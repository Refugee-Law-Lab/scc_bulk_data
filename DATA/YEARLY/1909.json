C.R. 1) was affirmed, Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting;\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the plaintiffs' action and petition and allowing the petition of the Canada Newspaper Syndicate.\nThe only question for decision on this appeal was whether or not the registration by the plaintiffs of the terms \"Bust\u00ebr Brown\" and \"Buster Brown and Tige\" as trade marks, the object being to use them as titles to a comic section of their newspaper entitled them to the exclusive use of such terms for that purpose and enabled them to prevent the respondents from issuing a comic section with the same titles. The Exchequer Court judge did not decide the question whether or not these terms could be registered, but dismissed the action on the ground that as the plaintiffs had issued these sections so entitled for several years without seeking for protection, they had become public property which any person could use. He also granted the petition of the Canada Newspaper Syndicate to have the said terms expunged from the registry of trade marks and refused that of the plaintiffs who asked to have also expunged the same or similar terms registered by the syndicate.\nR.

Guggenheim[8], in support of his contention that the appellant could not acquire property; in such a term as \"Buster Brown.\"\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant, in business in New York, published for some years an illustrated comic section of a newspaper of which the feature is the continued story of \"Buster Brown,\" or \"Buster Brown and Tige.\"\nThe originator of the idea would seem to have been some other publisher who had dropped the continuation of his publication before it was taken up in this copied and slightly modified form.\nThe appellant used weekly issues for its own newspapers periodically as the story developed and sold thousands of copies to other newspaper publishers to issue as sections of their newspapers.\nIn these latter cases the heading would be made to conform to the purposes of the respective publishers of these other newspapers by making the section wear the name and appear as part of such other newspaper.\nThe respondent was one of these other publishers for a time, but, being able to get some one else to continue the story, with inventions or imaginary ideas or want of ideas, independently in any case of what the appellant continued to publish, began and continued for some time the publication, as a section of its newspaper, of these new and independent relations of \"Buster Brown's\" doings and his name and supposed figure.\nThe appellant's managers conceived the happy thought of making trade marks of the name \"Buster Brown\" and \"Buster Brown and Tige,\" and registering them under the provisions of \"The Trade Mark and Design Act,\" and, having managed to get them registered, proceeded to the Exchequer Court to have justice done in the premises.\nThey failed. I will not say justice failed, but the suit failed.\nHaving got leave, because of the important issues raised, it appealed here.\nThe case of trade marks and their recognition by law as property preceded legislation requiring or facilitating their registration.\nOur Canadian legislation in that regard preceded that in England by some fifteen years.\nAn Act, 23 Vict. ch. 27, of the old Province of Canada, which related to trade marks, was punitive in its character, and, next year, repealed by 24 Vict. ch. 21, of the same province, which provided for registration of trade marks as therein defined.\nThat definition has been in substance, and almost in the same words, adhered to throughout the many changes that have taken place, first, in extending the law to the whole Dominion, and, next, in modifying and extending the means for registration and the effect thereof, as well as providing for the registration and protection of industrial designs.\nThe decision of this appeal must turn upon the meaning of the definition given by section 5 of the Act, as it now stands in chapter 71, section 5, of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1906), which is as follows:\u2014\n5. All marks, names, labels, brands, packages or other business devices, which are adopted for use by any person in his trade, business, occupation or calling, for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, product or article of any description manufactured, produced, compounded, packed or offered for sale by him, applied in any manner whatever either to such manufacture, product or article, or to any package, parcel, case, box, or other vessel or receptacle of any description whatsoever containing the same, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be considered and known as trade marks.\nI do not think the alleged trade marks in question here fall within this definition of what may be registered as trade marks. It does not appear to me either that either of them is or ever was intended as a device to distinguish anything \"manufactured, produced, compounded, packed or offered for sale\" as described in this section. The plain, ordinary meaning of the words does not warrant putting such an interpretation on them.\nThe word \"produced\" is the only one in the definition that can at all be said to be capable of such extended meaning as is sought to be placed upon the section and that would be a straining of meaning of the word when we have regard to the setting in which Ave find it.\nMoreover, when we look at the general scope and purpose of the Act, it seems quite impossible to suppose it was ever intended to protect property in a distinguishing mark such as this when applied to the kind of goods appellant vends when, as it claims, labelled therewith.\nThe production which the appellant sells is not a kind of paper, or of paper coloured in any particular way or covered with a peculiar kind of ink or set forms or figures. It is the nonsense that is produced by the brain of the man writing for the diversion of the idle that in truth is sold.\nIt may be that kind of brain product that copy- right might amongst other things be extended to or that copyright might cover.\nI am not, however, going to wander into the field of whether or not a trade mark can exist in such a name or names, or in the name of or title given any literary production of any kind, for I am quite sure it never was intended this section should apply to such a thing.\nIf it did, all that would be needed for a publisher of copyrighted, works, when the copyright was about to expire, in order practically to add twenty-five years to the term of copyright, would be to register the title and defy any one to use it, though then at liberty to sell the thing itself without a title.\nI think the distinction between copyright and trade mark registration was intended by the legislature to be, and that it must be, observed in applying this Act.\nOur statutes and the English Acts are so different that, except for the fundamental purpose of determining whether any device used may, in its manner of use, be, or not be a subject of such property as exists in law in a trade mark, the English cases are not very helpful.\nTo appreciate \"the essentials necessary to constitute a trade mark,\" required by sub-section (e) of section 11 of our Act, many of these cases may be valuable:\nBut, whilst these essentials are necessary conditions to registration, I do not agree that the converse is true and that the Act extends to everything that might by any semblance seem to have such qualities as a trade mark.\nWhen the cases in England turn as this does on the meaning of the Act providing for registration, the result may mislead unless this difference be observed.\nI observe in the case of Carey v. Goss[9] the title to the name of a periodical was registered as a trade mark and the question tried out as to the infringement of registration and treated as if quite regular and, indeed, necessary to maintain the action.\nNo question seems to have been raised in regard to the point of whether or not it was properly registered.\nHere, however, the right is expressly challenged on the ground I proceed upon.\nI see also that the right to the exclusive use of the name of a periodical was tried in the case of Rose v. McLean Publishing Co.[10], without any reference to the Act in question or of registration. Possibly there had been registration and that fact was known to the parties.\nBut, seeing that the Act requires in cases where its protection can be invoked that there must be registration, and so much arguable material in that connection passed unnoticed, I would have expected to find reference to the matter unless all concerned had taken the view that I have, and that such a right of property as title to a publication did not fall within the Act.\nThe rights of the parties were decided on other grounds entirely.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Idington. Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014In this case the facts have been fully stated in the judgment of the learned trial judge and it will be unnecessary to restate them.\nTwo questions arise; 1st. Can a combination of words be lawfully made a trade mark as applied to a series of comic sections of newspapers periodically published? 2ndly. Assuming that question to be answered in the affirmative, could the particular combination of words which the appellants have registered as their trade mark lawfully be registered as such? The first of these questions depends upon the construction of section 5 of the \"Trade Mark and Designs Act,\" and with great respect to those who take, a contrary view I really can have no doubt that such a part of a newspaper is a \"product\" \"produced\" by the publisher of the newspaper and therefore within the very words of the section. There is nothing in the statute or in the subject matter with which the statute deals seeming to require us to give to these words any signification less narrow than they import in their ordinary use; and we should not, of course, be justified in restricting their operation on any vague surmise respecting the policy of the Act. The argument addressed to us indeed was to the effect that the title of a periodical publication is in its nature incapable of becoming the subject of a trade mark right properly so called. That is a contention which I think is opposed to a stream of judicial opinion commencing at least as early as the year 1858 and embracing the views of judges of great experience in the subject and of very weighty authority. In Clement v. Maddick[11], Vice-Chancellor Stuart gave relief in an application to restrain the infringement of a trade mark alleged to exist in respect of the title of a newspaper known as \"Bell's Life in London.\" The applicant's right was in that: case treated as a right resting on trade mark pure and simple.\nThis is an application in support of the right to property. * * * Lord Cottenham in the case of Millington v. Fox[12] has declared that where a trade mark has been innocently and even unconsciously made use of to the injury of another the owner of the trade mark is entitled to the protection of this court.\nThese are the words with which the Vice-Chancellor opens his judgment at page 100. In Dicks v. Yates[13], at pages 663, 664, Sir George Jessel M.R, repeatedly during the course of the argument intimated the view that the title of such a publication might become a trade mark and in his judgment there is this passage:\nThe adoption of the words as the title of a novel is not new. But even that would not make invention. It might make a trade mark, and entitle the owner of the novel to say: \"You cannot sell another novel under that exact title, without any difference, so that the public will believe they are buying my novel when they are actually buying yours.\" That is trade mark, and that is intelligible. That would apply to newspapers and to serials in general.\nIn The Licensed Victuallers Newspaper Co. v. Bingham[14] Bowen L.J. puts the name of the newspaper touching its capacity to be made the subject of property as trade mark in the same category as a word stamped upon a stick of licorice. I do not think it is the most satisfactory way of dealing with the opinions cited to say simply, of Sir George Jessel for instance, that while he used the words attributed to him he meant to say something else. Neither do I think we ought to exert ourselves to discover some ground for restricting the ordinary meaning of the words used by the legislature in order to exclude from the operation of the Act that which at common law seems very clearly, I think, to have been the subject of property as trade mark. The American decisions are almost if not quite uniformly to the same effect.\nIt is argued, however, that the object to which the appellants seek to apply the combination of words in question, being only a part (sometimes indeed not even an integral or separate part, but a mere section of a page) of the newspaper itself, is for that reason outside the provisions of section 5. A comic section of a newspaper may, it seems, be printed on one or more sheets separated or joined together or only upon part of a sheet; but I really do not see that this circumstance makes it any the less a product or a thing produced by the publisher. If it could be contended that the term \"comic section of newspaper\" is not descriptive of anything having characteristic marks by which it can be distinguished from other parts of the newspaper, then the force of this objection would be apparent. But I do not think there is any ground for supposing that there can be any real difficulty in applying the description with sufficient certainty for all practical purposes.\nIt is a satisfactory confirmation of one's view to find that this very combination of words applied to this very thing has been held by an able and experienced American judge, Lacombe J., to be the subject matter of trade mark; New York Herald Co. v. Starr Co.[15]; his judgment being affirmed on appeal by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\nTouching the second question, the principal points made by the respondents are: (1). That since the appellants were, before registering the combination of words in question as trade marks, selling their newspaper, including the comic sections to which these words were applied, in Canada without the protection of copyright, and inasmuch as in the absence of any such protection it would be open to anybody to reprint the newspaper or the comic section including its title, the public thereby acquired the right to the use of the title itself on the principle accessorium sequitur principale; and\n(2). That the terms \"Buster Brown\" and \"Buster Brown and Tige\" represent imaginary beings that have become a part of the common stock of ideas of English-speaking North America and that the terms have passed into the language as representing these beings as \"Don Quixote\" and \"Pickwick\" represent imaginary personages; the appellants having no exclusive right to describe these beings and their adventures can have no exclusive right to the names. The first of these points is that upon which the learned trial judge has proceeded; while I should differ upon any question of the kind raised by this appeal, with great hesitation, from the view of the learned trial judge, there seems to me to be some fallacy in the argument that assuming the public may reproduce the whole of one of the respondents' comic sections including its title without infringing any legal right, it follows from this that it may produce its own comic section under the distinctive title used by the respondents to designate theirs.\nI have, moreover, already given my reasons for thinking that the title of a periodical publication may validly be made the subject of trade mark rights. The considerations indicated apply as well to a copyrighted publication as to a publication not protected by copyright; and in at least one of the cases mentioned there seems to be no ground for supposing that any such protection existed. It is manifestly not consistent with this view to hold that the failure to obtain such protection in respect of the numbers of a periodical publication would disentitle the proprietor of a publication to assert a right of property in its title as founded on trade mark.\nIn the view I take of the statute I think, too, that the second of these objections cannot be allowed to prevail. The registration of a trade mark is something more than prim\u00e0 facie evidence that the proprietor has a title to the exclusive use of it. Section 13, subsection 2, reads as follows:\nThereafter (that is to say after the registration of the trade mark) such proprietor shall have the exclusive right to use the trade mark to designate articles manufactured or sold by him.\nThe effect of the statute, I think, is that if the trade mark, so called, falls within the definition given by section 5 and the conditions of section 13 have been complied with, the registration alone confers upon the proprietor the exclusive right to the use of it. The right of action given by section 19 seems to be a right vested in any proprietor of a registered trade mark and a right which may be asserted against anybody who uses any such trade mark without the consent of the proprietor.\nSection 11 of the statute provides for a number of cases in which the minister may refuse to register a trade mark; and sub-section (a) of that section would appear to be broad enough to embrace the very objections now under consideration. That sub-section gives the minister power to refuse to register if he is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of such trade mark. That does not mean, I think, that the minister may refuse registration on the ground that the thing which the applicant proposes to register as his trade mark is something in which he has not acquired a property as a trade mark at common law; but that the minister may refuse registration if it is a case in his opinion in which the applicant has not made out a fair title to have conferred upon him the legal right to the exclusive use of the thing by the registration of it as a trade mark under the Act.\nAssuming, however, that the question which the minister is to consider is whether such a legal right is already vested in the applicant at the time of the application, still the statute appears to have confided to him, subject to any reference under section 12 of the Act, the determination of this question; and where a statute has committed to a specified authority the determination of a particular class of questions it would be repugnant to establish principles to hold that the decision of the statutory authority acting within the scope of its duty is, in the absence of fraud or manifest error of law, open to review in a collateral proceeding. No such case is made here. The objection under discussion involves a question of fact which, supposing the respondents to be right in their legal contention, we must assume the minister has decided against them. \"The Exchequer Court Act\" itself, section 23, seems to provide means by which in a proper case steps may be taken to cancel the registration of a trade mark. Whether in this case grounds exist for such cancellation does not arise on this appeal.\nThese considerations seem sufficient also to dispose of the contention that the respondents in using the words in question merely as a descriptive heading of a part of a newspaper containing an account of the adventures of the imaginary beings denoted by the words, have done nothing amounting to an infringement of the appellants' rights. If the appellants have a valid trade mark in these words as applied to comic sections of newspapers then the use of the words as so applied would seem to be actionable at the suit of the appellants under the plain reading of section 19.\nA large part of the argument for the respondents at Bar proceeded upon the principles assumed to have been established at common law concerning what are or are not essential characteristics of a trade mark. In reaching the conclusions above indicated, I have proceeded entirely on a construction of the statute; it appears to me that in construing such a statute there is some danger of being misled if one allow one's mind to be too freely influenced by what the common law may have determined to be the essential characteristics of a trade mark.\nRe Canadian Newspaper Syndicate.\nI think the petitioners have no status to attack the appellants' trade mark. At the time of registration it is not alleged that the petitioners were using the combination of words registered by the appellants. I cannot see on the facts that they have any interest in the question of the validity of the registration other than that of the members of the public generally unless such an interest is acquired by the simple act of attempting to use it themselves. I do not think they can thus acquire such an interest. If on behalf of the whole public the trade mark is to be attacked there is a well understood procedure for that.

The alleged breach charged against the appellants (defendants) was that they failed to obtain freight rates for the vessels at Montreal rates and to provide freight for 60,000 cubic feet of unfilled space in the vessels. The items which made up the damages claimed were as follows:\nSS. \"Austriana.\"\u2014Difference between Quebec and Montreal rates\n$ 635 02\nSS. \"Manchester Engineer.\"Difference between Quebec and Montreal rate\n1,073 16\nSS. \"Manchester Engineer.\" \u2014 60,000 cubic feet of unfilled space\n2,284 00\n$3,992 18 The defence denied the contract as alleged; set up that the defendants had never been placed in default to settle and determine the freight rates obtainable in Montreal; that they were prevented from fulfilling their contract by a fortuitous event, the destruction of a bridge on their line of railway; that they could not be held responsible for the empty space without having been first put in default to fill the same, which had not been done, and that there was misjoinder, the plaintiffs' causes of action not being susceptible of being united. In the Superior Court, the action was maintained as to the items for differences in freight rates only, but, on appeal, the full amount of the plaintiffs' claim was allowed by the judgment now appealed from.\nAlex.

The appellants are responsible for the difference between the Quebec and Montreal freight rates, but only to the extent of forty per cent, of the cargo of the ship, in accordance with the letter of the 3rd of February, 1903. For this reason, I would deduct $533.25 from the amount of the judgment. We do not grant costs as the appeal fails on the substantial points.

The facts of the salvage are stated by the local judge as follows:\nThere is nothing to especially distinguish this case from the ordinary cases of salvage towage services rendered to vessels in distress, until the \"Mystic\" and the \"Nanna\" arrived in the vicinity of the Sambro Ledges.\nOn Monday, February 4th, at about 7.30 in the morning the \"Mystic\" took the \"Nanna\" in tow off Seal Island near Cape Sable. Previous to that date the \"Nanna\" had been drifting about with her propeller shaft broken. That happened on the night of January 31st\nDuring the day before the \"Mystic\" came up a heavy westerly gale prevailed, which caused the \"Nanna\" to drift a long distance. She could not be steered, even with all her sails set, as way enough could not be made to enable her to answer her helm. Cargo was jettisoned in the hope that by lightening the vessel steerage way could be made but she would not obey her helm even then, nor could she be made to do so by any of the devices tried.\nOn Monday, 4th February, when picked up, she was about twenty miles off Seal Island. When the vessel was disabled signals of distress were put up.\nOn Sunday night there was a high sea, and as the captain of the \"Nanna\" says, her position on that night was not pleasant.\nThe vessel when picked up by the \"Mystic\" was, no doubt, not in a safe position, though she was in the vicinity of the usual route of vessels. After the \"Mystic\" made fast to the \"Nanna\" the towing proceeded without serious accident until Tuesday morning at about 7.45, when the line parted in a heavy wind, when the vessels were nearing Chebucto Head. At that time the captain of the \"Mystic\" appears to have been on his proper course to Halifax; but as he could not pick up a pilot, and as the weather was becoming bad, he decided to put to sea.\nIt was while he was bringing his ship slowly round, so as to avoid breaking the hawser, that the line parted, and the \"Nanna\" immediately commenced to drift towards the shoals at Morris Point. The captain of the \"Mystic\" at once proceeded to man\u0153uvre his vessel in an attempt to again make fast to the \"Nanna\"; and this he succeeded in doing in a most creditable manner, considering, the condition of the weather.\n****\nWhile he was thus endeavouring to get a line aboard the \"Nanna\" both vessels were drifting rapidly towards the dangerous reefs known as the Sambro Ledges. From the time when the line parted, until it was again put aboard the \"Nanna\" about half an hour elapsed, and three quarters of an hour passed more before the line was made fast aboard the \"Nanna.\"\nWhile they were thus drifting no soundings were taken. After again getting under way with the tow, and while steering a S. by E. course, the \"Mystic\" saw breakers ahead on the starboard bow, which were probably the Sisters; thereupon his helm was starboarded and he kept away from them, changing his course to north.\nHe then went slow, and was taking soundings. Not long after this the soundings shewing 15 fathoms, then again 15 again, and after that 17 fathoms, speed was increased, and breakers were seen a point or two on the port bow. These breakers were what is known as the Stapleton Rock breakers.\nThe captain of the \"Mystic\" signalled to the \"Nanna\" to anchor, and this was done by both vessels; the \"Nanna\" being in a position where she weathered the gale that blew all day Tuesday and on Tuesday night, without incurring any mishap whatever. The \"Mystic\" bumped several times on Stapleton Rock and incurred considerable damage. She made water in some of her compartments, but does not seem to have been rendered unseaworthy. After coming to anchor the weather continued to be very bad; a gale blew and the sea became extremely rough. Nevertheless, the vessels rode out the gale without further mishap until taken in charge by the tow boats from Halifax on Wednesday morning.\nJudgment was given against the owners of the \"Nanna\" and damages were assessed at $27,000 which included a sum for the injury sustained by the \"Mystic\" at Stapleton Rock, the local judge holding that such injury was caused by necessities of the service. The defendants appealed mainly against the allowance of damages under this head.\nMellish K.C. for the appellants.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the judgment of the trial judge should not be disturbed. The appeal involves only a question of fact and his finding is not so clearly wrong as to justify an appellate court in reversing, much less to simply reduce the amount awarded, All the points seem to have been fairly weighed by the trial judge. This court agrees with him that without the services of the \"Mystic\" the \"Nanna\" would probably have been a total loss. This admission is sufficient for me to accept the amount of the judgment which is fully and properly detailed, to my satisfaction at least. Twenty-five thousand dollars for salvage seems to be a large amount, but, when we consider that more than $15,000 go for repairs rendered necessary by the salvage services performed, I do not think it excessive. I am, finally, of opinion that $10,000, outside of these repairs, is not an unreasonable remuneration for saving a vessel of the value of $65,000, without propeller, at the mercy of a raging-gale, close to a dangerous coast, amidst a blinding snow storm and after great exertions and risks to the salvors whom the pilot and salvage tugs would not even venture to assist at first.\nUpon the whole, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs and, in reaching this conclusion, I keep within the well-settled jurisprudence of this country. I do not propose to review all the cases for they are too numerous. I will merely quote three or four, two of our own court, The \"Picton\"[1], in 1879, at page 653, and The \"Santanderino\" v. Vanvert[2], in 1893, and two of the highest courts in England.\nIn The \"Baku Standard\"[3], at page 551, Sir Ford North, speaking for the Privy Council, said:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that, considering the evidence, and that the compensation for damage is dealt with separately, full justice would have been done by an award of less than \u00a31,000 for salvage. But this is a question of amount only, and it is not the custom of this committee to vary the decision of a court below on a question of amount merely because they are of opinion that, if the case had come before them in the first instance, they might have awarded a smaller sum. It has been laid down in the \"DeBay\"[4], and other cases that they will only do so if the amount awarded appears to them to be grossly in excess of what is right; which is not the case here.\nIn another case, The \"Glengyle\"[5], at page 521, where a salvage of \u00a319,000 was awarded, Lord Herschell, speaking for the House of Lords, said:\nAt the best, in cases of this description, all that can be done is what may be called rough justice. It is impossible nicely and accurately to measure in relation to the risks run and the services rendered the sum which ought to be awarded by the court. My lords in the present case the amount is large, and it may be that it is larger than each of the members of this house, who have heard the appeal, would have given if it had been left to his individual judgment. I do not say that it is so; all I say is that, in my opinion, it is not so exorbitant or so manifestly excessive that we ought to interfere with the conclusion which has been arrived at.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014I also concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appeal is from a judgment of the local judge in Admiralty, at Halifax, in a case of salvage, and the only serious question is whether the sum awarded to the \"Mystic\" for the salvage of the \"Nanna\" is excessive.\nThe witnesses in the case were all examined in the presence of the learned judge, and I think his conclusions from the evidence were well founded, and it was for him to judge between conflicting statements.\nBoth vessels are of steel and propelled by steam, the \"Mystic,\" without cargo, valued at $219,000, and the \"Nanna,\" with cargo, at $65,437.\nThe \"Nanna,\" loaded with lumber, and on her way from Halifax to New York, became disabled, on the night of the 31st of January, 1907, by the breaking of her propeller.\nThis happened off the southwest coast of Nova Scotia, and she then drifted about helplessly, at the mercy of the wind, and tides, and currents, for three days and four nights, until picked up and taken in tow for Halifax, about 10.40 a.m., on the 4th of February, by the \"Mystic,\" which was on a voyage from Boston to Louisburg, in Cape Breton.\nAll went well for about two hundred miles, except for some delay caused by the parting and re-hitching of the tow-line, until about 5 a.m., on the 5th of February, when it began to snow so heavily that they could see nothing, the thermometer, at the same time, indicating a zero temperature.\nUnder these circumstances they soon began to take soundings, and, at 7.45, they heard the whistle at Chebucto Head, the entrance to Halifax Harbour, the same being supposed to be about a mile and a half distant.\nAnd here is where trouble and confusion began. In addition to the heavy snow and the zero temperature, a heavy gale sprung up from the E.N.E. and the tide was flowing in the same direction. About this time the tow line parted again, while making a change of course, and, for more than an hour, except for the man\u0153uvres necessary to get the hawser on board the tow and made fast, the ships could do nothing but drift.\nThe circumstances were such that to re-hitch the tow-line the ships had to get alongside; if a boat had been launched, it could not have lived. No pilots were out, although they were on pilot ground, and the evidence is that the pilots refrained from going out on account of the violence of the weather.\nIt was nine o'clock before the tow-line was made fast on the \"Nanna,\" and a further quarter of an hour. or twenty minutes, passed before movement could be made.\nAt this time the captain could not tell in what direction they had drifted, or where they were, and for another hour afterwards he endeavoured to make his way out to sea, but, seeing breakers whichever way he turned, he failed to get out, and, at last, determined to anchor.\nThis both ships did, but, before the \"Mystic\" was able to do so, she struck a shoal, and received injuries, repairs of which amounted to $13,850.\nThe \"Nanna\" suffered no injury, and both ships rode out the gale at anchor all that day and the following night. The \"Nanna\" was towed into harbour next morning by tugs, and the \"Mystic\" went in with her own steam; and the learned judge is of opinion that, while the \"Mystic\" was quite capable of taking the \"Nanna\" in, it was more prudent to accept the offer of the tugs.\nThe result was that, by the exertions of the \"Mystic,\" the \"Nanna,\" valued at $65,437, was rescued from a position of great danger on a rocky coast in which she had been for three days and nights, and was brought into port without appreciable damage, while the \"Mystic,\" while so employed, suffered very serious injury and incurred very serious risk of total destruction.\nNow, I do not understand that, in order to earn substantial reward, the master of a salving ship must be found to have done everything in the best possible manner. All men have not equal skill and capacity in difficult circumstances. No want of attention or effort is charged against the master of the \"Mystic.\" He was at his post of duty during the whole period of danger, using his best skill and judgment in the difficult situation and circumstances in which he was placed, and I do not think that, because he did not succeed in finding a way out to sea from among the shoals and breakers into which he had drifted, after the cable had parted, his owners are to be deprived of the just reward which the \"Nanna\" ought to pay for complete rescue from very great peril.\nThe learned judge has awarded a sum of $27,000 altogether, or about forty per cent. of the saved ship's value. Of this sum, $25,000 is awarded to the \"Mystic,\" and its officers, and, after deducting the expense of repairs, and other damages, the sum of $8,022 is all that goes to the owners of the \"Mystic\" as compensation for the services rendered by their ship and crew, and for the loss of forty five days' use of their ship and wages of crew while undergoing repairs.\nI think that is a very fair sum to charge against the \"Nanna\" for her complete rescue, from a position of very great danger, and the learned trial judge, having thought that sum a proper one to allow, I do not think we ought to reduce it, In The \"Chetah\"[6], it was declared that the first and most important question in such cases is the danger of the vessel salved, and that the most important element in a claim for high salvage is the imminent danger of destruction of the salved vessel. That there was such imminent danger in this case from first to last cannot be denied.\nIt is evident that it is only in very plain cases of excess that an appellate court interferes with the salvage allowed by the trial judge, for, in the \"Chetah\" Case6, in 1868, it is stated that was the first case in which the sum awarded was reduced.\nIn The \"City of Chester\"[7], Lindley L.J. enumerates the matters proper to be considered in salvage cases, and, at page 203, says:\nAnother circumstance to be considered is the importance of so remunerating salvors as to make it worth their while to succour ships in distress. This consideration renders it necessary to be liberal, not only to captains and crews who perform the salvage services, but also to owners of vessels engaged in those services where such vessels have been injured or exposed to danger. The salving vessel is often herself exposed to imminent peril; the risk of loss or damage to her is often very great; and the damage actually done to her, and the loss actually sustained by her owner from delay in her voyage and otherwise, may be, and often is, very considerable. Hence, one element in determining the amount to be awarded for salvage services is the value of the salving ship and cargo which have been exposed to risk; and the nature and extent of the risk are other elements for consideration. Where the salving vessel is, as in the present case, a large and valuable steamer, exposed to great risk, the claims of her owner deserve very favourable attention.\nIn the present case the value of the \"Mystic\" was more than three times that of the \"Nanna,\" and, having regard to the risk to which she was exposed, and the damage sustained, I think the award not excessive, and that a substantial value, over sixty per cent., is not an unfair Surplus left to the salved vessel. Duff J.\u2014This is an appeal from a salvage award; and the question principally argued\u2014which is the question of substance to be decided\u2014is whether the learned trial judge erred, in finding that certain injuries suffered by the \"Mystic\" (the salving ship), were caused by the necessities of the service, and so clearly erred as to justify a reversal of that finding; the damages attributable directly to these injuries as well as damages for the delay and loss of earnings consequent upon them having been reckoned as elements in the computation of the amount awarded ($25,000).\nThe appellant, \"Nanna\" (the salved ship), is a Norwegian steel ship of 1,125 tons gross tonnage; the SS. \"Mystic,\" which is owned by the respondent company, is a steel vessel of 2,342 tons.\nThe \"Nanna\" had her propeller shaft broken on the 31st January, 1907, in a voyage from Halifax to New York\u2014laden with deals. She was taken in tow, on Monday, the 4th February, at 10.40 o'clock a.m., by the \"Mystic,\" then bound for Louisburg. When picked up the \"Nanna\" was about 20 miles S.W. of Seal Island, which lies fifteen or twenty miles off the extreme southwest coast of Nova Scotia. Nothing material to the question at issue happened until the following morning\u2014Tuesday, 5th February \u2014when the whistle at Chebucto Head, which marks the outer entrance to Halifax Harbour, was heard by the \"Mystic.\" According to the bearings and soundings then taken, Chebucto Head would appear to have been about a mile and a half away.\nThe account of what followed will be more readily comprehended by referring to the accompanying sketch, which shews approximately the relative situations of the different localities that it will be necessary to mention as we proceed.\nAbout the time Chebucto whistle was heard, the \"Mystic\" sighted Bell Eock buoy close at hand, and, as the wind from the E.N.E. was rising and snow was falling, she decided to put to sea in order to avoid risk of stranding. About this time the tow line broke and the \"Nanna\" was allowed to drift until a line was again passed to her. Shortly after this, breakers, which proved to be on Morris Point, were seen, and a course was then set S.E. by E. for the open sea. Breakers were again seen on the starboard bow, on Ede Rock or the Sisters, at 9.15. The \"Mystic\" then turned around with her tow under a starboard helm and, at 10.18 struck the shoal at Stapleton Rock, receiving the injuries referred to. Both ships then came to anchor at that place and safely rode out the gale which afterwards came on, the \"Nanna\" receiving hardly any damage. On the following morning, the weather having moderated, tugs came to their assistance and towed the \"Nanna\" to Halifax\u2014the \"Mystic\" entering the harbour under her own steam.\nThere is, on the evidence, some conflict respecting the course steered by the \"Mystic\" after clearing the breakers seen at 9.15. The master of the \"Nanna'; says the course was north-west. Owen, the first officer of the \"Mystic,\" and Schlieman, the third officer, say that the course was north and that this was maintained until Stapleton Rock was reached. The captain of the \"Mystic\" when first called, on both cross-examination and re-examination, agreed with this; being re-called, in rebuttal, he said that the course first taken was north, but that, after the tow had cleared the breakers this course was changed to a course north-east by north. The learned trial judge seems to have accepted the statement given by the first and third officers of the \"Mystic\" and by the captain when first called, and I think the weight of evidence is in favour of this view.\nThe contention on behalf of the appellant is that, in. steering this course and maintaining it as he did for nearly an hour, the captain of the \"Mystic\" was guilty of a want of ordinary care or skill and that to, his failure in this regard the injuries suffered by that ship are attributable. It is not suggested that the captain of the \"Mystic\" committed a fault in turning to the north when he first saw the breakers referred to; this course was prudent to take in order to make sure that the \"Nanna\" could clear the dangerous place. But the captain admits that the \"Nanna\" was clear in ten minutes from the time the breakers were seen; and the question is\u2014whether or not the \"Mystic's\" course from that time can be justified.\nThe onus is, at the outset, on the appellant, and was so in the court below; \"Baku Standard\"[8]; but I think that when the admitted facts are considered, they are, in themselves, of such cogency as to require an explanation of the conduct of the captain of the \"Mystic.\" His own statement is that, having sighted a spar buoy at Morris Point, he believed it to be the Bell Bock buoy; and that, when he saw breakers the second time, he was at a loss to know where he was; and that the only thing he could do was to \"take soundings and keep in good water.\" I do not think this can be accepted as a satisfactory explanation. He knew he was on the southeast coast of Nova Scotia, near the outer entrance to Halifax Harbour, that an hour and a half before he had been within a short distance, a mile and a half, he says, of Chebucto Head; the wind was east northeast; for nearly an hour he had been drifting; he could hardly suppose he had been drifting in an easterly direction, and, on any conceivable assumption as to his position, it must have been plain that north of him and west of him was the shore and that a northerly course maintained for even a short time must take him into exactly the kind of danger he was trying to avoid.\nThe skilled seamen who were called as experts all say that in the circumstances his only prudent course after clearing the breakers was to proceed to sea, that is to say, on an easterly course. I cannot find in the evidence given on behalf of the respondents anything that appears to amount to a good reason why this course, seemingly so obvious, should have been looked upon as involving any special risk; or any plausible excuse for not taking it. I do not think it is sufficient or, indeed, any explanation to say the \"Mystic\" was \"always keeping in good water\"; to the eastward there was not only good water, but sea-room as well. The standard which ought to be applied to the conduct of navigators engaged in a salvage operation is stated in the following passage quoted from the judgment of Dr. Lushington, in The \"Magdalen\"[9] at page 142:\nIf it be such an error that men of skill and ability would say, from what had been done in attempting to render the salvage service, that, if they had had to undertake the operation, they would have considered it so doubtful as to the method of proceeding that either of two methods of proceeding might have been adopted, and that they would have tried one way, and that, if that had been unsuccessful, they would have adopted another, the court would not look upon that error in a severe light. But if there were measures pursued which were so grossly unskilful as to make it evident that ordinary skill and ability were wanting, that would be taken into consideration by the court.\nI think the captain of the \"Mystic\" fell below this standard; and that the appellants have succeeded in making out that the injuries in question were due, not to the necessities of the service, but to the default of the \"Mystic.\"\nI am not overlooking the counsel that upon a doubtful question of navigation the court should, in trying a claim for salvage, incline to the lenient view; nor am I leaving out of mind the danger that, in passing judgment after the event, one may not make full allowance for all the difficulties and embarrassments of a navigator in an emergency at sea. Giving her the full benefit of these considerations, I cannot escape the view that the course of the \"Mystic\" is not to be explained upon any hypothesis consistent with reasonably competent seamanship.\nThe learned trial judge has, as I have said, found the injuries suffered by the \"Mystic\" were due to the necessities of the service; and this finding was strongly pressed upon us as decisive. The particular question I have discussed is not touched upon by the learned trial judge; and it is, after all, a simple question of fact which, as with any other question of fact not involving the credit attributable to particular witnesses, we must examine for ourselves; and, if satisfied that the court below is wrong, we are bound to give effect to our own view. It being a question of seamanship, one is disposed once again to repeat what has been said so often\u2014it is unfortunate that, while exercising the functions of a court of appeal in respect of such questions, we have not (unlike other courts the world over exercising the like functions), the benefit of skilled advice.\nThe respondents are, however, entitled to a substantial reward for their exertions. I do not accept Mr. Mellish's contention that the \"Nanna\"- was left by the \"Mystic\" in a position more dangerous than that from which she was taken. The learned trial judge found that the \"Mystic,\" notwithstanding her injuries, was still able and ready to tow the \"Nanna\" into Halifax on the morning of the sixth. The acceptance of the assistance of .the tugs with the consent of all parties is not sufficient, I think, in these circumstances, to disentitle the \"Mystic\" to be rewarded as for a successful and completed service, though the sums allotted to the tugs must he taken into consideration in determining the amount which should be paid to her.\nThe learned judge has found that the operation of getting a line aboard the \"Nanna\" after the parting of the hawser, through no fault of the \"Mystic,\" was a difficult operation, was performed very creditably, and saved the \"Nanna\" from the probability of a total loss. I do not see any reason for disagreeing with this. On the whole, I think the award should be reduced to $12,500. The master's share should abate proportionately; but there should be no abatement of the sums allotted to the other officers and members of the crew.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

His premises are drained by a sewer running along Clarence Street from a point near Sussex Street, in an easterly direction, to King Street, or King Edward Avenue, a distance of four city blocks, when it connects with one of the main sewers of the city. The Clarence Street sewer, as originally constructed, was for the two blocks nearer to King Street only. This sewer was constructed in or about the year 1885, and was in two sections, the one being of pipe 18 inches in diameter, and the other of pipe 15 inches in diameter. This sewer was of sufficient size to comply with the standard recognized by engineers at that date, when street sewers were not called upon to bear the heavier burdens placed upon them by the paving of street, the concreting of sidewalks, and other improvements now in vogue.\nIn or about the year 1891 a further sewer was constructed along Clarence Street, from a point near Sussex Street, and thence easterly for about two blocks, to a connection with the sewer already described. This was a 12-inch pipe, and it naturally brought down a large body of water to the lower sewer.\nIn the following years, up to and including 1903, a small part of Clarence Street, next Sussex Street, was paved with asphalt, and the old wooden sidewalks were replaced by concrete or granolithic sidewalks. A number of additional gullies were also constructed to conduct the surface water to the sewers in question. The result was that the surface waters were collected together and carried to the sewers in greater quantity and with greater rapidity, so that the sewer opposite the property of the appellant was required to accommodate a somewhat greater quantity of water and sewage material than had been contemplated by the original engineering plan. During the same period the corporation passed a by-law compelling, for the first time, all house drains to be connected with the street sewers, as well as all down spouts con- veying water from the roofs of the houses. Of these latter it was proved there were six in all, on Clarence Street, connected with the drain.\nThe trial judge found, that while that portion of the sewer opposite the premises of the appellant was, probably, sufficient for the territory intended to be served originally, the subsequent extension of it to Sussex Street, and the addition of many subsidiary drains leading into it, had completely overtaxed its capacity, so that when there was a heavy rainfall the contents of the sewer were backed up into adjoining cellars. He also found that, according to the weight of expert opinion, the capacity of the sewer was not more than two-thirds of what it should have been to accommodate the increased burden imposed by the acts of the respondents.\nOn the night of the 30th of June, or the morning of the 1st of July, 1903, the basement of the appellant\u2019s premises was flooded by backing up of sewage, and quantities of goods which he kept there were destroyed. There was also some slight flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s cellar on the 1st of August, and the 2nd of September, 1904, but the chief contest centered in the flooding of the 30th of June, 1903, when the greater part of the damage claimed was caused. The trial judge found that these floodings were the result of negligence of the respondent in so increasing the facilities for running-water and sewage into the sewer in question as to cause the backing up, which resulted in the damage to the appellant, and that while the rainfalls on the occasions in question were heavy, they were not so heavy or extraordinary as not to have been reasonably anticipated, and with ordinary prudence provided for by the respondent. The Court of Appeal reversed these findings and dismissed the appellant\u2019s action.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nShepley K.C. and McVeity for the respondent.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014Owing to the great importance of the questions raised in this case as to the duty resting upon civic authorities in the provision made by them for the drainage of cities, and to the difference of opinion which has existed amongst the learned judges before whom the case has been argued in their appreciation of the evidence as to the facts proved, I have read all of the evidence most carefully and given the case much thought and consideration.\nThe result is to convince me that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe action was brought by Faulkner, a storekeeper, whose shop fronted on the south side of Clarence Street in the City of Ottawa.\nClarence Street runs east and west and connects Sussex Street with King Edward Avenue.\nOne of the main sewers of the city runs along the avenue and the Clarence Street sewer discharged into this main sewer.\nClarence Street sewer does not connect with Sussex Street sewer, and is what was called a lesser or subsidiary sewer for the drainage of Clarence Street alone. There are 104 buildings on the street, but only nine down spouts from the houses, and of these six are directly or indirectly connected with the sewer. The roofs of most of the buildings face half towards the street, and half away from the street. In the opinion of the city engineer this was a very important factor resulting in only about fifty per cent. of the water falling on the houses reaching the sewer because the southerly roofs throw the water southerly, towards Murray Street, the general formation of the ground sloping towards that street, and the water naturally ran that way. There is a water shed there.\nThe Clarence Street drain was built in three parts and of three different sized pipes. The pipe next to King Edward Avenue and which discharged into the main drain there, was 18 inches in diameter. Next to that the pipe was 15 inches, and beyond that for a length of 700 feet was 12 inches. The total length of the drain was 2,200 feet. Faulkner\u2019s shop was opposite the 12\u2011inch drain, about three or four hundred feet from Sussex Street.\nThe 18-inch and 15-inch drain was constructed in 1883 or 1885 and the 12-inch continuation in the year 1891. Some ten years afterwards (in the year 1901) 375 feet of Clarence Street next to Sussex Street by about 47 feet in width were paved with asphalt and granolithic sidewalks substituted for the old wooden ones.\nThere were complaints by Faulkner of three flooding, on the evening of 30th June, 1903, August 1st, 1904, and September 2nd, 1902. The two latter floodings caused comparatively little, if any, damage, and the substantial contest centered in that of 30th June, 1903, for which damages to the amount of $1,622 were claimed.\nThe contention on the part of the city was two- fold; first that the Clarence Street drain was a local improvement constructed under the statute at the expense of the property owners whose lands bounded on Clarence Street, and that the city after complaint had been made to them of the flooding of certain cellars during an extraordinarily heavy rain storm had submitted to the ratepayers a proposition to take up the existing drain and relay it either with larger pipe or steeper grade (which the grade of the main sewer permitted) and that the ratepayers had voted the proposition down and refused to allow it to be carried out. It was submitted that under these circumstances the city was powerless to make the contemplated change at the expense of the general taxpayer, and that the residents or owners of land fronting on the street could not hold the city liable for negligence if by their own act they prohibited the change suggested.\nThe second ground of defence was that it was good engineering in the northern zone according to the considered opinions of engineers generally to construct drainage providing for a downfall of 1\u00bd inches of rain per hour, and that this was the standard adopted by Ottawa and all the cities of Canada and the northern States, excluding Pennsylvania from that category; that while this Clarence Street drain was originally designed only to carry one inch it was mathematically capable of carrying off without any head 1\u00bc inches, and with a head of 18 inches of carrying off 1\u00bd inches without damage to any one, and as a fact demonstrated by numerous actual experiments carried on by Mr. Ker, the city engineer, and his assistant, Mr. Parsons, did so safely and without damage to any one.\nThe learned trial judge, as I read his reasons and interpret them, was of the opinion that a rainfall at the rate of three inches per hour lasting continuously for 9 minutes, such as that which occurred on the evening when the damages were caused, was such a storm as \u201cought reasonably to have been anticipated and with ordinary prudence provided for by defendants.\u201d If he was right in that conclusion of course there was no defence to this action because Mr. Ker himself admitted that the sewage system of Ottawa, like other Canadian towns, was only designed to provide against a rainfall of 1\u00bd inches, and that neither the general system nor the Clarence Street drain would carry off rain falling for nine minutes at the rate of three inches per hour, a downpour which he admitted would inevitably cause flooding all over the city.\nThe evidence of Mr. Found, the meteorological observer and keeper of the rainfalls at Ottawa, places it beyond doubt from the records shewn by his automatic machine, which, he stated, from its very construction and nature must be accurate, that while the rainfall was very heavy from 5 to 7.30 on the evening of the 30th June, 1903, from two minutes after five till eleven minutes after five, that is for nine minutes, the rain fell at the rate of three inches per hour.\nI agree with the appeal court that no such duty rested upon the city as, if I interpret the judgment aright, was found by the trial judge, and that it was not negligence on its part to fail to provide against such an extraordinary and abnormal downpour as that which caused the damage.\nI think that when there is such a general concensus of opinion amongst engineers as is shewn by the evidence that in the northern zone of America 1\u00bd inches is the proper rate of fall to be provided against, a municipality discharges its duty when it makes efficient provision for such a rainfall.\nIn the view I take of the proper conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence I do not desire to be understood as expressing any opinion upon the very interesting and important question whether in case a city seeking to substitute an effective system of drainage, for a particular street or locality for a system which had become or was claimed to have become obsolete or ineffective from accident or other cause is prevented by the adverse vote of the ratepayers entitled to vote on the proposal submitted to them from carrying out its object under the local improvement clauses of the Municipal Act, it still remains liable to any of these ratepayers in case they sustain damages to their property from the inefficiency of the system they refuse to have so remedied.\nIt was contended that in such case the city is liable because the corporation have general powers outside of the local improvement clauses to which they in the cases suggested are bound to resort, and that it is no answer to say that a resort to these general powers would create a burden upon the civic ratepayers generally. The point was not argued fully by Mr. Shepley who, however, challenged the existence of these general powers in the circumstances mentioned, but who relied upon the facts as proved by Mr. Ker and his assistant with regard to the efficiency of the existing drain as sustaining the judgment of the appeal court.\nIf the questions of fact still remaining open and to be determined were to be determined on theory alone, that is, given such a street with a pipe of such a size or sizes and of such length and grade to drain the usual area supposed to be required to be drained apart from special physical conditions affecting the area, I should probably find great difficulty in deciding between the conflicting opinions of engineers equally qualified and having had equal opportunities of forming their opinions.\nBut that is not the case here. It is true that the eminent engineers called upon for the plaintiff express the opinion that the size of the pipe on Clarence Street, 12 inches, 15 inches, and 18 inches, all alike shew the drain to be inefficient for a downpour at the rate of 1\u00bd inches.\nBut they are very frank in admitting their conclusion to be a theoretical and general one which local conditions might materially modify, and they one and all admit that while they looked generally at the street they did not examine or study the local conditions with such care as would be necessary if they were themselves going to report upon or design a drain or system of drainage for that street. Mr. Lewis says that he \u201cdid not survey the ground, but looked at it simply,\u201d and he based his conclusion on the assumption that the 12-inch sewer would drain seven acres. Mr. Keefer said that he thought if the city\nprovided for an inch and a half rainfall an hour they would be doing well.\nHe said that\nhe had made a careful calculation, examined the tracings of the plans to ascertain the grade and then \u201ctook the drainage area.\u201d\nHe says\nof course there might be difference between engineers as to the exact limits of the drainage, area that would be tributary to this sewer but I took it as it is very often taken that is the centre of the block on each side of Clarence Street that would be about 266 feet, that would be the strip that would form the drainage area for this sewer, that would be the width of it; and the length of it I did not take down to King Street, say about 2,000 feet from Sussex down to within 250 feet of King Street which would be drained probably by this sewer.\nThis he said he made 12 acres\nthen for the discharge I took the different sections of the sewer by the usual formula.\nNow I have given in his own words the data on which Mr. Keefer based his conclusions and the methods (the usual formula) by which he worked them out; not with the object of in any way discrediting him, but of shewing that his opinion was a theoretical one only and should not be preferred to the judgment of equally competent engineers formed upon actual survey of the existing area and based upon actual facts. As Mr. Keefer himself says in his examination \u201call depends on the physical condition of the area.\u201d\nThe competence of Mr. Ker, an engineer of very great experience, especially in drainage and municipal engineering, was frankly admitted at the argument by Mr. Henderson. Both he and Mr. Parsons, C.E., his assistant, made actual tests of the capacity of the Clarence Street drain under the existing conditions alike with regard to the asphalt pavement at the west end of Clarence Street, and also to the downspouts from the houses and the closet connections. He explains in the first place that Faulkner\u2019s cellar floor was two and a half feet above or higher than the street sewer. This was a vitally important matter and so far as the evidence goes (if known to the engineers called by the plaintiff which does not appear) does not enter into their calculations at all. Both Ker and Parsons base their conclusions largely upon that fact. Again and again in his main examination, his cross-examination and in reply to questions put to him by the trial judge Mr. Ker explains (and Parsons is equally positive on the point) that when under a slight head the drain was fully equal to carry off 1\u00bd inches without damage to any one. He says (in answer to a question as to the capacity of the entire sewer from Sussex Street):\nAs I said before that it will carry an inch and a quarter almost inch and a half,\nthis, as he explains is \u201cwhen running free and without any head.\u201d Then he goes on,\nTake an inch and a half it will run under the lower section eighteen inches a foot and a half head; fifteen inches eleven inches head; the twelve inch pipe at Faulkner\u2019s would be running free. His Lordship.\u2014\u201cNo head?\u201d A.\u2014No, that is to make myself plain on this sewer there are man holes in the centre of the street and the water will back up in these man holes the same as if you have a water tap in a water works system a foot and a half until it gets sufficient pressure to clear itself it will run under a foot and a half head on the eighteen eleven inches on the fifteen and nothing on the twelve.\nAnd he again repeats in answer to a question from the Bench whether it will carry away a rainfall of an inch and a half an hour that it will do so and\naccording to the calculations and gauges and experience in a rainfall it has done that.\nThen after explaining about Faulkner\u2019s cellar being above the sewer 2\u00bd feet he states there is absolutely no danger of flooding under an inch and a half storm. He also explains to the judge \u201cthe length of the storm makes no difference, it may last an hour, two hours or three hours.\u201d Mr. Ker then explains that \u201cthe general formation of the ground slopes towards Murray Street,\u201d in other words, does not run up hill. Now these two important and controlling facts, namely, the fact that the Clarence Street drain was two feet six inches below the floor of Faulkner\u2019s cellar; and the fact that all rain water carried from the southerly slopes of the roofs of the houses fronting on the south side of Clarence Street ran not into the main drain, but away south to Murray Street were not known to or at any rate did not enter into the calculation of the engineers Lewis, Keefer and Mc\u2011Dougall. Ker\u2019s conclusions were not theoretical, but his and Parsons\u2019 were mathematical conclusions based as they say upon the size of the drain, and the actual existing local conditions agreed with the actual tests they made in the man holes of the drain during the storms. In other words, the practical tests absolutely proved the correctness of their mathematical calculations.\nMr. Ker frankly admits that when it rained at the rate of three inches, as it did on the date of the flooding which caused the damage, or if it rained at any greater rate than 1\u00bd inches the drains were not sufficient and flooding would occur. But unless we are to refuse to accept the sworn statements of himself and his assistant engineer as to the actual tests and observations made by them when the storms were on, there was not and there could not be any flooding of Faulkner\u2019s cellar unless one of two things occurred, an artificial obstruction getting into the drain as it once did before according to the evidence of the former city engineer, Edward Perrault, or an extraordinary downfall of rain exceeding that which in this northern zone the concensus of civil engineering opinion says it is reasonable and proper to provide against, 1\u00bd inches per hour. The tests if made as sworn to would seem to be conclusive as to the capacity of the drain.\nThe conclusion I have reached is that there is really no absolute conflict between the engineers; \u201ceverything depends upon the actual physical conditions,\u201d says Mr. Keefer. Neither he nor Mr. Lewis surveyed or examined closely the physical conditions of the area south or north of Clarence Street\u2014\u201cthey just looked at it.\u201d They did not know, therefore, that the land sloped from Clarence Street to Murray Street and that all the water flowing from the southerly roofs of the houses facing on the south side of Clarence Street, ran, not into the drain, but away towards Murray Street. Neither do they appear to have known that the drain was two and a half feet lower than the floor of Faulkner\u2019s cellar, thus allowing nearly that head of water before any flooding could take place. And yet these are the two facts which controlled very largely Mr. Ker\u2019s opinion as to the capacity of the drain, an opinion which repeated practical tests only served to confirm.\nHolding, therefore, as I do, that the existing drain conforms so far as its practical capacity is concerned to the standard exacted by the highest engineering skill with respect to this northern part of the continent and that it is capable under existing condition of receiving and carrying off without damage any rainfall up to and including one of an inch and a half per hour and does actually carry off such rainfall I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSince writing the foregoing opinion, concurred in by my brethren Girouard and Maclennan JJ., I have had the opportunity of reading the dissenting opinion of my brother Duff. To obviate possible misconceptions I desire to add a word to what I have already written with reference to the decision of the majority of this court on the crucial question of the capacity of the sewer to carry off the water and sewage discharged into it during a rainfall of 1\u00bd inches per hour. That decision is to the effect that the sewer in question did satisfy this requirement. My learned colleague is of the opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal had found with the trial judge to the contrary. I do not so understand their findings. The trial judge did, of course, but not the Court of Appeal. On the contrary, their findings and those of the majority of this court fully agree on the point stated, and it was because of such agreement and because we also agreed with them as to abnormal downpour of rain on the occasion when the plaintiff\u2019s goods were damaged that we dismissed the appeal.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant\u2019s cellar on three different occasions within about fourteen months was flooded with sewage that came into it from a sewer with which he was bound by the city by-laws as well as the needs of his premises to form a connection.\nMr. Justice Teetzel, the learned trial judge, found as fact that this was caused by the city after its construction of the sewer having so constructed the neighbouring streets by means of new cement sidewalks and asphalt pavement as to pour into this sewer a greater volume of water and filth than the sewer\u2019s limited capacity would serve to carry away. He therefore adjudged the city liable and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $1,700. From this judgment the city appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and by a majority that court reversed this judgment and dismissed the action. Hence this appeal, which I think should be allowed.\nThe action rests on the palpable negligence of the city.\nThe sewer in question was constructed under and by virtue of two separate applications of the local improvement sections of the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d\nIn the view adopted by the learned trial judge and in which I agree it is quite unnecessary to determine whether or not either piece of work constituting this sewer was of the capacity required for the purposes intended.\nIt may have served the immediate purposes of its construction in the condition of things years ago, but before the city took the liberty of afterwards increasing, as it did, the volume of water poured into it within a given space of time, it was in duty bound in law (as I conceive it) and in accordance with elementary principles of justice and common sense to see that the turning in of such increased volume of water would not have the effect of thereby pouring filth into the cellars known to be rightly connected with and served by this sewer. It is not pretended this was done. It is not denied that this increased burthen alone unprovided for is sufficient to have produced the results in question.\nThe following passages from the evidence of the city engineer explain this clearly, and as he put it this is the key to the whole:\nMr. Henderson.\u2014Can we not put it in any way like this; that the sewer as originally built was not designed to accommodate these changed conditions? A.\u2014Yes, you are right there.\n* * * * * * * Q.\u2014Take question 142, where you say it was only in the last four or five years that this thing had occurred. 143. \u201cThen how do you account for it? What made the change?\u201d A. \u201cThe place is built up more, and people like Mr. Faulkner have downspouts connected, and the water that used to run away and soak in the yard now finds its way to the sewers, and that has changed the conditions.\u201d\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014The construction of the asphalt pavement on Clarence Street\u2014what additional burden would that impose on the sewer? Any appreciable addition or burden? A.\u2014It would result in draining a larger percentage of water more quickly into that section.\nQ.\u2014Would it be appreciable? A.\u2014Yes, it would.\nQ.\u2014To what extent?\nHis Lordship.\u2014Before, with the ordinary macadam, what proportion of water would get in? A.\u2014About a third.\nQ.\u2014And on the pavement about what? A.\u2014About 75 per cent., and the appreciable difference would be as to the ratio between the paved portion and the unpaved portion: that is the ratio that that paved area would bear to 11 acres.\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Henderson.\u2014The whole difficulty is caused by the paving and these manholes? A.\u2014That is the key note.\nQ.\u2014So that these recent changes are the cause of the whole trouble? A.\u2014Yes.\nWhy in the face of so simple a case we are troubled in appeal with a mass of law and fact that departs from the simple lines of the learned trial judge\u2019s findings and needs no consideration to determine the real issue I cannot understand.\nOf course I understand those concerned may at the trial have partly, as foundation for their claim, before the evidence of the engineer cleared the issue, and partly with an eye to the ulterior use of such an exhibition of the law and the fact have justification for this wandering afield. At present it only serves to becloud the real issue.\nThen as to the unexpected storm feature of the defence the recurrence on at least the three occasions in question within so brief a period of the like results sweeps away the excuses sought in unexpected storms. And this is also shewn by a mass of evidence proving that in other years and almost yearly for some few years the flooding occurred though not attended with such serious results as on one of the three occasions directly in question herein.\nEach furnished causes of action, and all that ever should have resulted from giving heed to the wonderful three-inch storm of nine minutes, of which so much has been made, was a diminution of the damages which is not now sought, nor at this stage could be listened to.\nSewers, drains and water courses are not merely for service in fair weather, but in rainy weather also, to that degree which long experience and observation will enable those concerned to know was likely to happen.\nIt is the duty of those having in charge the execution of such works to make the necessary observations, acquire the necessary knowledge that experience has brought those dwelling in or near to the locality which is to be served. Failure in that regard is negligence. It is not necessary to determine here the limit of range of time over which such an inquiry should be had.\nAn attempt by experiments later on after disasters resulting from improvidence or neglect in this regard have occurred to lay some sort of foundation for theory more or less plausible as an excuse is a poor substitute for the forethought that the occasion called for.\nThe argument that the construction of the streets in question had been done as the sewer itself under the local improvement clauses above referred to, and hence the city had no responsibility or means of recti- fying a gross wrong, is absolutely without any foundation.\nThese street constructions being later in date than the sewer plaintiff uses ought not to have been entered on at all in such a way as to interfere with any prior existing right. The city council is not a mere machine but is in duty bound to exercise every care that a private owner would or should. Indeed, it has the right without giving any reason to refrain from executing any such work.\nAnd on the other hand if through great need of the work the cost of a relief sewer or storm sewer were justifiable it could have been so made as to form part of the cost of the street formation.\nMany times and for various reasons the storm waters have to be taken care of without resorting to the sewer proper.\nAgain, when through miscalculation, error or otherwise a local work has not fulfilled expectations and served the purpose, the city is in duty bound to rectify, at the expense of the city, its own mistakes.\nThe law is not so lame as to render this impossible.\nI would like to see the man bold enough to apply to the court to restrain the city council from expending money to rectify such wrongs done and resulting from error in utterly unjustifiable destruction of property, health and comfort.\nSome corporations have been willing to spend the money in litigation that costs as much as or more than some simple device to remedy the evil.\nI think the trial judge\u2019s judgment should be restored with costs of the appeal to the appellant.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Davies. DUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant, who was the plaintiff in an action, is the tenant of premises on Clarence Street, Ottawa, which he uses as a dry goods shop. On three different occasions in the years 1903 and 1904, within a period of less than two years, his cellar was flooded by a discharge from a sewer constructed and maintained by the respondent, the City of Ottawa, and he thereby suffered damages to the extent\u2014as found by the learned trial judge\u2014of $1,700. At the trial, judgment was given against the municipality for this sum. The Court of Appeal by a majority of three to two reversed the judgment of the trial judge and hence this appeal.\nThe appeal raises two distinct questions. One question is whether or not, assuming the respondents to be answerable to the appellant for the absence of care in the construction of the works of which the injury suffered by him was admittedly the consequence, this injury was in fact the result of any such want of care. The other question is the question of law, whether or not under the \u201cOntario Municipal Act\u201d the respondent municipality was, in point of law, under any duty to the appellant in the construction of the works, making it so answerable.\nIn considering the first question it is to be observed that upon some important points the facts are hardly matter of dispute. The sewer in question, which was constructed partly in the years 1885 and 1886 and completed in 1891, was designed to dispose of storm water in addition to sewage matter proper. It is not disputed that for many years before the commencement of the action the appellant\u2019s cellar had, with more or less regularity, at least once a year, been invaded by an offensive liquid discharged from this sewer. It is clearly proved that his neighbours suffered in the same way, though not quite to the same extent. It is not open to question either that the facts were known through the complaints of the sufferers and the reports of the municipal inspectors at the office of the city engineer. It is also admitted that in these circumstances changes were made by the municipality in the condition of the area tributary to the sewer in the construction of new pavements which, coupled with a large increase in a number of catch basins connecting the surface of the street with the sewer, had the affect of greatly augmenting the volume of storm water discharged into it in any given storm.\nThese facts would seem in themselves to require some explanation from the respondent municipality when resisting a claim based on the occurrences mentioned at the outset. Sewers, designed with a sufficient capacity to carry the burden cast upon them, and at the same time properly constructed, do not periodically discharge their contents into the premises which as sewers they are intended to serve. Prim\u00e2 facie\u2014treating the question at issue as a question of negligence purely\u2014the facts I have just stated would appear to put the municipality on its defence.\nBut before a municipality can raise the question of non-liability to a person on whose land their drains discharge water that would not otherwise be there discharged, they must at least shew that they have done their work without negligence; and that due care was used to discharge what they say was their statuteable duty in the drainage and management of this highway. DeRinzy v. City of Ottawa[1], at p. 716.\nThe defence is two-fold: First, it is said that the sewer was constructed in accordance with the re- quirements of good engineering, having regard to the conditions existing at the time of the occurrence upon which the appellant\u2019s claim is based; that is to say, given the pavements and openings which, as I have mentioned, so largely added to the original burden of the sewer, it is contended that the sewer, at the time the various causes of complaint arose, was nevertheless adequate, according to the standard set by approved engineering practice, to cope with the additional demands arising from the altered conditions. The second defence is that every one of the three floodings, for the consequences of which the appellant seeks to make the municipality responsible, was due to a rainfall of such excessive intensity that the municipality could not reasonably be expected to anticipate it, and consequently cannot be held answerable as being negligent in not providing for it.\nThe first of these defences rests upon a certain rule touching the capacity of sewers intended to dispose of storm water as well as of sewage which admittedly is accepted by engineers as a working rule governing the construction of works of that character within a zone known as the northern zone, in which Ottawa is situated. This rule requires that such sewers when designed for places where street paving is extensively used shall be of sufficient capacity to dispose safely of the surface water collected and discharged into them during a rainfall having an intensity of 1\u00bd inches per hour continued indefinitely.\nThe principal contention on behalf of the respondent municipality was that the sewer in question satisfied this requirement. The learned trial judge found that it did not. A majority of the members of the Court of Appeal seem to me to have found that it did not. There was at the trial conflicting evidence on the point. It should, perhaps, in these circumstances, be sufficient to say that it is not in accordance with the practice of this court to set aside a finding of fact in which both the trial judge who saw the witnesses and the majority of the first Court of Appeal have concurred; and I should leave the matter there were it not that the majority of this court do not agree with my interpretation of the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario; and in these circumstances I have thought it better to state the result of my own independent examination of the evidence, which examination has led me to the same conclusion, upon this point, as that reached by the other courts.\n* * * * * *\n(The learned judge after an examination of the evidence in detail concluded that, on this point, it fully confirms the opinion of the learned trial judge.)\n* * * * * *\nAs regards the second defence, that is a defence in which the onus is on the respondents. To establish it the respondents must prove that on each of the three occasions in question the storm was one which in Ottawa, to borrow language used by Lord Chelmsford in delivering judgment of the Privy Council in Great Western Railway Co. v. Braid[2] would not \u201cbe expected to occur.\u201d Has this been shewn? The professional witnesses called by the appellant said that in many places within the zone to which the standard above mentioned is applied the most severe of the three storms\u2014there being an exact record of the rainfall on that occasion\u2014would be regarded as an ordinary storm; and that the rule was designed to provide for and does provide for such a storm. On what ground is that evidence to be rejected? Mr. Ker hardly disputes the first statement that such storms frequently occur on the southern part of the zone. He can only escape the natural inference from that by taking refuge in the trying position already mentioned that the rule is not designed to protect people along the route of the sewer from periodical overflows\u2014once a year or so.\nMoreover, it seems difficult, in view of the admitted facts, to regard the contention seriously. These three storms occurred within the space of fourteen months, yet every one of them is said to be a storm which could not reasonably be expected in Ottawa. Still another of this class of storms is added to the list, in 1905, more violent even than the three earlier ones, making four of these unforeseeable deluges within two years. Earlier than 1903, unfortunately for the appellant, the records are silent. Can it really be argued that in face of all these facts the respondent municipality has acquitted itself of the onus upon it to shew that each of these storms was of such a character as reasonably careful persons establishing a means for the disposal of storm water would not provide for? The true answer, I think, is to be found in Mr. Ker\u2019s repeated excuse, \u201cit is a matter of expense.\u201d\nThere remain the arguments that what the municipality did was done under its statutory powers and that the appellant\u2019s remedy (if any) is under the compensation clauses of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d and a further argument based upon the local improvement clauses of that Act. The first of these contentions must stand or fall upon the construction of the statute. The general rule of law is clear. If the thing complained of, although an act which would otherwise be actionable, be authorized by statute then no action will lie in respect of it; that is to say, if it be the very thing the legislature has authorized. Because, of course, no court can treat as injuria that which the legislature has sanctioned. Examples of the rigid application of the principle will be found in Williams v. Corporation of Raleigh[3], and in East Freemantle Corporation v. Annois[4]. The principle is equally applicable to persons and bodies acting under legislative authority for their own profit and to public bodies exercising powers conferred upon them for the public benefit. In both cases where the authority is in general terms merely it may be inferred from the general scope and provisions of the statute that the powers conferred are not to be exercised to the prejudice of private rights. This was the view taken of the statute under consideration by the House of Lords in the Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[5], and of that construed by the Privy Council in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parke[6]. It is, nevertheless, entirely a question of the true meaning of the statute. In Westminster Corporation v. London & North Western Railway Co.[7], Lord Halsbury said:\nAssuming the thing done to be within the discretion of the local authority no court has power to interfere with the mode in which it has exercised it. When the legislature has confided the power to a particular body with a discretion how it is to be used it is beyond the power of any court to contest that discretion. Of course this assumes that the thing done is the thing which the legislature has authorized.\nThis, however, must be read subject to two important observations, that is to say, that in the absence of some provision (either express or clearly implied) to the contrary it must be taken that in carrying out works authorized by a statute or in exercising powers conferred by a statute you are not to act negligently and you are to act reasonably, that is to say, you are to prosecute the work or you are to exercise the power, as the case may be, in such a manner as not to do unnecessary injury to others. Lord Macnaghten, at p. 430, said:\nIt is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers such as those conferred upon the corporation must take care not to exceed or abuse its powers. It must keep within the limits of the authority committed to it. It must act in good faith. And it must act reasonably. The last proposition is involved in the second if not in the first.\nIt is not necessary for the purposes of this case to decide the question whether the rule applied in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parke6, and in Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill5 is applicable to the conduct of a municipality constructing, under the authority conferred by the \u201cOntario Municipal Act,\u201d a work such as that which has given rise to the present litigation. Upon that point conflicting opinions would appear to have been expressed at different times in Ontario courts. Compare, for example, the judgment of Street J. in Weber v. Town of Berlin[8] with the judgments of the Court of Appeal in Garfield v. City of Toronto[9], and the judgment of Hagarty C.J. in Derinzy v. City of Ottawa[10]. The point has not been argued, and I express no opinion upon it, but only observe in passing that, reading the statute as it now stands, the legislature would appear to have anticipated that works constructed by a municipality under the powers conferred by the statute might affect injuriously the property of private individuals; and in some cases to have made provision for compensation in respect of such injuries.\nOn the other hand, it has been held in a long line of authorities, beginning with Brown v. Municipal Council of Sarnia[11], the statute does not protect the municipality from responsibility in an action for damages caused by the negligent construction of works of a kind authorized by the statute; I think these authorities have been well decided; but, even if I doubted that, it would be a grave question whether it is not now too late to depart from the rule established by them.\nIn this case the corporation by reason of making and maintaining an excessive number of conduits leading to the sewer passing appellant\u2019s property periodically conducts into his neighbourhood quantities of water and liquid filth for which they have provided no proper means of escape except into the premises abutting upon the street. This cannot be said to be the result of any mere error of judgment; but on the contrary was a consequence of what the municipality did, if not actually foreseen at least foreseeable by the most ordinary forethought.\nThat does not seem to me to be a reasonable exercise of the powers vested in the municipality in re- spect of the control of streets or of the control of sewers.\nThe last point arises upon the contention that the municipality is not liable because it has no funds which can properly be applied to remedy the mischief. This point with great respect seems to me to beg the question. If the mischief is the result of an actionable wrong it is hardly conceivable that means are not within the power of the council to remedy it. I do not, however, enlarge upon the question, but agree with the view expressed by my brother Idington upon it.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCracken, Henderson, McDougall & Greene.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Taylor McVeity.\n[1] 15 Ont.

Respondents.\n1908: November 17, 18; 1909: 1909: February 12.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPatent of invention\u2014Anticipation.\nCanadian patent No. 79392 for improvements in candy-pulling machines granted on Feb. 17th, 1903, declared void for want of invention having been anticipated by earlier inventions in the United States.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (10 Ex. C.R. 378), reversed on this point.\nCROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff brought action for infringement of his patent for improvements in candy- pulling machines claiming damages and injunction. Several defences were set up, including the following: That plaintiff's invention was not new; that it was not useful; that the public were allowed to use the improvements before the patent issued; that it was not manufactured within two years after the grant of the patent so that any person could buy it; and that after the expiration of twelve months from the date of the patent it was imported into Canada. By the judgment of the Exchequer Court the patent was declared void on the ground of non-manufacture for sale within two years all other grounds of defence except the last being decided in plaintiff's favour. Both parties appealed to; the Supreme Court of Canada and when the case came on for hearing it was agreed that only the main appeal by the plaintiff's should be argued and the defendant's cross-appeal should stand over. On the main appeal the judgment of the Exchequer Court was affirmed (1).\nAt a later date the defendant's cross-appeal was heard.\nGibbons K.C. and Haverson K.C. for the cross-appellant.\nAnglin K.C. for the cross-respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nIdington J.\u2014A decision against the appellant of any one of several issues raised by this appeal and cross-appeal would, if final, be fatal to the appellant's case.\nAt the hearing of the appeal, in 1907, the parties agreed to confine the argument to the main appeal, and judgment was given as appears in the report then published[2].\nThe appellant, it is said, desires to appeal therefrom and hence the cross-appeal has been recently argued.\nThe chief issues raised thereby are that the appellant was not in fact the first and true inventor, and that the use by the respondent of the machine, which it confessedly did use, was not an infringement of the appellant's patent. It is also claimed that there was no novelty in the alleged invention as it had at the date of the application in fact become by public use thereof public property; and also that an importation into Canada by the appellant of one of his machines had the effect, by virtue of section 38, sub-section (6) of the \"Patent Act,\" of nullifying the interest of the appellant in the patent.\nA brief history of the appellant's relation to the claims he makes may help to understand the strength or weakness thereof.\nHe had been at the time of the trial, in May, 1906, a manufacturer of candy for twenty-five years. He kept a diary from which I quote and extract substance of events hereinafter referred to. As early as 1890 he recorded in it: \"If I can invent some way of cooking it quick and pulling it by machine, also cut and wrap it by machine, then I would be all right. I will try when I get along a little further.\"\nIn 1894 he engaged a firm of machinists to get up such machines.\nIn May, 1897, the diary tells he had paid that firm $12,000 for wrapping and other machines which turned out useless, and that he was permitted by them to engage one Charlie Thibodeau, who had been working with them, to come to him and he would set up a machine shop of his own.\nOn the 29th of May, 1897, he accordingly entered into a written contract with Thibodeau whereby he agreed to enter his service for the purpose of perfecting and manufacturing such machines, and to give him \"his best services and also the full benefit of any and all inventions or improvements which he had made or might hereafter make relating to machines or devices in Hildreth's business.\"\nHe also agreed if Hildreth did not desire to patent any of said inventions or improvements to keep them secret.\nHaving, he claims, succeeded as to a wrapping machine on the 26th of December, 1897, he records in his dairy as follows:\nI made a little trial of my idea of a pulling machine, it is on the principle of hand-pulling. I drove two spikes in a board about eight inches apart and took a piece of iron in my hand and worked the batch around the spikes in the form of a figure eight. I think that is the principle we shall have to go on; we may have two hooks or pins pull apart drawing the candy and another hook or pin drawing it sideways and the two hooks go back again and take the candy once more and pull it out again either on a table or up on the side of the building same as hand pulling.\nIn November, 1899, he tried a pulling machine with rolls, but it would not work.\nOn the 30th of December, 1899, he records making a little experiment with the pulling machine. He adds there had never been one made or used to his knowledge.\nOn the 12th of February, 1900, the diary records as follows:\nReceived a circular to-day from the Grand Rapids Steam Engine, Grand Rapids, Mich., of a pulling machine that they had got up. I sent letter to them for more information, it had a different principle than mine. I do not see how they can ever pull candy with it, but if it will I shall buy one until I can get mine finished; their machine seems more like a bread mixer than a candy-pulling machine.\nOn the 19th of the same month he sent them a telegram for one of their machines.\nIt arrived on the 8th of May following, and on the 10th a man came to set it up, and tested it on the 12th, when the appellant records it would not work successfully, and that \"the principle is wrong.\"\nThen he says he told Thibodeau to make up the model and told him how he wanted it.\nOn the 15th of the same month he tested a minature of his own and it worked very satisfactorily, and had added a \"reversible motion to the hooks in conjunction with the figure 8.\" Two days later he tested the model and \"it worked fine\"\nOn the 21st of May he notes he had written Grand Rapids in relation to their pulling machine, and adds \"they have given it up for a failure.\"\nOn the 24th, 25th and 26th he records what he is doing in building his pulling machine and on the said 26th \"we shipped Grand Rapids pulling machine back to-day a failure.\"\nThe 10th of June he records that his \"works fine\" and he will apply for a patent.\nOn the 21st September, 1900, he filed in Washington an application for a patent for this invention which is called hereinafter \"the pendulum machine\" and in his specification describing it says \"the essential parts of the invention being a plurality of candy-hooks, a candy-puller and means of producing a relative in and out motion of these parts.\" This and more was subsequently amended, probably because too indefinite.\nHe described it as \"a new and useful improvement in candy-pulling machines.\"\nOn the 23rd October, 1901, Dickinson, the inventor of the Grand Rapids machine, made his declaration, to found an application for patent, which was filed in the following month. Then interferences at Washington induced the appellant to try and defeat Dickinson by acquiring the rights of invention of one Jenner, who had in fact, but how or when or where does not clearly appear, invented a machine much superior to either that of Dickinson or of the appellant.\nThis was in 1902 and Jenner pursuant to his agreement with the appellant and in verification of his specifications as to his invention swore on the 31st October, 1902, for the purpose of making application for patent, that he believed \"himself to be the original and first and sole inventor of the candy-pulling machine described and claimed in the said specifications.\" The application for a patent for this Jenner invention was filed at Washington the 15th of November, 1902.\nMeantime, in July, 1901, Thibodeau, having been sued by the appellant on the 15th of the previous March or earlier to restrain him from using a machine he had invented for candy-pulling, produced it for inspection and comparison with the pendulum machine appellant claimed to have invented.\nThis Thibodeau machine the appellant saw then for the first time and he admits it was the invention of Thibodeau, yet attempts sometimes feebly and at other times more boldly to claim it to be in principle the same as his.\nIt is admitted, I think, to be in principle identical with the Jenner machine. Whether admitted or not to my mind it clearly is so.\nThe chief difference seems to consist in the transmission of the driving power by means of a chain in one and in the other by a duplicate set of cogged wheels.\nThis Thibodeau machine is that in use by the respondent and it is that use which is claimed by the appellant to be an infringement of the patent next referred to.\nOn the 12th of August, 1902, the appellant filed at Ottawa his application for a patent in Canada of the pendulum machine above referred to and on the 17th of February, 1903, patent was granted.\nIt was for an \"alleged new and useful improvement in candy-pulling machines.\"\nHow or why it comes to be thus designated, if as the diary asserts there never had been a prior candy-pulling machine in existence, is not explained.\nWe had before us in argument a model of each of the machines referred to which I will hereafter refer to as respectively the Dickinson, the Thibodeau and the Pendulum machine.\nI was unable then, and after much reading of evidence and consideration of the whole matter am unable yet, to see how the Thibodeau machine can be said to be in any respect the same in principle as the Pendulum machine unless we are to seek for the principle in the motions necessary for pulling candy by means of hands and hooks on a wall or frame which it is said have been known for ages.\nTo use the same or similar motions was necessary in any method that might be adopted.\nEven the appellant does not claim he has a patent on that, but seems to imagine there is some magic in the figure 8 that he has adopted and claims as his own ideal of the product of motion that must be got.\nI cannot concede that he by his patent acquired in law any monopoly of the use of motions that may produce such a figure or semblance thereof, or that even when he got a machine that will produce in its paths of motion such figure he has escaped from the consequences of copying another man's machine or its principle of action or that he will have debarred all others in Canada during the life of his patent from so combining well-known mechanical contrivances as to produce the necessary motions in handling and pulling candy, even if these motions were in and out or round about or intersecting paths of such a nature as should enable one to imagine a succession of figures \"8\" in tracing the paths the candy or parts of the machine may have followed.\nIt seems to me that the Dickinson machine produced and could not help producing intersecting paths that on inspection give evidence of some resemblance to a figure 8 if there be a charm in that. Of course the figure 8 it produces is not so elegant as that resulting from a use of the Pendulum machine.\nWhen we come to pass this shadow and get to the substance of things in a comparison of these (Dickinson and Pendulum) machines, they are so nearly alike in their motions, and the Pendulum machine is so clumsy a contrivance that I think it was by a careful study of the former and an adherence, indeed a discriminating adherence, to its \"mode or motion\" that the Pendulum machine was arrived at; and that the rotary conception, so widely different, so much more useful, so much more readily seized by one who had the inventive faculty, and depended on that alone, freed from the trammels of a prior model, was possibly missed by the appellant.\nDickinson followed probably the baker's trough and mixer for his model and the appellant followed, at as respectable a distance as he knew how the Dickinson. It was necessary for him to differentiate from the model. Even Thibodeau, who was, as appellant evidently was not, an expert mechanic, could not make anything really useful of the appellant's conception and instructions, whatever they were, and dropped them and invented for himself a rotary machine.\nIf the internal evidence which the diary furnishes so amply, the external or objective evidence which comparison of the machines also supplies, and the history of the case, including appellant's own evidence, do not fully support my surmises relative to the appellant and his alleged invention, let us turn to his conduct for further cogent evidence of their correctness.\nWhy did he, if conscious of his own rectitude and capacity as an inventor, buy the Jenner invention?\nIf, as he swears, the principle of the Thibodeau, which is another Jenner, are the same as his Pendulum machine, why should he seek for support in the Jenner and buy it? He replies it was to antedate the Dickinson.\nBut again, how or why or on what grounds? It is not apparent on the evidence before us that any one would invest money in its purchase for that reason alone.\nBut he seemed afraid of Thibodeau's rotary machine when Thibodeau, the inventor of it, ventured to interfere with his claim at Washington.\nIt seems hard to believe that the appellant did not know when seeking to restrain Thibodeau why he sought to restrain him. If he knew that his machine was only something he pretends now identical in principle with his own, why should he feel disturbed?\nBut, however that may be, having found from inspection he got in July, 1901, what it was, why should he seek in 1902 to buy Jenner's, which was the same in principle? Besides the priority of date already referred to he adds it was better to buy him off.\nI find no ground for apprehension unless his was an imitation of Dickinson's. If the Dickinson principle had not been adopted why seek to antedate it?\nI think it is not unfair to infer that he had not the confidence he now pretends in the rotary and the pendulum being the same in principle or his pendulum machine being entirely different from the Dickinson, and in fact a machine that worked \"fine\" whilst the other was a total failure and worthless.\nMoreover, why did he knowing of the identity as he must after in July, 1901, seeing Thibodeau's which is identical with Jenner's induce Jenner on the 31st October, 1902, to swear he was the sole inventor of the machine? If his present contention be correct as to identity in principle of the Thibodeau or its equivalent the Jenner with his, he (Jenner) was only one of several inventors of the same thing.\nThe appellant seems to be in this dilemma. The development of his pendulum machine from Dickinson's seems much more easy, much more probable than to suppose that some one else merely developed the rotary machine in question from the pendulum machine.\nIt seems a fair test when we are asked to find the rotary machine in question an infringement of the pendulum machine to consider if it is at all probable that an ordinary skilled mechanic having once seen the alleged original invention could at once suggest and apply without the necessity for any inventive power whatsoever some other arrangement of mechanical contrivances to produce the same result.\nIf he could not, then he who constructs a new machine requiring inventive faculty is entitled to a patent, or to use as here without patent.\nOf course, if that new machine be but an improvement on the other he inventing it must, if he apply for a patent, be confined to an invention by way of improvement. His use without patent must be, of course, subject to the like limitations.\nBut if, as I find here, the invention be entirely new and not merely an improvement, he would be entitled to his patent as for a new machine, or if he did not desire a patent, to use it free from restraint.\nEven if in this case it is inconceivable that this rotary machine is not in fact founded on the earlier pendulum machine, then to my mind much less can it be conceived that was not anticipated by the Dickinson one still earlier.\nThen again, the whole story of the appellant, for long years anxious to design a bandy-pulling machine, beaten after years of speculation as to it, telegraphing to have the Dickinson machine sent him, shewing it to his skilled workman and to his attorney, and attacking immediately on its arrival with such feverish haste the problem he had so long failed to solve and coming to such sudden unexpected success and in one breath condemning as total failure that which he desired to have discarded, and self-approvingly recording how \"finely\" his own had worked when in fact it never was worth much, if anything, not only arouses suspicion, but when coupled with a pretty obvious resemblance between the two and all the other evidence and considerations I have adverted to, leads me to but one conclusion, and that is that the appellant never invented what he claims and is therefore not entitled to the relief he asks. Nor do I think that the Thibodeau machine in question was an imitation of the appellant's. Indeed if the appellant had really supposed it was the result of his instructions to his servant he would, I suspect, have used it in applying for his Canadian patent for it was so much superior to his pendulum machine.\nWe have to bear in mind that it is the appellant's conception we have to consider and not that of his hired man. His long years of meditation and failure and the measure of his capacity to understand mechanical principles as shewn by his evidence do not lead me to conceive of the sudden inspiration he got coming to him save what was derived from the use he made of the Dickinson machine.\nAs to the grounds of his public user giving possession to the public, I do not think, in the view I take, it is necessary to follow that matter very far.\nThe use extended over several years under such circumstances of publicity that I would, in consequence of the view I have taken of the appellant and his case, feel inclined to seek for corroborative evidence that measures were really taken to protect his invention from publication.\nIn his attempt to establish its utility by his statements as to its being used and yet hand labour being continued until the rotary machine was installed when both the pendulum machine and hand labour disappeared together, one is at a loss to know exactly what conclusion to arrive at regarding his veracity on this point of public use.\nAs to the importation I incline to think it was of the substantial parts of the machine and hence an importation of the invention. See interpretation of the word in the Act. I have not, however, arrived at a final opinion on that as it seems unnecessary to follow the matter further.\nI think the cross-appeal should be allowed with costs of appeal and of the trial.\nCross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blake, Lash & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gibbons, Harper & Gibbons.\n[1] 10 Ex.

The effect of the transaction caused the areas to become unoccupied lands of the Crown, within the meaning of the statute, and, upon their re-location, the water record in connection therewith continued to subsist as a right appurtenant to the joint pre-emption.\nJudgment appealed from (13 B.C. Rep. 77) reversed, the Chief Justice and Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J. at the trial. The defendants, Vaughan and McInnes, held separate pre-emption records, and, as partners, a joint water record, dated 20th January, 1888. On 28th October, 1889, they recorded what was styled an abandonment of their respective pre-emptions, relocated the same areas as partners, and, on the same day, applied for and recorded these areas as a new preemption in their joint names, in partnership, under the provisions of the \"Land Act, 1884\"[2], and the Act amending that statute[3]. Nothing was done in respect to the water record which was allowed to stand, as previously, in their joint names, \"Vaughan and McInnes.\" At the same time the pre-emptors swore to an affidavit, in the form required by the statute, stating that the areas were \"unoccupied and unreserved Crown lands, within the meaning of the statute * * * staked off and marked * * * in accordance with the provisions of the 'Land Act.' \"\nThe grant of water to Vaughan and McInnes was for 99 years from the 20th of January, 1888. On 25th March, 1899, the respondent Covert obtained a grant and record of the same water rights for an indefinite period, and, some time before the commencement of the action, transferred his lands, adjoining those of Vaughan and McInnes, and his water record to the other respondent, the Eastern Townships Bank. The bank subdivided the lands into small fruit farms and constructed an irrigation system for the use of these plots of land. Covert's water record was indorsed by the recording officer with a memorandum, as follows: \"Error in not making out application on the 18th October, 1887,\" and the bank, claiming that this had the effect of antedating their water record to the 18th of October, 1887, and giving it priority over the appellants' record, brought the action to restrain them from using the water in priority of the respondents and also attacking the validity of the appellants' record. The trial judge, Morrison J., dismissed the action and, on appeal, his decision was reversed by the judgment from which the present appeal is asserted.\nJ. A. Macdonald K.C. for the appellants.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. and H. C. Hamilton for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I dissent from the judgment allowing this appeal for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur generally with my brother Maclennan in his conclusion to allow this appeal and to restore the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action, but I desire to add some words of my own.\nThe ground upon which the Supreme Court of British Columbia rested their judgment was that the appellants, Vaughan and McInnes, had abandoned their separate pre-emptions at the time they took out their joint pre-emption and that their water record which had been obtained in connection with the preemption consequently lapsed.\nA number of other points were raised by the respondents either as invalidating the appellants' record or as giving priority to that of the respondents. I do not intend dealing with these at any length: I think the want of certainty alleged in the defendants, (appellants') record from the absence in it of the name of the creek sufficiently covered by their application for the record which application is identified in the record itself by its official number and contains the clerk's name.\nI agree for the reasons stated by my brother Maclennan that it would be impossible under the facts to make the respondent Covert's record relate back from the 25th March, 1889, to the 18th October, 1887, as contended for.\nThe substantial point on which the judgment of the court below proceeds was that there was such an abandonment by the appellants of the land of which they had severally pre-empted 340 acres and of their \"lawful occupation and bon\u00e2 fide cultivation\" of the same as necessarily destroyed or forfeited their water record and caused it to lapse.\nI am unable to reach the conclusion of the court below that there was any such abandonment.\nI agree that in order to obtain and retain a water record under this statute several things must exist and concur. The applicant or applicants must (a) be entitled to hold land and (b) must also be \"lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating lands\" in connection with which and as appurtenant to which he may record and divert so much water from the natural channel of any stream, lake or river adjacent to or passing through such land as may be reasonably necessary for agricultural or other purposes, and the commissioner for the district may allow. The 43rd section of the statute of 1884, as cited by my brother Maclennan, is the governing section.\nIn the case of the respondents these conditions existed at the time they obtained their water record. The fact that they obtained a joint water record while their pre-emptive rights were several in the land does not appear to me by any means to be fatal. Though they had each separate pre-emptive rights in 320 acres they worked all the lands in partnership and their occupation and cultivation of the lands were joint. The statute in its 19th section expressly contemplates the case of several persons uniting in partnership for the purpose of pre-empting, holding and working land and expressly declared such persons to be eligible to pre-empt as a firm an area of land to the extent to each partner of 320 acres in that part of British Columbia. But there is nothing in the statute which in my opinion prevents separate pre-emptors whose lands were so relatively situated that one water record in their joint names would enable them more satisfactorily to obtain the supply of water required for irrigation or other agricultural purposes from making an application in their joint names and obtaining a joint water record to be utilized for their several farms or holdings.\nI have not heard any satisfactory reason advanced why that should not be so. The statute certainly does not expressly prohibit such a course being taken, and I can easily conceive of situations existing which would makes such a course very desirable, if not necessary, as well from a pecuniary standpoint as from the physical situation of the lands relatively to the water sought to be obtained.\nThe defendants then having separate pre-emptive rights in the 640 acres which they worked in partnership, obtained their joint water record, necessitating the construction of one ditch only to carry the water to their lands. In this I think they were not acting outside of either the letter or the spirit of the statute.\nAfterwards, deeming it desirable to consolidate their separate pre-emptive rights in one joint pre-emption and finding the statute prohibited any transfer of any pre-empted land until after the issue of a Crown grant of the same, they went to the proper officer to effect their purpose by surrendering up their separate pre-emp- tions and taking out a joint pre-emption. As Vaughan in his evidence says:\nI told him (the officer) to put the lots in partnership; I turned over the old records and he made new ones.\nThe necessary formal application to record in their joint names as pre-emptors the 640 acres and also the statutory declaration to accompany it were duly made.\nThis it is which is said to amount to an abandonment and to work a forfeiture of their water record But an abandonment of what? Not of the lands, certainly. These continued in the possession and occupation of Vaughan and McInnes as they had been all along, and continued to be cultivated in partnership as they had been. No other person was or could be in such occupation or cultivation while the defendants remained in them. No suggestion ever was made of any intention to abandon the lands or their possession or occupation. No evidence of such intention was or could be given because it would be contrary to the fact. As a fact there was no abandonment and no intention to abandon, but on the contrary a clear undoubted intention to continue in the joint occupation and cultivation of the 640 acres.\nThe pre-emptors continued on without a break in their bon\u00e2 fide occupation and cultivation of the preempted lands, the sole and only change being that the separate pre-emptions were changed into a joint one. But this mere change in the title would not alone, in my judgment, operate to work a forfeiture of the water record which was appurtenant to their lands. The change was doubtless made in order that their water record being joint, their pre-emptive rights might agree with it. But the conditions necessary, in my opinion, under the statute to obtain a water record or right and to retain such right, namely, the existence of a person or persons entitled to hold lands and their \"lawful occupation and cultivation\" by such persons continued in the case of defendants, appellants, and their lands, and the mere change in the manner in which the title to the lands was held was not in itself fatal to their water rights. Looking at the substance of the transaction it cannot in my opinion be fairly said that there was any such abandonment as that contended for or any abandonment of the lands at all, or of the manner in which they had all along been occupied and cultivated. The most that can be said is that as they desired to change the tenure or title by which they held the lands from separate pre-emptions of moieties to a joint preemption of the whole and that as the statute prevented the accomplishment of their purpose by the customary methods of transfer until the Crown grant issued, they were compelled to resort to the method they adopted of surrendering their several pre-emptions and taking out instead a joint pre-emption. But such mere change in the manner of holding their title did not in any way affect their occupation and cultivation of the land or the necessity which presumably existed for the water their record entitled them to divert. The object of the prohibition of transfer until after Crown grant was issued I take it was to insure as far as might be possible that only bon\u00e2 fide occupiers and cultivators should hold and enjoy pre-emptive rights. It was to prevent the speculator and the many outside parties not being bon\u00e2 fide occupiers or cultivators from becoming the owners by purchase of these rights. Such prohibition never was nor could be intended to prevent several bon\u00e2 fide occupiers and cultivators who had taken separate pre-emptions from surrendering their several and separate rights and changing them into joint ones, if they desired to work their holdings in partnership, or on the other hand prevent those who had made their pre-emptions joint under the statute from surrendering and changing their interests to several ones. To say that they could only do so under penalty of forfeiture of their water rights which presumably were essential to the profitable enjoyment of their holdings is to import into the statute an object which I am satisfied was not that of the legislature, and to put a construction upon its sections which they will not fairly bear.\nA statutory water right appurtenant to a piece of land for the purposes of its proper and profitable occupation and cultivation might properly be forfeited and lost by its owner abandoning his holding. But in every case I take it whether there has been an abandonment or not must be a question of fact. In the circumstances of the case before us I find not an abandonment of the lands for the proper cultivation of which the water record was granted, but a mere change in the title, of the holders or occupants from several pre-emptions to a joint pre-emption so as to enable them more effectively in their opinion at any rate to cultivate and develop their holdings.\nThen it is said that in order to obtain the joint preemption they were obliged to make and did make a false declaration in stating the lands to be\nunoccupied and unreserved Crown lands within the meaning of the \"Crown Land Act.\"\nI do not agree to that. Whether the affidavit was false or true depends upon the construction of the statute. The statement that the land was unoccupied Crown land does not mean that the applicant was not in its occupation. What I take it to mean is that no other or third person occupied it. In the very nature of things the plaintiff must have been an occupier when he made his application because the statute in its 5th section expressly requires any intending preemptor to go upon the lands he intends pre-empting, and if the lands be unsurveyed first place at each of its angles or corners a stake or post, and further requires him to fix upon each post a notice in the following form:\nA. B.'s land N.E. post:\u2014A. B.'s land N.W. post, and so on as the case may be.\nIt is only after the intending pre-emptor has complied with these statutory requirements that he can make his application and if he obtains his record without having so staked and marked his land the statute goes on to say \"he shall have no right at law or in equity therein.\"\nThese essential pre-requisites go to shew that when he makes the declaration that the lands are unoccupied the meaning is unoccupied by any person other than the applicant. It would seem absurd that an intending pre-emptor staking out his land and complying with the statutory requirements of proclaiming by notice on the four corners of the land, that the land was his should, if he left his wife and children in a camp upon the land while he journeyed perhaps hundreds of miles to the proper officer to complete his pre-emption, be guilty of perjury if in his declaration he called the land unoccupied. It would be in my opinion unoccupied Crown lands within the meaning of the statute it after having been surveyed, staked and proclaimed as his by the applicant, he, in order to prevent it being \"jumped,\" or for any other reason, left his wife or agent in possession while he himself travelled away to complete his title.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The questions raised by this appeal turn upon the correct interpretation of the provisions of the \"Land Act, 1884,\" providing by said statute and also some amendments thereto for the diversion of water from the streams in British Columbia.\nThe legislation in question is a clear invasion of the ordinary common law rights of riparian proprietors and others whose properties may become subservient to the rights given to affect the purposes of the Act.\nTo carry out the provisions of the Act, officers of the Crown are entrusted with the duties of receiving applications from those desiring to avail themselves of the provisions of the Act to acquire such rights of diversion as the Act enables to be given.\nIt is part of the duties of these officers receiving such an application to see that all the conditions preliminary to such acquisition have been complied with and when complied with, to make a record of the grant which is made when he finds these conditions to have been complied with.\nHence the rights thus acquired are called water records.\nThe same officers who discharge these duties also have charge of the selling or entering and granting applications for the purchase of Crown lands in the district for which they are appointed. When granted and recorded this right of purchase is spoken of as a pre-emption right or record. Each of the appellants, Vaughan and McInnes, acquired as results of such applications for purchase a pre-emption right to certain lands that adjoined each other and could be usefully served by the same ditches or water system conveying water from a creek known as \"fourth of July\" creek.\nThey occupied these lands over which they had thus respectively acquired such rights of pre-emption.\nThough each thus had his separate title by way of pre-emption they carried on the business of farming these lands in partnership.\nTheir occupation was joint, but the root of each title to occupation was several, and when each occupant entered on or was in occupation of the land preempted by the other he was dependent on the will of that other or the contract he had with that other to maintain his right to such occupancy.\nThat occupancy might be jointly with or in substitution of the other as agreed, provided always such substitution was not entire or in conflict with the conditions imposed \"of continuous settlement.\"\nIt is necessary to understand these elementary propositions clearly in order that we can see if such persons fall within section 39 of the Act in question which reads as follows:\n39. Every person lawfully entitled to hold land under this Act, or under any former Act, and lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating lands, may record and divert so much and no more of any unrecorded and unappropriated water from the natural channel of any stream, lake, or river adjacent to or passing through such land, for agricultural or other purposes, as may be reasonably necessary for such purposes, upon obtaining the written authority of the commissioner of the district to that effect, and a record of the same shall be made with him, after due notice as herein mentioned, specifying the name of the applicant, the quantity sought to be diverted, the place of diversion, the object thereof, and all such other particulars as such commissioner may require. For every such record the commissioner shall charge a fee of two dollars; and no such person shall have any exclusive right to the use of such water, whether the same flow naturally through or over his land, except such record shall have been made and such fee paid.\nThe statute does not define what is necessary to constitute a person lawfully entitled to hold land under this or any former Act. This Act excludes by implication, aliens, unless complying with the terms laid down promising to become British subjects. Another Act, 47 Vict. ch. 2, expressly excludes Chinese.\nEach of these appellants who obtained the water record seems to have been qualified. No contention was made to the contrary in this regard. I therefore assume them qualified.\nEach of these appellants under the relations formed towards each other and these lands were lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating the lands in question.\nWhen we have regard to the purview of the Act we must surely conclude that it is the \"lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating\" that is desired to be served by this allotment of water.\nThis phrase appears in more than one place in the Act. As a test of the meaning of the Act that is in a measure of some value.\nBut beyond all that what could be the purpose of such legislation invading, as already said, what was ordinarily looked upon not only as an incident of the ownership of real property, but so much part and parcel thereof as to seem almost inseparable therefrom if it were not to be the means of supplying water to the cultivator?\nWhat we have to find under this section is a personal status for which the applicant or applicants must be qualified, first, by a general capacity to hold real estate; and, secondly, that he or they occupy and cultivate land.\nNo other condition or requirement of any kind is named in the statute or is referred to in the application for a water record, or in the water record itself.\nWhy should we seek to import one? How can we if we so sought to do?\nThe language used does not warrant our doing so. It is so clear and so express on this point as, I submit, to forbid us doing so.\nNow let us see if the appellants have that required personal status. Each was when the water record was applied for and got, in lawful occupation of and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating land which needed the use of water.\nNay, more, it is proven that together they lawfully occupied and cultivated as partners each with the other that other's land, and thereby were fully qualified even if some specific land must be also had in view unless the ordinary rights of land owners to so assemble their rights of occupation and cultivation are to be denied them.\nThere is in this last regard I submit no colour of reason for such a suggestion unless it is found in the prohibition of section 24:\n24. No transfer of any surveyed or unsurveyed land pre-empted under this Act shall be valid after a Crown grant of the same shall have been issued.\nThis section has been considered by the courts of British Columbia in two cases, Turner v. Curran[4], where an agreement to sell outright a pre-emption claim was held void, and Hjorth v. Smith[5], where a deed having been executed before patent of a preempted lot of land purported to convey it, but was only intended to operate after the patent was issued and to effect that purpose it was delivered as an escrow and after the issue of the patent was held valid.\nThis latter judgment proceeded on the ground that the instrument did not come within the express terms of the prohibiting a transfer of the land so pre-empted. See also Meek v. Parsons[6].\nIn like manner I fail to see how the agreement between the defendants to work the lands each was entitled to in partnership could come within the prohibition. It does not seem to me that such an agreement or acting upon it could offend against or come within the evil at which the section aimed.\nIt is, however, contended further that the grant of a water record must be held as intended to have been appurtenant to some specific land. Why so? The statute does not in terms or by any reasonable implication thereof make it so.\nLet us test it by what would be the result of a conveyance of the land.\nBouvier's Dictionary (vol. 1, p. 158) defines \"appurtenances\" as follows:\nThings belonging to another thing as principal, and which pass as incident to the principal thing.\nBurton on Real Property (8th ed.), p. 353, par. 1145, repeating Coke on Littleton, says:\nIn general everything which is appendant or appurtenant to land will pass by any conveyance of the land itself, without being specified, and even without the use of the ordinary form \"with the appurtenances\" at the end of the description.\nThen we find the interpretation given by authorities cited in Gould on Waters (3 ed.), p. 465, dealing with similar legislation is stated as follows:\nThe ditch when completed is not a mere easement or appurtenance. I do not find the cases he refers to in the foot note to the text bear directly on the point, but the cases of Strickler v. City of Colorado Springs[7], and Bloom v. West[8], are well worth looking at and held as just quoted.\nThe greater part of the land might be granted, one part to one, another to another, or for some other purpose to which this never could be supposed to be appurtenant.\nOr as intensive farming progressed a few acres of a whole section might require all the water so granted. Yet if anything in the theory that it was appurtenant a man may have after spending large sums of money on such improvements his whole property tied up in an undesirable way.\nIt would, I submit, be the part of wisdom to proceed slowly before grafting on to any statutory right, though having in some respects some relation to the use of or use for land, the intricate technical character of real property rights at common law or derived from ancient statutes; especially when the statutory right under consideration shews as clearly as this one does that it had not had that consideration given to it that would render the grafting process a success. Moreover, the statute does not imply any permanency of title as needed to entitle one to apply or receive a grant so long as there exists land lawfully occupied and cultivated and the party is not a mere trespasser.\nThe legal right given by this statute is, I think, analogous to that given householders in cities to be supplied by municipal or other corporations with light or water.\nThe right often, if not always, exists in the house- holder on the line to insist on a supply of light or water because he therein fulfils the primary condition entitling to such supply.\nBut who ever heard of such a right as so appurtenant to the land that a purchaser and grantee thereof could insist on the actual fulfilment of the personal contract which the vendor may have had, for years yet to run, at the time of sale?\nIn actual practice the term of ninety-nine or eighty years now in question may not seem to have much relation to the not uncommon term of a few years.\nBut in what essential is there any difference in legal principle?\nThe radical error in the judgment appealed from is that it assumes as necessary to the grant or holding it that there must be unity of title in the privilege or franchise given by the statute and in the property which it is used to benefit or improve whilst the statute clearly neither expresses any such thing nor implies it as necessary in any way, but plainly expresses merely the lawful occupation and cultivation.\nNay, more, to insist upon this unity of title in such a statute as before us where so many contingencies, qualifications and conditions are left unprovided for would be to defeat the purpose of the Act.\nThe whole chapter of Gould on Waters devoted to this branch of law is replete with such material as to suggest many reasons for holding this statutory right as it existed under the Act now in question and before later developments did not proceed upon any such theory as the water record becoming appurtenant to any land.\nIt could not in case of a sale of part perhaps even of the greater part of the land be conceivable as appurtenant to that sold. It is not severable in that way. It requires a special bargain in such case and does not pass.\nIndeed it might well be designed that part should pass and remainder be left without water.\nAll this remained unsettled, unprovided for, when this water record in question was granted. The statute as amended alters much of this, but cannot bear on this case.\nI do not urge that the water records could not be made appurtenant by contract. Nor do I say that a statute might not be framed to have the same effect or pass any opinion on the statute as now amended.\nI merely desire to enforce the argument that this statute had not made the water record appurtenant when first creating it and, hence, neither being so necessarily nor made so by express terms is not appurtenant.\nThe statute as amended in 1886 provided that transfers, etc.,\nshall be construed to have conveyed and transferred, etc., * * * any and all recorded water privileges in any manner attached to or used in the working of the land pre-empted or conveyed, etc., etc.\nHow far does that carry us? It simply provided for giving prim\u00e2 facie effect to the probable intention of parties making and receiving such transfers and recognizes a right not hitherto existing to transfer a water record.\nIt would seem quite clear, apart from any inference drawn from the existence and frame of this amendment, that the water record had not up to that time been assignable.\nIt was necessary to confer and define the extent of the power to assign, and in doing it this very class of cases was omitted for the section carefully restricts its operation to the transfers of any pre-emption right where the same are or were permitted by law.\nAny argument to be derived from it seems to me distinctly against such a position as taken here by respondents, that inherently these water records had been appurtenant to any land. It does not matter if in a dozen other classes of cases the right has become appurtenant so long as it has not so become in this.\nIt helps, moreover, appellants' case, when we have to consider the question upon which the whole case turned in the court below, to keep in view this obvious exclusion of this very case inherent in the amendment. Even if the right were appurtenant I think, for reasons I am about to state, it had not been forfeited.\nLet us consider then, what is relied on to forfeit appellants' rights.\nWhat happened was this. These appellants, Vaughan and McInnes, desired to extend their relations as partners to a joint interest or ownership of pre-emption in the lands hitherto held separately.\nThey presented their wishes on the 28th October, 1889, to the commissioner and on that day with his sanction and approval (as attested both by his swearing them to the affidavit taken, and the evidence of Vaughan, as well as what I infer from the date and form of the application on his printed form possibly written in if not by himself by his express directions, and from his writing across the face of their preemption certificates the alleged abandonment thereof) signed an application for a pre-emption of the combined properties of both and made the usual affidavit therefor.\nSection 24 prohibited a transfer from one to the other and this mode was adopted of bringing about the desired result. What legal effect had this proceeding? Most obviously it was either effective or a nullity.\nThe latter was entirely contrary to the intention of the parties, yet if illegal it must be held to have been and to be null.\nIn either alternative it cannot help the respondent.\nIf it effected nothing the so-called surrender was null.\nThe rights of the parties could not be so destroyed. They remained in lawful occupation throughout and continued cultivating jointly their lands.\nIt is treated in the judgment appealed from as effective to terminate the right of appellants.\nIn this I cannot agree. The Crown alone had the right to affirm this alleged termination of these preemptive rights.\nIf anything flowed therefrom, let us suppose, if we can venture so to suppose, the Crown had instituted proceedings to have it declared that the pre-emption had ended, because one of the officers of the Crown had in course of this written across one corner of the certificate the words, \"abandoned 28th October, '89, W.D., Assistant Commissioner of L. & W.,\" and set thereto his own initials. Can any one say such a claim would in any court of justice have been maintained? See the case of Lytle v. State of Arkansas[9], at p. 333.\nIt is said there must be a time during which the appellants' rights were suspended, yet they were in occupation.\nThen they must have been on this theory of suspension and surrender trespassers during that time. Could the Crown have maintained a suit for trespass done during that time? The answer would be that, until something more was done by the Crown, they were tenants at will or on sufferance and, thus, in the lawful occupation and cultivation which alone can be urged when assuming it must continue as the basis of right to hold the water record.\nAgain, the surrender relied on is a myth. The applicants signed nothing and did nothing but hand conditionally their certificates of pre-emption to the officer. His act in writing thereon was unauthorized unless he had power to do effectively what they desired and trusted to have done. Meantime the water record was not touched in any way. How then can it be held to be affected? Whilst the statute requires at its granting a personal status in him applying for it there is no provision for the qualification continuing.\nThe legislature seemed to assume that such a thing as a desire to hold when no longer useful was not likely to arise.\nAt all events no such case was specially provided for.\nI do not doubt that in law it was provided for by the implied consideration for and thus become virtually a condition inherent in the grant that it should be made useful.\nBut in that case it would not end as a matter of course.\nIt would require something done at the instance of the Crown by a proceeding in a court in a proper way shewing that in fact the consideration for the grant had failed.\nThe right would not terminate automatically, as it were. No statute or law had said so and this mode of relief was not one the respondents could insist upon.\nThis is entirely another consideration from that other argument used that the water would revert to the Crown, in which, I think, there is much to be considered. But if what I have said be not effective in maintaining my argument I doubt if it would gain any added strength from this other.\nWhat I have set forth as above seems to me clearly to establish by a strict adherence to elementary principles and the language of the statute that the appellants are entitled to succeed.\nThe numerous points taken and arguments adduced on either side beyond those directly or incidentally implied in the foregoing have received due consideration, but need not be dwelt upon at great length.\nThe date of the notice founding the appellants' application I think erroneous. We must now at this time assume the assistant commissioner adjudicated properly on so very obvious a matter. Besides there is the view taken in this court in the case of Martley v. Carson[10].\nAs to the alleged priority of the respondents' claim it is not supported by such evidence as at this distance of time should be called for in light of nearly twenty years of acquiescence in a condition of things that it would be most unjust for that reason alone now to disturb. It has to stand or fall by its own strength and adds nothing to anything else in the case on which the respondents might rely.\nThe ground taken by respondents that the water record of appellants does not designate the purpose for which the water is to be used on the creek in respect of which the water record is granted supported by a reference to sections 43 and 44 is deserving of notice, not from any strength to be found in it, but as one of those assumptions of law and fact that I respectfully submit have wrought so much confusion in this case.\nThe Act does not by these sections or anywhere expressly require that the exact purpose for which the water is to be diverted should be stated in the application or defined in the record of grant. There are certain things pretty evidently required by these sections. They are the personal status or qualification of the applicant already dwelt upon, that the water shall be for agricultural or other purposes, that the quantity be specified, and the object. Now surely what has been adjudged by the commissioner and done in pursuance thereof must be taken at this late date in light of the evidence before us to have got itself defined to the satisfaction of him in whom was reposed the judicial power to determine. More than that due consideration of the whole involved in this minor inquiry drives me to conclude that the adjudication must have proceeded upon a consideration of what quantity of cultivatable land was within a reasonable time likely to be in need of water and that the extent of land already cultivated would be some index thereof and that it was not the irreclaimable rocks which for aught we know may have formed nine\u2014tenths of the entire land in question that would or could be considered by the commissioner.\nAll these and like considerations, as well as extent of supply, and possible needs of others, were entrusted to the commissioner to pass upon before he sanctioned priority.\nTime has settled the boundaries of what he assigned and tells us thus what he did. But at no time does it seem that he or any one else had ever to consider to what land or part of land this grant so recorded should become appurtenant as one would expect to have found if the legislature had felt concerned in that sort of question instead of leaving it to be held in gross to become if need be appurtenant to what events might prove it fitting it should be, and the proprietor determine.\nThat brings me to suggest that the judicial nature of the inquiry entrusted to the commissioner was of such a character that unless he was clearly without any jurisdiction to pass upon appellants' first application for water in the way and to award as he did we have no right to disturb his decision which has remained unchallenged for nearly twenty years, nor has the respondent any right now when he failed to shew cause at the proper time before the commissioner as against appellants' application made, as it was always known to be, jointly.\nThis same judicial character of the functions the assistant commissioner had to discharge renders it quite needless to notice at length the rather absurd sort of proceeding relied upon as having the effect of ante-ating respondents' grant to the detriment of the appellants without ever calling upon them to shew cause.\nTaking into account the various considerations above as well as others not adverted to and section 3 of the amendment of 1886 and some other sections and having regard to the principles upon which the case of Osborne v. Morgan[11] proceeds, though possibly distinguishable from this case, there may be grave reason to doubt the status of the respondent herein.\nIt has become unnecessary in my view to pass upon the same. Being so, it is also undesirable to do so, as it might involve considerations detrimental to the rights of the respondent which in no way affect, or, in my view, now concern the appellants herein.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of the trial judge be restored.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The first question in this appeal is the date of the respective water records of the parties.\nThe Vaughan and McInnes application for a record was on the 15th November, 1884, and the Covert application on the 18th September, 1887. Both applications are in the same form; they are in reality not applications, but notices of intention to apply under section 43 of the \"Land Act, 1884,\" for permission to divert 300 inches of water from the Fourth of July Creek.\nThat section authorizes persons lawfully occupying and cultivating land to divert water for agricultural purposes\nupon obtaining the written authority of the land commissioner to that effect.\nThe section also requires that a record be made of the same with him, specifying certain particulars. A fee of $2 is required to be paid, and the section declares that no person shall have a right to use such water without such record having been made, and fee paid. The Vaughan and McInnes record, hereinafter called the Vaughan record, was made on the 28th January, 1888, and is expressed to be made under the said section 43; while the Covert record is dated the 25th March, 1889. That is its form and date, and if there was nothing more in the case, there would be a clear and undoubted priority of the Vaughan record of more than a year.\nIt is sought, however, to make the Covert record relate back to the 18th of October, 1887, by evidence that Covert, not having received his record for a long time, made application to the commissioner, and obtained it in the form and on the date above mentioned, but with a memorandum written across it and signed by the commissioner in these words:\nError in not making out application on the 18th October, 1887.\nA receipt is also produced, dated on the 25th March, 1889, for $2, the fee required by the statute to be paid for such records. On this receipt also is indorsed a similar memorandum to that upon the record, except that it says\nerror in not making out record instead of application.\nMr. Covert in his evidence said he had sent a sufficient sum with his notice of application to cover the $2 required to be paid for the record. The commissioner evidently did not acknowledge that he had received the fee with the application, but required and received it at the date of the record, and the only receipt which he gave was of the same date as the record.\nAssuming that Covert did with his application enclose money enough for the record fee, I think it is impossible to hold that his record can relate back to the 18th October, 1887.\nSection 46 of the Act declares that priority of right to water privileges, in case of dispute, shall depend on priority of record, and there was no record made for Covert until the later date. There had only been a notice of intention to apply for one, and when Randall, his agent, went for the record he saw the notice still sticking up in the office. It is beyond all possible controversy that there was no written authority, and no record made by or with the commissioner, such as the statute requires, until the 25th March, 1889. The record of the appellants, therefore, assuming it still to exist, has clearly priority over that of the respondents.\nIt is contended, however, that the Vaughan record lapsed and came to an end on the 28th of October, 1889, when Vaughan and McInnes surrendered to the commissioner their individual pre-emptions and obtained a joint pre-emption instead.\nPrevious to that date Vaughan and McInnes had separate pre-emptions of adjoining parcels of land each containing 320 acres, but had been occupying and cultivating them jointly, in partnership.\nOn that day they applied to the commissioner to change their several pre-emptions into a joint preemption of both parcels, a kind of holding and enjoyment authorized by section 19 of the Act.\nThe statute, however, section 24, presented a difficulty. That section prohibits transfers of pre-emptions until after a Crown grant has been issued. But for that prohibition all they would have had to do was for each of them to make a transfer of his pre-emption to some third person, who should then transfer both pre-emptions to the two, to be held in partnership.\nAlthough they could not transfer to a subject, they could transfer to the Crown, the Crown not being bound by the statute.\nThis they did: they surrendered to the Crown. It is immaterial whether the act was called a surrender or an abandonment. That is merely a question of words. They did not abandon, and did not intend to abandon. They remained in possession as before. They revested the title in the Crown and the commissioner immediately granted them a pre-emption in partnership, a perfectly regular and legal transaction.\nThe question then arises: What effect had this transaction with the Crown upon the joint water record? They did not expressly include that in the surrender. That was not necessary, for it was already held in the very way they wished to hold it. But, I think, it was not necessary for another reason. I think that, being appurtenant to the pre-emption, it was surrendered with them because vested in the Crown along with them, and was re-vested in the pre-emptors as appurtenant to the land.\nThe contention of the respondents on the other hand is that when the pre-emptions were surrendered, or abandoned, to the Crown, the water record came to an end, being severed from the pre-emptions to which it belonged, and ceased to have any further validity.\nIn my opinion when a water record has been obtained for a pre-emption, and has been acted upon by the making of the necessary ditch, and the enjoyment of the water for the purposes of the land, the water record or right thereby becomes appurtenant to the pre-empted land. That being so when the pre-emption was surrendered to the Crown the water right passed with it without any express act or mention; see Williams on Real Property (ed. 1892), p. 391, and authorities there cited. And for the same reason when the pre-emption was granted again the water right passed with it to the grantees. By section 25 of the Act it is provided that on the death of a pre-emptor his representatives must prove title and enter into possession within one year; otherwise the pre-emption with all improvements shall be forfeited to the Crown. There is no mention of water records, that being regarded, as I think it is in law and in fact, one of the improvements, and a most important improvement of the land, and appurtenant thereto.\nSuppose the case of a pre-emptor with a water record dying without heirs, could it be supposed for a moment either that the water right lapsed and did not pass to the Crown with the land or that the Crown had lost its priority? Or suppose that a pre-emptor with a water right in operation, and, having made improvements, abandoned possession, whereby his pre-emption became forfeited and vested in the Crown, would the water right not also vest in the Crown, as an appurtenance to the land, the same as all other improvements?\nBesides all this, the amending Act of 1886, ch. 10, sec. 1, expressly provides that all assignments and transfers of any pre-emption right when permitted by law shall be construed to convey and transfer any and all recorded water privileges in any manner attached to or used in the working of the pre-empted land. Can it be said that what was called a surrender or abandonment was not an assignment or transfer?\nIt is further objected that Vaughan and McInnes made false statements in their joint affidavit in support of their joint application. The statements referred to are (1) that the land was unoccupied and unreserved Crown land within the meaning of the \"Land Act,\" and (2) that they had staked off and marked the land in accordance with the provisions of the \"Land Act, 1884.\" It must be admitted that these statements were not strictly accurate. In making affidavits they followed the statutory form in such cases, but the statements were not intended to mislead the commissioner and did not and could not mislead him, for he knew all the facts. In a certain sense also the statements were true. The lands were in fact unreserved and they had been unoccupied by any one except the applicants, and they had also been staked off and marked by them, in order to obtain their previous pre-emptions.\nI think there is nothing in this objection.\nIt is also objected that when Vaughan and McInnes on the 15th November, 1884, made application for their joint record, they were not qualified to do so, as required by section 43 of the Act, inasmuch as they were not then lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating lands. The section, however, does not say that the application may not be made before occupation or cultivation. It is at the time of the record that there must be occupation and cultivation, and it is not disputed that there were both occupation and cultivation at the date of the record. But if there had been any irregularity in obtaining the record it would seem to be cured by section 3 of the amending Act.\nUpon the whole I am for these reasons of opinion that the record of Vaughan and McInnes was not invalid or lost for any of the reasons alleged, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs both here and below, and that the judgment at the trial should be restored.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The controversy in this appeal concerns the rights claimed by the appellants and respondents respectively under two water records purporting to be granted under the British Columbia \"Land Act\" of 1884, as amended by ch. 10 of the Act of 1886. The record, under which the appellant's claim, is dated the 20th of January, 1888, that under which the respondents claim, the 25th of March, 1889. Two questions are raised by the contentions of the parties which are pure questions of law and may, I think, at the outset be conveniently considered as such without reference to the facts of the case. The first of these ques- tions is whether or not a record authorizing the diversion of water (under section 43 of the Act of 1884), for use in the cultivation of a pre-emption creates a right which is defeasible upon the cancellation or abandonment of the pre-emption.\nThe second question is whether or not under the Act, such a record can be validly granted to two persons jointly each of whom is the holder of a several pre-emption, authorizing the diversion of water for use indifferently in the cultivation of the land embraced within the two pre-emptions.\nThe statutory provisions material to the consideration of these questions may be most conveniently referred to in the consolidation of 1888, where they appear as sections 39 to 50 of chapter 66. The first and leading provision (section 43 of the Act of 1884, section 39 in the consolidation) is in these words:\n39. Every person lawfully entitled to hold land under this Act, or under any former Act and lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating lands, may record and divert so much and no more of any unrecorded and unappropriated water from the natural channel of any stream, lake or river adjacent to or passing through such land, for agricultural or other purposes, as may be reasonably necessary for such purpose, upon obtaining the written authority of the commissioner of the district to that effect, and a record of the same shall be made with him, after due notice, as herein mentioned, specifying the name of the applicant, the quantity sought to be diverted, the place of diversion, the object thereof, and all such other particulars as such commissioner may require. For every such record the commissioner shall charge a fee of two dollars; and no such person shall have any exclusive right to the use of such water, whether the same flow naturally through or over his land, except such record shall have been made and such fee paid.\nOf this enactment it is first to be observed that it requires in express terms the application to \"agricultural or other purposes\" of the water which the grantee of a record acquires (under his record) the right to divert; but that it does not expressly provide that the water so diverted shall be used in the cultivation of any specific land. Nevertheless I think this latter requirement is plainly implied; and that the observance of it is one of the conditions of the grant. The section stipulates as a condition upon which alone the applicant may obtain a record that he shall be \"lawfully occuping and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating lands.\" It provides, moreover, that he shall be entitled to\nrecord * * * so much and no more of any unrecorded and unappropriated water * * * for agricultural or other purposes as may be reasonably necessary for such purposes.\nUnless at the time of the application the land is identified, in respect of which the water is to be used, how is the commissioner to measure the applicant's needs; how, in other words, to apply the standard prescribed by the statute? This measuring of the applicant's requirements for the purpose of determining the extent of the grant is obviously the function which above all others it is needful the commissioner should exercise wisely. The broad purpose which the legislature manifestly had before it in enacting these provisons was to secure the fair distribution of the waters of natural rivers and lakes throughout the districts in which they could be made available for the cultivation of land and in operations connected with such cultivation. Therefore the successful applicant is to obtain a record of so much as shall be reasonably necessary for his purposes, but of no more. Observe, however, that, once the question of his requirements has been passed upon by the commissioner and a record has been granted and a ditch constructed with a capacity sufficient to convey the quantity authorized by the record, that quantity is thenceforward, while the record remains in force, withdrawn from the disposi- tion of the commissioner. The water so diverted is appropriated to the purposes nominated by the record and however improvident the grant there is no power to recall it or without the consent of the grantee to devote the water to the benefit of other parts of the district. It was, therefore, of the first importance, it is not too much to say it was vital, to the proper administration of the system that in passing upon any application the commissioner should (in order to determine the reasonable requirements of the applicant) consider his needs in relation to the supply of water available and in comparison with the needs of the locality as a whole. It is hardly necessary to observe that to reach an intelligent judgment upon these points the commissioner must know at the time of the application what was the area and the character of it, in the cultivation of which the water applied for was to be employed.\nThere are other sections of the statute which presuppose the designation by the applicant of some specific land but I will not enter into a particular consideration of them. It seems to me that looking at these provisions as a whole the purpose of the legislature, as I have indicated it, is manifested on the face of them with quite sufficient clearness; and that a construction of them which would authorize the grant of a right to divert water to be applied to agricultural purposes and yet to be held in gross, that is to say, unfettered by any condition requiring the use of it for the benefit of specified land, would very plainly defeat that purpose. That I think\u2014since no difficulty arises from the words the legislature has employed\u2014is a sufficient ground for implying the condition. The second observation upon the provisions in question is that the applicant obtains his record in his character of a person \"lawfully occupying\" land. It would, I think, be trifling with this most necessary stipulation to hold that these words are words of description merely. They import this, that the right to appropriate conferred by the record, while it is a right which is to be used for the benefit of a specific tract, is at the same time vested in the holder of the record not personally, but in his character of lawful occupant of that tract; and I think the provisions of the statute leave no room for doubt that where land is held as a pre-emption then a record granted for use in connection with that land becomes annexed to the pre-emption and where the land is held under a Crown grant the record becomes annexed to the fee. That seems to me to appear sufficiently from section 49 (which was section 1 of the Act of 1886, and is quoted in the margin) as it stands:\n49. All assignments, transfers, or conveyances of any pre-emption right, where the same are or were permitted by law, and all conveyances of land in fee, whether such assignments, transfers or conveyances were or shall be made before or after the passing of this Act, shall be construed to have conveyed and transferred, and to convey and transfer, any and all recorded water privileges in any manner\u2014attached to or used in the working of the land pre-empted or conveyed; and any person entitled by devise or descent to any pre-emption right or land to which any recorded water privilege was attached or enjoyed by the person or persons last possessed or seized, shall also be entitled to such water privileges in connection with the land.\nBut the point is perhaps plainer when the history of that enactment is considered. So far as it touches pre-emptions the section first appeared as section 36 of the Act of 1870 in these words:\n36. All assignments, transfers, or conveyances of any pre-emption right, heretofore or hereafter acquired, shall be construed to have conveyed and transferred, and to convey and transfer, any and\n[page 319]\nall recorded water privileges in any manner attached to or used in the working of the land pre-empted.\nBy the law as declared in that Act the holder of a pre-emption might after the issue of the certificate of improvements transfer his pre-emption by having the transferee entered as the holder of it, the old record being cancelled, and a fresh record being issued in the name of the transferee. In 1875, the Act of 1870 was repealed and a new Act substituted. The new Act prohibited the transfer of pre-empted land before the issue of the Crown grant. The legislature\u2014thinking apparently that in consequence of this change section 36 had become obsolete\u2014eliminated that section; and thus the statute stood until 1886. In August, 1885, the well\u2014known case of Carson v. Martley[12] was argued before the full court, at Victoria; and, in consequence of the discussion which occurred in that case, the section we are now considering was passed. At the trial Begbie C.J. had expressed the opinion that a water record could not be held in gross. In the full court this opinion does not appear to have been questioned, but it seems to have been thought that a water record held by a pre-emptor who had transferred his pre-emption after the passing of the Act of 1875\u2014that is to say, after the express repeal of section 36 (above quoted) of the \"Land Act of 1870\"\u2014would not, because of the repeal of that section, pass to the transferee under such a transfer; and McCreight J., in delivering the judgment of the court[13], said:\nIt becomes unnecessary, therefore, to inquire into the nature of a water privilege under the \"Land Acts,\" and whether it amounts to more than a license or personal privilege incapable of transfer. At the next session of the legislature, the section in question (section 1 of chapter 10 of 1886, section 49 of the consolidation) was enacted; and it bears unmistakable marks of its origin. For the most part it is declaratory and retrospective; and in so far as it is otherwise (as in dealing with the rights of persons entitled by descent or devise) it will be seen that the enactment is merely the concrete logical result of the theory upon which the legislative declarations are based. What is this theory\u2014this view of the legislature respecting the state of the existing law? Is it not obviously that the right to divert water for use upon a specified tract of land when conferred by the grant of a record under the \"Land Act\" is and has always been a right appurtenant to the preemption when the land is held under pre-emption and appurtenant to the fee where the land is held in fee simple? In Martley v. Carson[14] the question had just been raised: Is a record a non-assignable personal right or does it pass with a transfer of the land in connection with which it is held or used? And the answer was a legislative affirmation that it did so pass and always had so passed.\nThe opposite view advanced by Mr. MacDonald and rejected by the court below\u2014that the right conferred by a record may be a right in gross a right that is to say unfettered by any term requiring the application to any specified land of the water appropriated under it\u2014is a view not only incompatible with the legislation to which I have just referred, but which, moreover, is out of harmony with the general course of legislation in British Columbia upon the subject of water rights. The legislation with which we are here particularly concerned relates to the appropriation of water in natural streams to the purposes of agriculture; but the parallel legislation relating to the use of water for mining purposes (which specifically deals with the questions arising in this action) marks even more unequivocally perhaps the trend of legislative policy as touching this aspect of such rights. The \"Mineral Act\" at an early date declared that a record authorizing the diversion of water for use in mining should be a record appurtenant to a particular claim (or claims grouped under the special provisions of the mining law) and provided that upon the abandonment of a claim the appurtenant water record should lapse with it. Indeed the essential principle which from the beginning characterized these statutory rights whatever the purpose for which they were to be exercised is, I think, accurately embodied in the Act of 1897. That Act, while reproducing the provision of the \"Mineral Act\" just mentioned, applies the same principle to records held or used in connection with the pre-emptions; and declares in express terms that such records shall cease upon the cancellation or abandonment of the pre-emptions to which they are appurtenant; and this as I have already said seems to have been the principle upon which the legislation of 1870 proceeded.\nIt is perhaps worth while observing that while the policy of enabling persons other than riparian owners to acquire rights in the waters of natural streams was probably suggested by the example of the Pacific states yet the development of legislation in British Columbia in respect of such rights has not been at all along lines parallel to those upon which the law has proceeded in most of the states referred to. Speaking broadly, in the American states the law on the subject started from the principle that water in natural streams is publici juris and early recognized a right of appropriation by virtue of which the first comer might acquire an exclusive right to a reasonable portion of such water (so far as it should not be in use for a beneficial purpose) by the simple process of diverting it and applying it himself to any such purpose. In some states this right is recognized to the exclusion of riparian rights, in others both classes of rights exist side by side; but in all the states I think the appropriation of such water by the simple application of it to a beneficial use for purposes not directly relating to or connected with the occupation of specific land (e.g., supplying the inhabitants of a town) was for a long period and in many of them still is sanctioned and protected by law; and consequently the dependency of such rights upon a specific interest in land is not in those states a characteristic of them. It appears accordingly that usually the right to divert water is not, in the states referred to, held as an easement appurtenant to land; and one even finds it held in a series of decisions in Colorado that such a right is incapable of being made appurtenant to land and that this view is professedly based upon the principles of the common law; one must here observe, however, that both the right to divert water from a stream and the right to take and carry water from and over the land of another are well-known easements which are commonly and quite validly granted at common law as appurtenant to a dominant tenement.\nFrom the beginning on the other hand the British Columbia legislature has been at pains to declare in unmistakable language (and doubtless not without a view of emphasizing the difference between the two systems) that the exclusive right to the use of water in natural streams and lakes could be acquired only in the statutory mode and for the statutable purposes; the statutable purposes were, prior to the year 1892 (if we except those sanctioned by certain statutes having a private or local application only), the purposes described by the words \"agriculture and other purposes\" and \"mining and other purposes.\" These words taken by themselves are no doubt sufficiently comprehensive to embrace any lawful purpose; but it is quite obvious that speaking generally a grant of water rights could have no practical effect which should not authorize the interference to some extent at least with riparian rights; and when we look at the form of land grant prescribed by the \"Land Act\" from the earliest times we find that while it contains a reservation which constitutes a license to the Crown to create \"water privileges\" to the prejudice of the grantee's riparian rights we find at the same time that this license extends to such privileges only as should be used for the two purposes of mining and agriculture.\nThe particular effect of these provisions, therefore, was that the appropriation of the waters of natural streams by private persons under general statutory authority before 1892 was limited by the purposes (mining and agriculture) for which such waters could be diverted without regard to the rights of riparian owners; purposes involving the occupation and working of specific areas of land. And in practice before the year mentioned persons under the necessity of using such waters for other purposes in derogation of riparian rights invariably, I think, resorted to the legislature for special authority. There is, therefore, some danger that error may arise from reading particular legislative enactments of British Columbia touching the subject of water rights in the light of American decisions; a much safer guide to the meaning of the legislature is the general trend of provincial legislation as shewn by the enactments relating to different branches of that subject and the course of administrative practice under them.\nFrom these views it follows that the right conferred by a record granted or used in connection with a pre-emption is defeasible on the abandonment or cancellation of the pre-emption, unless it can be maintained that such a right is annexed to the absolute allodial title vested in the Crown for the benefit of such persons as may acquire rights in it whether in succession to the pre-emptor or (after the lapse of the pre-emption) direct from the Crown. This would be to say, of course, that a record attached to an abandoned pre-emption may lie dormant for years and then suddenly spring into life and assume priority over and destroy the value of rights which had all the while been in active operation. Such a construction of these provisions if adopted would tend rather to embarrass and retard than to foster the conservation and useful application of the natural water supply which these enactments were undoubtedly intended to promote. I am disposed to think it is too late after a period of forty years to give effect to a view of them which is out of harmony with the object for which they were devised, which I do not think has ever before been suggested and would almost certainly in the case of many of the older records of hitherto unquestioned priority affect that priority with doubt and suspicion and establish a basis for adverse attacks which under the accepted view of the statute there could have been no ground to apprehend.\nFrom all I have said it results that the first of the questions above stated should be answered in the affirmative; and I think the same considerations lead to the conclusion that the second question should be answered in the negative.\nAs I have observed, in 1870 the legislature by a declaratory enactment established the principle that water privileges attached to or used in connection with the working of pre-empted land should be deemed to have passed and to pass by any transfer of such land under the \"Land Act\"; in 1886, this declaratory enactment was re-enacted by the legislature with a further provision that any such record should pass to any person or persons who should become entitled to the pre-emption by descent or devise; and I have also indicated that, in my view, the Act of 1897 merely expressed the effect of the law as it stood before that Act in providing that on the cancellation or abandonment of a pre-emption any record appurtenant thereto should be deemed to be at an end. These provisions do not seem easily reconcilable with the view that a single record can be made appurtenant to two several pre-emptions held under distinct titles. That view as Drake J. pointed out in Centre Star Mining Co. v. British Columbia Southern Railway Co.[15] would, if put into practice, lead to much confusion and many inconveniences; and I do not think it correctly represents the law of British Columbia.\nFrom these views of the law it follows I think that this appeal should be dismissed on both the grounds upon which Mr. Taylor supported the judg- ment below: 1st. that the record in question if not void ab initio had lapsed by reason of the cancellation or abandonment of the pre-emptions in respect of which it was originally granted; and 2ndly. that it was void ab initio as having been granted in respect of two several pre-emptions held by two several pre-emptors.\nThe facts in evidence I think establish the cancellation of the pre-emptions.\nIt is admitted that Vaughan and McInnes, each of whom was the separate holder of one of two adjoining pre-emptions, wished to unite these pre-emptions and hold the land in a single block. The law required that each must by himself or an agent continuously reside upon his own pre-emption, and they each should do upon this pre-emption, improvements of a value prescribed by the statute. The statute, however, contained provisions by which two persons in partnership might take up, in one area, a quantity of land equal in extent to two pre-emptions and as partners reside upon any part or improve any part for the behoof of the whole. Vaughan and McInnes wished to get the benefit of this provision and transform their separate holdings into a single partnership holding. There was, under the statute, one, and only one, way in which this could be done; and the evidence is, to my thinking, too clear to admit of dispute that the appellants took that way. They could abandon or procure the cancellation of the existing pre-emptions and take up the same land in partnership as a single pre-emption under the provisions mentioned; and this, I say, it seems to me clear they did. The undisputed facts (of the persons concerned one only, the appellant Vaughan, could be called as a witness) are that the appellants having in view the purpose I have mentioned, went to the office of the commissioner, and that, on the 28th October, the commissioner wrote upon the existing pre-emption records \"abandoned,\" with the date and his initials; that the appellants made the statutory affidavit required to enable them to obtain a record of the same land as a partnership pre-emption in accordance with their plan, in which they stated under oath that the land was \"vacant and unoccupied,\" and that the record was accordingly made. The appellants obtained a Crown grant based upon this record, having occupied the lands as a partnership pre-emption.\nThese facts are, I think, quite sufficient to support the inference which the court below drew from them, viz., that the appellants before obtaining their partnership record had abandoned the pre-emptions held by them separately.\nThe oral evidence of the appellant Vaughan helps the appellants very little; but it makes clear beyond all question that, for the purpose mentioned, the appellants assented that their individual pre-emptions should be treated as abandoned and cancelled and on the faith of that assent the commissioner issued a partnership pre-emption under which they thenceforward occupied the land and upon the basis of which they obtained a grant of it from the Crown. When one considers the character of the functions performed by the commissioner under the \"Land Act,\" it seems almost too clear for argument that it is not now open to the appellants in such circumstances to contend that notwithstanding the record of the partnership pre-emption the individual pre-emptions were in force when the application for the partnership record was made. Mr. Macdonald quite frankly admitted that there must have been at least a punctum temporis when the appellants had no right or interest in the land; and that seems to be so plain a result of the facts that I will not dwell upon the point. On what ground then can it be supposed that during this interregnum the appellants had in the lands any right of occupation which the law can recognize? The fundamental condition of the change of tenure which they sought and which they obtained was their affirmation that there had been such an abandonment of all right of occupation and of all occupation in fact as brought the lands within the category of lands subject to be taken up under section 3 of the \"Land Act,\" that is to say, \"unoccupied and unreserved\" Crown lands.\nIt is a principle of some importance that where the legislature has confided to a special tribunal the determination of a question or a class of questions the decision of that tribunal within the scope of its duty is (in the absence of fraud or of mistake of law apparent on the face of the proceedings) conclusive. The decision of the commissioner upon an application to him for the cancellation of a pre-emption record under the \"Land Act\" is, I think, within the rule; from it there is, by the statute, an appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, but (subject to the exceptions mentioned) it is I think final in default of such appeal. By it, moreover, the status of the land with reference to the operation of the provisions of the \"Land Act\" as Crown land or as occupied land is fixed. By the act of the commissioner the land in question became unoccupied Crown land within the meaning of the \"Land Act\"; and, if the view I have already expressed (touching the dependency of the record upon the existing pre-emptions) be correct, any right acquired by the appellants under that record then ceased.\nAs to the second ground it is admitted that at the time of the grant of the record the appellants occupied their land in two several pre-emptions; but it is suggested that it was within the province of the commissioner to determine whether their interest in this land was such as to entitle them to a record in respect of it and that, this having been determined, his decision cannot now be reviewed. I do not think this quite meets the point. Speaking broadly, the decision, as I have already said, of the commissioner upon any matter within his province is (subject to the exceptions indicated) not reviewable except through the means provided by the statute; but, if the commissioner profess to do that which the statute does not authorize him to do, he could not validate his unauthorized act by putting an erroneous construction upon the statute from which his powers are derived. Now the record granted to the appellants does not on its face indicate any particular land in respect of which the water appropriated under it was to be used; and if that land could not be identified so that the record must be read as a grant in gross, then, in the view I have taken of the statute, it is obvious the record must be void as a grant not authorized by the statute. I do not think it is on this ground void because upon the undisputed facts there is no difficulty in identifying the land; but among the facts which it is necessary to take note of in order to identify the land is the fact that appellants were holding and occupying a certain area under two several pre-emptions and it is to this area that we must, in order to meet the objection just indicated, attribute the record. In other words (if it is to be treated as a record not invalid as a grant in gross), it is on its face a record appurtenant to two several pre-emptions held under distinct titles, or one which, in my view of the statute, the commissioner had no power to grant.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal fails. A good deal has been said about the hardship inflicted upon the appellants by the decision below. Hardship is not necessarily attended by injustice; the truth is, that a failure to comply with the statutory conditions of statutory rights often results as do other kinds of improvidence in individual loss; but when such lapses give rise to litigation (and they are a considerable source of the litigation arising out of the administration of the laws governing the acquisition of rights of various kinds in the public lands) judicial efforts to mitigate the seeming hardship of particular cases by departing from settled paths rarely fails to lead to general confusion and in the end I think not seldom to injustice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: D.

The execution debtor, named in the second writ, had made a bargain for the purchase of the hull subject to the price being paid before delivery, but had not paid the price nor had the property been delivered into his possession. Subsequently, the bailiff adjudicated the hull to the appellant by judicial sale at auction.\nHeld, that there had been no valid seizure under the second writ; that the purchaser acquired no title to the property, by the adjudication, and the sale to him should be rescinded; that, under the circumstances, there could be no application of the maxim \"en fait de meubles possession vaut titre\" and that the maxim \"main de justice ne dessaisit pas\" must be taken subject to the qualification that a seizure under judicial process places the goods seized beyond the control of an execution debtor.

Chase-Casgrain K.C. and Alex, Casgrain for the appellant.\nErrol Languedoc for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench for the Province of Quebec, sitting at Montreal, confirming (Boss\u00e9 and Blanchet JJ. dissenting), a judgment of the. Superior Court (Archibald J.) by which a sale of movables purporting to have been made under judicial process was set aside. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe facts out of which the suit arose are few, and, as found by the court below, offer, in my opinion, little or no difficulty in the appreciation of their legal consequences.\nIn July, 1906, the respondents, marine underwriters, sold to one L\u00e9gar\u00e9 the hull of the steamer \"Sovereign,\" then lying partially destroyed by fire in the Lachine Canal, a condition of the sale being \"cash before delivery.\" It appears that, in violation of his agreement, L\u00e9gar\u00e9 entered into possession of the hull which he proceeded to dismantle; whereupon the respondents, as unpaid vendors, took an action against him to set the sale aside, and joined to their action a conservatory attachment. While the hull was under seizure and in the custody of the guardian in that case, one Griffin, a judgment creditor of L\u00e9gar\u00e9, attached, or rather assumed to attach, under a writ of execution issued long previously, the hull, which the bailiff subsequently purported to sell under the authority of this writ to the appellant; and the present action is brought to set that sale aside. The appellant relies upon arts. 668 C.P.Q. and arts. 1490, 2005 (a) and 2268 of the Civil Code, and says that, in the absence of an allegation of fraud and collusion in the declaration the plaintiffs, now respondents, cannot succeed. The two courts below found that fraud was proved, although not alleged in the declaration; but I prefer to maintain the judgment on the ground that no valid seizure of the hull was made in the case of Griffin v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and that, not having been taken in execution, there could be no sale of the hull \"under execution,\" or \"under authority of law,\" in that case, as required by the articles above referred to. I appreciate the importance of giving effect to the maxim en fait de meubles possession vaut titre (2268 C.C.), and of maintaining the validity of a judicial sale and I freely concede that irregularities of procedure should not invalidate the title of a purchaser in good faith of movables at a judicial sale (art. 668 C.P.Q.). But there is another principle of at least equal importance which is a necessary part of the judicial system of every British country, to this effect, that no man shall be deprived of his property except by consequence of the law of the land. The general principle of law is (art. 1487 C.C.) that the sale of a thing which does not belong to the seller is null; by way of exception to this general rule arts. 1490 and 2268 C.C. provide, in effect, that corporeal movables sold under authority of law cannot be reclaimed. The commentators on the articles in the Code Napol\u00e9on, which correspond with the articles of the Quebec Civil Code\u2014there being no article in the French Code which corresponds with art. 668 C.P.Q.\u2014say that this exception to the general rule is based upon the maxim en fait de meubles, possession vaut titre. Planiol, vol. 1, no. 1119. But the same author says, at no. 1124:\nLa possession vaut titre. Il faut donc \u00eatre possesseur. Ceci exclut les personnes qui n'ont pas encore la possession; par exemple Vacheteur \u00e0 qui la chose n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e. Cet acheteur ne peut pas invoquer la maxime \u00e0 son profit.\nHere the sale was made \"cash before delivery\" to L\u00e9gar\u00e9, the defendant in Griffin v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9, and the hull of the steamer \"Sovereign\" was, at the time of the seizure and sale in this case, undoubtedly the property of the respondents, notwithstanding the clandestine acts of possession exercised by L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and, further, was then attached and sous-main de justice, in the case of Booker et al. v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9. Admittedly, as said by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, in his dissenting judgment, main de justice ne dessaisit pas; but that legal maxim must be read according to Pothier with this qualification:\nLa saisie ex\u00e9cution rend les meubles indisponibles et restreint, sans toutefois le supprimer, le droit qu'a le saisi d'en jouir comme propri\u00e9taire. Le saisi ne peut ni les ali\u00e9ner, ni les mettre en gage, ni les pr\u00eater, ni. les d\u00e9truire, d\u00e9placer ou d\u00e9tourner d'une fa\u00e7on quelconque \u00e0 peine de poursuite correctionnelle.\nIn my view of the case, this point does not require to be further elaborated. The substantial defect in the appellants' title results from the fact that there was no seizure and consequently\u201d no sale under execution\" (art. 668 C.P.Q.), or under \"authority of law,\" arts. 1490 and 2268 C.C. Such a sale necessarily implies that the thing sold must be placed for that purpose by legal process in the hands of justice; plac\u00e9 sous main de justice, to use the very expressive French phrase; and I agree absolutely with the two courts below that it is impossible to hold on the facts that a valid seizure was made in the case of Griffin v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9, assuming the hull to have been in the possession of L\u00e9gar\u00e9. Describing how a seizure is made, La Coutume cle Paris, tome 8, nos. 2 and 3, says:\nLa justice entre dans la maison du d\u00e9biteur, elle prend et gage ses meubles et apr\u00e8s l'en avoir dessaisi pour en faire un gage de justice, elle en exige la vente pour payer le saisissant.\nAnd Judge Taschereau says, at page 94 (b) of the case:\nQu'est-ce qu'une saisie? Il faut, apr\u00e8s tout, qu'il y a\u00eet un acte mat\u00e9riel par l'officier saisissant pour mettre la chose saisie sous la main de la justice. Si, d'une part, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il porte la main sur les objets saisis, d'autre part il faut quelque chose de plus qu'une op\u00e9ration purement intellectuelle ou imaginaire. On n'a jamais pr\u00e9tendu qu'un huissier pouvait faire une saisie du fond de son \u00e9tude.\nIt cannot be said that in this case the hand of justice was ever laid upon the hull of the steamer under the second seizure. Marsan, the seizing bailiff, says that he stood, when he professed to make his seizure, on the bank of the canal 500 or 600 feet distant from the hull, and his recors, Hanraty, puts the distance at 500 yards. Then Beaudoin, the new guardian in the case of Booker et al. v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9, swears that, at the time the seizure is supposed to have been made, he was on or near the hull and he never saw the bailiff Marsan or his assistant,. Hanraty, and, in this statement, he is corroborated by Rivet and Barbarie, p\u00e8re. To reverse the findings of two courts and hold that a bailiff might, under such circumstances, make a valid seizure to which he could appoint a guardian would be, in my opinion, to establish a most dangerous precedent. The seizure of movable property must be recorded by minutes made by the bailiff intrusted with the writ of execution (art. 629 C.P.Q.) and these minutes must contain a detailed description of the things seized, their number, weight, and measure, according to their nature (art. 639 C.P.Q.). How could the bailiff give these necessary details in a proper case under the conditions described by the witnesses here? To every seizure a guardian is appointed who is bound under pain of coercive imprisonment to produce at the time fixed for the sale the effects seized which were placed in his charge (arts. 657, 658 C.P.Q.). How can it be said that the guardian was ever put in possession of this hull? What sort of possession could a guardian have when he never went nearer than 600 feet to the thing seized, the waters of the canal covering the intervening space? I agree unhesitatingly with the trial judge and with the majority in appeal that no valid seizure was made and that the appellant could not acquire a title from the bailiff in the circumstances. We have been referred to the case of The Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad Co. v. Morris[3], in which it was held that\nwhere a number of shares of railway stock were seized and advertised to be sold in one lot, neither the defendant nor any one interested in the sale requesting the sheriff to sell the shares separately, and such shares were sold for an amount far in excess of the judgment debt for \"which the property was taken in execution, such sale in the absence of proof of collusion was held good and valid. I do not for one moment intend to cast any doubt upon that judgment. In that case the question of the validity of the seizure was not considered and could not have arisen. So much was this the case that in the Superior Court and in the court of appeal, art. 668 C.P.Q. (then art. 559 C.P.C.) was not even referred to[4]. The effect of that article seems to have been considered in that case for the first time in this court. But the cases are clearly distinguishable. In Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad Co. v. Morris[5], the shares were admittedly properly seized and advertised to be sold in one lot and neither the defendant nor any one interested in the sale requested the sheriff to sell the shares separately, and it did not appear that there was any intention to defraud, or that any loss had been sustained in consequence of the shares being sold in one lot, but, on the contrary, that such mode of sale was advantageous to the creditors; the sale was held good and valid, although the amount realized thereby was far in excess of the judgment debt for which the property was taken in execution.\nHere I hold that the hull was never seized and cannot, therefore, be said to have been sold under execution. In Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad Co. v. Morris5, there is a quotation from Bioche \"Dictionnaire de Proc\u00e9dure\" which might mislead. To avoid misunderstanding I quote the whole paragraph from which the words are taken:\nL'inobservation des formalit\u00e9s prescrites par les art. 617, 618 et 619 (V. sup. nos. 297 \u00e0 301), n'entra\u00eene pas la nullit\u00e9 de la vente; on ne peut d\u00e9pouiller des adjudicataires de tonne foi; mais elle soumet le saisissant et l'officier minist\u00e9riel aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats du saisi et des autres cr\u00e9anciers, si elle leur a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice. Chau-veau, 19,408; Pigeau, Com. 2,207; Demiau, 408; Biret, 2,169; Thomine, 2,132. The formalities prescribed by arts. 617, 618 and 619 refer to the place of sale and the advertisement and not to the seizure or preliminary step of taking in execution.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014I have some doubts in this case, but they are not strong enough to induce me to dissent.\nIdington, Maclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, Mitchell & Curveyer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Greenshields, Greenshields & Languedoc.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 193.\n[2] Q.R. 32 S.C. 142.\n[3] 14 Can.

At the trial the action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Archibald, but his judgment was reversed and the plaintiffs' action was maintained and the damages assessed at |250, with costs, by the judgment from which the present appeal was asserted.\nThe questions raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and A. W. P. Buchanan K.C. for the appellants.\nT. Chase-Casgrain K.C. and G. Desaulniers for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with the opinion stated by Duff J.\nGirouard J. (dissenting)\u2014We are here brought face to face with a social and political problem, the liberty of the press in Quebec.\nA weekly newspaper, Le Nationaliste, of Montreal, brought a direct charge of blackmailing against Le Moniteur du Commerce, a weekly review of trade and finance also published in Montreal; and invited the latter to prosecute it in order that it might have an opportunity of proving the truth of the accusation. The Moniteur immediately brought an action for libel, of which we do not know the results. The Montreal Gazette, one of the principal daily newspapers of the country, announced the fact that the suit had been brought, and gave a summary of the declaration or statement of claim as fyled. This summary must have been satisfactory to the proprietor of the Moniteur, since he has not made any complaint on the subject though he is proved to have read it.\nSome days later the Nationaliste served upon the plaintiff its plea of justification, containing some twelve pages of printed matter, in which it gave the names of the banks and business houses that had been made the victims of the alleged blackmailing, and caused it to be fyled in the office of the court in the usual manner. Six days later, the Moniteur sued the Gazette for libel, alleging the fact of the publication by it of an abstract of this plea, and averring that the defendant had acted with malice and with an intent to injure, without, however, claiming that the plea so published was a document of a private nature.\nAt the hearing before the trial court, and in appeal, as well as before this court, the question of malice does not seem to have perplexed the judges; they all agree that the Gazette acted in good faith, and that the summary published by it of the plea in question was fair, honest, and in the public interest.\nThe whole difficulty of the case is to determine whether this plea is a document of a private or of a public nature. The Court of King's Bench held, contrary to the decision of Mr. Justice Archibald, at the trial, and with Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 dissenting, that the document was of a private nature, and that it would not become public until after it had been read, or, at all events, produced in open court at the trial.\nThis decision is of very great importance for the whole press of the country, and it is not to be wondered at that some have protested most vigorously, while others have given vent to rather extravagant language, which it may be as well to tone down and correct at once. It has been claimed that the press has a right to publish everything which comes before our courts. . It should not be forgotten that it is the publication of such matter only as is of public general interest that comes within the privilege of the press, in Quebec at all events. I am aware that eminent judges in England, whose names will be found in the notes of my learned brother, Mr. Justice Duff, have held that the privilege of the press to publish juridical proceedings may be traced to another order of ideas. According to them, this privilege is based upon the right which the public enjoy of being made acquainted with everything that takes place during the sittings of the courts, and as everybody cannot be present at such sittings, the press comes to the aid of those who are absent by publishing the proceedings, thereby enlarging, as it were, the sphere of usefulness of the courts of justice. According to this theory the press is a kind of good fairy conducting a continuous performance of miracles. By a wave of its wand, it is pictured to us in the act of dissolving the walls which encircle our halls of justice, and of revealing to the public gaze, not only of the country but of the universe, a tableau of everything which may be carried on within.\nThe British law-givers do not seem to have been greatly impressed by this idea, for all the legislation of the past twenty-five or thirty years has re-affirmed the old doctrine that the privilege of the press exists only in cases where the proceedings are of public interest, and that, when it publishes a libel, a defamatory accusation against a private individual, it cannot claim any right other than those which may be invoked in similar cases by an ordinary citizen. In England for at least more than a century\u2014although formerly and perhaps at the time of the cession it was not so, Petersdorff, Abr. (ed. 1029), vol. 12, p. 200\u2014 a defendant may triumph over a suit for damages by pleading and proving the truth of the libel; but, where the proceedings are brought in a court of criminal jurisdiction, the accused must, furthermore, establish that he acted in good faith in a matter of public interest.\nThe press is bound by the same rule. In the Province of Quebec our jurisprudence is more exacting based, as it undoubtedly is, upon the old French law, which lays down as a maxim that la vie priv\u00e9e doit \u00eatre mur\u00e9e; it requires the two conditions of good faith and of public interest in all cases, civil as well as criminal. Nevertheless, the truth of the libel and other extenuating circumstances may be pleaded, if not as a bar to the suit, at all events in mitigation of the damages. Everything depends upon the circumstances. This is the meaning attached to the jurisprudence of Quebec during the past fifty or sixty years, and, in order to become convinced of this, it suffices to read Mignault, vol. 5, pp. 355 and following, where all the numerous precedents on the subject will be found. We hold that the public is not concerned with the private affairs of an individual or of a family, even when they come before the open courts. Unfortunately, the press has woefully trespassed upon private rights of late years, since the publication of scandals and of sensational items has become the fashion. But no question of this kind is raised in the present instance. What is in issue here is not so much the truth of the libel as the right of the press in connection with the publication of juridical proceedings. It is admitted that if the plea fyled by the Nationaliste had been read in open court, there would be no ground of action against the appellant.\nIs the press obliged to await the day of trial before it can justifiably print or publish what is in issue, in other words, what is being done in our courts of justice?\nFormerly, in England, all the proceedings in a law suit were had in open court, issue and return of writ, appearance, fyling of pleas, etc., etc. The great increase of judicial business has revolutionized the system of pleading and procedure. Blackstone (Lewis ed.), vol. 3, pp. 271 and following, and more especially 275, 279, 293. For many years a suit could not be brought here in Canada without leave of the judge, and the issues were always joined in open court. 25 Geo. III. ch. 2 (1785), secs. 1, 6, 8, 11, 13; R.S.L.C. (1845), pp. 85 and following.\nIf the decision of the Court of King's Bench be correct, the publication of every proceeding or pleading would have been privileged under the old law, as it had been fyled in open court; and yet not one single authority or precedent has been referred to by that court to shew that such a practice would be contrary to public order.\nNowadays, when these pleadings may be fyled in the office of the prothonotary in virtue of a law which says that they shall be deemed to have been fyled before the court, how can it be claimed that they are of a private nature? What was done under the old system should aid us in the interpretation of the new, especially as the legislature has not expressed any intention of bringing about any change in this respect.\nSir Henri Taschereau, Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment of the majority of the court, did not refer to article 16 of the Code of Procedure, which was cited before us, and which says that \"the sittings of a court or of a judge are public,\" for the simple reason, probably, that this article does not lay down any new doctrine, but is the mere expression of a rule of English public law which has always been in force here since the cession of the country. Neither does the learned Chief Justice refer to article 1053 of the Civil Code for the purpose of proving that civil offences committed by the press should be judged in accordance with the principles laid down by that article. Apart from the last quoted article, there is no civil law in Quebec on the subject of libel by news-papers, however desirable it may be that legislation of some kind should be passed by the Dominion Parliament, \"for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\" \"British North America Act, 1867,\" sec. 91. According to his lordship, these offences should be judged according to the rules of the common law of England which recognizes that the press enjoys certain privileges that were unknown to the old French law; and, on this point, I agree with the judges of the King's Bench, who merely give expression to the jurisprudence of our province as determined since the decision of Rolland J., in 1848, in Gugy v. Hincks[3], subject, of course, to such modifications as the usages of our people have sanctioned. These privileges formed part of the public law of England which follows the British flag wherever it floats.\nBut I do not concur with the Court of King's Bench when it holds that according to the common law of England the publication of a pleading fyled in the Superior Court is not privileged so long as it has not been produced at the trial in open court. This is doubtless the rule where the statutory law of Great Britain prevails, and, more particularly, the statute of 1888, which restricts the rights of the press to\na fair and accurate report in any newspaper of proceedings publicly heard before any court exercising judicial authority.\nThese statutes have never been enacted in our province and have no force of law here, although Ontario, British Columbia and other provinces have adopted them at least in substance. So much is admitted by the Court of King's Bench. But, says the learned Chief Justice, these statutes are not new law; they are merely the expression of the common law; and he adds:\nThe privileges must be confined to the publication of proceedings in open court, as it was in England, before the \"Libel Act\" came into force, and as it undoubtedly is still under that Act.\nComyn's Digest of the Laws of England, vo. \"Libel\" (5 ed.), p. 872, published in 1822, simply lays down the rule that the publication of judicial proceedings is lawful. Likewise Petersdorfif's Abridgment, vo. \"Libel,\" published in 1829, makes no mention of the \"open court\" rule. Odgers, an unquestionable authority on this subject, who has been quoted by both parties in this case says (ed. 1905), p. 307:\nThe words publicly heard should not have been inserted.\nPollock on Torts (ed. 1908), p. 273, remarks also that this clause of the statute of 1888\nwould seem to be only a not quite accurate affirmance of the common law. But, where is the evidence that the old common law contained any such restriction? By common law I mean the unwritten law, founded upon reason and the usages of the people, and in force in England at the time of the cession of this country. That is the only common law which should govern. Where is this common law to be found? In the decisions of the judges, as contained in the law reports? I have failed to find one single precedent on the point which now interests us, prior or even subsequent to the cession. I do find some decisions rendered about the beginning of the last century, wherein general principles are laid down, and, with all due deference, it seems to me they say quite the reverse of what the Court of King's Bench has said.\nIn England (says the learned Chief Justice), as far back as 1804, (Rex v. Lee)[4], and continually since (with the solitary exception of Curry v. Walter)[5] (since overruled), the publication of an ex parte proceeding in criminal cases was not only regarded as not privileged by law, but as an illegal act in respect of its tendency to obstruct the due course of justice.\nBut this is the very opposite to what really took place. Curry v. Walter5 was approved in Rex v. Wright[6], in 1799, and more recently in Kimber v. The Press Association[7], in 1893. Lawrence J. said in Rex v. Wright6, and I prefer his opinion on the old law, for he lived in those days:\nThe proceedings of courts of justice are daily published, some of which highly reflect upon individuals; but I do not know that an information was ever granted against the publishers of them. Many of these proceedings contain no point of law, and are not published under the authority or the sanction of the courts; but they are printed for the information of the public. Not many years ago, an action was brought in the Court of Common Pleas by Mr. Curry against Walter, proprietor of \"The Times,\" which supposed libel consisted in merely stating a speech made by a counsel in this court on a motion for leave to file a criminal information against Mr. Curry. Lord Chief Justice Eyre; who tried the cause, ruled that this was not a libel, not the subject of an action, it being a true account of what has passed in this court; and in this opinion the Court of Common Pleas afterwards, on a motion for a new trial, all concurred though some of the judges doubted whether or not the defendant could avail himself of that defence on the general issue. Though the publication of such proceedings may be to the disadvantage of the particular individual concerned, yet it is of vast importance that the proceedings of courts of justice should be universally known. The general advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public, more than counterbalances the inconvenience to the private persons whose conduct may be the subject of such proceedings.\nThere is something more. Odgers says that it was not Curry v. Walter[8] which was overruled, but rather Rex v. Lee[9], and at page 292, he remarks:\nThere are dicta of eminent judges which would seem to deny any privilege to fair arid accurate reports of ex parte proceedings, even in the Superior Courts. Per Maule J. in Hoare v. Silverlock, No. 2,[10], in 1850, and Abbott C.J. in Duncan v. Thwaites[11]. But Curry v. Walter8, is an express decision, that such reports are privileged; a case which was at one time doubted, but is now clear law. Cock-burn C.J., in Wason v. Walter[12], expressed his clear opinion that a fair and accurate report of an ex parte application would be privileged. And, now, the decision in Usill v. Hales[13], settles the law, and extends immunity to all bona fide and correct reports of all proceedings in a magistrate's court, whether ex parte or otherwise; and such cases as R. v. Lee9, must be considered to be overruled, in so far at all events that it is unlawful to publish any report of ex parte proceedings.\nAs far as we are allowed to judge, it seems to me that the old decisions, those which were rendered at a period close to the cession, made no distinction between the report of judicial proceedings in open court and those simply in court. The decision of the Court of Appeal in England, in Kimber v. Press Association[14], has been quoted as having been rendered under the common law against the appellants' contention. And yet it does not sustain the legal proposition of the respondent that, in order to be privileged, the pleading must have been read or produced in open court, that is to say, during term or at least at the sitting of the court. In that case, the proceedings were held in council chamber where the clerk had called the justices of the peace together for the purpose of obtaining ex parte the issuance of a summons against a solicitor for perjury. The public was not excluded, but was not represented, if we may except a reporter\u2014he is everywhere\u2014who made a report to the associated press of what had taken place. It was held that his report was privileged. The Court of Appeal decided that\nwhere there are judicial proceedings before a properly constituted judicial tribunal exercising its jurisdiction in open court, then the publication, without malice, of a fair and accurate report of what takes place before that tribunal is privileged.\nLord Esher added:\nThe common law, on the ground of public policy, recognises that there may be greater danger to the public in allowing judicial proceedings to be held in secret than in suffering persons for a time to rest under an unfounded charge or suggestion.\nThe learned judges explain that by the words \"open court\u201d must be understood not only the place where the sittings are held, but any place where the court exercises its jurisdiction, and from which the public is not excluded.\nIs it essential that this jurisdiction be exercised by the same functionaries, that is to say, by the judges who finally decide the issues? It seems to me the assertion is neither reasonable nor practicable under our juridical system.\nAmerican precedents have been cited adversely to the appellant. I admit that if they had been rendered under a Code of Procedure similar to that of the Province of Quebec where the action, the declaration, the defence, and all the pleadings before the trial are supposed to be fyled before the court, they would be of great weight; but we must decide this cause according to the rules and principles which we find in the Code of Procedure of that province.\nWe come now to a second question: Is the prothonotary's office an office distinct from the court? Article 76, C.P.Q., says that a suit is brought before the proper court, while, in practice, it issues from and is returned to and fyled in the prothonotary's office. See also arts. 117, 118, 151, C.P.Q. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 94 to 103, the writ commands the defendant to appear before the court, and, in the present case, the writ summons the defendant to appear before the court, while, in practice, the defendant fyles his appearance in the office of the prothonotary only. C.P.Q. art. 161. Since he is ordered to appear before the court, it would naturally follow that he should also fyle his defence before the court. C.P.Q., art. 197. It is not every one who has a right to fyle pleadings. They must be accepted by the prothonotary or his representatives in the name of the court which exercises its jurisdiction through them.\nNow it seems to me that everything that takes place before the courts being, as is the case here, of a public and general interest, is public matter and the reports which the press may make thereof and which are fair in substance, and published in good faith and without malice, are privileged.\nRules of practice have been referred to. Such rules concern only the management of the prothonotary's offices, the custody and preservation of the records and archives of the court, and can go no further. They are of no importance when it becomes necessary to decide whether the appellant had or had not the right to publish the pleading in question, for that issue must be decided according to the laws of the land, and not by the rules of practice of the Superior Court.\nFurthermore, the Court of King's Bench gives to rule 36, the only one which can have any application, a much greater scope than its terms import. The rule does not say that communication of the records can be given to the interested parties only, but that these latter shall be entitled to communication thereof in the prothonotary's office. The latter cannot refuse it under any pretext. The rule says nothing about strangers to the cause, nor about the general public, whom the prothonotary may have special grounds to refuse, an order of the judge, for instance, such as is sometimes issued by the courts of other countries. Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law, vol. 24, pp. 182, 183, par. VIII.\nThe judge may, it is true, prohibit the inspection of the pleadings or of the whole record, in the interest of good morals or public order, just as he may exclude the public from the sittings of the court, even in a case of public interest. C.P.Q. art. 16. As a rule, the records of courts of justice are public documents. Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law, vol. 24, pp. 159, 160, 161, 170; Odgers, pp. 295, 296. If a newspaper makes a wrongful use thereof, if it gives them to the public when private interests alone are at stake, for instance, in cases of seduction, filiation, separation from bed and board (although, even in such cases, there may be exceptions where public men are concerned), if it makes public, I say, facts or private acts which are entirely of a personal nature, with which the public is not at all concerned, it does so at its risk, and peril, and cannot claim immunity.\nIn this case, the interest of the public cannot be put in doubt; this much is admitted. The subject matter is the honesty of a newspaper which is accused of blackmailing. The reporter of the Gazette, Duteau, did not surreptitiously obtain from the prothonotary's office the plea the publication whereof is made the basis of this action. He was even invited by one of the officers in charge to take cognizance of it, to take notes from it, and his notes are admitted to be correct This is what is said by him in his testimony:\nWell, on the day previous to the publication of the article, I came to the prothonotary's office here, as I do every day, and I inquired if there was anything doing: and one of the deputy prothonotaries told me that Mr. Asselin has fyled his defence in connection with the action that was taken against him by Mr. Shallow, whereupon I inquired if I could see the defence, and I obtained the document, and made an abstract of it, and wrote it out.\nThis simple story shews that in the opinion of these two officials, the pleading in question was a public document which the press and the public had a right to see, when no order to the contrary had been given.\nThis is all the evidence there is on the subject, and it might, and doubtless would have been made stronger if the respondent had alleged in his action, or in his answer to plea, that the records of the Superior Court before being read in open court, are private and not public documents. Not only has the respondent not said this, but he has left the contrary to be inferred by his answer to plea.\nFinally, should the court of appeal allow a plaintiff to make use of a reason which is not set out in his demand, and which he virtually thrust to one side for the purpose of bringing a charge of malice against his adversary. If the plea in question had not been read or produced at the trial and was private should he not have alleged the fact in order to take advantage of it? He charges malice only, which has not been proved. In fact, the contrary has been established. He goes even further in his answer to plea, and avers that the Gazette did not obtain its information from the records of the court, meaning that it was obtained out of court, being evidently under the impression that that source of information would be different, a distinction which is clearly made by the Quebec Court of King's Bench in Archambault v. Great N.W. Telegraph Co.[15]. Here it was held that the publication of an abstract from the declaration is a suit entered, but before the return of the action, is not privileged. The text of the formal judgment upon the point is in these terms:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e, n'a pas justifi\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de ses d\u00e9fenses, et sp\u00e9cialement qu'elle n'a pas prouv\u00e9 que la d\u00e9claration dans la cause No. 1479 de Dame Henrietta Sylvia Andrews v. Frs. Xavier Archambault, dat\u00e9e le 20 de f\u00e9vrier 1883, et rapportable et rapport\u00e9e en cour seulement le 14 de mars 1883, form\u00e2t partie des archives de la court, f\u00fbt ouverte au public, \u00e0 la date de la transmission par la d\u00e9fenderesse du t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme en question.\nThe only inference which can be drawn from this decision is that the publication of such an extract after the return of the action and the fyling of the declaration in the prothonotary's office would be privileged.\nThe Court of King's Bench seeks to follow the common law of England. What is to be understood by that? Where is this common law to be found, the common law which was followed at the time of the cession of this country to England, one hundred and fifty years ago? Blackstone (Lewis ed.), vol. 1, par. 65, tells us that the common law is the unwritten law Which takes its strength from immemorial usage, and which may be found in the reported judgments of the courts; but it strikes me that these reports must, be constant and uniform in order to have force of law. Again, how can we look for uniformity when we consider that the public has repeatedly altered its customs and usages on this subject, according to varying circumstances, without waiting for any action on the part of the legislature?\nLord Coleridge said that if he had had to decide the case then before him according to the principles recognized sixty or seventy years earlier, his conclusion would have been different. Odgers (ed. 1905), p. 293. Pollock on Torts (ed. 1908), p. 259, asserts that the modern decisions of the Court of Appeal are far from agreeing with those of former days, and that we will have to wait until the House of Lords has spoken upon the subject in order to know what to hold.\nSince the days of the cession journalism has made rapid strides. It has taken hold of every movement of the entire world. A newspaper written to-day as newspapers were edited fifty or sixty years ago (without going as far back as the cession) would not secure a single subscriber. We insist, nowadays, upon news of everything, and from every point\u2014telegraphic despatches, parliamentary reports, political, juridical, religious, municipal, financial, police, industrial, strikes, athletic news; accounts of meetings of companies and of corporations, of trade unions, of sports, of theatricals, and we must also have a personal column, and another for local news, another for social news, town topics, without mentioning caricatures, pictures and wood cut portraits. This is well known. However, the common law does not spread its protecting arms over all these. The change in the law with regard to public meetings was not made in England until 1888, nor in Canada until the Criminal Code was published in 1892. Still, without being protected by a text of law, these reports were published during many years before then. They were called for and screened by public opinion. As Lord Campbell observes in Lewis v. Levy[16]:\nThe law upon such a subject must bend to the approved usages of society though still resting upon the same principle, that what is hurtful and indicates malice should be punished, and that what is beneficial and bona fide should be protected.\nMay we not reach the conclusion, from all that has preceded, that the usages of our people have entirely changed on the subject of the press, and what one has a right to expect from it? Can we reasonably exact from the newspapers anything more than fairness, good faith, honesty and public interest, elements which are not put in doubt in this case? Such is the conclusion which has been reached by many eminent judges in England. Odgers, 293, 294, 295.\nFinally, to keep to the case which is now before us, it seems to me that the principle laid down in art. 288 of the Criminal Code (see. 320, ch. 146, Revised Statutes of Canada), settles the whole difficulty. This is what the article says:\nNo one commits an offence by publishing any defamatory matter, in any proceeding held before or under the authority of any court exercising judicial authority.\nNo distinction is here drawn between term days and other days. It will not surely be contended that the Superior Court exists upon trial days only; It exists permanently in its offices, before the trial for the incidental and introductory proceedings necessary for the institution, contestation, and hearing of causes, and afterwards, for the execution of its judgments by its officers. The prothonotary, in certain cases, is supposed to represent the court or judge; and in his office he pronounces certain judgments in the name of the court. C.P.Q. arts. 33, 532, 1310.\nArticle 288 of the Criminal Code is not mentioned in the respondent's factum; it has, furthermore, escaped the attention of the Court of King's Bench, with the exception of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, who dissented. With that great judicial discernment which always distinguished him, the learned judge reasons out the question in the following manner:\n(Translation.) The principle of the liberty to publish ex parte proceedings is pushed much further in these countries than is necessary for the purposes of this case, where the publication was made of a contested demand and of a plea to such demand after they had been fyled in the office of the prothonotary of the court. Both were public property, the action itself which was the act of Shallow who complained of a libel that had appeared in the Nationaliste, and the plea, also fyled in the same office, by Asselin, giving his reasons why the action of damages by Shallow should be dismissed. A rule of practice had been cited to establish that communication to any others than the parties themselves or their representatives, should not be given of papers fyled in the office of the court. This rule was established. for the proper administration of the office, and goes no further. It certainly could not go further, or change the law, any more than it could convert the office into a dark chamber where all judicial proceedings would be had in secret.\nFurther on he adds:\nWhere is the law which makes them secret, which enacts that law suits, before they Come to trial in open court, are so very private in their nature that the public has neither an interest nor a right to know what are the contestations which take up the time of the courts, what are the claims, commercial or otherwise, which are recorded, who are insolvent, who are on the point of becoming so, why is it contended that they are so, and what reasons do they offer to shew they are not insolvent? Again, by what authority would we hold that everything in our office, suits as well as pleas, are secret procedures, which no one may disclose to the public under pain of committing a civil offence? It would certainly be pushing things very far to say that a newspaper, accused of blackmailing, which brings an action for damages by reason of such accusation, should have the right, after its action has been returned into court and become public property by the announcement made of the fact by another newspaper, to claim exemplary damages for the publication of the plea to this original action, even before proof has been made or judgment has been rendered in the first suit.\nThe public has a right to know what degree of importance, what reliance and what confidence it should give to a newspaper, and if such newspaper, being accused of lying and blackmailing, claims damages because of the accusation, the public has an equal right to know what defence is being made to the suit. For it must not be forgotten, that Shallow is suing for damages. The fact that he thus sues, and the reasons which led him to sue, were made public by the Gazette. Shallow did not complain of this. He took good care not to do so; but he complains that the Gazette published the plea offered by Asselin to the suit for libel. He wishes that the plea alone should remain unknown, and he bases his action against the Gazette solely upon this one fact.\nTo me it is clearly evident that the facts complained of by the respondent would not warrant the prosecution of the proprietors of the Gazette for libel in a criminal court. This appears to be the formal enactment of the article of the Criminal Code. I cannot conceive with regard to newspapers that what is not a libel from a criminal point of view can be held to be a libel civilly. If a journalist has the right and is in duty bound to note everything which may interest the public within the limits prescribed by law, without being exposed to penal censure, there is still greater reason that he should be immune against any civil condemnation. Such was the opinion that Mr. Justice Johnson expressed in the case of Trudel v. Le Monde[17]:\nThe rights and liberties of the people of Canada completely take out of the category of wrongdoing (culpa), to which alone the article (1053 C.C.) relates, the performance of a public duty in a truthful and honest manner, which is the defendant's case, as they put it.\nIt is well worthy of remark that the Court of Appeal confirmed this view of the matter[18].\nRex v. Wright[19] and Curry v. Walter[20], cited above, are also authorities for the proposition that where the press has privileges, there can be neither criminal action for libel nor civil action for damages. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, a country governed by a Civil Code similar to ours in matters of civil offences, decided in 1891 that\ncommunications in a judicial proceeding are privileged and no person is liable civilly or criminally in any respect for anything published by him in the course of his duty in said proceedings. Gardemal v. McWilliams[21].\nIt is really the case to say that private interests must give way before the public weal.\nSuch is my interpretation of the Criminal Code, whose enactments are on this subject peculiar to our country. For all these reasons I would allow the appeal, restore the judgment of the trial court, and dismiss the plaintiff's action with costs before all the courts.\nIdington and Maclennan JJ. agreed with the opinion stated by Duff J.\nDuff J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether the publication of the statements contained in a pleading filed in the course of a civil action is (merely because such statements form part of such a pleading) a privileged publication within the rule which throws the protection of privilege about fair reports of judicial proceedings. The decision of the question is to be governed by the application of the law of the Province of Quebec; but it was conceded by counsel on both sides that under the law of that province the principles applicable to the particular question in controversy in this appeal do not differ from the principles of the common law.\nThe reason lying at the foundation of the privilege in question is, I think, nowhere more broadly stated than by Mr. Justice Laurence in the following passage which occurs in his judgment in Rex v. Wright[22]:\nThough the publication of such proceedings may be to the disadvantage of the particular individual concerned, yet it is of vast importance to the public that the proceedings of courts of justice should be universally known. The general advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public more than counterbalances the inconveniences to the private persons whose conduct may be the subject of such proceedings.\nThe convenience of individuals is to be made subservient to the interest of the public in the administration of justice\u2014which requires that full publicity shall be given to judicial proceedings\u2014and hence the privilege. But is there any consideration touching the public administration of justice which affects generally with this desideratum of publicity the statements made in pleadings fyled by private litigants in the course of private litigation? I can conceive none. The publicity of proceedings involving the conduct of a judicial authority serves the important purposes of impressing those concerned in the administration of justice with a sense of public responsibility, and of affording every member of the community an opportunity of observing for himself the mode in which the business of the public tribunals is carried on; but no such object would appear to be generally served by applying the privilege to the publication of preliminary statements of claims and defence relating only to private transactions; formulated by the parties themselves; in respect of which no judicial action has been taken, and upon which judicial action may never be invoked. It is only when such preliminary statements or the claims or defences embodied in them form the basis or the subject of some hearing before, or some action by, a court or a judicial officer, that their contents can become the object of any real public concern as touching the public administration of justice.\nIt would seem, therefore, that the appellant's claim of privilege for the publication of a pleading, merely because it is a pleading, cannot be justified upon the broad ground on which the privilege itself is said by Laurence J. to rest; and still less does that claim receive any countenance from the judicial decisions in which the rule has been applied or from the terms in which it has in later cases been judicially expounded. I have not been able to find among the reported decisions in England or in Canada a single case, except this, in which privilege has been claimed as attaching to the report of a judicial proceeding except in respect of an account of a proceeding in open court. Neither can I find any authoritative statement of the rule in which the application of the privilege is not limited either in express terms, or (when the facts under discussion are considered) by plain implication, to reports relating to such proceedings.\nThus in Rex v. Wright[23], Laurence J. is discussing the question whether the privilege is broad enough to protect the publication of reports of parliamentary debates; and while in the passage quoted he uses an equivocal phrase (\"the proceedings of courts of justice\") it is quite evident that he has in his eye proceedings in open court alone.\nIn the more recent cases the limitation is unequivocally expressed. One of the latest in which the rule is defined is Kimber v. The Press Association[24]. The privilege claimed in that case was not based upon the English Act of 1888 (the defendants not being proprietors or publishers of a newspaper, and consequently not within the statute) but upon the common law principle. That principle is thus stated at p. 68 by Lord Esher:\nThe rule of law is that, where there are judicial proceedings before a properly constituted judicial tribunal exercising its jurisdiction in open court, then the publication, without malice, of a fair and accurate report of what takes place before that tribunal is privileged. To the same effect is the language of Lopes L.J., at p. 73:\nThe rule of law founded upon principles of public policy and convenience, is that no action for libel can be maintained in respect of a report of judicial proceedings, taken before persons acting judicially in open court, where the report is a fair and accurate report of those proceedings and published without malice.\nThe Court of Appeal, moreover, in that case treated as a vital point an objection that the proceedings were not in open court. At page 70, Lord Esher says:\nTherefore under that section the justices are acting judicially in a judicial proceeding in considering the application for the issue of a summons and by the law of England the proceeding must be in open court. No order to close the court was made by the justices in the present case and it is clear that the proceedings were in open court.\nAt page 73, Lopes L.J. says:-\nI am therefore of opinion that the objection that this was a report of proceedings not taken in open court fails.\nAnd so Fry L.J., at p. 76:\nI think therefore that the defendant must * * * shew that the matters in respect of which the report was published took place in open court.\nIn Lewis v. Levy[25] Lord Campbell, considering the application of the rule to the publication of an account of a preliminary investigation of a criminal charge before a magistrate, deemed it necessary to examine the question whether the court in which the magistrate sat while conducting the inquiry was \"a public court of justice\"; and, at page 558, this passage occurs:\nBut although a magistrate upon any preliminary inquiry respecting an indictable offence may, if he thinks fit, carry on the inquiry in private, and the publication of any such proceedings before him would undoubtedly be unlawful, we conceive that while he continues to sit foribus apertis, admitting into the room where he sits as many of the public as can be conveniently accommodated, and thinking that this course is best calculated for the investigation of truth and the satisfactory administration of justice (as in most cases it certainly will be) we think the court in which he sits is to be considered a public court of justice.\nThe same learned judge in Davison v: Duncan[26] at page 231, mentions (as one of the safeguards provided by the rule) the fact that \"the proceedings\" in respect of which reports are privileged \"are under the control of the judges.\"\nSo strongly indeed have the courts emphasized the condition that the proceeding reported shall be a proceeding in open court, and so completely has that condition become incorporated in the rule as an essential element of it, that there is a considerable body of opinion of very high authority in support of the view that the rule itself is to be explained as merely intended to effect an extension of the area of the public court; and, a\u00eethough the passage I have quoted from Laurence J. has been accepted by eminent judges as stating truly the common ground upon which rest both the public right to be present in court and the privilege attaching to the publication of what occurs there\u2014still it is perhaps open to doubt whether there is not a greater weight of opinion in favour of resting the privilege upon the first-mentioned or narrower ground. Thus Lord Esher in Macdougall v. Knight & Son[27], at page 639, adopts the opinion which he extracts from the judgment of Lord Campbell (speaking for the Court of Queen's Bench) in Lewis v. Levy[28] that the privilege is based upon the ground that the court is open to the public but cannot hold all the people who may wish to be present and it is for the public benefit that what takes place should be made known to all.\nSpeaking in the same case, in the House of Lords[29], Lord Halsbury says the foundation of the privilege is\nthat judicial proceedings are in this country public and that the publication of what takes place * * * is allowed because such publication is merely enlarging the area of the court.\nIn Stockdale v. Hansard[30], Patteson J. and, in Furniss v. Cambridge Daily News[31], Gorrell Barnes J. give their adherence to the same doctrine.\nThere seems, therefore, to be as little foundation in authority as in principle for this view put forward by the appellants concerning the scope of the privilege; and one may perhaps venture to say that it is with some satisfaction that one arrives at this result. It is, I think, obviously undesirable that, by the simple expedient of commencing an action and filing a claim, anybody should be able to secure to himself the protection of the law in the dissemination of the most outrageous libel. The publication of statements of fact which it is in the public interest to publish and which are hot untrue requires the protection of no privilege, because without any such protection such a publication entails no liability.\nThis view, as applicable to proceedings in the courts of Quebec, receives additional confirmation from the provision contained in rule 36, rules of practice, which seems to shew that the contents of pleadings and other papers filed in the course of litigation in the superior courts are not publici juris. That rule provides as follows: All parties to a suit shall be entitled to communication of exhibits and other writings fyled therein;\na provision not easily to be accounted for if the public generally had in respect of such documents rights\u2014one need not say equal\u2014but at all analogous to the right of the public to be present at and to observe all proceedings in open court.\nThe American authorities cited by counsel are uniformly in accord with the opinion above expressed. I do not refer to them at length, but cannot forbear at least to mention the opinion delivered by Holmes J. speaking for the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Cowley v. Pulsifer[32], and that of Hayden J., speaking for the St. Louis Court of Appeal, in Barber v. St. Louis Dispatch Co.[33], each of which contains a convincing argument in favour of the rejection of the privilege now claimed based mainly upon an exhaustive examination of the English decisions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: White & Buchanan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Desaulniers & Vall\u00e9e.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 309.\n[2] Q.R. 31 S.C. 338.\n[3] See Mousseau v.

VII. c. 11 (Man.)\u2014Contract with solicitor engaged on salary\u2014Conflict of laws.\nSection 468 of the charter of the City of Winnipeg (1 & 2 Edw. VII. ch. 77), provides that where the city solicitor is engaged at a stated salary, the city has the right, in law suits and proceedings, to recover and collect \"lawful costs,\" in the same manner as if such solicitor were not receiving such salary. The corporation enacted a by-law appointing its solicitor at an annual salary and, in addition thereto, that he should be entitled, for his own use, to such lawful costs as the corporation might recover in actions and proceedings, except disbursements paid by the city. Upon the taxation of the costs awarded to the respondent on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (41.Can. S.C.R. 18):\nHeld, that the statute and contracts above recited applied to costs awarded on said appeal and that, on the taxation, the usual fees to counsel and solicitor should be allowed. Hamburg-American Packet Co. v. The King (39 Can. S.C.R. 621) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Registrar in Chambers, on taxation of the costs awarded to the respondent on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada[1].\nThe judgment appealed from was delivered, as follows, by\nThe Registrar.\u2014Upon the taxation of the successful respondents' costs in the Supreme Court, the solicitors for the appellant have claimed that inasmuch as the counsel and solicitor in this court has an agreement with the City of Winnipeg whereby the city pays him a specific salary of $3,600 per annum, by which they obtain all his time and services for the corporation, that the respondents are not entitled to tax against the appellant any other costs than his disbursements.\nThe \"Charter of the City of Winnipeg\" is contained in 1 & 2 Edw. VII. ch. 77 (Man.), and section 468 provides as follows:\n468. Where an attorney or solicitor is employed by the city whose remuneration is wholly or partly by salary, annual or otherwise, the city shall notwithstanding have the right to recover and collect lawful costs in all suits and proceedings in the same manner as if such attorney or solicitor were not receiving such salary, whether such costs are by the terms of his employment payable to such attorney or solicitor as part of his remuneration in addition to his salary or not.\nIn addition to this by-law No. 3613 (a) of the City of Winnipeg provides as follows:\n1. Theodore Alexander Hunt, of the City of Winnipeg, solicitor, is hereby appointed solicitor to the corporation of the City of Winnipeg at a salary of three thousand six hundred dollars ($3,600.00) per annum, and that, in addition to the said salary, the said Theodore Alexander Hunt shall be entitled for his own use to such lawful costs as the said corporation of Winnipeg may recover in actions and proceedings, which costs, except disbursements which may have been paid by the said city, shall be paid to the said city solicitor as additions to the salary payable to the said solicitor.\n2. The said solicitor shall devote his whole time to the duties of the office, and shall perforin the duties in respect of said office prescribed by by-law No. 1596 and any amendments thereto passed or to be passed by the council.\nI have already had to deal, in Wilson v. Davies, with a somewhat analogous question, where the successful respondents in this court had an agreement with an accident insurance company, whereby the insurance company undertook the payment, as be- tween it and the respondents, of all the costs in this court, and wherein I have reviewed all the decisions in Ontario and the English decisions, and the recent judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan in this court in the case of Hamburg-American Packet Co. v. The King[2]. In my reasons in that case, I pointed out that, in the Province of Quebec, the law as to costs is different from that in the Province of Ontario, and that, by art. 553 of the Code of Procedure in the Province of Quebec,\nevery condemnation to costs involves, by the operation of law, distraction in favour of the party to whom they are awarded,\nand, therefore, so far as the Supreme Court of Canada is concerned, it was open to the court to adopt the ruling as to costs in force in Quebec in preference to that in Ontario, \"but that Mr. Justice Maclennan had affirmed the reasoning of the courts in Ontario, and had held that costs are payable to the successful party as an indemnity, and that where the party is under no liability for costs to his solicitor, and there is nothing against which the client requires to be indemnified, such costs cannot be taxed against the unsuccessful party in this court.\nI have now to determine whether the facts of this case are so different from those in Wilson v. Davies that a different conclusion should be arrived at with respect to the liability of the appellant.\nAn agreement such as this would appear to be perfectly valid in England under the \"Attorneys and Solicitors' Act, 1870,\" 33 & 34 Vict. ch. 28, sec, 4 (Imp.), which reads as follows:\n4. An attorney or solicitor may make an agreement in writing with his client respecting the amount and manner of payment for the whole or any part of any past or future services, fees, charges, or disbursements in respect of business done or to be done by such attorney or solicitor, whether as an attorney or solicitor, or as an advocate or conveyancer, either by a gross sum, or by commission or percentage, or by salary or otherwise, and either at the same or at a greater or at a less rate as or than the rate at which he would otherwise be entitled to be remunerated, subject to the provisions and conditions in this part of this Act contained: Provided always, that when any such agreement shall be made in respect of business done or to be done in any action at law or suit in equity, the amount payable under the agreement shall not be received by the attorney or solicitor until the agreement has been examined and allowed by a taxing officer of a court having power to enforce the agreement; and if it shall appear to such taxing officer that the agreement is not fair and reasonable he may require the opinion of a court or a judge to be taken thereon by motion or petition, and such court or judge shall have power either to reduce the amount payable under the agreement or to order the agreement to be cancelled and the costs, fees, charges, and disbursements in respect of the business done to be taxed in the same manner as if no such agreement had been made.\nThis section of the statute was acted on by the courts in Henderson v. Merthyr Tydfil Urban District Council[3]; and, even before the statute, it had been held in 1867 by Vice-Chancellor Page-Wood, in Galloway v. Corporation of London[4], that an arrangement of this sort between a solicitor and client was not illegal.\nIn Ontario, however, the Court of Appeal expressly refused to follow the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor, in Stevenson v. City of Kingston).[5]\nMr. Bethune, for the respondents, contended that where the provincial legislature had expressly authorized an agreement between the solicitor and client such as is found in the present case, this validation of the agreement removed the basis for the Ontario jurisprudence, and that the Ontario cases had no application. This may be quite true so far as the costs in the provincial courts are concerned, but in my opinion it can have no application to the costs in the Supreme Court. The legislature of Manitoba cannot legislate regarding the Supreme Court of Canada, either in respect to its jurisdiction or as regards any other powers conferred upon it by the Parliament of Canada. As far back as Clarkson v. Ryan[6] the Supreme Court held that the provincial legislature of Ontario had no power to. limit appeals to the Supreme Court; and quite recently, in the Crown Grain Co. v. Day[7], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the section of the Manitoba statute which provided that in a case of mechanic's lien the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be final and conclusive, was not effective to prevent an appeal to the Supreme Court, the Committee saying that this enactment was in direct conflict with the general provisions of appeal in the Dominion Act, and that if such legislation were valid it would virtually defeat the main purpose which the Parliament of Canada had in view in establishing the Supreme Court.\nThe \"Supreme Court Act,\" by section 53, provides:\nThe court may in its discretion order the payment of the costs of the court appealed from and also of the appeal or any part thereof, as well when the judgment appealed from is varied or reversed as when it is affirmed.\nI must hold, therefore, that, so far as the Supreme Court is concerned, the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan in the case above cited, of Hamburg-American Packet Co. v. The King[8], has declared that in an appeal to the Supreme Court, costs are awarded to the successful party as an indemnity, and that if there is an agreement between the client and the solicitor whereby the client will not be called upon to pay the costs of the solicitor in this court, such client, if successful, cannot tax such costs against the unsuccessful party to the appeal, and that the provision of the \"Winnipeg Charter,\" even if applicable to costs in the provincial courts has no application to costs in this court.\nC. J. Bethune for the motion by way of appeal.\nF. A. Magee contra.\nHis Lordship delivered judgment, as follows:\nMaclennan J.\u2014The appellant Ponton brought an action against the City of Winnipeg to recover certain lots of land sold by the city for taxes, and bought in by the city. He was unsuccessful in the courts below, and his appeal to this court was lately dismissed with costs.\nOn the taxation before the registrar the appellant objected that the respondents ought not to be allowed anything but disbursements.\nThis objection was founded upon a statute of the Province of Manitoba, and the terms of a contract between the respondents and their solicitor, Mr. Hunt.\nThe statute referred to is section 468 of the \"Winnipeg City Charter,\" and is as follows:\nWhere an attorney or solicitor is employed by the city, whose remuneration is wholly or partly by salary, annual or otherwise, the city shall, notwithstanding, have the right to recover and collect lawful costs, in all suits and proceedings, in the same manner as if such attorney or solicitor were not receiving such salary, whether such costs are, by the terms of his employment, payable to such attorney or solicitor as part of his remuneration, in addition to his salary or not.\nThe contract between the city and Mr. Hunt was by a by-law in the following terms:\n1. Theodore Alexander Hunt, of the City of Winnipeg, solicitor, is hereby appointed solicitor to the corporation of the City of Winnipeg at a salary of $3,600 per annum, and, in addition to the said salary the said T. A. Hunt shall be entitled for his own use to such lawful costs as the said corporation of Winnipeg may recover in actions and proceedings, which costs except disbursements which may have been paid by the city shall be paid to the said city solicitor.\n2. The said solicitor shall devote his whole time to the duties of his office and shall perform the duties in respect of said office prescribed by by-law No. 1596 and any amendments thereto passed or to be passed by the council.\nThe learned registrar has given effect to the objection in a very full and careful opinion, which he rests mainly upon my judgment in The Hamburg-American Packet Co. v. The King (1).\nThis is an appeal from the decision of the learned registrar, and was very ably argued before the learned Chief Justice and myself by Mr. Bethune, for the appellant, and Mr. Magee, for the respondent.\nIt is to be observed that the Hamburg-American Packet Co.'s Case[9] was very different, and there was no statute or contract such as in the present case.\nThe city by-law No. 1596, referred to in the contract with Mr. Hunt, was not brought before the registrar or before us, and I assume that any additional duties on the part of Mr. Hunt, prescribed thereby, are only such as are usually performed by a solicitor.\nThe statute and agreement are confined to attorneys and solicitors and their duties and services, and have no relation to counsel or counsel's services. In Manitoba the offices of barrister and attorney or solicitor are distinct, although the same person may be an attorney or solicitor and also a barrister, and Mr. Hunt is both a barrister and an attorney and solicitor.\nThe salary provided by the agreement, therefore, does not extend to services rendered by Mr. Hunt, as counsel, and he appeared as counsel in the case both in this court and below, and there is no ground on which the usual counsel fees may not be claimed by Mr. Hunt against his clients, and recovered by the city as part of the costs awarded to them by this court.\nHow then does it stand with regard to charges for services as a solicitor, for the question is confined to them, the city's right to recover counsel fees whether to Hunt or any other counsel, as well as disbursements being clear and undoubted?\nIn considering this question it must be borne in mind that costs awarded, whether here or below, at all events under the English system, are the costs of the party, and are awarded to him and not to the solicitor. If the solicitor is acting gratuitously his client can recover no costs, as in the case of an action in form\u00e0 pauperis, simply because the client has incurred none, and if the solicitor by agreement with his client is to receive a fixed sum, irrespective of any particular litigation, or of its result, it cannot be said that the client has incurred any liability to him in that litigation. He has neither paid anything, nor incurred any liability to pay anything, by reason of it for services. And, if not, and if the solicitor could demand nothing for his services, in case his client was unsuccessful, it cannot be said that the client has incurred any costs, as the result of it, except disbursements.\nThe relation of solicitor and client is one of contract, and must be governed by the law of the province in which the contract is made, and not of the province in which the services are rendered. It follows that the solicitor's right against his client to costs incurred in this court, as well as in the lower courts, must be governed by the law of Manitoba, and that the statute and contract are applicable to the costs awarded by this court in the appeal.\nThe only costs in question on this appeal also are those incurred in the appeal to this court alone, the costs in the lower courts being payable by virtue of the orders made below which were merely affirmed by this court.\nThe only question before us, therefore, respects Mr. Hunt's services as a solicitor in this appeal. Is he now for the first time to be at liberty to make out a bill for his services, not against his client, but against Ponton a bill for which he clearly had no claim against his client or against any one, until the moment when this court pronounced judgment in the city's favour with costs.\nThe question depends wholly upon the statute. What says it? It is that, in such a case, the city shall recover lawful costs in suits in the same manner as if the solicitor was not receiving a salary, and whether such costs are payable as part of his remuneration, or in addition to his salary or not.\nThe obscurity in the language is in the use of the word costs. The costs of a client in an action are the sums which he has paid or which he owes, to his solicitor, or his counsel, or to witnesses or others for services rendered therein. The statute says that the city, although employing a. solicitor at a salary may still recover and collect lawful costs in all suits, that is, as I understand it, may recover and collect from the opposite party in an action sums, as above defined, which it may have lawfully paid or which it may lawfully owe for services. The sums owing, paid to counsel or for disbursements, answer the description in the statute, lawful costs. But it did not require the statute so far as those costs are concerned to enable the city to recover them, and the question is can the statute and agreement be made to apply to services which the solicitor was bound to perform in consideration of his salary and without further remuneration. He was entitled to his salary even if this action had never been brought. How then can it be said that his services in this action have cost his clients anything? He issues a writ or enters an appearance, could he claim anything for that, except disbursements? Up to the very last moment before judgment does his client owe anything but disbursements? If the judgment is against the client, or is in his favour but without costs, does the client owe anything for his services, or if the party ordered to pay is insolvent must the client pay? The answer to these questions must be in the negative. If so how can the mere fact that the action is dismissed with costs, make the city a debtor for services for which up to that time they owed nothing, and for which, if they had failed, or had succeeded, but without an award of costs, they would never have owed anything? And what the statute and agreement say is, that what he may recover is lawful costs.\nIt seems to be clear then that the costs sought to be allowed here are not in any proper sense costs, what the statute calls legal costs, that is costs of the client, and it being also clear that both counsel fees and disbursements could and might be taxed and allowed independently of the statute and without its aid, it follows that unless the costs in question can be allowed the statute has no effect or operation whatever, is altogether nugatory, and the sole question is whether we can give it effect or operation on the principle ut res magis valeat quam pereat. Can we say that the legislature must have intended the allowance of the costs in question by the expression lawful costs, followed by the words in the same manner as if such attorney or solicitor were not receiving such salary.\nUpon the whole after much consideration I think that we may without violating any principle of the construction of statutes hold that the words of the enactment mean costs which would have been lawful, that is recoverable by the city, if the attorney or solicitor were not receiving a salary.\nIt is an old rule that every statute is to be expounded according to the intent of them that made it \u2014Maxwell on Statutes (4 ed.) 427 and references\u2014 and I think we can see, although perhaps dimly, that the intention of the statute in the absence of any other effect which can be given to it, is such as I have indicated.\nFor these reasons I think the judgment of the learned registrar should be reversed and that the costs in question should be allowed on the taxation.\nMotion allowed with costs.\n[1] 41 Can.

In the present case, as the appellants failed to discharge the onus thus resting upon them, the judgment appealed from (13 B.C. Rep. 234) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J., at the trial[2], and maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies, now reported.\nBodwell K.C. and Lennie for the appellants.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondents. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given, in the court below, by Mr. Justice Irving.\nGIROUARD J. agreed in the dismissal of the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014 This was an action of trespass brought by the respondents against the appellants for mining within the vertical plane of the west end line of their mining location called the \"Heber Fraction.\"\nThe defendants did not dispute the fact of their having mined within this location of plaintiffs, but justified it on the ground that they were only following the dip of their own \"Slocan Star\" vein from its apex within their own location, and contended that they could follow such dip of the vein across and beyond the side lines of their locations indefinitely as it descends and so long as they proved continuity in the walls and ore of the vein, and kept within the extent of their side lines.\nThe claim of the defendants to this extralateral right was based upon section 31, chapter 25, of the statutes of British Columbia (1891), the first part of which was practically copied from section 2322 of Title XXXII., ch. 6 of the United States Revised Statutes and reads as follows:\nThe lawful holder of a mineral claim shall have the exclusive right and possession of all the surface included within the lines of his location, and of all veins or lodes, throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extending downward vertically, although such veins or lodes may so far depart from a perpendicular in their course downwards as to extend outside the vertical side\u2014lines of such surface location; but his right of possession to such outside parts of such veins or lodes shall be confined to such portions thereof as lie between vertical planes drawn downwards, as above described through the end lines of his location so continued in their own direction that such planes will intersect such exterior parts of such veins or lodes; and nothing in this section shall authorize the locator or possessor of a vein or lode which extends in its downward course beyond the vertical lines of his claim to enter upon the surface of a claim owned or possessed by another.\nThe latter part of this British Columbia section (not copied here), had reference to certain relative bearings of the location and the vein or lode which traversed it in which case, the section provided, the side lines of the location became the end lines thereof for the purpose of defining the rights of the owners. An important legal contention was submitted by the respondents' counsel in the course of his argument on the effect of this latter part of the section upon the appellants' rights even if upon the facts with regard to the continuity of their \"Slocan Star\" vein the finding should be in the appellants' favour.\nHe contended that under the proved facts of this case the appellants' side lines of their \"Silversmith\" location became their end lines for the purpose of defining their rights and that as a consequence they could not under any circumstances have the right to mine on the disputed territory or justify the trespass complained of. I merely mention the point in passing because in the view I take of the facts it does not become necessary to determine it.\nIn order to make the dispute and contentions of the respective parties intelligible, it is necessary to have before one's eye some sort of sketch of the mining locations of the respective parties shewing the relative situations they bear to each other and also the course of the level or drift the mining of which constituted the trespass complained of and the course of the alleged apex of the vein by virtue of which through the \"Silversmith\" location of the appellants they claimed the right to mine within the vertical planes drawn downwards of the respondents' \"Heber Fraction\" location.\nSuch a sketch or outline of the location I here insert. The contention of the appellants shortly was that the \"Slocan Star\" vein after running through the \"Slocan Star\" location from east to west suddenly turned to the north as and after it had entered the \"Heber Fraction\" and continued generally on that northerly course through the \"Heber Fraction,\" the \"Rabbit's Paw\" and the \"Silversmith\" until it reached Point B in the \"Windsor\" location when it turned to the west and ran in the southwesterly though somewhat tortuous course through the \"Silversmith,\" that an apex of that vein was in the \"Silversmith\" location from the point where it left the \"Jennie\" till it reached the \"Windsor,\" and that this apex entitled them as owners of the location to follow the vein down its entire depth to No. 5 level and so on such level southerly to and embracing the alleged trespass on the \"Heber Fraction.\"\nThe respondents, on the other hand, contended, in accordance with the findings of the appeal court of British Columbia, that the \"Slocan Star\" vein ended at the bend to the south on its entering the \"Heber Fraction\"; that in fact it was there broken and cut off by a fault fissure, called throughout the trial the \"Black Fissure\" that this \"Black Fissure\" was a nonmineralized fissure or vein and continued away to the north from the bend or turn where the \"Slocan Star\" vein ran up against it, and again at point B where appellants alleged the vein turned towards the west continued on in a northerly direction and did not turn at all; that the apex claimed to justify the trespass is not on the other or faulted end of the \"Star\" vein, but is the apex of the fault or \"Black Fissure\" itself; and that the \"Silversmith\" vein away to the west does not connect with this \"Black Fissure\" at all. It was plain from these several contentions that the main fight between the parties must concentrate around the facts as they are found to exist at the two great bends of the No. 5 level drift, though the character of the intervening and other parts of the vein or drift is important as determining identity and continuity.\nThe appellants contended that a quantity of ore in place had been found from the bend at or about station 21 along the drift for a distance of about 280 feet, and that this fact was absolutely inconsistent with the theory of a separate and independent vein or fissure running in a northerly and southerly direction and cutting off or faulting the \"Slocan Star\" vein, and shewed that in fact the \"Black Fissure\" was a myth and had no existence, the vein or lode or fissure, as it was variously called, being really and truly a continuation of the \"Slocan Star\" vein turning to the north, and again at the north point B to the southwest. They further contended that the evidences of the vein so turning alike at the south at station 21 and again at the north point B were apparent and could be seen by any one making an examination as they had been seen by their workmen and experts.\nThe respondents submitted that there were no evidences of any turn in the \"Slocan Star\" vein at or about station 21, and that what were alleged as such evidences were inconclusive and most unsatisfactory and that as regard the ore found in the drifts for a distance of 280 feet from the bend or turn it was easily accounted for, and as one of the experts, Fowler, said, its presence was, on the assumption that the respondents' theories were correct, not to be excused but expected. In the first place they say that from the turn at the shaft going northerly from station 21 there was 80 feet shewing ore which was the cut off end of the original \"Slocan Star\" vein by the \"Black Fissure\"; then came a gap of thirty feet shewing no ore; then for 15 feet more evidence of ore in place shewing, as they contended, evidence of another vein running up against and into the \"Black Fissure\" and beyond that point for the remainder of the 280 feet the ore found was not ore in place, but drag ore from this independent vein subsequently called vein No. 2.\nAt the extreme northern end the appellants contended that the vein turned at B and ran southwesterly to E and then tortuously to station 52, where ore was again found, while the respondents' contention was that all the drifting and tunnelling done between B and station 52 was through country rock and not along any vein or lode at all, and that as a fact from station 27 to station 52 the level or drift was absolutely without ore and non-mineralized. They further contend that the \"Black Fissure\" was a separate independent fissure not in any way part of the \"Slocan Star\" vein or the \"Silversmith\" vein and which continued on to the south at one end and to the north at the other away past the alleged bends or turns in dispute and that these two veins, the \"Slocan Star\" and the \"Silversmith,\" were in no way now connected whatever plausible grounds might exist for contending that at some distant period they may have formed one vein or lode.\nThe trial took place before the Chief Justice who, at one period, ordered some additional work to be done for the purpose of testing the truth of the rival theories respecting the continuity or discontinuity of the \"Slocan Star\" vein. The appointee being unable from sickness to carry out the work ordered the Chief Justice determined to make a personal inspection of the work. He did so, accompanied by the chief expert on each side, and, between points B and C, ordered some further work to be done which he also inspected.\nThe conclusion he reached was that the \"Black Fissure\" theory was a myth; that the whole of the No. 5 drift was along and part of the \"Slocan Star\" vein, as evidenced by what he concluded was alike continuity of walls and vein and ore found in the drift for a distance of 280 feet from the turn at the south, and that the theory of the respondents' experts as to the \"Black Fissure\" being a separate and independent fissure cutting off the \"Star\" vein or lode and of an independent vein running eastwardly from station 22, and thus accounting for the ore found in the No. 5 drift at that station and north of that was a theory \"born of despair.\"\nHe was pressed several times to order some work in the nature of cross-cutting to be done at or near station 21 and north of the alleged bend which would either prove or disprove the theory of an independent fissure cutting off the \"Slocan Star\" vein and continuing in its southerly course past where it crossed such vein at station 21, and also some other work at the most northerly end of the drift past where it turned at point B which would prove or disprove its continuance on to the northward as contended, and also some work at station 22 which would prove the existence or non-existence of the separate independent vein contended for by respondents' experts.\nThe Chief Justice, however, feeling confident in the conclusions he had reached as the result of his inspection declined to make the order asked for, whereupon counsel for the respondents decided it would only be a waste of time to argue the case on the evidence then before the trial judge and in the absence of the evidence the work they asked to have done would supply. The Chief Justice accordingly formulated the conclusions he had reached and gave judgment for the present appellants.\nOn appeal to the full court from that judgment the application for an order to have the three pieces of work above referred to done was renewed and granted.\nIndeed it is hard to see how it could be refused or on what reasonable ground it could be opposed. It may well be that on the evidence the Chief Justice had before him coupled with the personal inspection he made in the presence and with the assistance of the experts on both sides his decision would not in the absence of this further work and the disclosure it resulted in have been interfered with.\nWhat we have to deal with is not the Chief Justice's decision on the partial evidence he had before him coupled with his own inspection, but the judgment of the full court of British Columbia after the work which they had ordered had been done and the great mass of testimony taken before them had been given respecting the actual works done and the results they disclosed. The original experts were fully reexamined and their theories tested in the light of the actual facts disclosed and several new experts were brought forward and examined.\nNo question was raised before us as to the power of the court to make the order it did or to receive the evidence it heard. Before the trial judge the contentions of each side rested largely upon theories. They were no doubt ably supported by skilled and experi\u2014 enced mining engineers and the Chief Justice, after personal examination of the mine, accepted that of the defendants. But it does appear to me that the test asked for by the plaintiffs of the correctness of the theory they put forward as to the separate independent character of the so-called \"Black Fissure\" and its prolongation past each of the disputed bends, south as well as north, as also as to the existence of the separate and independent vein or lode at point C, was a most reasonable one and could hardly fail of being a decisive one. If the result had shewn either that the \"Black Fissure\" so called was not prolonged north and south beyond the disputed bends, or if no independent vein had been found at station 22, then it seems to me the theories of Mr. Sizer, Mr. Fowler and the other experts of the respondents would have been so weakened as might have justified at least acquiescence in, if not full acceptance of, the conclusions reached by the Chief Justice.\nAt the hearing of the appeal in this court we had the advantage of having the contentions on both sides very fully and ably submitted by counsel with the assistance of elaborate plans and models without which their arguments would have been difficult if not impossible to follow intelligently. Since then I have read and re\u2014read the carefully compiled factums of both sides, as also a large part of the evidence, and as a result I have reached the conclusion that the contentions of the plaintiffs have been sustained and that the onus which rested upon the defendants has not been discharged.\nIn my judgment when the owner of a mining location seeks to exercise his statutory right and follow downwards and outside of and beyond the vertical plane of the side limits of his location a vein or lode an apex of which is found within and upon or near the surface of his location he is bound, in case he claims to mine and work within the vertical plane limits of another miner's location, to shew by evidence so clear and cogent as to be irresistible that such mining as he claims to justify is on the same vein or lode as has its apex within his location. If such vein or lode has been faulted and severed and he claims to follow the severed part I think the rule laid down in the United States cases, on a similar statute, that he must prove by preponderating evidence identity and continuity alike a reasonable one. It is, as Lindley says in his book on mines, section 615, impossible to prescribe any definite rule as to what degree of continuity or identity, in a legal sense, the miner must establish when he invades property adjoining the location containing the apex of the vein. Each case necessarily presents its own peculiar features. But that there must be alike identity and continuity shewn is I think clear.\nThe continuity may it is true be interrupted even to a closure of the fissure without destruction of the identity provided the extent of the interruptions or closure does not prevent the tracing of the lode or vein through the fissure to be identical in its parts as a geological fact.\nButte & Boston Mining Co. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Mines de Lexington[3], cited with approval in Lindley on Mines, section 615.\nI do not gather, however, that there is very much difference between the parties as to the law governing this question of the necessity of shewing identity and continuity of the lode or vein. The great dispute is as to the facts to which the law is to be applied.\nI do not propose to write an analysis of the great mass of evidence taken in the case. Any such analysis would be unsatisfactory without the presence of models and maps to illustrate it. I am satisfied with the analysis and general reasoning of Irving J. which, with the aid of the maps in evidence, can easily be followed.\nI think the work done under the direction of the full court of British Columbia established beyond reasonable doubt: First, that the \"Black Fissure\" was not a myth, but was an independent fault fissure of entirely different material from that of the \"Star\" vein, being of broken polished country slates, and that it had been formed later than the vein fissure and had no mineralization; that it faulted and cut off the \"Slocan Star\" vein at the southern turn near station 21, and after so cutting it off continued on away to the south. Secondly, that the presence of the ore found within the first 280 feet of the \"Black Fissure\" from the shaft at the southern bend was reasonably accounted for in the manner I have before stated, namely, by the \"brooming up\" against this fissure, to use the expression of the Chief Justice at the trial, of the \"Slocan Star\" vein and of the No. 2 vein disclosed by the C drift where the fissure faulted and cut off these veins and by the drag ore from each of the veins caused by the great earth movement which the experts speak of. The explanations of the presence of this ore for the distance mentioned along this fissure which I accept are quite consistent with the existence of the \"Black Fissure\" as a separate independent fault fissure. Thirdly, that the existence of the vein No. 2 at station 22, as an independent separate vein, was established by the running of the C drift and accounted for much of the ore formed in the first 280 feet of the fissure. Fourthly, that the \"Black Fissure\" (so called) did not turn in a southwesterly direction at point B as appellants contended the vein did at that point, but was shewn, by the work done at X, to have continued on away to the north, thus adding an additional proof of its independent and separate character.\nI think it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that from station 27 or 280 feet north from the place where the fissure faults the \"Star\" vein, and where the drag ore ceased all the way round to station 52, where the \"Silversmith\" vein containing ore was first reached on this No. 5 drift, a distance of 1203 feet, the drift was absolutely sterile of ore and nonmineralized.\nI also reached the conclusion from the evidence that there was no ore vein turning off westwardly from the \"Black Fissure\" either at point B or at station 41, and that all the tunnelling and drifting done by the appellants at these several places were simply driftings through the country rock.\nThe drift had first been driven northerly to \"x\" along the \"Black Fissure\" drift, but as that drift was not leading in a direction to connect with the \"Silversmith\" vein it was abandoned and the entrance to it so blocked up and disguised or hidden by the workmen of the defendants as to conceal the existence of the drift running north from B in that direction. The drift as far as it had been driven to \"x\" from B had been timbered all the way, work which would have been unnecessary if it was country rock they were drifting through. These drifts from 41 to 43 and from B to 43 were no doubt made with the hope and object of establishing connection and continuity between the two ore-bearing veins, the \"Slocan Star\" and the \"Silversmith.\" It is well, however, to bear in mind that they were all run after this litigation began, as, indeed, was the whole of No. 5 level from station 22 in the south.\nThese facts, as I have found them, are destructive of the case set up by the appellants and negative any continuity between the \"Slocan Star\" vein and the \"Silversmith\" vein.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the court below.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIt seems to me, as Mr. Justice Martin puts it, that the appellants have not satisfied that onus of proof resting on them.\nI agree with the exhaustive analysis of the evidence that Mr. Justice Irving has given us the benefit of and the general conclusions he has arrived at without being quite sure as to how far I should agree in the extent or degree of discredit which he attaches to one of the leading witnesses for appellants.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014 I agree in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lennie & Wragge.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Taylor & O'Shea.\n[1] 13 B.C.

While the suit was pending, the plaintiff died and the respondent, as chef de communaut\u00e9, petitioned to be allowed to take up the suit in lieu of the deceased plaintiff, his wife being plaintiff's universal legatee under a notarial will made on the 21st day of June, 1905. The appellant contested the petition, alleging that the will in question was invalid, having been made by the testatrix when she was not in possession of her mental faculties, and inspired by suggestion and undue influence on the part of the respondent and his wife.\nThe contestation was dismissed with costs by the Superior Court and that decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from. The circumstances in relation to the issues on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nS. Beaudin K.C. and Belcourt K.C. for the appellants.\nT. Ghase Casgrain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The only question in issue on this appeal is one of fact and I wish to express my absolute concurrence in the conclusion reached by the distinguished judges who spoke for the majority of the Court of Appeal. Their opinions are to be found in the report of the case in the court below[2].\nThe testatrix was interdicted on the ground of insanity at the request of the appellant, on the 19th of February, 1905, but, apparently, against the opinion of the relatives summoned to form part of the family council. She was relieved of this interdiction on the 29th of May following, and, on revision, this last judgment was confirmed on the 15th of June, and the will impugned in these proceedings was made on the 21st of the same month. The question is: Was the testatrix of sound and disposing mind on that date?\nThe interdiction was removed on the advice of a family council composed of eleven of the nearest relatives of the testatrix, the majority of whom formed part of the first family council; and their finding that the testatrix was then of sound and disposing mind may be said to be equivalent to the verdict of a jury. On an application to review their finding it was confirmed by the judge. No change is proved to have taken place in the mental condition of the deceased between the 15th and the 21st of June. Subsequently, the same issue was tried in these proceedings by the judge who removed the interdiction and he again found in favour of the sanity of the testatrix and his judgment was confirmed in appeal.\nUnder these circumstances we are asked to reverse. This is, in my opinion, one of the cases in which we should apply the rule that has been laid down on more than one occasion in this court, that we should not reverse the concurrent findings of two courts on questions of fact unless clearly erroneous.\nAn interesting question was raised in the Court of appeal below and at the argument here as to whether or not the judgment relieving, on the advice of the family council, the testatrix of the interdiction was res judicata as between the parties in this case. It is not necessary to decide that question now, but I would refer to Lacoste, \"Chose Jug\u00e9e\" (2 ed.), page 8, n. 1: La r\u00e8gle qui accord aux d\u00e9cisions judiciaires autorit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate de chose jug\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e par la cour de cassation de Belgique au jugement qui prononce la mainlev\u00e9e d'une interdiction, et la cour de Gand Ta appliqu\u00e9e en outre au jugement qui prononce l'interdiction; Gand, 2 d\u00e9c., 1899, (motifs) sous Cass. Belgique, 29 nov., 1900, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. V., \u00e0 ce sujet, notre note dans S. et P., 1902, 4, 17.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGirouard J. (diff\u00e9rant).\u2014J'h\u00e9siterais \u00e0 renverser le jugement rendu dans cette cause par deux cours sur une question de fait, si dans l'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve elles avaient tenu compte d'un principe qui, dans une cause comme celle-ci, a toujours servi de guide aux tribunaux; savoir qu'un l\u00e9gataire qui a fait faire un testament en sa faveur au pr\u00e9judice des h\u00e9ritiers, soit en loi ou en vertu d'un testament ant\u00e9rieur, doit prouver que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait l\u00e9galement par un testateur comp\u00e9tent et agissant librement. Il s'agit d'une demande en nullit\u00e9 d'un deuxi\u00e8me testament pour cause de d\u00e9mence, suggestion et captation ou influence indue. Comme toujours, la preuve est contradictoire et c'est surtout dans ces circonstances que l'application du principe ne doit pas \u00eatre perdue de vue.\nNous sommes en pr\u00e9sence de deux testaments: l'un inattaquable, v\u00e9ritable arrangement de famille fait par les parents, de l'assentiment de leurs enfants, qui sont les parties dans cette cause, o\u00f9 il faut supposer que les droits de part et d'autre furent loyalement examin\u00e9s et justement trait\u00e9s; l'autre fait \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la testatrice\u2014son mari \u00e9tait mort dans l'intervalle\u2014qui avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux affaires, \u00e9tait en outre malade, paralytique, souffrante et faible d'esprit et pouvait facilement subit l'influence, surtout de ses proches les plus chers, par lequel testament elle prive presqu'enti\u00e8rement l'une des branches de sa famille, les Laram\u00e9e, des avantages du premier testament pour les faire passer \u00e0 l'autre, les Ferron. Sans entrer dans tous les incidents et les d\u00e9tails nombreux et assez compliqu\u00e9s qui forment le dossier (qui couvre trois cents pages imprim\u00e9es), il est cependant n\u00e9cessaire de s'arr\u00eater sur quelques faits saillants.\nLes parents ici, monsieur et madame Bonin, n\u00e9e Aur\u00e9lie Quintin dit Dubois, cultivateurs de St. Marcel, comt\u00e9 de Richelieu, n'\u00e9taient pas les p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re mais les parents adoptifs de deux jeunes filles s\u0153urs et ni\u00e8ces de madame Bonin, dont l'une avait \u00e9pous\u00e9 Th\u00e9odule Laram\u00e9e, l'appelant, et l'autre Joseph Ferron, l'intim\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s leur mariage, madame Laram\u00e9e e,t son mari rest\u00e8rent avec les parents adoptifs environ un an, puis all\u00e8rent aux Etats-Unis d'o\u00f9, apr\u00e8s un s\u00e9jour de huit ans, ils retourn\u00e8rent \u00e0 St. Marcel vers 1901; et finalement en 1904, ils all\u00e8rent de nouveau habiter avec les vieux parents \u00e0 la suite des arrangements de famille que voici: Le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1904, par un acte entre vifs, qu'ils qualifient \"vente et donation,\" pass\u00e9 devant Cardin, jeune, N.P. de Massueville, ils pass\u00e8rent \u00e0 Laram\u00e9e la terre paternelle, o\u00f9 ils vivaient, avec tout ce qui en d\u00e9pendait, moyennant certaines charges et une rente viag\u00e8re. Le m\u00eame jour, par un autre acte entre vifs intitul\u00e9 aussi \"vente et donation,\" ils pass\u00e8rent \u00e0 Ferron une autre terre de moindre valeur, il est vrai, mais c'\u00e9tait, para\u00eet-il, ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre eux apr\u00e8s m\u00fbres d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, comme cela se pratique invariablement dans nos campagnes, et il est remarquable que pas un seul t\u00e9moin n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit qui ait mis en doute l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de ces arrangements. Pour donner plus de force \u00e0 ces dispositions entre vifs, deux testaments furent faits devant le m\u00eame notaire et deux t\u00e9moins du voisinage: l'un, celui de M. Bonin, le 11 f\u00e9vrier 1904, et -l'autre, celui de Mme. Bonin, le 11 mars suivant. Ces deux testaments confirment en tous points les dites ventes et donations.\nQuelques jours apr\u00e8s, savoir le 28 mars 1904, M. Bonin s'est suicid\u00e9 pour des raisons qui n'apparaissent pas et qui sont d'ailleurs \u00e9trang\u00e8res au litige. Naturellement, cette mort \u00e9trange a d\u00fb \u00eatre un grand choc pour sa veuve et il n'est pas surprenant d'apprendre que le 15 mai suivant elle \u00e9tait frapp\u00e9e d'une forte attaque de paralysie. Elle re\u00e7ut les soins du m\u00e9decin de l'endroit, le docteur Gendron, et peu de temps apr\u00e8s elle \u00e9tait convalescente et comme d'ordinaire dans les cas de cette nature sans \u00eatre gu\u00e9rie. Il est rare en effet qu'une personne \u00e2g\u00e9e d'environ soixante-dix ans, frapp\u00e9e de paralysie comme elle le fut, en revienne compl\u00e8tement. Le docteur Gendron, qui revit la pauvre vieille chez les Ferron o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait en promenade \u00e0 l'automne de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, 1904, en compagnie du notaire Cardin, certifie qu'elle \u00e9tait alors \"d\u00e9mente, un cerveau ruin\u00e9.\"\nA trois reprises diff\u00e9rentes durant cet automne de 1904, en septembre et en d\u00e9cembre, Ferron, durant la visite de madame Bonin, fit venir le notaire Cardin dans le but de lui faire faire un deuxi\u00e8me testament. Le notaire s'est rendu \u00e0 l'appel chaque fois mais sans r\u00e9sultat, vu que d'apr\u00e8s lui elle n'\u00e9tait capable de tester; la derni\u00e8re fois, cependant, afin d'en finir avec ces courses, il demanda au docteur Gendron de l'accompagner, ce qui fut fait. Le notaire ajoute que le docteur Gendron, apr\u00e8s examen, lui a d\u00e9fendu de recevoir le testament et que s'il le faisait, il t\u00e9moignerait contre lui. Le t\u00e9moignage du docteur Gendron confirme celui du notaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. C'est alors que M. Cardin a abandonn\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e de re\u00e7evoir un deuxi\u00e8me testament.\nLe 4 f\u00e9vrier suivant (1905), madame Bonin \u00e9tait interdite \u00e0 Sorel pour cause de d\u00e9mence \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Laram\u00e9e, mais, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ainsi que Laram\u00e9e et le notaire instrumentant, Cardin, l'avouent, \u00e0 l'instigation sp\u00e9ciale de Ferron. M. Cardin ajoute dans son t\u00e9moignage:\nMonsieur Ferron a r\u00e9pondu: \"Puisqu'on ne peut pas faire un testament et puisqu'elle est folle, on va toujours lui nommer un curateur, quelque chose, pour la repr\u00e9senter,\" et il m'a demand\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'interdiction, l\u00e0-dessus j'ai dit: \"Est-ce que M. Laram\u00e9e serait consentant?\" Il dit: \"Voyez-le donc.\" J'ai vu M. Laram\u00e9e et on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'interdiction \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 du conseil de famille.\nQ.\u2014C'est monsieur Laram\u00e9e qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9?\nR.\u2014Oui. Il m'a demand\u00e9 d'aller voir M. Laram\u00e9e pour voir s'il serait consentant; j'au vu les deux parties, nous avons proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de monsieur Laram\u00e9e, mais c'est \u00e0 la demande de M. Ferron que l'interdiction a eu lieu.\nLa cons\u00e9quence de cette interdiction a \u00e9t\u00e9 de faire na\u00eetre dans le c\u0153ur de madame Bonin de la haine pour Laram\u00e9e. Une de ses r\u00e9ponses aux interrogatoires pour son interdiction d\u00e9note l'esprit qui l'animait:\nQ.\u2014Qui n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnable?\nR.\u2014Monsieur Laram\u00e9e. Il faut voir ce qu'il est. Il est ambitieux. O\u00f9 est-ce qu'on trouverait le magot. On passerait le magot. On passerait dans le champ et on ne le trouverait pas. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 courir \u00e0 Sorel. Il est grand. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Sorel pour dire que j'\u00e9tais folle. Pourquoi cela? c'\u00e9tait pour avoir le magot * * * mais le magot lui \u00e9chappera bien.\nL'insucc\u00e8s de Ferron avec M. Cardin lui inspira l'id\u00e9e d'aller frapper \u00e0 la porte d'un autre notaire, plus complaisant, savoir Joseph G\u00e9d\u00e9on Larivi\u00e8re, exer\u00e7ant \u00e0 St. Aim\u00e9. Nous avons le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier et malgr\u00e9 les imperfections, r\u00e9ticences et h\u00e9sitations, il en r\u00e9sulte qu'il d\u00e9clare \u00e0 Ferron que si l'interdiction \u00e9tait lev\u00e9e et que madame Bonin fut pourvue simplement d'un conseil judiciaire, elle pourrait faire un testament. De suite Larivi\u00e8re, \u00e0 la demande de Ferron, prend les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir le relev\u00e9 de l'interdiction. Il s'arme d'abord de l'affidavit du m\u00e9decin de Ferron, le docteur Pepin, asserment\u00e9 devant lui le 12 mai, o\u00f9 ce dernier jure que Mme. Bonin \"a toujours joui de toutes ses facult\u00e9s mentales\" et \"qu'elle est capable d'administrer ses biens et affaires\" bien que plus tard, lorsqu'il fut appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, il avoue qu'il n'a jamais tenu de conversations avec elle et n'a fait aucun examen de, son \u00e9tat mental. Puis, le 23 mai, Larivi\u00e8re donne \u00e0 Laram\u00e9e avis d'une assembl\u00e9e de parents chez Ferron, \u00e0 Massueville. Enfin le 26, au lieu et \u00e0 l'heure indiqu\u00e9s, l'avis du conseil de famille \u00e9tait pris devant lui \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Mme. Bonin, d\u00e9clarant qu'elle jouissait de toutes ses facult\u00e9s mentales et qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de re\u00e7evoir sa rente annuelle de $207.50 et d'administrer ses affaires. Ferron a pris part \u00e0 cette d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, mais non Laram\u00e9e qui est sorti de l'assembl\u00e9e en disant qu'il reviendrait avec son aviseur l\u00e9gal; mais on n'a pas attendu son retour et alors Laram\u00e9e s'est pourvu,par appel devant la cour \u00e0 Sorel. Le 15 juin, 1905, apr\u00e8s un nouvel interrogatoire de Mme. Bonin et un nouvel avis du conseil de famille, l'honorable juge Charbonneau rendit un jugement nommant un conseil judiciaire \u00e0 Mme. Bonin pour les raisons suivantes:\nAttendu que la majorit\u00e9 du conseil est d'opinion que la dite Aur\u00e9lie Quintin dit Dubois soit pourvue d'un conseil judiciaire;\nQu'il appert aussi par la preuve que la dite Aur\u00e9lie Quintin dit Dubois n'est pas capable de g\u00e9rer et administrer ses affaires seule et sans aide. Laram\u00e9e a pris part \u00e0 cette d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, \u00e9tant d'avis qu'un conseil judiciaire \u00e9tait indispensable. Il ne s'inqui\u00e9ta gu\u00e8re de la possibilit\u00e9 d'un deuxi\u00e8me testament, parce qu'il consid\u00e9rait sa pauvre tante comme \u00e9tant absolument d\u00e9mente. Mais il comptait sans Mtre. Larivi\u00e8re.\nPendant que toutes ces proc\u00e9dures se d\u00e9veloppaient devant le notaire Larivi\u00e8re et devant la cour \u00e0 Sorel, Mme. Bonin habitait d\u00e9finitivement le domicile des Ferron o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait gard\u00e9 \u00e0 vue et o\u00f9 le docteur Gagn\u00e9, le ou vers le 6 juin 1905, quoique envoy\u00e9 expr\u00e8s par le juge pour faire l'examen de madame Bonin sur son \u00e9tat mental, fut oblig\u00e9 de revenir sans la voir. Ferron remarqua qu'il ne voulait rien faire sans consulter le notaire Larivi\u00e8re qu'il envoya chercher et qui arriva \"et encore,\" ajoute le docteur dans son t\u00e9moignage, \"on m'a refus\u00e9 de me la laisser voir. On m'a dit qu'il y en avait assez qui l'avait vue.\" En sus les Ferron et leur notaire lui adress\u00e8rent des injures. Dans son jugement qui est con\u00e7u dans des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 541 du code de proc\u00e9dure, le savant juge ne fait aucune allusion \u00e0 cet incident qui, suivant moi, peint la situation. Inutile d'ajouter que Laram\u00e9e qui a tent\u00e9 de voir sa tante vers la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, n'a pas eu plus de succ\u00e8s.\nEnfin le temps presse; il faut arriver au d\u00e9nouement. Le notaire Larivi\u00e8re se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution l'avis qu'il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Ferron; celui de faire un deuxi\u00e8me testament. Le juge-en-chef Taschereau est d'avis que \"c'est la testatrice elle-m\u00eame qui envoie qu\u00e9rir le notaire Larivi\u00e8re.\" Le notaire dit cependant:\nMme. Bonin m'a fait demander par l'interm\u00e9diaire de M. Ferron d'aller chez lui disant que Mme. Bonin voulait faire son testament. Je me suis rendu. A l'entendre, on dirait que c'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il en est question et cependant depuis plusieurs mois lui et Ferron ne cessaient de faire pas et d\u00e9marches pour arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat. Larivi\u00e8re raconte qu'il s'est rendu chez Ferron o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u les instructions de Mme. Bonin en pr\u00e9sence seulement de Ferron et de sa femme. Les Ferron, dit-il, n'ont pas donn\u00e9 les termes du testament, mais \"des explications.\" Le conseil judiciaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent. Larivi\u00e8re n'a pas re\u00e7u le testament ce jour-la, n'ayant pas de second notaire et ne voulant pas prendre des t\u00e9moins sur les lieux dans la crainte d'\u00e9bruiter le testament. Il dit \u00e0 Ferron qu'il fera venir le notaire Rivet d'Yamaska, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques lieues, et de cette fa\u00e7on tout restera dans le plus profond secret. C'est en effet ce qui eut lieu quelques jours apr\u00e8s, durant la veill\u00e9e du 21 juin, Larivi\u00e8re et Rivet re\u00e7oivent le testament de Mme. Bonin, Ferron et sa femme \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sents. Les notaires testifient qu'elle savait ce qu'elle faisait; quant \u00e0 Ferron il est impossible de savoir ce qu'il en pensait, car il n'a pas offert son t\u00e9moignage. L'ex\u00e9cution du testament prit peu de temps; il \u00e9tait court; tout \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la femme de Ferron. Personne ne sut rien de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 jusqu' apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la testatrice qui eut lieu le 15 mai 1906. Cependant, en juillet, 1905, le notaire Larivi\u00e8re, Ferron et le conseil judiciaire Lemieux vont demander certains effets chez Laram\u00e9e. Ce dernier refusa invoquant le premier testament. L\u00e0-dessus, Larivi\u00e8re lui dit: \"Monsieur Laram\u00e9e, tout est \u00e0 vous par ce testament, si c'est le dernier.\" Il ne lui a jamais dit qu'elle venait de faire un deuxi\u00e8me testament; son serment d'office s'y opposait, dit-il. Cependant il avait admis les Ferron \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cution. Il me semble que tous ces faits d\u00e9montrent non-seulement que ce sont les man\u0153uvres de Ferron qui ont amen\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution du deuxi\u00e8me testament \u00e0 son avantage, mais \u00e9tablissent de fortes pr\u00e9somptions de captation et suggestion ou influence indue, pratiqu\u00e9es en fraude des droits des Laram\u00e9e, pr\u00e9somptions que Ferron devait repousser par une preuve compl\u00e8te. C'est ce qu'il n'a pas fait; c'est m\u00eame le contraire qui appara\u00eet.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure, Charbonneau J. et la cour d'appel, Blanchet et Lavergne JJ., diff\u00e9rants, ont maintenu le dernier testament, all\u00e9guant que les Laram\u00e9e n'avaient pas prouv\u00e9 leurs avanc\u00e9s. Mais dans les circonstances sur qui retombait la t\u00e2che de faire la preuve? Les appelants n'ont-ils pas assez prouv\u00e9 pour la rejeter sur le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire? Si nous appliquons les principes que nous avons d\u00e9finis dans la cause de Mayrand v. Dussault[3], il ne peut y avoir de doute selon moi que le dernier testament doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, tant d'apr\u00e8s le droit fran\u00e7ais que d'apr\u00e8s le droit anglais. Nous retrouvons en effet dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la suggestion ou de la captation pos\u00e9s par les auteurs, en particulier par Baudry-Lacantinerie, Pr\u00e9cis, tome 2, no. 774; Laurent, vol. IL, nos. 132, 134, 135; et Marcad\u00e9, tome 3, art. 901, page 407.\nQui a vers\u00e9 le poison de la haine dans le c\u0153ur de madame Bonin contre Laram\u00e9e, ainsi qu'elle l'a manifest\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'interrogatoire cit\u00e9e plus haut? Peut-on raisonnablement supposer que ce soit autre que les Ferron? M\u00eame si le doute \u00e9tait permis \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, Ferron a-t-il repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption du droit anglais que celui qui fait faire un testament en sa faveur au pr\u00e9judice des h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, qu'ils le soient par la loi ou en vertu d'un testament, doit prouver hors de tout doute que le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par une personne capable de tester, librement et m\u00eame honn\u00eatement? Nous avons d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la cause de Mayrand v. Dussault[4], que cette r\u00e8gle devait \u00eatre suivie ici comme faisant essentiellement partie de la libert\u00e9 de tester qui nous vient du droit anglais; et je dois ajouter que le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 de reviser notre d\u00e9cision. Je conclus en citant l'autorit\u00e9 du \"House of Lords\" dans Fulton v. Andrew[5], comme \u00e9tant la plus haute autorit\u00e9 sur la mati\u00e8re. Lord Hatherley disait:\nThere is one rule which has \"always been laid down by the courts having to deal with wills and that is that a person who is instrumental in the framing of a will and who obtains a bounty by that will is placed in a different position from other ordinary legatees who are not called upon to substantiate the truth and. honesty of the transaction as regards their legacies. It is enough in their case that the will was read over to the testator and that he was of sound mind and memory and capable of comprehending it. But there is a further onus upon those who take their own benefit after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown upon them the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\nPour ces raisons, j'accorderais l'appel, maintiendrais la contestation des appelants, rejeterais la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 pour reprise d'instance et d\u00e9clarerais le dernier testament nul et de nul effet, avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nDavies J.\u2014In the case of Renaud v. Lamothe[6] this court decided that, in the Province of Quebec, the English law governs the subject of testamentary dispositions. Under that law it has been determined by the Court of Appeal in England, in Tyrrell v. Painton et al.[7], and it is now accepted as the true rule to be deduced from Barry v. Butlin[8]; Fulton v. Andrew[9]; and Brown v. Fisher[10];\nthat, whenever a will is prepared and executed under circumstances which raise the suspicion of the court, it ought not to be pronounced for unless the party propounding it produces evidence which removes such suspicion and satisfies the court that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the instrument.\nIn the present case two wills had been executed, the first one under circumstances which admitted of no suspicion attaching to it, and the last one, which Avas attacked on the grounds that it was made and executed\nwhen the testator was not in possession of her mental faculties, but was inspired by suggestion and undue influence of the respondent and his wife.\nAt the argument before us, without expressly abandoning the contention of undue influence, counsel for the appellant relied chiefly upon the ground that the testator was not of sound mind when she executed the will.\nAt the close of the argument I entertained some doubt upon the question. Since then I have carefully considered the respective contentions in the light of the conflicting evidence, expert and otherwise, and the several judgments of the courts below, and, while my doubts have not been entirely removed, I have not been able to reach such a clear conclusion that the judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench is wrong as would warrant me in reversing that judgment. The fact that neither the respondent nor his wife were called to give evidence was calculated to intensify suspicion. They were the parties in whose favour the will was made, who were seeking to maintain it, and with whom the testatrix resided for some months before her death and at the time the will was made.\nThey were both present in the house at the time of its execution, and Mrs. Ferron was, as I gather from the evidence, in the room when the testatrix gave her instructions to the notary for the will and when she afterwards executed the will. Mr. Casgrain, I think, very properly, under the circumstances, accepted the onus of supporting this will, and the sole question is: Has he discharged that onus?\nBoth courts below, the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, found that he had, and, while the fact of the evidence of Perron and his wife having been withheld had added to the doubts which the circumstances of the case created, it has not carried me any further and to doubt merely, in such \u00e0 case as this, is to confirm. The experts called with respect to the soundness of mind of the testatrix differed in their opinions.\nI attach great importance to the evidence of the two notaries, one of whom took the instructions and prepared the will, and the other of whom accompanied him when it was executed. Both these notaries knew of the previous interdiction by the court of the testatrix for insanity. They also knew of her subsequent release from that interdiction, but accompanied with the appointment of a judicial adviser, and of a host of other circumstances calling for special precautions on their part, alike as to her capacity to make a will and as to her knowledge and approval of its contents.\nThe notary who drew the will swears that he prepared a will upon notes taken at the dictation of the testatrix, that he re-drafted and re-arranged these notes at his home, and that three days afterwards he returned to the testatrix, accompanied by the notary Rivet, and that she then repeated, without suggestion or aid, what she had told him in regard to her last wishes; that the will was then read to her and that she approved of it is as being what she wished and what she had dictated, and they both state that they were fully alive to the necessity, under the peculiar facts, of taking every precaution so as to satisfy themselves with regard to her mental condition and her wishes with respect to the disposition of her property. The learned judge who heard the case and knew all the parties and their circumstances and relations to each other and to the testatrix, and who was the judge who had removed the interdiction, found for the will, accepting the testimony of these notaries and the other witnesses who testified to the testatrix's sanity. A majority of the Court of King's Bench confirmed that judgment and, notwithstanding the many suspicious circumstances which surround the case, I am unable to reach such a clear conviction of the error of these judgments as would justify me in reversing them.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. A careful perusal of the evidence leads me to infer that the only impairment of the mind of the testatrix was the result of a paralytic stroke that rendered her incapable for a time of making a will; that she thereafter grew better and so continued to improve until she became and was at the time of making the will in question possessed of the necessary testamentary capacity therefor. As much stress was laid by appellant's counsel on the evidence of want of capacity displayed in answer to the interrogatories she had to answer on three different occasions I have paid particular regard to these answers.\nThe answers on the second occasion evince such a marked improvement over those given on the first occasion as to convince me she was, perhaps slowly, yet steadily, recovering her health and with her physical health her normal soundness of mind.\nOn the third occasion there appear some lapses of memory and one or two of confusion, but the ordeal she was going through, which she quite well understood was to test the soundness of her mind, was quite enough, I think, to unnerve her at times. She had also on this occasion to undergo an examination of over an hour and, making due allowance for that and its incident fatigue as compared with the previous occasions, I think my theory of her continued improvement is correct notwithstanding the mistakes I have referred to.\nCertainly the simple will she had decided to make was quite within the mental grasp she seems to have reached.\nShe certainly had conceived against appellant some sort of repugnance. For that I think she left his house, and notwithstanding the cloud then hanging over her mind seems to have had intelligence enough to find her way to the place one would under such circumstances expect her to go to if her mind was clear but her body weak.\nI infer from what occurred that she desired when she reached there to be taken to the respondent's place and he was sent for and she was taken there accordingly. I fail to see how whilst she lived with the appellant her mind could have been so poisoned by the respondent as to create this aversion for the appellant and especially during that period of her illness when her memory was weak and unlikely to retain impressions from remarks on casual visits there by the respondent or his wife even if we assume such without evidence.\nWhatever happened she clearly had received under such circumstances an abiding impression that shewed itself during her later interrogations.\nIf proof of anything it clearly is that she had mental capacity far beyond what some would have us believe.\nIt seems to me this clearly is not, whatever it may be, a case of senile dementia.\nThen we have two professional gentlemen who give evidence as to the making of the will and unless we discard what they say as utterly unworthy of belief without any proper reasons for doing so I do not see how we can, especially in light of what had gone before, say that deceased was so deprived of mind, memory and understanding that she could not make a will.\nThey did not make it quite clear that she was, when giving instructions, taken aside beyond the hearing of the respondent and his wife.\nThat certainly would have been a proper course and I should have felt much more confidence in what was done if some such course had been pursued and the reasons asked of her, for her preferring one of two parties who appeared to have been equally probable subjects of her bounty.\nHowever, I cannot lay down as a rule of law that such a course is absolutely necessary even where the man drawing the will has been procured to do so by the beneficiary.\nI think in the absence of reasons to suppose these professional men were dishonest that the case is removed from any such difficulties as appeared for consideration in the cases of Barry v. Butlin[11], and Fulton v. Andrews[12], and such like cases.\nThe merely sending for or bringing some one to draw up a will is not alone enough to destroy a bequest to him or her who does so.\nEach such case must be determined by its own surrounding circumstances when we are asked to attach weight to the mere fact of sending for, or engaging or even selecting, the notary to perform such a service.\nThe only thing that has troubled me in the case since giving it all the reading of evidence and consideration thereof I possibly can, is that the condition of mind deceased then had, though of testamentary capacity, was what might be easily imposed upon.\nI see no evidence, however, on which I can rest any presumption in law or find as facts from which I can infer captation, suggestion, undue influence or any other form of fraudulent practice such as imputed to the respondent.\nThe learned trial judge saw the witnesses and had a better opportunity in many ways of forming a correct judgment than any one else, and he is satisfied and also the majority of the court of appeal, and it seems to me great weight must in such a case be attached to these circumstances.\nThe case of Mayrand v. Dussault[13], relied upon, had in it facts in abundance which we have not here of a nature to entitle us to draw the inferences that were drawn.\nWe must be careful not to substitute suspicion for proof. We must not by an extensive doing so render it impossible for old people to make wills of their little worldly goods. The eye may grow dim, the ear may lose its acute sense, and even the tongue may falter at names and objects it attempts to describe, yet the testamentary capacity be ample.\nTo deprive lightly the aged thus afflicted of the right to make a will would often be to rob them of their last protection against cruelty or wrong on the part of those surrounding them and of their only means of attracting towards them such help, comforts and tenderness as old age needs.\nIt seems to me pertinent to speak thus for this very case, I rather think, furnishes an illustration of what people have to suffer at the hands of those that have not been as kindly treated as they had a right to expect.\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the opinion stated by my brother Girouard.\nDuff J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal for the reasons stated in the opinion of Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Ethier & Lefebvre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Casgrain, Mitchell & Surveyer.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 215.\n[2] Q.R. 17 K.B. 215.\n[3] 38 Can.

[1906] c. 7, ss. 17 and 18.\nThe provision in sec. 18, sub-sec. 2 of the Controverted Elections Act (R.S.C.

Gilbert v. The King (38 Can. S.C.R. 207) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton dismissing a preliminary objection to the election petition.\nA petition against the return of the appellant Stratton as a member of the House of Commons was filed on Nov. 21st, 1908. Sections 17 and 18 of the \"Controverted Elections Act\" provide for service as follows: 17. An election petition under this Act, and notice of the date of the presentation thereof, and a copy of the deposit receipt shall be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, or in such other manner as is prescribed. R.S., c. 9, s. 11.\n18. Notice of the presentation of a petition under this Act, and of the security, accompanied with a copy of the petition, shall, within ten days after the day on which the petition has been presented, or within the prescribed time, or within such longer time as the court, under special circumstances of difficulty in effecting service, allows, be served on the respondent or respondents at some place within Canada.\n2. If service cannot be effected on the respondent or respondents personally within the time granted by the court, then service upon such other person, or in such manner, as the court on the application of the petitioner directs, shall be deemed good and sufficient service upon the respondent or respondents. 54-55 V., c. 20, s. 8.\nThe time for service expired on December 1st and on the following day an application was made to Mr. Justice Britton for an order for substitutional service based on the following affidavit made by the petitioner's solicitor the heading and jurat being omitted.\n\"I, William Henry Moore, of the City of Peterborough in the County of Peterborough, solicitor, make oath and say:\n\"1. I am the solicitor for the above named complainant, and on his behalf I caused the petition herein to be presented to this honourable court by my Toronto agents in this matter, namely, Messrs. DuVernet, Raymond, Jones, Ross and Ardagh, solicitors, on the twenty-first day of November last.\n\"2. After filing the said petition my said agents sent it to me to be served on the respondent, whose domicile and chief place of business is at Peterborough aforesaid.\n\"3. The same was received by me on the twenty-fifth day of November, 1908. I made inquiry for said respondent, but could not find him at Peterborough, and was informed he would be in Toronto the next day at his office, whereupon I returned the said petition to my said agents to be served. They returned it to me on the twenty-sixth of November last stating that he was not in Toronto.\n\"4. On receipt of said petition on the morning of the twenty-seventh of November last I handed it into the sheriff's office here with instructions to proceed without delay to serve the said petition on the said James Robert Stratton.\n\"5. The said petition was this day returned to me by Mr. Frederick J. A. Hall, Deputy Sheriff of the said County of Peterborough, with the statement that he had made every effort to serve the said James Robert Stratton, but had failed to do so.\"\nHis Lordship granted the order in the following terms the formal parts again being omitted.\n\"Upon the application of the complainant upon reading the affidavits of Frederick J. A. Hall and W. H. Moore filed and the exhibits therein referred to and upon hearing what was alleged by counsel for the complainant:\n\"1. It is ordered that the time for service of the petition herein be and the same is hereby extended till the twelfth day of December, 1908.\n\"2. It further ordered that a copy of the petition and of notice of the date of presentation thereof and a copy of the deposit receipt and of the appointment of the petitioner's solicitor may be served upon the respondent by delivering such copies to Roland Glover or such other clerk as may be in charge of the respondent's office at Peterborough.\n\"3. And it is further ordered that the costs of this order be costs in the matter of the said petition.\" The petition was served on said Roland Glover on December 3rd.\nA number of preliminary objections were filed and served, but when they came up for hearing all were abandoned except one, namely, that the petition had not been properly served the order of Mr. Justice Britton being null and void, having been made on insufficient material and after the time for service had expired. The objection was dismissed and the appellant then took an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The rule as to the service of an election petition is laid down in section 17 of the \"Controverted Elections Act,\" which provides that the petition, notice of presentation, and copy of deposit receipt are to be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, or in the alternative in such other manner as is prescribed by the Act, which must be interpreted to mean by the Act or by the rules of court made under the Act. Section 18 fixes a delay of 10 days after the day on which the petition has been presented for service of notice of the presentation of the petition and provides that this delay of ten days may. be extended if, in effecting service, special circumstances of difficulty have arisen; this section also provides for substitutional service if it is found impossible to serve the respondent personally within the time granted by the court. Section 85 of the Act gives to the judges of the court authority to make rules and orders for the effective execution of the Act and the regulation of the practice and procedure with respect to election petitions.\nIt has been impossible for me to ascertain what were the rules in force in Ontario when the petition was served, but it was not contended by counsel on the argument that any rule existed affecting the questions in dispute in the appeal.\nI construe these sections to provide that service may be made in either one of three ways:\n1\u00b0 In the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters in the provinces. (Sec. 17.)\n2\u00b0 In such manner as the court directs on the application of the petitioner in the special circumstances mentioned in section 18.\n3\u00b0 In such manner as may be provided for by the rules of Court. (Sec. 18.)\nIn Ontario the service of a writ of summons in civil matters is provided for by consolidated rule 146, which is:\nWhere service is required the writ may be served in any county or district in Ontario and the service thereof shall be personal; but if it appears to the court or a judge on affidavit that the plaintiff is unable to effect prompt personal service, the court or judge may order substituted or other service by advertisement or otherwise.\nIt is not doubted that the service made in conformity with the order of the 2nd December, 1908, would be valid if this were a civil case, and that order is in my opinion as effective made as it was within the extended period as if made before the expiration of the 10 days allowed for service, if the judge had jurisdiction to grant the extension after the 10 days within which the service should be made had expired, of which I have no doubt. Gilbert v. The King[1] and cases there cited. We have no power or right to ignore the provisions expressly made relating to the manner of service by the 17th section of the Act and should not put a construction on the 18th section which would involve such a result. The sections provide alternative modes of service, one in conformity with the service of writs of summons in the province and the other the personal and substitutional service expressly prescribed in the 18th section. But the latter method of service is not exclusive and I hold that if the service was made in the manner prescribed by the rule applicable in civil matters it is a good service. The judge who gave the order explains the facts in this way:\nThe application was made ex parte. If for want of proper information as to the facts, the petitioner has obtained an improper order, it was at his own risk. It did appear to me, on affidavit, that the petitioner was unable to effect prompt personal service of the petition and notices, and so in the exercise of my discretion I made the order.\nThe respondent being a business man of large interests, in different parts of Canada, the service upon his clerk, Roland Glover, or upon the clerk in charge of the respondent's office at Peterborough, should be as good as personal service, and therefore should be deemed personal service.\nAssuming that at the time I had jurisdiction to make any order allowing further time, I do not think the order bad by reason of its directing substitutional service as well, in one order. Rule 146 in my opinion applies and the petitioner had, up to that time, been unable to effect \"prompt personal service.\"\nI am of opinion that the order made by Mr. Justice Britton under these circumstances not having been set aside under the practice of the Ontario court as made improvidently or without sufficient material, stands as a good order and that the service under it was a legal one without the letter and spirit of the Act and gave the court jurisdiction over the respondent.\nGirouard, Davies and Duff JJ. concurred in dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014If we read sections 17 and 18 of the \"Controverted Elections Act\" as absolutely meaning that there must be three stages taken in reaching substitutional service of an election petition then this appeal ought to be allowed, but not otherwise.\nThe three stages I refer to are first an attempt to serve personally within ten days as the Act requires, when read in light of the local practice as to service of writ of summons; secondly, an order either within or beyond that term directing an extension of time for service, which must, if the order do no more than extend the time, be personal service; and thirdly, an order for substitutional service if attempts to make personal service have after due effort failed.\nI conceive there may be cases in which these several steps and that order of events might properly be exacted, but I do not think it is imperative. Many cases quite likely to arise would render such a performance slightly ridiculous.\nTake the case of a member elect living abroad beyond the possibility of being reached within the statutory limit of time for service or any reasonable extension of it, by order of court or judge, why should the second step have to be taken when doing so would be an absurdity?\nI think effect can be fully given to every word of these sections (and such ought to be the endeavour in construing anything) by limiting the use of the power to extend for personal service to the cases where the \"special circumstances of difficulty in effecting service\" are of such a character as to justify an application for the extension and not to extend its application to the cases where the granting of the order would be farcical.\nBoth sections 17 and 18 substantially as at present have always existed in the Act and with transpositions and slight changes have throughout been supposed to be operative each covering its own appropriate ground.\nI think also both sub-sections of section 18 must be read together just as if one whole. The section stood as a whole for many years undivided into sub-sections as it now stands since the revision of 1906. I do not suppose it was intended by this severance to change its meaning yet at first blush it reads since as apparently of a different meaning. In the other way of reading literally the requirement in sub-section 2 without relation to what has gone before of \"personally within the time granted by the Court\" the second sub-section would be reduced to an absurdity for the second extension of time to provide for substitutional service would be a \"time granted by the court.\"\nI do not pretend the case is free from difficulties. I am somewhat shaken in the opinion I arrived at in former cases and now express on seeing the opinion I find of the late Chief Justice Armour and the late Mr. Justice Street in the Haldimand Case[2], at p. 484 et seq., before the Act was amended, but in the main as it now is.\nThis opinion comes from authority I regard so highly I would have followed, in the absence of conflicting decisions here, if the decision of that case had turned upon it.\nThe opinion is at best, however, mere obiter dicta, though framed by as careful a man as I ever knew and adopted by another.\nTaking the other view I have indicated as to the meaning of the sections the extension for mere personal service was unnecessary before permitting substitutional service.\nWhen I arrive at that conclusion, and hold as I do for the reasons Mr. Justice Britton has assigned in that regard that he had power to make the order after the expiration of the ten days permitted for personal service, all\" the rest seems to me mere matter of discretion which should not be interfered with.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Watson, Smoke & Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William H. Moore.\n[1] 38 Can. S.C.R. 207.\n[2] 1 Ont. Elec. Cas. 480.\n",

Simpson v. Palliser (29 Can. S.C.R. 6) distinguished. Idington J. dissenting.\nMotion to approve security for costs and to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, quashing an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, which had varied the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Ottawa, by reducing the amount of damages assessed in favour of the plaintiff. The action was for damages for personal injuries and, in the Superior Court, the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs, the damages being assessed at $6,000. The defendants appealed to the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, and by the judgment of that court, the judgment of the court of first instance was varied by the reduction of the damages to the sum of $3,500. The defendants then sought a further appeal to the Court of King's Bench, where, on motion on behalf of the plaintiff, the appeal was quashed, as incompetent, on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Review was, in effect, a confirmation of the judgment of the Superior Court on the inscription for review by the defendants and that, under articles 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure, there could be no further appeal by the party so inscribing in review.\nThe application was first made before the Registrar, in Chambers, and was, by him, referred for decision by the court.\nAylen K.C. for the motion.\nE. B. Devlin K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of King's Bench for the Province of Quebec quashing, for want of jurisdiction, an appeal by the Hull Electric Co. from a judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review.\nThe plaintiff (respondent) recovered judgment against the defendants (appellants) in the Superior Court for the sum of $6,000 and from this judgment the appellants inscribed in review and that court reduced the condemnation to the sum of $3,500.\nThe defendants then appealed to the Court of King's Bench and, there, the appeal was dismissed, on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Review from which the appeal was taken was merely a confirmation of the judgment of the Superior Court (article 43 C.P.Q.). It was held that, in so far as it condemned the appellant to pay the amount of the judgment of the Superior Court, to the extent of $3,500, the judgment of that court was not, in that respect, revised or reformed, but confirmed in review; and that part of the judgment of the Superior Court so confirmed could not be modified in appeal. In this conclusion I agree.\nThe object of the article (43) is to limit appeals, and if the appellants are allowed to go from the Court of Review to the Court of King's Bench and from that court come here merely to get relief from the judgment of the Superior Court, then there would be three appeals from the judgment of the latter court, which is the very thing the statute was intended to prevent. The appellants should have come to this court from the Court of Review direct.\nWe were referred to the case of Simpson v. Palliser[1], where the damages of the plaintiff had been increased on appeal to the Court of Review and, upon that ground, it was held here that an appeal lay to the Court of King's Bench, and not here. It will be seen that Simpson v. Pallisser1 is not an authority on the point raised here. In that case the amount of the condemnation was increased in review; the judgment of the Superior Court was, therefore, not confirmed, and the party prejudiced by that increase was entitled to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Here, as I have said, the appeal is taken from a judgment which does not revise or reform, but confirms pro tanto the judgment of the Superior Court. This judgment is in accordance with the settled jurisprudence of Quebec since Beauch\u00eane v. Labaie[2], where it was held that there is no appeal from the Court of Review when the party appellant complains of a judgment in review which confirms in part the judgment appealed from, and by his appeal seeks to obtain redress against that part of the judgment of the Superior Court which is confirmed in review. The article of the Code of Procedure (43), formerly 1115 C.P.C., is not new. It was first enacted in 1867 and amended in 1874 by 37 Vict. ch. 6, sec. 1, and re-enacted in 1888 (R.S.Q. art. 6005), in 1891, by 54 Vict. ch. 48, par. 2, and, finally, in 1897, when the present code was promulgated. I would not disturb the construction put upon this article by the Court of King's Bench and never departed from since 1876. Fraser v. Brunette[3], is not an exception to the general rule. That case is reported also in 19 Revue L\u00e9gale, at page 305, but in both places imperfectly. In Fraser v. Brunette3 the plaintiff had obtained from the defendant a right of pre-emption with respect to two lots of land which in violation of this agreement the defendant afterwards disposed of; hence an action in which the plaintiff asked by his conclusions: 1st. that the defendant be condemned to give him a title to the lots in question within a fixed delay; 2ndly. by subsidiary conclusion that in default of a title the judgment of the court do avail to him as such. During the course of the proceedings the plaintiff amended his claim alleging that he had suffered damages as a result of the sale made by defendants to the extent of $ 1,000, and that instead of being condemned to give him a deed to the property he prayed that the defendant be condemned to pay as damages, $1,000. The Superior Court, overlooking the amended pleadings, condemned the defendants to pass a title in accordance with the conclusions of the action as originally drafted, and in default that the judgment be equivalent to a title. The defendants thereupon appealed to the Court of Review where the original judgment was confirmed as to the right of pre-emption, but reformed by condemning the defendant to pay $1,000 as liquidated damages instead of returning the property. Hence the appeal to the Queen's Bench where the appeal was heard on the ground that the judgment was reformed by substituting a condemnation to pay $1,000 for a condemnation to return the property. This is not in principle a departure from Beauch\u00eane v. Labaie[4]. In Fraser v. Brunette[5], the part of the judgment in review complained of completely reversed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nI would follow City of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon et al.[6], where it was held that the Court of Queen's Bench having properly declined to exercise jurisdiction, no appeal lies to this court.\nApplication refused with costs.\nGirouard J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nDavies J.\u2014The right to appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench of Quebec quashing, for want of jurisdiction, an appeal by the Hull Electric Co. from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, depends upon the construction to be put upon sub-section 4 of article 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec.\nThe simple question is whether or not a judgment of the Court of Review reducing the damages awarded by the Superior Court from $6,000 to $3,500 can be held to be a confirmation of that judgment within the meaning of the above article of the Code of Procedure.\nThe question is largely one of procedure, and, as it appears to be the settled jurisprudence of Quebec, since Beauch\u00eane v. Labaie[7], that a judgment reducing the damages only is a confirmation pro tanto of the judgment of the court of first instance, and so within the article referred to, I will not dissent from the judgment proposed refusing the right to. appeal.\nHad the question come before us untrammelled by decisions which, in questions of procedure, it is not the practice of this court to interfere with, I should have been prepared to allow the appeal on the ground that the reduction of the damages was not a confirmation of the judgment of the court of first instance within the meaning of the article of the Code of Procedure.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the case of Simpson v. Palliser[8] ought to govern this application.\nIt is though, on the facts, the converse of this case, in principle identical. It simply was a case of increasing whereas the case at bar is a case of reducing the amount of the judgment.\nThis court held, contrary in principle to what the Court of Queen's Bench had previously held in Beauch\u00eane v. Labaie[9], such a thing was not a confirmation, and, hence, an appeal would lie to the Court of King's Bench. That court has, in the case at bar, notwithstanding the holding of this court, refused to exercise its jurisdiction.\nI am unable to understand how increasing, for and in respect of the same cause of action, the amount of damages, instead of merely diminishing them, can be more of a confirmation of the judgment in the one case than in the other.\nThe case of The City of Ste. Gun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon[10] does not touch the point. In that, the question raised was whether or not there could be an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and this court held there could not and, there being, therefore, no possible appeal from the court of final resort in the province, no appeal could lie here.\nThe Chief Justice, in disposing of that case, makes clear that it formed one of the numerous class of cases where no appeal is allowed by the provincial legislation to the final court of resort in the province and no legislation existed to permit an appeal here from a lower court, as to a limited extent is permitted in some Quebec cases, there could, therefore, be no appeal either here or to the Court of Queen's Bench.\nBesides the former case is the last authority of this court on the subject.\nIn the recent case of The C. Beck Manufacturing Co. v. Valin[11], at page 528, I had occasion to fully consider the right of appeal when it turns on the question of a court having erroneously either asserted or refused to exercise its jurisdiction.\nI concluded then and hold now that an appeal in such case is an appropriate remedy where the case is otherwise within any of the classes (and having the necessary pre- requisites) for which an appeal is provided.\nThe application should, I think, be granted.\nDuff J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Aylen & Duclos.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brooke, Chauvin & Devlin.\n[1] 29 Can.

[1906] c. 139, s. 41.\nUnder the provisions of the Montreal City Charter, 62 Vict. ch. 58, sec. 484 (Que.), an action was brought by the city, in the Recorder's Court, to recover taxes on an assessment of the company's property in the city. Judgment was recovered for $39,691.80, and an appeal to the Superior Court, sitting in review, under the provisions of the Quebec statute, 57 Vict. ch. 49, as amended by 2 Edw. VII. ch. 42, was dismissed. On an application by the company to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to hear an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review,\nHeld, that the Superior Court, when exercising its special appellate jurisdiction in reviewing this case, was not a court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes within the meaning of section 41 of \"The Supreme Court Act,\" R.S. [1906] ch. 139, and, consequently, there could be no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nMOTION to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming a judgment of the Recorder's Court for the City of Montreal, by which the defendants were condemned to pay to the city the sum of $39,691.80, for taxes due on their property assessed within the City of Montreal.\nThe action was instituted in the Recorder's Court for the recovery of taxes claimed by the city. That court has jurisdiction in such cases by virtue of section 484 of the Charter of the City of Montreal, 62 Vict. ch. 58, which provides in part as follows: \"The Recorder's Court has the jurisdiction of a recorder and shall hear and try summarily, 1. Any action brought in virtue of any by-law or resolution of the council for the recovery of any sum of money due to the city for any assessment,\" etc.\nAn appeal lies from the judgment of the Recorder's Court to the Superior Court, sitting in review, under 57 Vict. ch. 49, as amended by 2 Edw. VII. ch. 42, which provides in part as follows: \"In all cases or proceedings when the amount in dispute relates to one or more municipal or school taxes or assessments or fines or penalties imposed by any municipal by-law, exceeding in all the sum of five hundred dollars, there shall be an appeal from the final decision of any recorder or Recorder's Court to the Superior Court, sitting in review.\"\nThe charter also, by sections 383 and 384, in part provides as follows:\n\"383. Any ratepayer having duly complained of any entry or omission in the said rolls, or either of them, who may think himself aggrieved by the decision of the assessors, may within eight days, appeal from said decision by petition to the Recorder's Court, which shall have jurisdiction in all such cases. \"384. A final appeal shall lie from any decision rendered by the Recorder's Court in respect of any entry on the valuation and assessment roll or on the tax roll, to any one of the judges to the Superior Court * * * and such judgment shall be final.\"\nIn the Recorder's Court the city recovered judgment for $39,691.80, and the company appealed to the Superior Court, sitting in review, where the judgment of the Recorder's Court was affirmed. The company then sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe application by the motion was made upon a reference to the court by the registrar in chambers.\nCampbell K.C. appeared in support of the motion.\nAtwater K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an application to affirm the jurisdiction of this court, in these circumstances:\u2014\nThe appellants were assessed in the years 1902-03, 1904-05 upon their property in the City of Montreal for the sum of $36,691.80, and, in 1906, an action was brought in the Recorder's Court to recover this amount and the company was condemned to pay. From this judgment an appeal was taken to the Superior Court, sitting in review, and the judgment of the Recorder's Court was confirmed. From that judgment the company wishes to appeal here, invoking section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nIn my opinion that section has no application to the facts of this case. This action was brought in the Recorder's Court, which is not a superior court of original jurisdiction, but a municipal court, clothed by statute with special authority to hear cases for the recovery of any sum of money due to the city for any assessment. Prom the judgment of that court, in these special cases, the same statute gives an appeal to the Court of Review. It cannot be said that, when exercising this special appellate jurisdiction, the Court of Review is a court of last resort, created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property within the meaning of section 41. If the appeal was from a judgment of one of the judges of the Superior Court, to whom an appeal is given by article 384 of the Montreal City Charter from the decision of the Recorder's Court on a complaint against the decision of the assessor, under section 383 of the said charter, then section 41 of our Act might apply. It is to be observed that the Court of Review is not a court of final resort in the province.\nThere is no appeal from that court except in certain exceptional cases of which this is not one.\nGirouard J. concurred in the judgment rejecting the motion with costs for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in rejecting the motion to affirm our jurisdiction.\nIdington and Duff JJ. also concurred in the rejection of the motion with costs for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nMotion refused with costs.\n",

R. 134) was affirmed, the Chief Justice dissenting, and Davies J. hesitante, as to the quantum of the damages awarded.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming the judgment entered upon the findings of the jury, by Perdue J., at the trial, in favour of the plaintiff, for $8,000 damages, with costs. The circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nWatson K.C. and Laird for the appellants.\nCohen for the respondent. The Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff that, in the circumstances of this case, the question as to whether a child of tender years can be held at law to be incapable of contributory negligence does not arise. The judge clearly put to the jury the question of plaintiff's contributory negligence and properly directed them as to that issue.\nI am, however, of opinion that the damages are grossly excessive and on that ground I would grant a new trial.\nI wish further to express my astonishment at the defence put forward by the company to the effect that they are not bound to equip their cars with such fenders and guards as are generally considered indispensable for the protection of human life. Jurors can scarcely be blamed if, in cases arising in communities where such defences are raised, they take an exaggerated view of the companies' liability when accidents occur.\nGirouard J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I adopt the reasoning and conclusion of my brother Duff with respect to the findings of the jury on the two incompatible theories or contentions submitted to them on behalf of the respective parties, and also with respect to the alleged contributory negligence of the child. It was quite open to the jury on the evidence to have accepted the version of facts contended for by either party as the true one.\nThe evidence was very conflicting and was fairly submitted to them by the trial judge. They accepted the plaintiffs' theory and contention as to the facts which caused the accident, and in so doing necessarily negatived those of the defendants. That being so, their findings of negligence with respect to the defective fender and want of care in the motorman in keeping a proper lookout cannot now be impeached.\nI also agree that on such findings of the jury, which there was ample evidence to sustain, the defence of contributory negligence must fail and is in fact practically eliminated from the case.\nIt becomes unnecessary to consider, under these circumstances, what is the law with respect to contributory negligence on the part of a child six years of age or whether the learned judge misdirected the jury on that point when he held it to be a question of law for him to decide, as I agree, under the findings of the jury and the evidence, the appellants could not have sustained any prejudice from the judge's ruling on the point.\nI am by no means, however, satisfied on the question of the damages awarded by the jury. In my opinion, considering the age, position in life and prospects of the injured child, the damages were grossly excessive. As, however, the Court of Appeal did not think a new trial should be granted on this ground and a majority of this court concurs in the same opinion, I will not formally dissent.\nIdington J.\u2014This action was brought by an infant to recover damages arising from her being, when aged five years and eleven months, knocked down and so far run over and dragged by the appellants' electric street car on the main street of Winnipeg, that I am not surprised at the amount of the verdict when founded on such negligence as shewn to have caused such results.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Purdue with a jury, who found by their answers to his questions that this accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants, now appellants; that the negligence consisted in\ndefective-fender and negligence on the part of the company not having car wheels guarded and on the part of the motorman in not looking ahead and in not applying the brakes and in not using sand to stop the car; and they assessed the damages at $.8,000.\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba having refused to disturb the judgment entered according to this verdict, we are asked to do so.\nThere was evidence that the fender failed to respond to the motorman's attempt to operate it, that the car wheels were not guarded as they might have been and as cars elsewhere had been and one car on appellants' line also was at the time, and also from which it might be inferred the motorman had not been looking or he might have seen and done more to save the girl.\nThe case, therefore, could not have been properly withdrawn, in regard to any one of these causes of complaint, from the jury.\nThey were with those of excessive speed and failure to ring the gong the questions properly raised by the pleadings and the evidence.\nThe additional findings are harmless surplusage and neither add to nor detract from the strength of the others and possibly are germane to the question of speed and doubtless form the answer the jury found as to the charge of high speed.\nThe contention that inasmuch as the city authorities had not, as the contract between the appellant and the city empowers them, directed a specified fender to be used, none need be used, is so untenable, I am surprised to find it raised as an arguable point of law in this case; though for the second time such a contention has been set up in this court within the past sixteen months.\nThe only other question seriously raised as to the conduct of the trial arises out of the refusal of the learned trial judge to submit to the jury some sort of question as to whether or not the plaintiff could by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the injuries; and instead of doing so telling the jury that\nthis little child only six years old is not accountable for negligence like a grown person,\nto which the defendant's counsel at the trial took \"very strong exceptions.\"\nCounsel, on the learned judge's explaining what he had said as to such a contention, modified his demands and put it in a more reasonable way yet inaccurate in law and asked his lordship\nto tell the jury that the child is responsible for its acts as far as it realizes what it is doing.\nThe jury, thereupon, were recalled by the learned judge when he removed from the case all ground for reasonable objection in putting the matter as I am about to quote from this supplementary charge.\nTo understand it one must appreciate the issues of fact he presented to the jury.\nOn the one hand the plaintiff's witnesses shewed that she had gone across the track in course of going to school and, when on the strip seven feet wide between the tracks, saw cars coming in opposite directions and got frightened at that, hesitated, retraced her steps to return to the side whence she had come and got caught in the result by the car. The fender failed to trip, and she fell underneath instead of above it as she might have done if it had operated properly. On the other hand the defendant's witnesses, including the motorman, pretended she never had come in front of the car, but was between the sidewalk and the track, running from a boy snowballing her; and had with her shawl over her head run against the side of the car or vestibule of the car, got knocked under it and hence her injuries.\nNow the judge speaking of these conflicting presentations of the facts said as follows:\nNow if you believe that (referring to the latter one) and the other witnesses for the defence the company would not be guilty of negligence. I thought I had made that clear to you, but if you believe the defendants' account of how the accident occurred, that the child ran across in that way and struck the vestibule of the car before the motorman could stop it, and that he did take steps to stop it, then the defendants would not be guilty of negligence. Then your proper answer to the first question would be \"No.\"\nNo objection was made to this as a proper disposition of counsel's objection.\nIt was impossible for the jury to find for the plaintiff on this charge except by first finding the story of defendants' witnesses untrue, and if that is thus eliminated no evidence remains that would have justified a finding of contributory negligence of the kind any child of five years and eleven months old can conceivably have attributed to it.\nThe hesitation, doubt and trepidation she evidently felt and exhibited would have been excusable in one much older.\nTo appreciate the legal bearing of what we have to deal with let us see what the law, so far as developed, really is.\nThough the law fixes an age limit for responsibility in some cases, none for the application of the doctrine of contributory negligence has yet been so definitely fixed as to furnish a uniform rule of law to guide us in all possible emergencies that may arise in the conduct of children.\nThe same sort of reasoning that led to fixed ages as lines at which responsibility may be drawn in some cases tends with the progress of changed and changing conditions to develop a fixity of law. What has so far happened in legal development as to contributory negligence also is briefly this.\nJust one hundred years ago a great master of English law and language is said (in Butterfield v. Forrester[2]) to have formulated for the first time, so far as reported cases give us the law, the doctrine of contributory negligence. His comprehensive proposition, doubtless the result of earlier law, has been qualified as the exigencies of time and place and occasion seemed to furnish reason therefor.\nThe case of Lynch v. Nurdin[3], thirty years later, raised and settled in a large measure the necessary qualification where infants as plaintiffs were concerned. That case was one where a lad nearly, but under seven years, had with a playmate jumped into a cart, left unattended on the street by the owner's servant, who ought to have been in charge, and the horses spurred up by the playmate moved on and the plaintiff boy received in the result a broken leg.\nNo one claimed at the trial of that case to raise as such the question of contributory negligence as a bar to recovery; but the boy's acts and age were considered by the jury under the direction of the trial judge and the jury then and thus possessed of the whole case found a verdict for the boy.\nThis was moved against and the whole subject dealt with by the court when it was expressly found that whether contributory negligence or however looked at it, the child's act, was only what might be expected of a child of such tender years and hence furnished no bar to the action.\nThat decision leaves all that is to be found in this case well within the limits of the due allowance to be made when applying the law of contributory negligence in the case of infants suing for damage done them by reason of the negligence of another.\nIt has been maintained as good law down to this time. The only two expressions of doubt as to it each related to the negligence of a defendant and not that of a child's contributory negligence, and even that doubt it is said is attributed in one of these cases erroneously to Lord Esher. See page 163 (n), of Canadian edition of Beven. Besides it is referred to in Engelhart v. Farrant[4], at page 247, by Rigby L. J., as if law, and I find Lord Esher, one of the court, disposing of the case in which this happens.\nIt was accepted as law in the case of Sangster v. T. Eaton Co.[5], upheld on appeal here[6].\nIn Ricketts v. Markdale[7] the late Mr. Justice Ferguson, whose care and accuracy were most notable, wrote the judgment fully concurred in by the whole court, dealing with this phase of the law. He quoted approvingly American and other authorities the gist of which is that no more can in any event be required than that the child should do what might be expected of an ordinary, careful and prudent child; that everywhere a child of six or seven years is presumed to be incapable of contributory negligence; and that it is not attributable to a child of tender years.\nNo one now pretends to support literally the defendant's contentions at the trial, but it is claimed that a varying standard as set up for older infants in many cases, ought to extend to this child. No such rule can be found to have been laid down in English or Canadian cases as law in the case of child under seven. The cases chiefly relied upon are American. It may be hard enough to reconcile the utterances of our own high authorities without going abroad.\nThe learned trial judge evidently had in view, in dealing with the facts presented to him, the law as laid down by this court in the case of Merritt v. Hepcnstal[8], at pages 152, when the court through the then Chief Justice, Sir Henry Strong, adopted the law as laid down in Gardner v. Grace[9], by Channell B. as follows:\nThe cases shew that the doctrine of contributory negligence does not apply to an infant of tender age. To disentitle the plaintiff to recover it must be shewn that the injury was occasioned entirely by his own negligence.\nI find on reference to the original record of the Merritt Case8 that the child in question there was only three years of age.\nYet so far as it goes the law there laid down is binding on us and must be applied as our guide as I infer the learned trial judge tried to apply it. The term \"an infant of tender age\" there used is that which is most widely used as to various ages up to six or seven years in the cases most carefully thought out. In Lynch v. Nurdin[10] the plaintiff was referred to as \"a child of very tender age between six and seven.\" I incline, therefore, to hold we might well follow the proposition just quoted and that the learned judge's reason for excluding the question of contributory negligence was right.\nIt is not necessary to say more than this that, on his view of the facts, the proper question was to determine not as to contributory negligence, but whether or not the injury was within the above rule and occasioned entirely by the negligence of the child.\nMere refusal at the request of a defendant to submit a question relative to contributory negligence to the jury is not in itself misdirection; for the first question the judge has to solve is whether or not there is any evidence bearing on the point.\nSubmitting needless questions or issues for consideration, only tends to confusion and perplexity in the minds of the jury.\nHere the remark addressed to the jury as to contributory negligence was absolutely harmless, and although beside the question also quite correct so far as it went.\nThe appellants' counsel were pressed in argument here to specify the facts in evidence on which they relied to furnish ground for a direction as to contributory negligence and resorted to the evidence for the defence which the learned judge as above set forth told the jury if true furnished a complete defence. He chose to treat that evidence as bringing the case within the second branch of the rule quoted above. The appellant cannot surely complain of this. I would not desire to commit myself to its absolute accuracy as to its bearing on the plaintiff's case, but the course the jury were directed to pursue was exactly what would have been the case had the learned judge called what he spoke of contributory negligence instead of substituting, not in actual words but in truth, injury occasioned wholly by the child's own act. Many such cases have been passed upon already. Treating this as of that class of defence, could not, did not, mislead the jury.\nThe jury refused to believe appellants' side of the case and that evidence is thus put out of consideration here.\nThe charge was lucid and fair, and so far as it omitted, at first, anything the defendant's counsel complained of was on the recall of the jury properly supplemented so far as in law it could be.\nWhat happened as to the nature of the objections taken and the judge's charge in Hansen v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11], are so similar to this case in that regard that what we did there might if need be referred to and followed.\nThe doctrine of the negligence of the parents being imputed to the child was set up in argument, but I confess to being unable to apprehend its bearing on this case if we have regard only to English and Canadian authorities. The American authorities are so conflicting as to help little if at all.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014It is, I think, hopeless to impeach the verdict in this case as against the weight of evidence. A question, however, which requires examination is raised by the appellants' contention that the learned trial judge improperly withdrew from the jury the defence of contributory negligence pleaded by them.\nThe action was the outcome of an accident in which the infant respondent (a child not quite six years old) was run down by the appellants' car and seriously injured. The mishap occurred on Main Street, Winnipeg, just opposite the entrance to a cross street known as Stella Avenue. On Main Street, which runs north and south, the appellants have a double track; and the car referred to was, when the accident took place, running south on the westerly track. The respondent with other children had just come out of Stella Avenue, which opens into Main Street at its westerly boundary, and was crossing the latter street on her way to school.\nTwo wholly incompatible accounts of the occurrences were presented to the jury by the respective parties. According to the case presented on her behalf at the trial, the respondent crossed the westerly track in safety, but, seeing a car on the easterly track coming from the south, she became confused, and, attempting to return across the westerly track, was knocked down just as she reached the most westerly rail.\nThe appellants' case was that the respondent never crossed the westerly track, at all; but, playing at snowballs with one of her companions\u2014and not observing the car\u2014ran against the side of the vestibule and slipped under the body of the car in front of the wheel that crushed her.\nThese were the rival cases presented to the jury; and the appellants' complaint which we have to consider is that the learned trial judge (holding that in law contributory negligence could not be imputed to a child of the respondent's years) withdrew that issue from the jury.\nI do not think it is necessary to decide whether under the law of England, which on this subject prevails in Manitoba, the ruling of the learned judge on this point is open to objection.\nIn Merritt v. Hepenstal[12] this court seems to have held that, in such a case, in order to succeed the defendant must shew that the injury was occasioned entirely by the negligence of the child; and it was upon this view that the learned trial judge acted. I should prefer, however, to reserve for future consideration the exact effect of that decision and to rest my judgment on this appeal on other grounds.\nThe learned trial judge instructed the jury that if they accepted the account of the accident advanced by the appellants they should dismiss the action. In face of this instruction (even assuming the question of contributory negligence to be in such a case a question of fact, depending on the views of the jury and the ruling of the learned trial judge touching the degree of care to be expected from a child of tender years to the opposite effect therefore erroneous), I am not able to discover any ground upon which it can be said that the appellants have by reason of that ruling suffered any prejudice.\nThe learned judge, had he submitted to the jury the defence proposed, would unquestionably have told them that there was nothing in the facts to support that defence, if they accepted the account of the child's movements just preceding the collision which was put forward on her behalf. He might, perhaps, have told them also that, if they accepted the appellants' account, it would be a question for them whether the plaintiff's conduct had fallen below the standard of reasonable care to be expected from a child of her years; but in point of fact the learned judge put the question in a form much more favourable to the appellants. He told them that if they accepted that account the action should be dismissed. This error\u2014which was error in form only, if error at all\u2014could not possibly prejudice the appellants.\nIn truth the verdict shews that the jury rejected the appellants' view of the accident and acted upon the respondent's account; and, on the hypothesis that the latter accorded with the facts, it is not open to dispute that the defence of contributory negligence must fail.\nOn this ground (that assuming the learned judge misdirected the jury an examination of the charge as a whole and of the findings of the jury shews that the misdirection was innocuous) I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Munson, Allan, Laird & Davis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bonnar, Hartley & Thornburn\n[1] 18 Man.

Thompson (Defendant) Respondent.\n1909: February 23; 1909: March 29.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Agreement for sale of land\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Fiduciary relationship\u2014Specific performance.\nWhere an intending purchaser, by disguising his intentions under the role of a disinterested friend imposed on the confidence thus established and induced the owner of land to accept an offer for the purchase of it which probably would not otherwise have been accepted without independent investigation, specific performance of an agreement for sale thus procured should not be enforced. Fellowes v. Lord Gwydyr (1 Sim. 63) discussed and distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing the judgment, in favour of the plaintiff,:by Martin J., at the trial and dismissing the action with costs.\nThe plaintiff, Hugh Henderson, residing at Rossland, B.C., visited the defendant, a resident of Seattle, Wash., ascertained that she was willing to sell a house and lot which she owned in Rossland, and offered to act in a friendly way on her behalf in securing a purchaser. Upon his return to Rossland, he entered into correspondence with her in which he represented that he was the agent of undisclosed principals desiring to purchase the property. He informed her that the house was in a dilapidated condition; that a good price could not be obtained and, after some letters and telegrams had passed between them, she accepted the price he offered and advised her to accept. She, afterwards, discovered that the proposed purchasers were the plaintiff, Hugh Henderson, and his wife and refused to carry out the sale. The action was then brought to enforce specific performance of the agreement for the sale of the property.\nAt the trial, Mr. Justice Martin, maintained the action with costs, and said:\n\"After further reflection upon this matter I can only form the opinion that the plaintiffs must succeed. The representations made by Hugh Henderson as to the condition of the house were substantially correct, and though I agree that it would have been more honourable if he had frankly stated the true position of the prospective purchaser, instead of trying to convey a false impression in that respect, still he was not acting in any fiduciary capacity towards the defendant, nor was she in any way prejudiced by his misleading statements. The case in principle cannot be distinguished from Fellowes v. Lord Gwydyr, in 1826[1], and on the facts I must find for the plaintiffs. I need only add that I do not think that the letter of 12th February seeks to impose any new conditions, it simply expresses, though in not very clear and precise language, a layman's idea of the way to complete the title in the circumstances.\"\nThis judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from. Shepley K.C. for the appellants.\nEwart K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014It is not open to doubt that if the parties to the contract sought to be enforced in this case stood towards each other in a fiduciary character, such as that of principal and agent, the court would not, under the facts so proved, lend its aid to enforce specific performance.\nI have had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion on the evidence that the parties did stand towards each other in that relation. The appellant's own evidence satisfies me on the point. He admits that when he first visited the respondent in Seattle he had no intention of purchasing the property for himself and so gave her to understand and left her under the impression that he did not want to purchase, but to procure for her a purchaser. He disclaimed, it is true, her offer to pay him a commission for his services, but that, of course, made no difference, as he left her clearly under the impression he was to act as her agent to get her a purchaser.\nWhen he returned to Rossland he continued the misrepresentation and led her by letters to believe that he was in treaty with some third party for the purchase, and advised her to accept that third party's offer as being the best he could get out of them. As a matter of fact it transpires that the third party was his wife and that he himself had an interest in the purchase. He, therefore, occupied a position where his interest and his duty conflicted, and the authorities are conclusive that, in such cases, where there is a non-disclosure of that which it was the plaintiff's duty to disclose no specific performance can be granted. In this case there was not only non-disclosure but misrepresentation of material facts.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Mr. Shepley for the appellant conceded that if any fiduciary relation existed between his client and the respondent there was an end to his appeal. I have no doubt that the proposition involved in this may be supplemented by the further proposition that if there was anything in the language and conduct of the appellant which might have reasonably induced the respondent to believe that the appellant was acting as her agent there was also an end to his appeal; notwithstanding his peculiar idiosyncracies which enabled him to convey this impression and at the same time find for himself his way to reconcile the plain facts with a denial of such an obvious conclusion as forces itself on the minds of other people when considering the same.\nI quote hereunder from his evidence including the letter referred to and which is also copied, what I think leaves it open fairly to infer that the appellant's language and conduct led and purposely was intended to lead the respondent to the belief that he was acting as her agent, as her friend, doing her friendly service without compensation and to her implicitly trusting him accordingly. I think he thereby gained the advantage of a few hundred dollars in the price she asked, but at the same time lost any right he could have to enforce specifically a bargain he claims to have been made to appear in writing.\nQ. Who brought up the subject matter of the sale at all? A. Mrs. Thompson.\nQ. You called at her house in Seattle? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Did you have the purchase by yourself in view? A. Not at the time\u2014no.\nQ. What do you mean by that? A. I had no intention of purchasing the house at the time.\nQ. But you had the intention of discussing the matter of the purchase with her on that occasion? A. Well, I intended to talk about the property\u2014yes.\nQ. That is about her house here? A. Yes.\nQ. You were wishing then to purchase? A. To get a purchaser.\nQ. You didn't want it yourself? A. I didn't want it myself at that time.\nQ. So that when you left her she was under the impression that you yourself did not want to purchase? A. Yes.\n*******\nQ. So that during all these negotiations and this correspondence Mrs. Thompson thought you were acting as an independent adviser? A. No, I don't think she did.\nQ. What position then was she to think that you occupied? A. As a purchaser\u2014as getting a purchaser.\n*******\nQ.That is not the question I asked you. What position would Mrs. Thompson think you occupied in connection with this sale? A. I don't know what position\u2014I wrote an offer. ***\n*******\nQ. Were you yourself to have any interest in it ? A. Well, yes. *\nBy Mr. MacNeill. Q. You state here, Mr. Henderson, in your letter of January 24th (Exhibit 1), that the best offer you could get was $1,250. Did you really try to get a better offer than that? A. No, I didn't try ***\n*******\nRossland, B.C., February 4, 1907.\nMrs. K. A. Thompson,\nDear Madam,\u2014Your letter received and contents noted. You did not mention anything about the electric fixtures, taken from the rooms, whether you have them stored here or not. Also one of the windows that got broke by the explosion have they settled with you for the damages done, or have you put in a bill claiming any damages, as the property looks to a disadvantage. I have seen the party today and the best I can get out of them is one hundred more, or $1,350 all clear. While the price is very low I don't think I would miss a sale. If you decide to sell, wire me, as they are looking at other properties, so I told them I would have you wire at my expense, and send your deed to Macdonald & Winn, who will forward you the money when the title is got. I remain,\nYours respectfully,\nH. HENDERSON.\nIt is to be observed that the appellant swears positively he had no intention of purchasing the house at the time, and yet was to get a purchaser. What can all this mean but what I have said?\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I doubt whether the documents produced sufficiently disclose the essential elements of an agreement between the respondent and a contracting purchaser ; but, as the point does not appear to have been considered in the earlier stages of the litigation, I will deal with the case upon an examination of the topics which have been fully discussed before us and in the court below.\nThe appellant, before entering upon the correspondence on which the action is founded, intentionally led the respondent to believe that, as a friend, he was willing to help her to procure a purchaser for her house. Having thus begun, he opened the correspondence; and, in that correspondence, he professed himself to be acting as the intermediary between her and an offering purchaser. He tells her with particularity of interviews with this intending purchaser; an offer made and an advance on that offer; implies fruitless efforts on his part to procure a further advance; exaggerates the marks of dilapidation he finds on a visit to the property, and advises the respondent not \"to miss a sale.\" The appellant, all the while, was negotiating on his own behalf and the respondent learned of the elaborate deception thus practised upon her only when the action was brought. In these circumstances the appellant sues for specific performance.\nI think the appeal fails on this short ground. The facts either admitted or proved by the correspondence shew that the appellant, by disguising his real aims under the role of a disinterested friend and imposing on the confidence thus established, induced the respondent to act upon his advice and to accept an offer which it is probable she would not otherwise have accepted without, at all events, independent investigation. It does not require the authority of any specific decision to shew that a plaintiff who has procured a contract by such contrivances is not in a situation entitling him, on the basis of that contract, to advance a claim to equitable relief.\nI will add only a word about Fellowes v. Lord Gwydyr[2]. When that case comes to be examined by a court competent to review it, it may be found that, whatever is to be said about the decision itself, the reasoning on which it was based by Lord Lyndhurst as well as by the Vice-Chancellor is not quite reconcilable with principles established by more recent decisions. But there can be no doubt that, to the facts of this case, as I view them, that decision can have no application. In Fellowes v. Lord Gwydyr[3] the parties were at arms length and the Lord Chancellor, moreover, declined to draw the inference that the misleading conduct of the vendors had operated upon the mind of the purchaser to induce him to make the purchase. These circumstances alone are sufficient to deprive the decision of any relevancy to the points in controversy on this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E. S. H. Winn.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. H. MacNeill.\n[1] 1 Sim. 63; 57 Eng. R. 502.\n[2] 1 Sim. 63.\n[3] 1 Sim. 63.\n",

(1902) c. 152\u2014Notice of rejection\u2014Reasonable time \u2014Breach of warranty\u2014Damages.\nBy contract made at Winnipeg, Man., plaintiffs sold to the defendants, by sample, a carload of cured fish to be shipped during the winter from their warehouse at Canso, N.S., \"f.o.b. Winnipeg.\" The sample was sound and satisfactory. The fish arrived in Winnipeg in a frozen state and were received by the defendants and kept by them in an outhouse for several weeks before being placed in the freezer, the atmospheric conditions being such that the fish could not, in the meantime, have deteriorated by thawing. Some of the fish when sold proved unsound, were returned by customers and the whole shipment was found not up to sample and unfit for food. On inspection the health inspector condemned the whole carload and it was destroyed. About six weeks after the fish had been received by them, the defendants notified the plaintiffs of the rejection of the carload so delivered. In an action for the price at which the fish had been sold, the defendants counterclaimed for damages for breach of warranty and consequent loss in their business.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (17 Man. R. 620), that the sale had been made subject to delivery at Winnipeg, that any loss occasioned by deterioration in transit not necessarily incident to the course of transit should be borne by the sellers, that the loss in this case was not so incident, and that, under the circumstances, the purchasers had notified the sellers of the rejection within a reasonable time, as contemplated by the \"Sale of Goods Act,\" R.S.M. (1902) ch. 152; that the plaintiffs could not recover and that the defendants were entitled to have damages on their counterclaim. Appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Cameron J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiffs brought their action to recover the price of 800 boxes of fish sold by them to the defendants, to be delivered at Winnipeg, the plaintiffs agreeing to re-pay to the defendants any freight payable on the carload of fish shipped from Canso, N.S., to the defendants at Winnipeg, Man. The defendants pleaded, amongst other things, that the fish had been sold to them at Winnipeg, by sample, that they did not correspond with that sample and they had rejected and refused to accept the fish, and counter-claimed alleging breaches of warranty and claiming damages. At the trial, Mr. Justice Cameron found, on the evidence, that the sale had been made by sample, that the carload of fish did not correspond with the sample when delivered either at Canso or Winnipeg, and dismissed the action. He also held that the defendants were entitled to judgment on their counterclaim and made a reference to the master to ascertain the amount of the damages. By the judgment now appealed from, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba reversed this judgment, maintained the action to the extent of $1,393.70, and dismissed the counterclaim with costs.\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellants\nEwart K.C. for the respondents. The Chief Justice.\u2014One Connor, agent of the plaintiffs (respondents) a fish company having their principal place of business at Canso, in Nova Scotia, sold to the defendants (appellants) wholesale and retail dealers in fish at Winnipeg, two carloads of fish. The order for the first car was given on the 13th November, 1906, and the fish arrived in Winnipeg on the 18th of January, 1907. The second car ordered on the 14th of November, 1906, arrived on the 1st of February, 1907, and was taken into store on the 4th of the same month. The sale of the second carload was by sample and it is admitted that the sample produced was one of the finest. In the letter written by Connor, at Winnipeg, enclosing the order for this car to the plaintiffs at Canso, he (Connor) says that the carload was ordered \"on condition you ship them the same quality haddies as sample.\" Before the fish arrived and was taken into store, trouble arose about the quality of the first carload and another shipment of some 400 boxes had also gone bad. The haddie was intended for sale among the appellants' customers in both their retail and wholesale trade and was bought, as I gather from the evidence, because if in accordance with the sample it would suit the taste of these customers. The preliminary precaution of effectively testing the quality of the sample by cooking and eating it was taken by respondents' managers. It is, I think, admitted that finnan haddie cannot be properly inspected when frozen. In fact, it would appear from the evidence that the only effective test is to thaw and cook the fish. Be that as it may, on the 23rd of February, the defendants' manager Wall wrote complaining of the fish and requesting the plaintiffs to\ntake the matter of this haddie proposition up with their agent (Connor) who had made the sale, at once, in order that same may be taken off your hands as we will not, as we have already said, endeavour to dispose of the goods.\nA previous letter had been written on the 21st of the same month, and the defendants had also refused to accept a draft for the value of the fish. There is very little, if any, dispute or difference between the witnesses as to the quality of these fish after they reached Winnipeg. No answer was given to the letters of the 21st and 23rd February; but, on the 6th March, Connor, the selling agent, called at the defendants' store presumably to investigate the complaints made as to the quality of the fish and it was then agreed to have it examined, and one Guest was by mutual consent selected for that purpose. Guest says that some of the fish was not fit for use, and finally being pressed for details says:\nI mentioned to Mr. Wall and Mr. Connor that although the fish were not first-class there was nothing to prevent people from using them. That was my opinion of the haddies at the time.\nEliminating all the other evidence adduced by the defendants, can it be said that this finding was favourable to the plaintiffs? I think not. In the civil law, which counsel for the respondents says is applicable to this case, when a sale is made by sample, there is an implied warranty that the goods will, in all respects, be equal or conform to the sample, and any defect or inferiority, however slight, in the goods is sufficient to justify the purchaser in refusing to accept. Dalloz, 1873, 2, 100; Durocher v. Leitch[2]; R.S.M. ch. 152, see. 17.\nMy conclusion is that it was the intention of the parties to enter into a contract for the delivery in Winnipeg of fish fit for the trade for which to the knowledge of the sellers it was intended and equal in all respects to the sample exhibited by the plaintiffs' selling agent when the sale was made and the subsequent delivery of the fish and the taking of it into store by the defendants does not in the circumstances imply acceptance. The defendants (purchasers) were entitled to reasonable time and opportunity for inspection (section 33, \"Sale of Goods Act\") to ascertain if the fish corresponded with the sample and I agree with the trial judge that there was no improper delay in discovering the defective quality of the fish nor in the offer to return it. The fish was frozen and it is admitted that effective inspection was impossible except by adopting methods which would destroy its commercial value, and the defendants (now appellants) seem to me to have shewn every anxiety to give the shipment a fair test by the only effective means, that is, by sale to their customers, although in so doing they ran the risk of serious injury to their trade. With respect to acceptance and rejection, I hold this to be one of those cases in which one should apply the principle stated by the Geneva Court of Appeal:\nSortent du cadre des v\u00e9rifications usuelles auxquelles l'acheteur est tenu, celles qui ne peuvent se faire sans modifier l'\u00e9tat et l'apparence de la merchandise et sans diminuer sensiblement la valeur de celle-ci.\nTribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral Suisse, Journal des tribunaux, juillet, 1904.\nAs it was argued for the respondents that the Manitoba \"Sale of Goods Act\" was a mere codification of the principles of the Civil Law, I would refer in addition to 24 Laurent, No. 143, par. 2.\nAs to the counterclaim for damages, I find with the trial judge that there was an express agreement between the parties at the time of the settlement for the price of the first carload of fish fully reserving the defendants' rights and that allowances for any of the unsold portion which might thereafter be found not of first quality would be made. In the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice agrees that there was evidence to justify this finding. The case of Beer v. Walker[3] is, in my opinion, applicable in one aspect of the case. That is the case about the Ostende rabbits in which it was held that there is an implied warranty that goods sold for human consumption shall reach the buyer in condition fit for food and to continue so until the buyer can reasonably dispose of them in reasonable course of business, and it is no answer to say that they became unfit for food in the ordinary course of transit. In my view of the case it is not necessary to rely upon that authority. Here the seller contracted to deliver the goods at their destination, Winnipeg, equal to sample, and reasonable time for inspection and rejection must be allowed the buyer.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nGirouard J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought to recover the price of two separate carloads of finnan haddies sold by the plaintiffs to the defendants at different times. The defendants carry on the fish business in a large way in Winnipeg, and the plaintiffs catch, cure and ship their fish from Canso in Nova Scotia. They had an agent, Mr. Connor, at Winnipeg, and the sale of both cars of fish were made in that city by him. The trial judge found that the second carload was sold by sample and that it did not correspond with the sample when delivered either at Canso or Winnipeg. He further held that when defendants paid for the first carload of fish \"there was an express agreement fully reserving the defendants' rights\" to recover back for any fish in that car which they might shew were bad and unmerchantable. On his findings he dismissed plaintiffs' claim and gave judgment for defendants on their counterclaim, referring the question of the damages to which they were entitled on both cars to the master for assessment.\nOn appeal it was held that construing the language of the contract for the sale of the second car of fish sued for in the light of the plaintiffs' statement of claim that the goods were \"to be delivered at Winnipeg\" the contract must be held to have required delivery there and the property did not pass till such delivery.\nThe Court of Appeal also found that the defendants had the right to reject the goods in Winnipeg as not up to the contract if on inspection they were so found wanting, but after a lengthy review of the facts they determined that the defendants retained the goods for an unreasonable time after receiving them without rejecting them and after being aware of the defects in the fish, did acts in relation to them inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, and that there had, therefore, been an acceptance of the goods which became thereupon defendants' property entitling plaintiffs to a verdict for the price; that such acceptance of the fish threw upon the defendants the onus of proving their counterclaim for damages arising from the defective character of the fish; that the fish were of good quality and condition when delivered to the carrier at Canso, and that as defendants\nhad not shewn what the condition or character of the fish was when it reached Winnipeg or what caused the damage or when or where the fish spoiled whether during transit or afterwards, but kept possession of the fish until climatic conditions made the holding of them precarious, the loss must be held to have been largely caused by their own negligence.\nI agree with the holding of the Court of Appeal that the contract in the case must in the circumstances under which it was made be held to have\nrequired delivery of the fish in Winnipeg, and that the property in the fish did not pass till such delivery.\nSuch a determination does not necessarily follow from the use of the letters and words \"f.o.b. Winnipeg\" in the contract made. There is room for much contention as to their real effect and the language may be said to be ambiguous. But when we consider the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, that the agent of the plaintiffs and of the defendants both were in Winnipeg when they made it that the fish. were to be shipped from Canso, Nova Scotia, thousands of miles from Winnipeg, and delivered \"f.o.b. Winnipeg,\"' that they were to be in accordance with a sample then and there produced and that the plaintiffs in suing upon the contract expressly set forth in their claim that the goods were to be delivered in Winnipeg, I agree that the contention of the parties must fairly be determined to have been that the property in the fish should not pass until they were in Winnipeg ready for delivery to the defendants.\nI also agree with the finding of the trial judge, approved, as I understand from their judgment, by the Court of Appeal, that the contract was one for sale of goods by sample. The property in the fish did not, therefore, pass to the defendants until it was delivered to them in Winnipeg between the 1st and 4th February. The car seems to have reached Winnipeg on the first of February, but was not delivered over to the defendants till the 4th, and it is not shewn clearly on which day their agents, the cartage company, received the car from the railway company. It does not seem to me under the proved climatic conditions which then existed at Winnipeg a matter of any importance whether the car was delivered to the defendants' agents on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th as the fish could not have been injured during that time they being then in a solid frozen condition.\nIn this condition they were delivered to the defendants on the 4th and were stored in their winter shed adjoining their freezer where the defendants store all their fish during the cold weather. In this shed they remained until the 18th March when they were transferred to their freezer.\nThe conclusion of fact which I have reached from a close examination of the evidence respecting the temperature which existed from day to day and from the condition of the shed where the fish were kept from the 4th February until the 18th March when they were transferred to the freezer, and from the condition of a lot of other fish of defendants kept in the shed at the same time, and from the temperature of the freezer from that date of the 18th of March till the fish were examined and condemned by the sanitary authorities and destroyed as unfit for human food, is, that the fish were kept under conditions which would not and did not allow of their thawing out, and that the bad condition in which the fish were ultimately found to be in by the sanitary authorities must, therefore, have existed at the time they were delivered to the defendants at Winnipeg in a solidly frozen condition.\nAt the time of its delivery, therefore, although not known to the defendants and not capable of being known by any inspection or examination short of one which involved thawing of each box of fish out, the fish were not merchantable or up to sample.\nThe questions then arise as to what were the risks of deterioration which defendants were liable for before delivery to them at Winnipeg. The Manitoba \"Sales of Goods Act\" says those \"which were necessarily incident to the transit.\" Did these risks embrace deterioration caused by the freezing of the fish and their thawing and freezing again?\nThe trial judge held that the fish could not have been, from the condition in which they were proved to have been when thawed out, in good condition when delivered by the plaintiffs in Canso.\nThe appellants on the contrary hold that the evidence shews the fish to have been in good condition when so delivered in Canso and apparently fit for transit to Winnipeg, and that there was no evidence given by either side as to the treatment of the carload for the twenty-two days between delivery to the carrier and its arrival in Winnipeg, nor during the four days it was in Winnipeg before reaching defendants' warehouse.\nI do not feel obliged to determine whether or not the finding of the trial judge or that of the Court of Appeal as to the condition of the fish when delivered by the plaintiffs at Canso is a proper one, because it seems to me that, even assuming the goods to have been in good condition when delivered to the carrier there, unless the unmerchantable condition in which they were found in March and for which they were condemned and destroyed is necessarily attributable to risks which the buyer assumed under the 33rd section of the Manitoba \"Sale of Goods Act,\" then such condition must be held attributable to other risks for which the sellers alone would be liable. That section reads as follows:\n33. Where the seller of goods agrees to deliver them at his own risk at a place other than that where they are when sold, the buyer must, nevertheless, unless otherwise agreed, take any risk of deterioration in the goods necessarily incident to the course of transit.\nThat section adopts the rule stated in Bull v. Robison, in 1854[4]. It is limited expressly to cases where the risk would otherwise be the seller's as, under my construction of the contract, is the case before us where the goods were to be delivered in Winnipeg. The risks which, unless otherwise agreed, the buyer assumed are in the express language of the section \"any risk of deterioration in the goods necessarily incident to the course of transit.\" All other risks the vendor assumes. As said by Alderson B., in delivering the judgment of the court, in Bull v. Robison4:\nA manufacturer who contracts to deliver a manufactured article at a distant place must indeed stand the risk of any extraordinary or unusual deterioration, but we think that the vendee is bound to accept the article if only deteriorated to the extent that it is necessarily subject to in course of transit from the one place to the other, or in other words that he is subject to and must bear the risk of the deterioration necessarily consequent upon the transmission.\nAs so expressed the rule does not seem an unreasonable one. But I cannot think that the deterioration found in these fish was \"necessarily incident to the course of transit\" or necessarily consequent upon such transit. It might have occurred during the transit; it might not. It was not necessarily incident to it. To hold so would be to throw the entire risk in the case of perishable goods upon the purchaser who in a case like the present did not own the property till it was delivered to him in Winnipeg, and who under the contract had no right to dictate how the goods should be forwarded. The deterioration I hold in this case comes within the extraordinary or unusual deterioration exceptional or accidental for which the vendor assumes the risk as stated by Baron Alderson in the case referred to. The vendor was to deliver the fish \"free on board\" at Winnipeg. He was to pay the freight. He could send the fish in a refrigerator car and reduce the risk arising from changing climatic conditions to a minimum, or he could send them at a cheaper rate by ordinary car taking the risk himself, and in this case he chose to do so.\nThe remaining and the main question is whether or not the appellants accepted the goods within the meaning of the 35th section of the Act. That section reads:\n35. The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him, and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, or when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.\nThere was, of course, no intimation of acceptance and the questions remain as to acts of ownership inconsistent with ownership of seller or undue detention of the goods without notice of rejection.\nThese are questions of fact determinable in each case upon its own peculiar facts. Here we have a carload of fish in boxes delivered to defendants in a solid frozen condition. No mere outward examination or inspection would afford any clue to their real condition nor would indeed the removal of the box or package enclosing them do so. The only examination which would or could be in any sense effective to determine the condition of the fish would be by thawing out the contents of the boxes. But why should defendants be compelled to resort to that mode of inspection which necessarily destroyed all the boxes tested when there remained what has been shewn to have been the customary method of selling the frozen boxes of fish to customers who would properly and effectively determine their true condition by thawing out and cooking the fish. The defendants, pursuant to this mode of testing the fish, on February 9th sent ten boxes to their retail store. The result was most unsatisfactory and was probably known to defendants to have been so within a few days afterwards. On 23rd February defendants' manager, thinking that possibly he had not given the fish as fair a test as he should have done, shipped out seven boxes more of the fish to customers, and on the 26th four boxes and on the 27th four boxes, in all fifteen boxes. On March 5th plaintiffs' agent, Connor, returned to Winnipeg, from a business visit to the West and between that date and the 6th he saw Wall, defendant's manager, and after discussing the facts connected with the receipt of the goods by defendants and their condition asked him to make another test of the goods. It was not then contended on plaintiffs' part that defendants had by any undue delay on their part accepted the goods, but the two men ultimately agreed that one Guest, as a disinterested party, should test them and a number of boxes were thawed out at defendants' freezer and examined by Guest. His opinion was that some of the haddies were not good; some smelt quite strong and others were all right as far as he could see.\nThe result of this test was to confirm Wall in his conclusion not to accept or sell the fish and he so informed Connor, but after some conversation he agreed with Connor, who was not from Guest's examination satisfied the fish were bad, to give them another test and in consequence shipped out to customers the balance of about 120 or 125 boxes. All these fish sent out after the interview between Wall and Connor were so sent at Connor's request and after these further tests had been made and the results known the defendants wrote the letter of the 19th March rejecting the fish as being in a uniformly bad condition. Mr. Newcombe contended that there had been an absolute rejection by the 5th of March when the telegram of that date was sent by defendants to plaintiffs refusing to accept plaintiffs' draft for the price of the fish and asking for \"instructions as to the disposition of your fish.\" The telegram he contended read in the light of defendants' previous letter to plaintiffs shewed a clear rejection of the fish. The rule of law on the subject is clearly laid down on the point in Grimoldby v. Wells[5], where it was held that with regard to goods sold by sample the purchaser might reject them by giving notice to the vendor that he would not accept them and that they were at vendor's risk, but that such notice must, of course, be clear and unequivocal.\nIt does not appear, however, to be important to determine whether or not there was an unequivocal act of rejection on that day because within a day or so afterwards, sometime between the 6th and 9th March, the interview between Wall, defendants' manager, and Connor, plaintiffs' agent, took place on the latter's return from the West, at which interview Wall at first clearly rejected the goods, though he subsequently agreed with Connor to a further test being made of them by a disinterested party, Guest, and this test not being satisfactory to both parties ultimately agreed to give them another test by further shipments to his customers. The time lost in these several tests and trials of the fish made at the express request of plaintiffs' agent cannot certainly be counted as against the defendants, while in my opinion the fact that plaintiffs' agent, so far from contending that there had been an acceptance of the fish, urged the defendants to give them further trials is important in determining whether there had or had not been a lapse of a reasonable time in the retention of the goods by defendants without intimation to the seller that they had rejected them.\nThe 35th section of the \"Sales of Goods Act,\" already cited and set out, states what constitutes acceptance of goods by the buyer.\nThe only question which can arise under this section is whether or not there was undue detention by the buyers without notice of rejection.\nThis question of fact the Court of Appeal determined in the affirmative. Looking at all the circumstances of the case, the time when the goods were delivered, the then condition of these goods, frozen solid, the impossibility of testing their condition unless by the thawing out of each box or by sale to customers who would do this, the sale of the ten boxes on the 9th February and the subsequent sales of the fifteen boxes between the 25th and 27th February, the notice to Connor on or about the 6th March, when he returned to Winnipeg, of defendants' rejection of the goods, coupled with the subsequent agreement at the same interview between the two agents to have the fish further tested by Guest as an independent person, and the subsequent shipments by defendants to their customers at Mr. Connor's request after Guest had made his examination, the places and temperature in which the fish were kept from the time they were received by defendants till they were condemned and destroyed by the health authorities, I am satisfied that there was no such \"undue detention of the goods,\" that the defendants never accepted them, that nothing was done by the buyer with or to the goods inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, and that they were rejected within what under the peculiar facts and circumstances was a not unreasonable time for testing and ascertaining their condition.\nThe subsequent discovery by the health authorities of the absolute unsoundness of the fish convinces me that no prejudice could have been caused to the plaintiffs by the delay, and the conduct of defendants' agent on or about February 6th in having first an independent test made by Guest and in afterwards inducing defendants to send out further samples to their customers to further test them, satisfies me that at that time at any rate he at least did not think the fish had been accepted.\nCoupled with what I have already said of the temperature and conditions under which the fish were kept by defendants until they were condemned and destroyed I am satisfied that their condition was attributable to something which happened to them before or during transit and \"not necessarily incident to the course of transit,\" and that the delay of the defendants in rejecting them was not unreasonable under all the circumstances.\nSumming up my conclusions I would say: 1. That I agree with the Court of Appeal that the true construction of the contract provided for delivery by the seller to the buyer in Winnipeg; that the property did not pass until that delivery and that the sale was one by sample; that the \"risks of deterioration in the fish necessarily incident to the course of transit\" fall under section 33 of the \"Sale of Goods Act\" upon the purchaser, and all other risks upon the seller, and that, assuming the goods to have been delivered to the carrier at Canso in good and suitable condition, as found by the Court of Appeal, but upon which I do not express any opinion, any damage causing deterioration to the fish arising from their having been frozen and thawed during transit not being necessarily incident to such transit must under the circumstances of this case be held to have been accidental and exceptional and so must fall on the seller; that the fish when delivered to the purchasers' agent or carters in Winnipeg was in a frozen condition and was kept in such temperature and condition by the defendants after receipt by them as precluded their being deteriorated any further than they were when received, up to the time they were condemned and destroyed; that consequently the delay in repudiating acceptance of the fish, such as it was, did not operate to the plaintiffs' prejudice and was not under the circumstances unreasonable, and that therefore the defendants having finally rejected the fish on the 23rd March as unmerchantable and not in accordance with sample no right of action existed for the price of the second carload; that the claim of the defendants for such damages as they may reason- ably have sustained by reason of the plaintiffs' breach of contract was a good one with respect to both car- loads and had been preserved as far as the first carload was concerned by express agreement when that car was settled for and that therefore the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and that of the trial judge restored.\nIdington J. agreed in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs.\nDuff J. agreed with Davies J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Aikins, Robson & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tupper, Gait, Tupper, Minty & McTavish.\n[1] 17 Man.

When it expired the lessor notified the lessee that he would not renew and that he had appointed a valuator of the improvements requesting her to do the same, which she did. The valuation was made and the amount thereof tendered to the lessee which she refused on the ground that valuable improvements had not been appraised, and refusing to give up possession when demanded the lessor brought ejectment. By her plea to the action the lessee set up the invalid appraisement and claimed that as the lessor's option could not be exercised until a valid appraisement had been made he was not entitled to possession. By a plea on equitable grounds she again set up the invalid appraisement and asked that it be set aside and the lessor ordered to specifically perform the condition in the lease for renewal and for other and further relief.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed against (38 N.B. Rep. 465), Idington J. dissenting, that though the appraisement was a nullity that fact did not defeat the action of ejectment; that the acts of the lessor in giving notice of intention not to renew, demanding possession and bringing ejectment, constituted a valid exercise of his option under the lease, and that the lessor was entitled to possession.\nHeld, also, Idington J. dissenting, that sec. 289 of the \"Supreme Court Act of New Brunswick\" did not authorize that court to grant relief to the lessee under her equitable plea; that such a plea to an action of ejectment must state facts which would entitle the defendant to retain possession, which the plea in this did not do. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nEwart K.C. and W. B. Wallace K.C. for the appellant.\nMcKeown K.C. for respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Duff J.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with the opinions of Duff J. and Anglin J. dismissing this appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is the lessee of property described in a renewable lease which originally began to run in 1840 and of which the last renewal expired in May, 1907. This is an action of ejectment brought by the lessor since the expiration of the term to recover possession from the lessee whose only answer seems to be rested by the statement of defence upon the equity she claims to have arisen under the following agreement in the lease:\nAnd it is agreed by and between the parties to these presents, that at the end of the said term, the buildings or improvements heretofore erected, or which may hereafter be erected or made by the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators or assigns, on the demised premises, shall be valued by two indifferent persons, one to be chosen by each party, which two parties, in case of disagreement, shall choose a third, the appraisement of whom, or any two of whom, shall be conclusive, as to the value of such buildings and improvements; at which time it shall be in the option of the said Charles William K. Cunard, his heirs and assigns, to pay to the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators and assigns, such appraised value, or to continue the lease of the said premises to the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators and assigns, for a further term of twenty-one years, at the same yearly rent, under the like covenants in all -respects as herein contained and expressed.\nI construe this as containing mutual covenants by the parties that there shall be \"at the end of the term\" a valuation in the manner prescribed of buildings and improvements and then and not before the lessor shall declare his election and at least until he has after such finding so declared the lessee is bound to hold herself ready to renew.\nI think there is clearly an implied agreement that the lessee shall remain in possession pending the bringing about of what is expressly provided for as the basis of the further execution of what has been partly in express terms and partly by implication agreed to be done.\nIf ever there was a contract where the considerations \"of the terms of the contract in a reasonable and business manner\" as expressed in the very apposite words of Lord Esher in Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[2], gave rise and vitality to an implication, when due regard is had to what the surrounding circumstances and the evident purposes of the parties were, this is that contract.\nThe English cases of analogous import seem to be generally of a converse character giving the lessee the option, and hence in part the difficulty of finding authority.\nBut we have the American cases of VanRensselaer's Heirs v. Penniman[3], followed in Holsman v. Abrams[4], which seem very much in point, though I cannot assent to what is suggested there as to a tenancy from year to year resulting unless supplemented by payment of rent in the way which usually implies that. Nudell v. Williams[5] is in the same direction. The observations by eminent judges in Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[6] to the effect that cases upon other contracts are of little service stand good, yet the authorities largely got together in the argument of that case, and on the same subject of necessary implication under review from a different point of view in the case of Butterfly Co., Ltd. v. New Hucknall Colliery Co., Ltd.[7], in the current volume, exhibit the maintenance of numerous implications much less obvious than what I find here.\nHaving regard to the express covenants and necessary implications here, just as clear to my mind, I think a court of equity could in such a case restrain the lessor from proceeding in violation of his obligations in the premises. In view of the nullity of the award as made; of the ambiguous character of the lessor's election; of the possibility that there is no power to compel the appraisers to act and rectify their omission or the lessor to nominate another, or in any way do what obviously must be done to enable the lessee to obtain what by the findings of the learned trial judge is her right, I think it needless to elaborate how or why a court of equity could and should holding my view of the agreement find its way to restrain the respondent. Without extending the equitable jurisdiction given by the statute further than was in the somewhat analogous legislation of the \"Common Law Procedure Act\" done as applied to other cases than ejectment suits when the test was whether restraint could properly be applied unconditionally to the claim set up I think such an equity exists here.\nWhether in the case of a full explicit repudiation of all his obligations by the lessor which would clearly entitle the lessee to an action for damages the court, seeing he is a man of substance, might or not leave her to her action may not be clear, but he has created a most embarrassing situation I need not dwell on merely to make more so.\nBut in the case presented and holding the view I do of the nature of the obligations binding the parties and possible want of other remedy there should be no doubt of what course to adopt.\nThe defence, however, is maintainable at law and the pleading is amendable and we are bound to amend if need be to do justice. The respondent's right to eject could only arise when the lessee's holding became wrongful by virtue of the lessor's express election and demand of possession after a valid award. I see, however, no necessary implication that the appellant should be entitled to hold longer than until the lessee's election after such an award. To hold for an ulterior purpose of securing payment seems an extension of the term not fairly within the reasonable implications of the agreement.\nI would declare award void, allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the action. Duff J.\u2014The respondent is the owner of the reversion in certain premises in the City of St. John which, by a lease dated the 1st of May, 1886, were demised for a term of twenty-one years from that date to the appellant's predecessor in title. The lease contained a provision in the following words:\nAnd it is agreed by and between the parties to these presents that at the end of the said term the buildings or improvements heretofore erected, or which may hereafter be erected or made by the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators or assigns on the demised premises, shall be valued by two indifferent persons, one to be chosen by each party, which two parties, in case of disagreement, shall choose a third, the appraisement of whom, or any two of them, shall be conclusive as to the value of such buildings and improvements; at which time it shall be in the option of the said Charles William K. Cunard, his heirs and assigns, to pay to the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators and assigns, such appraised value, or to continue the lease of the said premises to the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators and assigns, for a further term of twenty-one years, at the same yearly rent, under the like covenants in all respects as herein contained and expressed.\nUpon the expiry of the term valuators were appointed who professed to make an appraisement pursuant to this provision. The respondent then notified the appellant that he would pay to her the sum found by the appraisement as the value of the improvements, and at the same time tendered that sum. This tender the appellant refused to accept; and the appellant having further refused to give up possession, in compliance with the respondent's subsequent demand, the action out of which this appeal arises was brought. On the argument before us the respondent's claim to recover possession was put upon two grounds: 1st, that the term vested in the appellant having expired, she was left without any right of possession; and 2ndly, that assuming some right of possession to have remained vested in her after the expiry of the term and pending the exercise by the respondent of the option conferred by the clause quoted above, that right has lapsed because the respondent has pursuant to that clause elected to pay the value of the improvements and to resume the premises demised.\nThe question raised by the first of these contentions need not in my view of the case be considered. To come to the second\u2014the plaintiff, upon the expiry of the term became entitled to elect whether he would \"continue the lease\" for a further term of twenty-one years, or pay the lessee for her improvements. It is not perfectly plain on the face of this clause at what point of time or in what manner the election is to be exercised. The clause is susceptible of several constructions; and of these both parties seem to have accepted the view according to which the lessor was bound only to make his election within a reasonable time after the expiry of the term, and might do so by any unequivocal expression of his intention.\nHas the lessor then exercised his election to pay for the improvements? In form he has admittedly done so. He has tendered the amount found by the valuators to be the value of the improvements; has expressly declared his intention not to renew the lease; has demanded possession; has brought ejectment. It is argued, however, that this ex facie valid exercise of his option to determine the possession of the lessee is vitiated by the circumstance that everything so done was done on the footing that there had been a valid appraisement of the improvements. It is not and cannot be seriously disputed that the valuators in making the appraisement left out of account improvements for which they ought to have allowed; or that this omission had the effect of invalidating the appraisement. Does this circumstance\u2014the invalidity of the appraisement\u2014affect the validity of the respondent's election?\nThe alternatives between which he was to decide, be it observed, were, in the words of the clause, on the one hand, \"to pay * * * such appraised value\" and on the other hand \"to continue the lease * * * for a further term of twenty-one years.\" His election might be effected either by evincing an intention \"to pay\" or by evincing an intention not \"to continue the lease.\" If we limit ourselves to evidence positively manifesting an intention to pay there is something to be said in support of the view that the respondent's acts indicated an intention to pay only the specific sum awarded by the valuators\u2014rather than the true value of the improvements as determined by a proper proceeding under the provisions of the lease. But, whatever may be said upon that point, the notice of the 22nd of June, 1907, was in explicit terms a communication of the respondent's intention not to renew the lease. In the light of that communication the effect of the respondent's conduct appears to have been simply this; that he had decided to resume possession and that he was proffering a sum of money which was as much as he admitted he was liable to pay as the value of the improvements. That, subject to the effect of any mistaken belief under which he may appear to have acted, was an irrevocable election to pay whatever the appellant might be entitled to.\nDid the respondent then proceed under any mistake which can be held to have deprived his acts of their normal legal effect? Had it appeared that both parties were proceeding under the belief that the valuators had made a complete valuation within the meaning of the lease, and that the respondent had exercised his option under that belief, when in truth the exercise of the option exposed him to a liability to pay a very much larger sum than that awarded by the valuators, it may be that (no equity intervening to prevent it, and the appellant insisting upon a valuation pursuant to the lease), the respondent would have been entitled to revoke his election. It would, nevertheless, even in that case, be revocable only at his option. I do not know upon what principle the appellant could insist on treating it as void so long as the respondent should be willing to stand by it. Here, however, evidence is wanting to support the contention that it was open to the respondent\u2014at all events at any time after the commencement of the action\u2014to recall his election. It is quite impossible I think to escape the inference that, at least as early as the time when the appellant refused the respondent's tender, the respondent became aware that she disputed the validity of the valuation. In these circumstances whatever might have been his rights up to that time, he must be taken by bringing ejectment to have concluded himself from setting up his mistake as a ground for withdrawing from the position he had assumed.\nThe appellant's defence consequently fails. But an important question arises respecting the cross relief claimed by the defendant. The facts do, I think, establish her contention as I have already intimated that the appraisement so called was wholly invalid; and it is, moreover, I think, sufficiently calculated to becloud her rights in regard to compensation and to embarrass her in the prosecution of her claim to give her a title to relief in a court of equity. The difficulty in the defendant's way is one which arises solely out of rules of procedure. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick has held that under the \"Supreme Court Act\" it is not within the power of the court to grant the appellant any relief in this action. One cannot help feeling that in the circumstances of this case it is regrettable that such relief cannot be given at once; but I cannot bring myself to entertain any doubt that this court would not be justified in reversing the decision of the court below on that point. The question is, as I have said, a question of procedure\u2014 whether the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on its common law side has power in this action to grant the relief claimed or whether on the other hand substantive proceedings must be instituted in the equity branch of the court. The course of this court\u2014and if I may say so the rule seems to me to be a wise one\u2014is that we do not interfere with the deliberate decisions of provincial courts upon matters which are matters of procedure only unless the determination impeached involve something like a departure from the requirements of substantial justice. It is impossible to say that there is any such departure in this case. I venture, moreover, to say that I have just as little doubt that on the merits of the question the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is right. The statutory provisions material for consideration to the point are these:\nSection 134. For the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of the two last preceding sections and of the provisions of this chapter relating to ejectment, respecting equitable defences, and for causing complete and final justice to be done in all matters in question in any action on the common law side of the court, the court or a judge thereof, according to the circumstances of the case, may at the trial or at any other stage of the action or other proceeding, pronounce such judgment or make such order as the equitable rights of the parties respectively require, and may make such rule or order as to adding third parties, or treating parties named plaintiffs as defendants, or parties named defendants as plaintiffs and as to costs and may direct such inquiries to be made and accounts to be taken as seems reasonable and just and may as fully dispose of the rights and matters in question as a court of equity could.\nSection 287. In case the defendant, or any other person not named in the writ who has obtained leave to appear and defend, has a defence to the action on equitable grounds, he may in addition to the notice denying the plaintiff's title, and asserting title in himself, state by way of defence the facts which entitle him on equitable grounds to retain possession; and such statement shall begin with the words, \"For a defence on equitable grounds.\"\nSection 289. The defendant may in such statement, as in a bill in equity or in answer asking gross relief, attack the title of the plaintiff on any ground whatever, and in all such cases he may pray and ask for relief against the plaintiff; and it shall be competent for the court on the hearing or trial of the cause in all such cases to grant or withhold the relief prayed for as law and justice shall demand, and generally to do justice and to determine all questions between the parties arising in the action according to law.\nSection 289 is the enactment mainly relied upon. The relief which the courts thereby authorized to grant the defendant in an action of ejectment would seem to be relief which is based upon a state of facts affording a ground for impeaching the plaintiff's title to which the court can give effect and does give effect as a defence to the action. In other words before the power conferred upon the court by this section can come into operation you must have facts sufficient to support an attack on the plaintiff's title and thereby constituting a defence to the action; then and then only, if on that state of facts the defendant would in a substantive proceeding be entitled to claim affirmative relief against the plaintiff the statute empowers the court (in order to give complete effect to the rights arising out of that state of facts), to grant that relief at once, without the necessity of further proceedings. My view of the section may be exemplified by supposing the case of a plaintiff in ejectment who bases his rights to possession upon a conveyance by the defendant which the latter alleges was obtained by undue influence. Under the \"Common Law Procedure Act\" that circumstance could not have been set up by the defendant as a defence in an action of ejectment. Chitty's Archbold (12 ed.) 1038. In an action in the King's Bench Division for the recovery of possession of land the defence might be set up and if established the deed treated as set aside for the purposes of the action only; but no order directing the cancellation of the instrument could be granted. To use the language of Brett J. in Mostyn v. West Mostyn Coal Co.[8], at page 150, the deed could not be \"set aside with regard to its effect in the future.\" The provisions in question here go a step further. Not only is the court authorized to give effect to the defence for the purposes of the action but any affirmative relief to which the defendant would be entitled in substantive proceedings in equity may be given in the ejectment action. It is a vastly different thing, however, to say that the court is empowered to grant such relief upon a state of facts which it has held to be wholly irrelevant to the plaintiff's claim. Such a case is, I think, plainly outside the purview of the section. And this is such a case; for here it has been held both in the court below and in this court that the invalidity of the so-called appraisement has no relevancy whatever to the respondent's claim for the recovery of the land.\nI concur in the declaration proposed by my brother Anglin and subject to that would dismiss the appeal with costs. Anglin J.\u2014The appellant (tenant) appeals from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick awarding to the respondent (landlord) possession of certain wharf property on the River St. John in the City of St. John. The lease under which the appellant held this property expired on the 1st May, 1907. It contains the following provision:\nAnd it is agreed by and between the parties to these presents, that, at the end of the said term, the buildings or improvements heretofore erected or which may hereafter be erected or made by the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators or assigns on the demised premises shall be valued by two indifferent persons, one to be chosen by each party, which two parties in case of disagreement shall choose a third, the appraisement of whom or any two of whom shall be conclusive as to the value of such buildings and improvements, at which time it shall be in the option of the said Charles William K. Cunard, his heirs or assigns to pay to the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators and assigns such appraised value or to continue the lease of the said premises to the said Anne Cunard, her executors, administrators and assigns for a further term of twenty-one years at the same yearly rent, under the like covenants in all respects, as herein contained and expressed.\nOn the 2nd May, 1907, the landlord notified the tenant that, under this covenant, he had chosen and appointed one Holder as his appraiser and that he required the tenant to appoint her appraiser. On the 21st May the tenant formally notified the landlord that she had appointed as her appraiser one Belyea. The two appraisers so appointed met and, being unable to agree, chose, as third appraiser, one Edgett.\nIn the course of the trial some exception appears to have been taken by counsel for the tenant to the right of the two appraisers, named by the parties, themselves to select the third appraiser. The trial judge overruled this objection and it was not renewed on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, nor has it been raised in this court. The appraisers proceeded to make a valuation, and eventually two of them\u2014Holder and Edgett\u2014concurred in an appraisement, dated the 15th of June, 1907, in which they valued the tenant's improvements at $2,550. There was some conflict of evidence as to whether proper steps had been taken to render the appraisement sufficient and binding without the concurrence of the appraiser named by the tenant. No objection, however, on this ground appears to have been urged in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and the point is not raised in this court. But the appraisers, as found by the trial judge\u2014this finding being affirmed in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick\u2014omitted to include in the improvements for which they made allowance, a portion of the wharf property which had been constructed of crib work and filled in, and which appears to be of substantial value. The courts below have expressed the opinion that upon this ground the appraisement is invalid. On the 22nd June the landlord notified the tenant that he had \"decided not to renew the lease\" and that he would pay \"the amount of said award and terminate the said lease.\" The tenant did not relinquish possession, and on the 23rd July the landlord served upon her a formal notice to quit. The notice of the 22nd June was accompanied by a tender of the amount of the award, and a similar tender was made to the tenant at or about the time when the notice of the 23rd July was given. The tenant still continuing in possession, the landlord brought the present action of ejectment,\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick, affirming Hanington J., has held that there is no agreement, express or implied, in the lease entitling the tenant to retain possession of the demised premises after the expiration of the term of the lease, and that the landlord upon his demand was entitled to possession thereof before exercising his option to take the property over and pay for the improvements. The tenant, appealing to this court, contends that it is a necessary implication from the provision of the lease as to renewal that she should have the right to retain possession until the landlord has exercised, in a manner binding upon him, his option, not to renew but to pay for improvements.\nThe tenant alleges that the landlord, in giving the notice of the 22nd June that he had decided not to renew the lease, proceeded upon the assumption that the award of the appraisers was valid, and that, in giving the notice of the 23rd July, he proceeded upon the like assumption; that, under the terms of the provision above quoted from the lease, the landlord is not bound to elect until there has been a valid appraisement of improvements; and that his election, in the mistaken belief that there had been such an appraisement, is not binding upon him. Therefore, the tenant claims, the landlord has not yet irrevocably elected not to renew and until he has so elected she insists upon her right to retain possession.\nCounsel for the landlord supported the judgment in appeal upon two grounds: (1) that under the terms of the lease the landlord is entitled to possession although he has not exercised his option against renewal; and (2) that he is entitled to possession, whatever the proper construction of the lease, because he has in fact irrevocably elected against renewal; and he took the position that his client has exercised his option against renewal in a manner binding upon him, and that he is prepared to abide by the consequences of having so exercised, such option, including the chance of there being a larger appraisement of the value of improvements for which the tenant is entitled to compensation, should the award already made be set aside and a new appraisement had.\nBy her pleadings and at bar in the courts below, as well as in this court, the tenant has asked that, in any event, upon the finding that the appraisement is invalid, she should be given judgment for consequential relief in the form of an order setting aside the award and directing a re-appraisement.\nIf, upon its proper construction, the provision above quoted from the lease allows the landlord to postpone the exercise of his option until an appraisement or valuation of the improvements has been duly made, that is a term inserted for his benefit and, upon the maxim quisque potest renunciare juri pro se in-troducto, he may waive his right to await the appraisement of the valuators and may exercise his option immediately upon the expiration of the lease. If, doing so, he elects not to renew, he takes his chances as to the outcome of the appraisement of improvements. I see no reason why, when the landlord asks that the decision in his favour be upheld because he has elected not to renew and declares that he has so exercised his option under the lease, he should not be taken at his word, and given judgment upon that ground. Gaudy v. Gaudy[9], at pp. 81 et seq.\nIt seems to me unnecessary to determine the somewhat nice question whether, if he had not exercised his, option, the landlord would be entitled to recover possession of the demised premises. If he should be so entitled, it would follow that, pending the appraisenient, he could eject his tenant, thereby seriously injuring, if not destroying, the business carried on by her on the premises, and yet, after the lapse of whatever time should be consumed in the making of a proper appraisement, he might notify the tenant that he elected to renew, when she would be confronted with the alternative of incurring the expense of moving back into the premises, and paying rent for the period during which she had been deprived of possession, or of forfeiting her right to compensation for her improvements. This not improbable situation affords a plausible argument against a construction which would give to the landlord the right to eject the tenant before he had irrevocably elected not to renew and also affords some support to the contention that the words \"at which time\" in the provision of the lease conferring his option upon the landlord were intended to relate not to the date at which the appraisement of the value of buildings and improvements should be completed, but to the date at which the term of the lease should expire.\nBut, inasmuch as the tenant's right eventually to recover the duly appraised value of her improvements will be protected by the estoppel of a judgment based upon a declaration, to which the landlord is willing to submit, that he has already made a binding election not to renew, I think that, varied by the insertion of such a declaration, the judgment for possession in favour of the respondent should be affirmed.\nThe respondent has also been awarded the sum of $250 for mesne profits since the termination of the lease. Of this the appellant complains. In view of the disposition of the main appeal, this portion of the judgment cannot well be interfered with. The right of the tenant to the cross relief which she asks, in the nature of an order setting aside the appraisement and remitting the matter of valuation of the appraisers for further consideration, depends upon the provisions of the statute law of New Brunswick applicable to actions of ejectment.\nThe Supreme Court Act (C.S.N.B. [1903], ch. III.) contains provisions with regard to equitable pleas similar to those of the \"Common Law Procedure Act\" (C.S. U.C. [1859], ch. 52), held not to apply to actions of ejectment (Neave v. Avery et al.[10]) and the \"Administration of Justice Act\" (Ont. 36 Vict. ch. 8). Amongst the latter are found, in sections 287 to 289, the provisions permitting defences upon equitable grounds in actions of ejectment. By section 287 the defendant is permitted to\nstate by way of defence the facts which entitle him on equitable grounds to retain possession.\nBy section 289 he is permitted to\nattack the title of the plaintiff on any ground whatever and in all such cases he may pray and ask for relief against a plaintiff.\nAs pointed out by Barker C.J. section 289 can \"only have reference to matters which would amount to a defence to the action, or which, in the language of section 287, would entitle the defendant to retain possession.\" The landlord having elected against renewal, it is obvious that the equitable plea of the tenant alleging the invalidity of the appraisement cannot constitute a defence to the action on equitable grounds. Neither does it amount to an attack upon the title of the plaintiff and, although by section 289 the court is empowered to grant or withhold the relief prayed for as law and justice shall demand and generally to do justice and to determine all questions between the parties arising in the action according to law,\nthis jurisdiction is conferred only in \"such cases,\" that is, in cases where the defendant puts upon the record by way of equitable defence a plea alleging matters which constitute a defence to the plaintiff's claim for possession\u2014which entitle the defendant on equitable grounds to retain possession. If, upon such a plea, the defendant is entitled to relief, the court is empowered to give it to him. But the foundation of the jurisdiction is a plea by the defendant stating facts which entitle him on equitable grounds to retain possession. The plea in the present instance does not fall within this description. It alleges matter wholly irrelevant to the plaintiff's claim for possession based upon his having elected against renewal and it does not, therefore, present a case in which the court is empowered to exercise the jurisdiction conferred by section 289.\nCounsel for the appellant directed attention to sections 133 and 134 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" These sections embody provisions of the \"Administration of Justice Act.\" (See 36 Vict. (Ont.) ch. 8, sees. 3 and 8.) Section 134 enables the court to\npronounce such judgment or make such order as the equitable rights of the parties respectively require,\nand\nfor the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of the two last preceding sections and the provisions of this chapter relating to ejectment, respecting equitable defences and for causing complete and final justice to be done in all matters in question in any action on the common law side of the court, * * * as fully dispose of the rights and matters in question as a court of equity could. This section, so far as it relates to an action for ejectment, for which a separate and distinct code is provided by secs. 275 to 385 of the \"Supreme. Court Act,\" appears to be limited in its purpose by the words above quoted. It is only for the purpose of carrying into effect the object of the provisions of sections 287-8 and 9 that the jurisdiction conferred by section 134 may be exercised in actions of ejectment. These provisions, as already indicated, do not extend to the pleading of equitable matters or equitable rights otherwise than by way of defence to the plaintiff's claim and it is only where they are properly so pleaded that relief can be given to the defendant in respect to them.\nHaving regard to these statutory provisions the proper conclusion seems to be that the appellant cannot in this action obtain the cross relief which she seeks in respect to the appraisement and which was refused her by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nFor these reasons, with the variation in the judgment above indicated, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George H.

[1897] c. 203, s. 168, s.s. 10(f)\u2014Construction of statute\u2014Gasoline \u201cstored or kept.\u201d\nOne of the conditions of the contract of insurance against fire imposed by the Ontario Insurance Act (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 203, sec. 168, sub-sec. 10(f), is that an insurance company is not liable for a loss occurring while gasoline, inter alia, is \u201cstored or kept in the building insured * * * unless permission is given in writing by the company.\u201d\nT. effected insurance on a building used as a drug and furniture shop having in his employ a qualified chemist who occupied rooms in the upper part as tenant. This clerk had a gasoline stove which he used occasionally for domestic purposes and later on he brought it down to the shop and used it in making syrups, and while doing so the building took fire and was totally destroyed.\nHeld, that this was a \u201ckeeping\u201d of gasoline on the insured premises within the meaning of the statutory condition, and the insurance company were not liable for the loss. Mitchell v. City of London Assur. Co. (15 Ont. App. R. 262) distinguished.\nJudgment appealed from (17 Ont. L.R. 214) reversed, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe only question reserved for consideration on this appeal was whether or not gasoline was \u201cstored or kept\u201d on the insured premises in breach of the statutory condition imposed by R.S.O. [1897] ch. 203, sec. 168, sub-sec. 10(f). The facts relied on to support the defence of so \u201ckeeping\u201d gasoline are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. All the other questions dealt with by the courts below were disposed of at the argument in respondent\u2019s favour.\nRaney K.C. for the appellants. \u201cStored\u201d and \u201ckept\u201d are not synonymous terms and effect must be given to each. \u201cKept\u201d is the more comprehensive word and its meaning cannot be cut down by the more narrow term preceding it. See Anderson v. Anderson[2] as to the principle of construction in such case.\nMitchell v. City of London Assur. Co.[3] can easily be distinguished. It was decided there that lubricating oil was, to the knowledge of the company, a necessity for the operation of the insured property and its use was, therefore, an implied term of the contract. Boyer v. Grand Rapids Fire Ins. Co.[4], was decided according to our contention in this case.\nAs to the condition being reasonable see Bastian v. British American Assur. Co.[5]; Johnston v. Dominion of Canada Guarantee Go.[6], at pp. 479 and 482.\nGamble K.C. for the respondent Thompson. Words collocated in a manner similar to \u201cstored or kept\u201d in this condition have frequently been held to mean the same thing. For example, \u201chave or keep\u201d in Biggs v. Mitchell[7]; \u201ccase or canister,\u201d Foster v. Diphwys Casson Slate Co.[8] In Krug v. German Fire Ins. Co.[9] a condition against using premises otherwise than for storage was not violated by a temporary use for other purposes. And the Ontario courts held the same in Mitchell v. City of London Assur. Co.[10]\nHellmuth K.C. for the respondent The Union Bank, referred to Strand\u2019s Jud. Dict, word \u201ckept\u201d: Farmer & Mechanics Ins. Co. v. Simmons[11].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014As I read the evidence it establishes these facts:\nThat the plaintiff\u2019s manager, Post, some time before the fire, brought upon the insured premises half a gallon of gasoline to be used in a gasoline stove with which he cooked his meals in a room over the store, where he lodged with his wife. While the gasoline was being kept upstairs where it had been used for several days by Post for cooking purposes an emergency arose in connection with the preparation of syrups in the store and the stove with what was left of the gasoline (about a pint) was brought down to a room at the rear of the store to prepare the syrups, and during the time that it was thus in use for this purpose the fire occurred. The question to be decided on these facts is: Was gasoline stored or kept on the premises insured in violation of the condition of the policy set out at length by Sir Louis Davies?\nThis is a mixed question of law and fact which, in my opinion, must, in the circumstances of this case, be answered in the affirmative. I hold that there was a breach of this positive condition and that the plaintiff cannot recover.\nThe object of this statutory condition, which is part of the consideration of the policy, is to decrease the risk of destruction by fire of the thing insured, and, by limiting the peril insured against, to proportionately lessen the obligation of the insurer to indemnify the insured; and to that end it prohibits the storing or keeping on the premises of the very inflammable substances enumerated, i.e., gasoline, etc. Can it be said that the insured did not violate this condition of the contract which he entered into with the company when he brought upon the premises gasoline, one of the prohibited articles, and which he kept there for several days and used in a gasoline stove for cooking purposes? I cannot find anything in the record to shew that there was any limitation of the time during which it was intended to use the stove for which the gasoline was required. It is said to have been discarded; but as a fact it was available for use at any time, as evidenced by the fact that the fire was caused by the use of the gasoline stove and its contents.\nI do not think it is necessary to either extend or restrict the meaning to be given to the words \u201cstored or kept.\u201d They are to be read along with the context and the whole section must have a reasonable interpre- tation, such as was probably contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was entered into. For a dealer to store or keep for commercial traffic during a protracted period the excluded substances on the insured premises under proper conditions of safety would, it is admitted, be a breach of the condition; but it is argued that to keep them for occasional daily domestic use during months under such conditions as common sense suggests are most likely to bring about the destruction of the premises is not a violation of such a condition. With proper deference and fully sensible of the weight to be attached to the opinions of the distinguished judges below, I am obliged to say that I cannot accept such a conclusion which necessarily involves the inference drawn by Mr. Hellmuth that the destruction of the property as a result of the use of gasoline in a gasoline stove kept on the premises is one of the perils insured against whereas the destruction of the property while gasoline is stored or kept under proper conditions as regards safety would not be a risk insured against.\nLet me repeat again to avoid possible misunderstanding: This is not a case of bringing upon the insured property an excluded article for a temporary purpose or for a purpose which might reasonably be contemplated or be assumed to be in the minds of both the insurer and the insured in view of the subject matter of the insurance, such as arose in the Mitchell Case[12], but was the keeping on the premises of an excluded article in a manner and for a purpose in direct violation of the condition of the policy. The distinction between the case where the excluded article is brought upon the premises for a temporary pur- pose, and one in which it was kept there in direct violation of the condition, is well exemplified in the cases of McCurdy v. Orient Insurance Co.[13], in 1906, and Boyer v. Grand Rapids Fire Ins. Co.[14], in 1900. In the latter case the court said, in referring to a previous decision of Smith v. German Ins. Co.[15]:\nIn the last named case the gasoline was in the building for the purpose of being used by the painters, when they were making ordinary and usual repairs to the building by painting it where it needed painting. The court discussed the questions involved at length, citing many authorities, and held, in substance, that the making of ordinary repairs, in a reasonable way, even though it increased the risk while the work was going on, and even though an article was used in the work the use of which in the business carried on in the building was prohibited by the policy, would not avoid the policy; that if the use of naphtha at the time and in the manner in which it was used was reasonable and proper in the repair of the building, having reference to the danger from fire, as well as to other considerations, it would not render the policy void, but the question was a proper one for the jury.\nThe case proceeded upon the theory that it was in the contemplation of the parties that the insured building should be kept in repair, and that what it was reasonably necessary to do to accomplish that purpose would not avoid the policy. But there can be no such claim here. It is a well-known fact that gasoline is a dangerous article to have in and about a building. The parties had a right to contract that it should not be allowed upon the premises without the written consent of the company. They made such a contract. Gasoline was brought upon the premises, not for the purpose of being used in a reasonable way for necessary repairs, but, according to the version of the plaintiff, for the purpose of using it in a gasoline stove in an upstairs room, having no direct connection with the store, but reached from an outside stairway. Would it be claimed that a gasoline stove could be used without the consent of the company, and that its use would not invalidate the policy? If not, could the keeping of gasoline be allowed on the premises for the purpose of using it in a stove without the consent of the company, and the policy remain good? If so, how much might be kept? And for how long? It seems to me to ask these questions is to answer them against the claim of the plaintiff. I agree with Sir Louis Davies. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014These were actions brought to recover moneys claimed to be due under policies of insurance taken out by respondent Thompson in the appellant companies. More than one defence was set up to the actions by the companies and argued upon this appeal besides that with which I will deal presently. These defences related to prior and subsequent insurances upon the property in question as to which it was alleged no notice as required by the policies had been given to the companies. They were all, however, disposed of at the argument adversely to the appellants, the only question reserved for consideration being that of the proper construction of the statutory condition R.S.O. ch. 203, sec. 168, sub-sec. 10(f), which reads as follows:\nThis company is not liable for the losses following, that is to say:\n(f) For loss or damage occurring while petroleum, or rock-earth or coal oil, camphene, gasoline, burning fluid, benzine, naphtha or any liquid products thereof, or any of their constituent parts (refined coal oil for lighting purposes only, not exceeding five gallons in quantity, or lubricating oil not being crude petroleum nor oil of less specific gravity than required by law for illuminating purposes, not exceeding five gallons in quantity, excepted), or more than twenty-five pounds weight of gunpowder is or are stored or kept in the building insured or containing the property insured, unless permission is given in writing by the company.\nThere was no dispute as to the facts relating to the fire which destroyed the insured premises or to the presence upon the premises at the time the fire occurred of a small quantity of gasoline, or to the circumstances under which it had been bought and remained upon the premises.\nThe respondent Thompson being the proprietor of a drug store, not being himself a licensed druggist, employed one Post who was so licensed as manager of his store. This manager was in charge at and prior to the effecting of the insurance and also at the time the fire occurred. He was also tenant of the respondent of the rooms above the drug store which he occupied with his family, all of which formed part of the insured premises.\nSome weeks before the fire Post purchased and brought to his rooms above the drug store half a gallon of gasoline which he used in a gasoline stove for cooking purposes for three or four days and then ceased to use it further for cooking purposes and left the stove with the unused portion of the gasoline in it in one of his upstair rooms.\nOn the clay of the fire he carried the stove and its gasoline contents down to a room in the rear of the drug store and there lighted the gasoline in the stove and began to boil some syrups. The stove had been burning some ten minutes or more when the syrup boiled over and the fire took place.\nThe fact that the fire took place as a consequence of the use at the time of the gasoline stove does not in itself affect the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. The sole question is: Did the loss occur while gasoline was \u201cstored or kept\u201d on the premises within the meaning of those words in the statutory condition?\nThe learned trial judge in a considered judgment after reviewing the cases upon the point came to the conclusion that to bring a case within the condition\nthere must be something in the nature of dealing in such articles or having a storehouse therefor;\nand that\nno court could give to the words a meaning wide enough to cover the present case. In the Court of Appeal the learned Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of the court after dealing with the facts went on to say that\nwhat is to be ascertained is the meaning to be attached to the condition as a whole.\nTo that I fully subscribe and inasmuch as the language of the condition is that of the legislature and not that of the company the court is not justified in construing the words for any reason against either insurer or insured. Effect must be given to the plain simple meaning of the words if that can be ascertained. The Chief Justice goes on to say:\nIs there any reason for separating the words \u201cstored or kept\u201d even though they were expressed in the disjunctive? If the intention was to exclude gasoline and the other substances mentioned in condition 10 (f) and the word \u201ckept\u201d has a wider and more extensive meaning than \u201cstored\u201d why use the latter at all. It must be taken to have been used in the ordinary sense and for some reason and as not unnecessarily inserted. And \u201ckept\u201d should also be read as not intended to nullify the meaning of the word with which it is associated. In other words they should be read together. Read together they indicate the continuous habitual storage or keeping of an article.\nI have italicized what I understand to be his conclusion which in another sense he puts as follows: \u201cIt would do no violence to either words to read them in this condition as they were by Hagarty C.J.O. in Mitchell v. City of London Ass. Co.[16] as\npointing to a dealing in such articles or having a storehouse therefor.\nBut Chief Justice Hagarty in the paragraph from which the above words are taken seems rather to rest his judgment upon the ground that the words \u201cstored or kept\u201d were not applicable\nto a lubricating oil necessarily used for machinery where machinery or a boat propelled thereby was the subject matter of the insurance\nas was the case then before him. As I understand the ratio of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case it was that the presence of the oil there in question on board of the tug was not within the condition of the policy, but was within what was held by them to be an implied exception, out of that condition. The Chief Justice so reasoned from the fact that the oil was as he said on board the tug \u201cfor the necessary purposes of lubricating the engine\u201d and with the knowledge of the insurance company as he says\nthe court must assume a universal knowledge that lubricating oil must be so used.\nIt was this combined necessity and knowledge which induced his conclusion that the condition did not cover this oil, but that on the contrary it was within the implied exception which permitted it. Chief Justice Hagarty goes on to say:\nNo person insuring a steam vessel against fire would think of obtaining express permission to keep enough oil to lubricate the machinery nor would, except after taking legal counsel, construe this clause in the statutory condition as prohibiting its use.\nOsler J.A. in the same case at page 278 while stating he was not prepared to differ from the Chief Justice rested his judgment upon the ground\nthat the statutory condition is qualified by the application which is a part of and is incorporated with the policy and which prohibits only the storing of camphene, coal oil or burning fluid without the special permission of the company saying nothing of petroleum or rock-earth oil.\nPatterson J.A. concurred with both Hagarty C.J.O. and Osler J.A., while Burton J.A. dissented from the judgment, but upon a ground having no relation to the one we are discussing.\nThis case cannot be said to be an authority one way or the other applicable to the appeal now before us. I am not able to accept the construction of Chief Justice Moss that the words of the condition \u201cstored or kept\u201d must be read as indicating a \u201ccontinuous habitual storage of an article.\u201d There may be authority for such a conclusion in some of the cases cited from the state courts of the United States on the language of the policies before those courts, but I cannot accept it with regard to this statutory class nor can I accept the alternative construction he suggests and which was adopted by the trial judge based evidently upon a casual observation made by Chief Justice Hagarty in the case of Mitchell v. London Assurance Co.[17] that they may \u201crelate only to something in the nature of dealing in such articles or having a storehouse therefor.\u201d I venture to think that both readings involve the importing into the section of a limitation never intended by the legislature and which the words used will not justify. I think there is reason to be found in the use of the disjunctive separating the words stored or kept, the latter being a word of broader and larger meaning than the former. If the word \u201cstored\u201d was alone used it might be held to import some commercial or business meaning only, and such as would be applicable to and understood in the world of trade and commerce. But I cannot see how such a limited meaning can be put upon the word \u201ckept.\u201d It has no special reference to dealing in an article as one of trade and commerce, and to so limit it must be to fritter away the language of the legislature. It must be taken as being used in its ordinary sense and as it would be understood by ordinary people and as inserted for some good reason and not unnecessarily or without meaning. It might be a reasonable limitation to say that the prohibition is not applicable to such very small quantities of the forbidden article, say a few ounces for medicinal or cleansing purposes as are not unusually found in ordinary households. A court might well determine without doing violence to the language of the clause that it did not prohibit and never was intended to prohibit such very small quantities, and obviously it must be a question in each case whether the quantities kept are within that limitation. But could such a limitation be extended to the pint, the remains of the half gallon, which was the unfortunate cause of the fire here? I feel compelled to say no. It is said that at the time of the fire there was only about a pint. But that was quite sufficient for the purpose of boiling his syrups by the chemist. Though the fact that this quantity of gasoline actually caused the fire may have nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s liability for the damage it would be almost ludicrous for the court to hold that it existed in a quantity so insignificant as to be innocuous or ignored.\nThere remains the ingenious suggestion of Mr. Hellmuth, which at the time impressed me somewhat, that under the condition the fire must have occurred while the gasoline was being \u201ckept\u201d on the premises and that this fire occurred not while it was being kept, but while it was being actually used for fuel. But if the conclusion is once reached that it was so being kept while it was being used for three or four days as fuel upstairs and for the period when it was abandoned as a fuel and simply remained in the gasoline stove, it is difficult to see when it ceased to be. kept simply because it was brought down stairs in the stove where it had been for some weeks and then ignited for the purpose of boiling syrups for the chemist\u2019s business. It seems to me to come back to the primary question: Was it not being \u201ckept\u201d when and while it remained in quantity a pint or more in the rooms upstairs after it ceased to be used for the three or four days as a fuel and did it not continue to be kept while it was being carried down and used in the room downstairs behind the drug store for the purpose connected with the business of boiling syrups?\nThe criminal cases called to our attention assist very little if any in the construction of this clause, and I am bound to say that after reading the different American cases cited I did not find them, owing to the different language used in the clauses of the policies discussed, and to the fact that they were conditions of policies prepared by the companies and so for special reasons construed must strongly against the party preparing them, of any great assistance in this case where we are construing the language of the legislature.\nTwo things in the condition in question are of importance with respect to its construction, one that with regard to certain of the prohibited articles several have a specified minimum quantity excepted or allowed; five gallons in the case of certain oils, and in that of gunpowder twenty-five pounds; and the other is that apart from such specific exceptions or permissions general words are used at the end of the clause qualifying the absolute prohibition, namely, \u201cunless permission is given in writing by the company.\u201d These latter words seem intended to meet the suggested cases where the arbitrary and absolute lan- guage of the prohibition might work intolerable hardship while the adoption of the suggested construction excluding such trivial quantities as a few ounces for cleansing clothes from stains or spots or for medicinal purposes in households from the operation of the prohibition relieves the clause from a construction contended to be obviously absurd and not within the intention of the legislature.\nThe appeals should be allowed with costs and the actions dismissed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The only question raised herein and now left for decision turns upon the construction of the statutory condition No. 10, sub-section (f), which as set forth in section 168 of \u201cThe Ontario Insurance Act\u201d was indorsed as required by that section on the policy sued on.\nThe purport of it is that the company is not responsible for loss or damage that occurs \u201cwhile petroleum\u201d or other things specified\nis or are stored or kept in the building insured or containing the property insured\nwithout written permission. The question to be resolved is the meaning of the words \u201cstored or kept\u201d as used in said condition.\nThe statutory conditions framed by a commission of judges were first imposed in 1876. The one now in question stood as first enacted until 1887, when possibly anticipating the decennial revision of the Ontario statutes, due to be done that year, the \u201cOntario Insurance Act, 1887,\u201d was passed and this condition was modified in the way I will presently refer to.\nMeantime the case of Mitchell v. City of London Fire Ins. Co.[18], which required for its decision that the condition, as it stood then must be interpreted in order to decide the rights of the parties arose out of an insurance on a tug. The tug insured had carried about two gallons of a lubricating oil which was a product of one of the forms of articles thus prohibited.\nIn deciding in 1886 that issue in that case the late Mr. Justice Armour of this court then sitting in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario after giving his reasons at p. 744 for doing so held as follows:\nIn my opinion the words \u201cstored or kept,\u201d as used in this condition, are too indicative of duration and permanence to cover a user such as was had of this black oil on this tug.\nThe late Mr. Justice O\u2019Connor, though doubting if a tug was a building expressly agreed in this holding and thus the majority of that court maintained the plaintiff\u2019s case.\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[19] where the late Chief Justice Hagarty, who had been of the commission which framed the conditions held, for reasons that appear on pp. 267 and 268, that the oil in question was not \u201cstored or kept.\u201d He says:\nIt is not \u201cstored or kept,\u201d in the apparent meaning of the words which seem to point to a different matter such as the dealing in such articles, or having a storehouse therefor.\nThis was concurred in by Mr. Justice Patterson, afterwards a judge of this court, and accepted by Mr. Justice Osler who, however, preferred to rest his judgment of that case on the express terms of the contract as evidenced in the application as he read it. He was also one of the judges who concurred in the judgment of the Court of Appeal now in question.\nAt first blush I was led by what is or appears, on closer reading, only mere illustration in Chief Justice Hagarty\u2019s opinion judgment to suppose he had proceeded on an implication to be found in the contract from the nature of the subject matter of the insurance. Clearly that is not his meaning, but a means of arriving at the same meaning of the phrase as Mr. Justice Armour had.\nAnd just as he finds everybody knew of the use of lubricating oil being in necessary use, so everybody knows of each of the other things.\nHe never intended to say this kind of lubricating oil was a necessity. He had lived too long in this world with an acute sense of what was going on not to know that lubricating oils of other kinds had universally been in use up to about twenty years before the making of the contract he was dealing with to imply any such thing.\nI have no doubt he did imply that under such a condition of things as existed the legislature could never have intended to put the meaning on \u201cstored and kept\u201d he was then asked to put and we are now asked to put.\nI cannot distinguish that case in principle from this one. It was put clear beyond doubt that the judicial interpretation of the words \u201cstored and kept\u201d as used in this condition did not cover the case of a casual having of any of the prohibited articles in a building whilst burnt down.\nWhat happened the condition, about a year later than the decision in the Queen\u2019s Bench, was that it was as already referred to amended by the \u201cOntario Insur- ance Act, 1887,\u201d inserting gasoline which had not previously been so amongst the things forbidden \u201cto be stored or kept.\u201d\nIt was further amended by inserting the following words in the excepting parenthesis of the condition:\nor lubricating oil not being crude petroleum nor oil of less specific gravity than required by law for illuminating purposes, not exceeding five gallons in quantity.\nThe judicial interpretation had evidently thus got legislative sanction in 1887 which has never been questioned since.\nThe general use of petroleum began about 1861 and increasing general use of its many products had also by 1887 become such as to enable those concerned to frame a more appropriate condition than had been done twelve years before. Gasoline is then for the first time expressly enumerated amongst the articles dealt with. And the term lubricating oil is used for the first time and then in the parenthesis, and distinguished from crude petroleum, and required to be of a certain specific gravity.\nIn no way does this indicate anything in the amending Act to shew that the legislature did not mean to use the words \u201cstored or kept\u201d in the sense attributed to them by the court.\nIn this amended Act I think the presumption is that the legislature did use them in the sense attributed to them by the court. See the cases cited, Hard-castle (3 ed.), p. 183 et seq.\nThe amendment of the \u201cInterpretation Act,\u201d by 60 Vict. ch. 2, sec. 11, now section 9, sub-section 59, of the \u201cInterpretation Act of 1907,\u201d R.S.O., whatever it may mean is not retroactive or of such nature as to touch herein this case now cited. The use of gasoline has gone on increasing and become so general that probably half the existing fire insurance in Ontario is for the moment practically worthless if we find as asked to do here that a pint of gasoline being in a building when fire takes place destroys the right to recover.\nWhatever may be said of the true meaning of the phrase in question especially in light of the curiously framed excepting parenthesis in the middle of the condition, I think that the meaning indicated expressly by judicial authority, sanctioned by legislative use immediately after such indication, and then upheld by such a mass of judicial opinion in the Court of Appeal immediately after that must be taken (when unquestioned ever since amid so vast a number of cases as undoubtedly have given opportunity to demand such interpretation as now sought by appellant), to have come to be regarded by all concerned as the meaning by which they were bound in their dealings in regard to insurance for the past twenty years.\nThe meaning adopted so long ago and followed by the Court of Appeal in the judgment now under consideration is in harmony with the meaning given amongst many others to the word \u201ckeep\u201d by the Century Dictionary \u201cto have habitually in stock or for sale.\u201d\nI respectfully submit we should always hesitate to adopt in the interpretation of either statute or contract a meaning that is likely to run athwart the common understanding of men in the ordinary conduct of their affairs, lest thereby the ends of justice be frustrated.\nThe adoption of the plain ordinary sense of the language used is daily and properly pressed upon us. The basis of the rule is to give to words and phrases that meaning, whether etymologically accurate or not, which passes current amongst men in relation to the business in hand.\nThese words in question here have come to have and be accepted as having in the relation now in question the meaning the Court of Appeal has applied.\nI think the appeal ought, therefore, to be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Davies.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014In the course of the argument the court intimated that, except upon one point common to both cases, the appeal of the insurance companies is hopeless. That point, reserved for consideration, is, whether, at the time the plaintiff\u2019s premises were destroyed by fire, gasoline was \u201cstored or kept\u201d upon them, within the meaning of statutory condition 10(f), prescribed by the \u201cOntario Insurance Act,\u201d R.S.O. (1897) ch. 203.\nThe facts are fully set forth in the judgments of the learned trial judge and the Chief Justice of Ontario[20], and in that of Mr. Justice Davies in this court.\nStatutory condition 10 (f) exempts the insurers from liability\nfor loss or damage occurring while * * * gasoline * * * is stored or kept in the building insured * * * unless permission is given in writing by the company.\nThis condition, when originally introduced in Ontario, as No. 10 (g), by the statute 39 Vict. ch. 24, did not apply to gasoline; but, by the Act 50 Vict. ch. 36, gasoline was included in the list of prohibited articles.\nIn Mitchell v. City of London Assurance Co.[21], in 1886, and[22] in 1888, the Ontario courts were called upon to interpret this statutory condition. A fire had occurred on a tug while there was upon it a small quantity (about a gallon in two small cans) of oil\u2014assumed to be \u201crock, earth or coal oil\u201d\u2014used for lubricating the machinery. Lubricating oil was not then, as it is now, excepted from the condition to the extent of five gallons. (See 39 Vict. ch. 24.) In the Divisional Court it was held by Armour and O\u2019Connor JJ. (Wilson C.J. dissenting), that crude or earth oils, kept for lubricating purposes in such a quantity as was on the tug, could not be said to be \u201cstored or kept\u201d within the meaning of the statutory condition.\nStoring or keeping an article seems to me to convey the notion of conservation, a keeping inconsistent with the destruction of continual or occasional use,\nper O\u2019Connor J., at p. 748.\nIn the course of his judgment in the Ontario Court of Appeal, Hagarty C.J.O., at p. 268, said that the oil was\nnot \u201cstored or kept\u201d in the apparent meaning of the words, which seem to point to a different matter such as the dealing in such articles, or having a storehouse therefor.\nPatterson J.A. concurred with Hagarty C.J.O. Osler J.A. preferred to rest his concurring judgment upon another ground. Burton, J.A., who dissented on another point, expressed no opinion upon the construction of the words \u201cstored or kept.\u201d\nSo construed in the Ontario courts twenty years ago, this statutory condition has since been used in many thousands of insurance contracts, and we find it unqualified in the policies now sued upon. Before its adoption in Ontario in 1876 it had received a like construction in the NewYork Courts, Williams v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co.[23], in 1874, and I respectfully agree in the statement of the Chief Justice of Ontario in the present case that\nthe trend of decision in the courts of the United States is in the same direction.\nIt is a wholesome rule that has often been laid down that when a well-known document has been in constant use for a number of years, the court, in construing it, should not break away from previous decisions, even if, in the first instance, they would have taken a different view, because all the documents made after the meaning of one has been judicially determined are taken to have been made on the faith of the rule so laid down.\nDunlop & Sons v. Balfour, Williamson & Co.[24], in 1892.\nIn Bourne & Tant v. Salmon & Grluckstein, Limited[25], the Court of Appeal when asked to overrule the Divisional Court decision in Direct Spanish Telegraph Co. v. Shepherd[26], in 1884, refused to do so. Cozens-Hardy M.R. said:\nMr. Macorran has frankly and fairly asked us to overrule that decision and to say that it is no longer law. I am not prepared to do so. I think it is a very serious matter in dealing with rates and questions of this kind lightly to depart from an interpretation which must have governed and guided the rights of parties in innumerable cases of a similar kind ever since.\nAnd Sir Gorrel Barnes said:\nI think it is extremely important where a decision has been in existence for some 20 or 25 years, which is practically on all fours with the case before the court, that the court should be very reluctant to entertain a fresh view of that old decision which might disorganize the state of things which had existed as a result of that old decision for that length of time.\nA similar view was expressed by Vaughan-Williams L.J., in Southwark Union v. City of London Union[27]. For other instances of the application of the rule reference may be made to Re Wallis; Ex parte Lickorish[28]; Pandorf v. Hamilton[29]; Philipps v. Rees[30]; Palmer v. Johnson[31]; Smith v. Keal[32]; Pugh v. Golden Valley Railway Co.[33]\nThe same rule is applicable to old and accepted dicta of eminent judges which are likely to have affected divers and numerous contracts. In re Rosher[34]; Quilter v. Heatly[35]; Ex parte Willey[36].\nThe views expressed in Mitchell v. City of London Assurance Company[37], are certainly not \u201cmanifestly erroneous and mischievous\u201d (Pugh v. Golden Valley Railway Company)33; on the contrary unless the meaning of \u201ckept\u201d is restricted in some degree by collocation with \u201cstored\u201d\u2014noscitur a sociis\u2014the latter word is practically expunged; neither are these views \u201ccontrary to principles of the general law\u201d (Smith v. Keal)32; nor have they been questioned in later cases (Labouchere v. Dawson)[38]. We are dealing with a \u201ccontract in daily use\u201d (Philipps v. Rees)30, and with a decision which\nis not binding upon us, but in view of its character and practical results is one of a class of decisions which acquire a weight and effect beyond that which attaches to the relative position of the court from which they proceed\u201d (Pugh v. Golden Valley Railway Co.)33 \u201cOne of those decisions which * * * it would be mischievous to overrule\u201d (Andrews v. Gas Meter Company)[39]:\nTo put upon the language of paragraph (f) of the 10th condition a construction different from that placed upon it 20 years ago by such eminent judges as Hagarty C.J.O. and Armour J., which, so far as I can find, has not since then been questioned in Ontario, and which, it is entirely proper to assume has been acted upon by insurers and insured during the intervening period, and now to hold that it is a breach of this condition to have upon the insured premises a small quantity of gasoline for domestic purposes, would, I think, be unfair and unjust, and could produce nothing but mischief and uncertainty in the mercantile world. On this ground alone I would affirm the judgment in appeal.\nI fully recognize that in the Mitchell Case[40] the article in question was something which both insurer and insured must have contemplated should be used, having regard to the subject of the insurance; and therefore a case of implied exception was made out. But the decisions in Williams v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co.[41]; Putnam v. Commonwealth Ins. Co.[42]; Mayor of New York v. Hamilton Fire Ins. Co.[43]; Hynds v. Schenectady County Mut. Ins. Co.[44]; Springfield Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Wade[45], and other American cases are not susceptible of this explanation. Moreover, I rely not upon the actual decision in the Mitchell Case[46], but rather upon the views as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cstored or kept,\u201d which the distinguished Ontario judges, whom I have named, expressed as a ground of their judgment.\nI was also impressed by the contention of counsel for the respondents that, whether or not the gasoline should be regarded as having been \u201cstored or kept\u201d while it lay in the disused stove upstairs; it certainly was not being \u201cstored or kept\u201d when it had been brought down stairs in the stove for actual and immediate use and consumption. At the time of the fire the conditions were the same as if the gasoline had been brought upon the premises only when the stove was carried downstairs. Gasoline thus in actual use and in course of consumption cannot be said to be \u201cstored or kept.\u201d Dobson v. Sotheby[47]; Maryland Fire Ins. Co. v. Whiteford[48]; Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. v. Lawrence[49]; Mears v. Humboldt Ins. Co.[50]; Krug v. German Fire Ins. Co.[51]; Fraim v. National Fire Ins. Co.[52] The fact that it had been previously \u201cstored or kept\u201d would be quite immaterial; Putnam v. Commonwealth Ins. Co.[53]; as is also the fact that the use of the gasoline actually caused the fire; Turnbull v. Home Fire Ins. Co.[54]; the excepted risk being confined to fire occurring while the prohibited article is actually \u201cstored or kept\u201d in the insured building.\nI find myself with great respect unable to agree in the judgment of the majority in this court. The appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed. Appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants Equity Fire Ins.

Cox v. Adams (35 Can. S.C.R. 393) followed, Idington J. dissenting.\nOnly in very exceptional circumstances should the Supreme Court refuse to follow its own decisions.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (17 Ont. L.R. 436) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial which dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe action was brought by appellant for rescission of conveyances and other documents which she executed to secure the bank for a large liability of her husband, the respondent, John Stuart. Mr. Justice Mabee, in giving judgment at the trial, states the facts as follows: \u201cMr. John Stuart, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, had for many years prior to 1896 occupied a very prominent position in financial and mercantile matters in Hamilton. He was the head of a large wholesale house, the president of the Bank of Hamilton and connected with other corporations.\n\u201cPrior to 1896 he had made large investments in the Maritime Sulphite Fibre Co. owning a pulp and paper mill at Chatham, N.B. He was the president of the company, his only living son was the general manager. Almost the whole of his available resources were invested in that company. The defendants were carrying the account and more money was urgently required if there was to be any likelihood of the company being made a success. On Feb. 6th, 1896, Mr. Stuart in a letter to the defendant says: \u201cHe (Mr. Lee, a fellow director) however knows that the $50,000 mentioned in the guarantee will not be sufficient to carry us through. * * * I shall find a surety to take his place. I explained to him, as to you, the pressing necessity for relief in money matters in Chatham during the next few days * * * Mr. Lee will either sign the guarantee in a day or two, or agree with me for a substitute; in the latter case my wife will join me in the guarantee and I now submit her name to you for that purpose, as I told you her means are ample enough to secure payment for a much larger sum than we contemplate requiring now or in the future. Pending the carrying out of these arrangements I trust you will authorize your Chatham branch to pay the company\u2019s cheques for funds required as follows: (Then follows a statement amounting to $7,500.) I would prefer as you will readily believe not to ask this favour lest it should meet the fate of similar previous ones, but it is based upon the proposals above recited and I trust you will have no doubt that my promise to complete one or other during the coming week will be kept.\u201d\n\u201cOn February 7th the general manager of the bank wrote saying the bank would advance $4,250 of the $7,500 asked and stating the balance could stand until the guarantee was completed and the following is a postscript: \u2018I think it only reasonable to ask, that if you offer Mrs. Stuart\u2019s guarantee, you should provide us with a statement of her means and ability to make it good.\n\u201cThe information was furnished shewing Mrs. Stuart to be possessed in her own right of real estate, stocks and mortgages to the value of about $250,000.\n\u201cOn February 24th, 1896, Mr. Stuart completed the proposed transaction, or rather the guarantee being that date was completed shortly afterwards, and the plaintiff signed a document guaranteeing advances to the Sulphite Co. up to $100,000.\n\u201cOn February 14th, 1896, she assigned in trust for the bank mortgages amounting to about $27,000 and on 11th April, 1898, she gave another guarantee to the bank for the Sulphite Co. advances up to $125,000. This latter was inclusive of the $100,000 guarantee, so her total liability was not to exceed $125,000.\n\u201cAdvances were made by the bank upon these guarantees and in 1903 the company went into liquidation and on October 2nd, 1903, the plaintiff and her husband gave the bank a mortgage upon all the real estate owned by them. On July 20th, 1904, a lengthy agreement was entered into between the bank and the plaintiff and her husband, the result of which was that the plaintiff gave up to the bank all her estate, both real and personal, in settlement of her guarantee. The plaintiff\u2019s husband at this time was liable to the bank upon a note $196,052 and a guarantee of $50,000 and he was discharged from this debt by the bank. Many stocks that the plaintiff owned, but which stood in the name of the husband, were pledged by him for advances from other banks, and the equity of redemption only in these was turned over by the settlement of July. There was nothing in the transaction to shew the defendants that these stocks belonged to the plaintiff and I have every reason to believe the officers of the bank treated upon the basis of these stocks belonging to the husband.\n\u201cOn Jan. 6th, 1903, Mr. John Stuart resigned his position of director and president of the Bank of Hamilton and received from them an agreement to pay him the sum of $5,000 per year as long as he lives, the payments to be made monthly in advance. Of course by releasing him from the indebtedness to the bank in consideration of both the husband and wife agreeing to make the transfers provided for in the settlement of July 20th the defendants put it out of their power to proceed for the recovery of the $5,000 per year payable by the Bank of Hamilton. Mr. Stuart said he had understood that was not available for creditors, but it is quite apparent that the defendants could have obtained judgment against Mr. Stuart and obtained a receiving order and swept away from him the monthly payments from the Bank of Hamilton. Many deeds were executed as provided for by the settlement of July, 1904. The properties turned over to the bank, stocks sold, some of the real estate, if not all, it was said in argument had been sold and the position of the defendants entirely changed. \u201cIn 1903, during the liquidation of the Sulphite Co., the defendants were in litigation with the liquidators and on October 6th, 1903, Mrs. Stuart joined in an agreement authorizing the settlement of that litigation upon the strength of which the defendants made compromises and otherwise changed their position and made a cash payment to the liquidator of $15,000.\n\u201cOn February 24th, 1896, five shareholders and their representatives transferred to the plaintiff 134 preference and 100 ordinary shares (in all $23,400) \u201cin consideration of Mrs. Jane J. Stuart giving a guarantee to the Bank of Montreal for advances made and to be made to the company to the extent of $100,000.\u201d Mrs. Stuart signed acceptances of the transfer of these shares upon the books of the company and from time to time gave proxies for them to be voted upon. In a letter written by Mr. Stuart to Mr. Bruce (who was a shareholder and guarantor to the bank) of February 12th, 1896, he says: \u2018The question at once presents itself what inducement can we offer to any one to assume the responsibilty of guaranteeing the necessary advances ($100,000 referred to in the letter) and how can the matter be arranged. * * * I believe I can procure the guarantor required by the bank for the new advances, on the security of a lien on material to the bank, and the postponement by Mr. Lee and myself of our claims for cash advances, together with a reasonable bonus in the way of stock which may under existing circumstances be considered of only nominal value. It is, of course, most vital to me to save this property in which my all is invested, and it is of no small consequence to all concerned, for all have not merely an interest in the value that is expected to be given to the stock, but also, perhaps, a more serious responsibility contingent on the unpaid debt due to the Bank of Montreal.\u2019\n\u201cOf course Mrs. Stuart was the guarantor referred to in the letter and in addition to the stock bonus which was given to her the postponement of the debt for cash advances was also executed by Messrs. Stuart and Lee. On February 26th, or thereabouts, and when the $100,000 guarantee was given by the plaintiff the advances already made and for which the plaintiff was becoming liable were about $20,000, but whether this sum included the $7,500 which Mr. Stuart was asking in his letter of February 6th, 1896, the bank to advance upon the strength of the guarantee being given does not clearly appear, but it is altogether likely it does include that sum as on February 20th the debt upon this head was only some $11,000. In any event the guarantee was not given for an entire past due liability to the bank; at least the sum of $80,000 was advanced upon the strength of the first guarantee and an additional sum of $25,000 upon the second guarantee being given.\n\u201cMrs. Stuart is a lady of intelligence and refinement. She was the sole executrix and devisee under her father\u2019s will and obtained in land and securities about $250,000 from that source upon his death in 1886. Her husband had had the entire management of her estate and in 1896 it stood at something like $240,000.\n\u201cPrior to becoming liable to the defendants in February, 1896, she had indorsed for her husband a note discounted and then held by the Bank of Hamilton for $125,000; that note was afterwards paid out of the proceeds of her securities, which with the transfers made by her to the defendants in 1904, entirely wiped out her fortune. \u201cShe says she had no experience in business matters, that she signed at her husband\u2019s wish, that she knew something of his business matters, and thought he had independent means, that she knew of his connection with the Sulphite Co. long before 1896, and that she also knew Messrs. Lee, Bruce, Brown and Leys were connected with it, that her son had been connected with it for many years and was the manager and that she and her husband were both hoping the company would offer to him an opportunity for a successful business career. She also says she knew there was nothing her husband was more engrossed in than the success of the company and that she knew he had a large amount invested in it, that upon that account and her son being manager she was also interested in its success. She says she consulted no one about the wisdom of her entering upon the guarantee, that she would have scorned to consult any one about the transaction and regarded it solely as a matter between herself and her husband, that she knew the bank would advance a large amount of money to the company that her husband and son were interested in upon the strength of the guarantee and that she intended the bank to act upon the guarantee and advance the money; that she was in no way under the control or influence of her husband, but exercised her own free will, and that she was sanguine about the success of the company if the bank would advance the money. She says that if her husband had said to her not to enter into the guarantee without asking some one else she would have refused to consult any person else, that she knew there was no sham about the guarantee and that she was becoming legally bound, that her husband did not make the slightest misrepresentation to her and she repudiates the suggestion that she was in any way deceived or misled. Then when giving the second guarantee she says she knew the company wanted more money and that that was the reason she was asked to give the additional guarantee. She did not remember getting stock in the company, but at once frankly recognized her signature in the company\u2019s books and to the proxies, although she had also forgotten about the latter. Then, speaking of the settlement made in 1904 when she gave up everything, she says she knew all the facts connected with the matter and had learned nothing additional to what she knew at that time; she knew of the arrangement the Bank of Hamilton had made to pay her husband an annuity of $5,000 per year and that the bank was releasing him from all liability. She knew she was conveying everything to the bank, that they could not keep up Inglewood (the Hamilton residence which also belonged to her) on $5,000 a year and that she intended the bank to get it.\n\u201cMr. Stuart says that no misrepresentations of any kind were made to induce her to sign any of the documents and that he told her \u201cshe was to get shares in the Fibre Co. as a sort of acknowledgment of her goodness in doing this.\u201d\nThe learned judge held that as the transaction was bon\u00e2 fide and there was no fraud on deception Cox v. Adams[2] did not apply his interpretation of the decision in that case being that there was not a majority of the court in favour of the principle that a married woman is entitled to the protection of independent advice. He therefore dismissed the action and on appeal from his judgment the Court of Appeal was equally divided and it was sustained. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHellmuth K.C. and W.J. Elliott for the appellant. Cox v. Adams2 is a binding authority for the proposition that the relation between husband and wife, as regards the necessity for independent advice, is the same as that between father and child or guardian and ward.\nAnd this is clearly the law in England as exemplified by Bank of Africa v. Cohen[3], decided in 1908. See also Bischoff\u2019s Trustee v. Frank[4].\nShepley K.C. for the respondents. All the cases in which a married woman has succeeded in setting aside a transaction into which she had entered are those in which there was fraud or deception. This was so in Cox v. Adams2, and the majority of the court in that case did not proceed on the view that the wife was in the protected class.\nIn Turribull v. Duval[5] also the decision was based on the ground of pressure, and concealment of material facts by the husband and the question of independent advice had not to be determined. The same can be said of all the cases relied on by the appellants.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The only question argued before us on this appeal was whether conveyances or securities given by a married woman of or upon her separate property to or for the benefit of her husband can be upheld as against her in the absence of independent advice before executing the documents, the beneficial assignee having knowledge at the time of her marital relationship. Or, put it in another way, whether under English authorities the wife stands towards her husband within those confidential relationships which, in cases where conveyances or securities are made or given by one to or for the benefit of the other, the law, on grounds of public policy, requires shall have the protection of independent advice in order to be upheld.\nIn the case of Cox v. Adams[6] this court had to consider the question very fully. A majority of the court, of which I was one, was, after full consideration of the authorities, of the opinion that the wife was within those confidential relationships and gave judgment accordingly. Mr. Justice Sedgewick, while expressly concurring in the opinions delivered by Mr. Justice Girouard and myself, held also that the securities in question in that case were avoided as against the wife by fraud, and, because of this, an attempt has been made in the courts below to distinguish Cox v. Adams6 from the case now before us, where no fraud is charged. But that additional ground adopted by Mr. Justice Sedgewick for the conclusion he reached cannot, in my judgment, weaken the authority of that case or make it less binding upon us than it, otherwise, would be. The learned justice fully agreed with the ground on which Mr. Justice Girouard and I, myself, rested our judgments, that the wife was within those confidential relationships. As I am of the opinion that the decision of this court in Cox v. Adams[7] is binding on us, I would allow this appeal with costs and dispose of the case in the manner proposed by Chief Justice Moss in the Court of Appeal.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014It is contended that the appellant, being a married woman living with her husband to the knowledge of the respondent when she signed, without independent advice, documents guaranteeing the respondent for advances made by it to a corporation in which her husband was deeply interested, could not thereby bind her separate estate, though the facts surrounding and leading to these contracts are such that, if she had before signing, gone through the form of hearing some such independent advice and had discarded it, the contracts would have bound her and her estate.\nI observed the difficulty her counsel had in defining this new doctrine as presumption of law or of fact and the qualification, in the latter case at all events, that might be some sort of consolation to some of those in Ontario concerned in some of the thousands of contracts entered into in that province, without observing the form demanded on the faith of the law not imposing such conditions.\nIt is attempted to rest the appeal on the case of Cox v. Adams7.\nI admit there are expressions in some of the opinion judgments in that case, reversing by a bare majority the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, going a long way, but I submit these opinions were not necessary in the view taken of the facts by two of that majority to the determination of the case, and, in short, do not form the ratio decidendi of their judgments.\nIt is one thing, in dealing with a case of fraud or undue influence, to remark upon the absence of independent advice, and quite another to hold that alone sufficient because of presumption arising therefrom.\nUnless there be in a case the concurrent opinion of at least the majority of a court as to the application of a principle of law on a point to be decided which, of necessity, has led to the determination of the suitors\u2019 rights found dependent thereon, its decision binds no one in a later case.\nI might well adopt and apply the language used in relation to a more extended view of the nature of authority by Sir William Markby, in his book on \u201cElements of Law,\u201d par. 99:\nThe nature of the process of reasoning which has to be performed in order to extract a rule of law from a number of decided cases by elimination of all the qualifying circumstances, is a very peculiar and difficult one. The opinion of the judge, apart from the decision, though not exactly disregarded, is considered as extra-judicial, and its authority may be got rid of, by any suggestion which can separate it from the actual result. Unless, therefore, a proposition of law is absolutely necessary to a decision, however emphatically it may have been stated, it passes from the province of auctoritas into that of mere literatura. Curiously enough it is not the opinion of the judge, but the result to the suitor, which makes the law.\nI might also refer to the remark of the late Sir George Jessel M.R., in Re Hallett\u2019s Estate[8], at p. 712, that\nthe only use of authorities, or decided cases, is the establishment of some principle which the judge can follow out in deciding the case before him. Another illustration of the nature of authority derived from decided cases is that of The \u201cVera Cruz\u201d[9], in which, on appeal, the court held a previous decision arrived at in appeal by an equal division had not the effect of constituting such decision authority in a later case in appeal.\nLet us see what those of the learned judges who composed the majority deciding Cox v. Adams[10] did say.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick says, at page 396:\nAfter many days not only of expostulation and entreaty, but also upon the most atrocious misrepresentation of his financial position and his prospects of ultimate success from property which he then falsely asserted that he owned, they both were induced to sign the notes which are the instruments sued on in this case.\nI look upon the whole thing as a conspiracy between Walmsley and Cox to rob, for their mutual advantage, those weak and trustful ladies. * * *\nAnd at page 397 speaks of it as\na deliberate attempt on the part of both to defraud them.\nAnd he expressly says, in light thereof, that\nthe equitable principles regarding undue influence need not be resorted to.\nAnd at page 398 Mr. Justice Girouard says:\nIf that advice had been taken, is it probable that the gross misrepresentations and fraud perpetrated by the principal debtor would not have been discovered by the solicitor inquiring either from Walmsley or elsewhere, as was done later on? etc., etc.\nAnd, at page 414, he says:\nI have less hesitation in arriving at this conclusion that I am inclined, on the evidence, to think that both these ladies, as in Turnbull v. Duval[11]; Bridgman v. Green[12]; Huguenin v. Baseley[13], and Smith v. Kay[14], were, in fact, badly pressed and grossly deceived as to the nature of the transaction, and that Walmsley became an active party to the fraud by the promise of $1,000, which it is hardly pos- sible, under the circumstances, not to consider as a reward to Cox for betraying the persons who were entitled to his protection.\nIf these learned judges intended to lay down the proposition it is now contended they did as the ratio decidendi of the case, I would not have expected this examination of the evidence for there was never any pretence of these ladies having taken independent advice.\nHence, I cannot feel assured from reading his judgment that the late Mr. Justice Sedgewick deliberately intended to concur in the view of his colleague Mr. Justice Davies as to the law when considered in relation to the wife as governing his decision.\nIn short, in the view taken of the facts both by him and Mr. Justice Girouard, there was no need to rely upon any such proposition of law so far as the wife was concerned. Comprehensive undiscriminating phrases of agreement sometimes mislead. Nor do I think when such widespread consequences depend upon the decision which could only be weighed by those since concerned in its interpretation by reference to the report of the case we should look elsewhere for assurances of its meaning; especially when we find three out of five judges able to distinguish it from this case.\nAnd I find Mr. Justice Sedgewick avowedly did not consider it necessary to come to any such conclusion of law, and, hence, proceeded on the facts as he viewed them to reach the result by the application of legal principles in no way affected by the proposition now in question.\nIf we are not bound by the decision of this court in Cox v. Adams[15], to hold otherwise, as I think we are not, there can, in light of the findings of the learned trial judge, be nothing clearer. I think, then, that this appeal is not maintainable.\nTo illustrate and apprehend the true position of the law of Ontario on the subject, let us observe its growth and remember that, at common law, the marriage gave certain limited and certain more extended, but conditional, rights to the husband in and over his wife\u2019s real estate and to possess her chattels real and to possess absolutely her specific personal chattels and, as to her choses in action, to reduce thein into his possession.\nI am not called upon here to go into the details of this brief outline of the husband\u2019s right or of the qualifications thereof nor to observe the distinct rights she might have arising from settled estates or other property held for her separate use. All I am concerned with is to recall the condition of things before the changes made in the law by modern legislation in the province whose law is now in question in order that we can understand how little it was possible under such a state of things to have arisen therein for the application to the dealings between husband and wife of the exact principles of law governing the relation between parent and child or similar relations.\nIn such cases the child\u2019s property was his or her own. and the weak were protected against the strong by the application of well-known principles to preserve to the child or other weak person his or her rights of or in property.\nBut when the husband requesting the wife to part with such property as Mrs. Stuart gave up here was only asking, apparently, what the law had so recently given to him, what field was there for such a principle to operate upon?\nWhen the enfranchisement of married women began and their power over their separate real estate was recognized, the husband\u2019s common law rights therein were, for a time, also recognized. She could not convey her real estate without him. And she was so protected by law that she could not convey it, even with him, save upon condition of a separate examination and judicial certificate that she was found, as a result thereof, to be acting free from the restraint of her husband.\nI need not dwell upon the details of this legislation or how, bit by bit, the husband\u2019s rights and her protection, in this mode or by such means, were at last obliterated.\nThe lesson to be drawn from this history is that, when the legislature was conferring thus upon the wife a dominion over her real estate and also her personal property it was, tentatively as it were, for a long time expressly protecting her against her husband as regards her real estate, but never applied that protection or seems to have dreamt of applying similar protection for the wife as to her personal property; much less to her power of contracting, which I am about to advert to.\nIn all this growth of legislation, the wife was gradually acquiring dominion over that which had, speaking broadly, been theretofore the husband\u2019s property or possible property. The enfranchisement had gone a long way and was something entirely inconsistent in principle with putting restraint upon the married woman.\nThose, I submit with respect, arguing for the main- tenance of safeguards seem to me to have entirely misapprehended the starting point of the married woman\u2019s emancipation, the condition of things in which that took place, and the process that has gone on which finally, for the present, ends in 60 Vict. ch. 22, now set forth in RS.O. [1897], ch. 163, and section 4 thereof, as to the meaning of the contracting power, as if a feme sole, previously conferred and appearing in section 3 of the last named chapter 163; both being now in question.\nIf the legislature in this long course of legislation and judicial discussion, I had almost said struggle, extending over nearly forty years, had ever intended in taking from the husband that which once was his, to prohibit him from merely requesting and receiving assistance unless through the channel of some independent advice, I think it would have said so.\nWhen protection as against her husband\u2019s influence so long guarded against in regard to her real estate until the injury and absolute futility of it was recognized and removed by the legislature, why should we partially re-establish it? Why, especially when the principle had never been adopted by courts in relation to the dealings of husband and wife?\nWe have been referred to many authorities quite beside what the history of this legislation tells was intended and this enactment expressly provides.\nWhat right have we to cut down the express power so given? Moreover, it is not in the case of a contract with the husband we are asked to do so, but in a contract with others knowing only the married relation existed and husband\u2019s partial interest. In this case his proportion of interest is large, but in many other cases it might well be his interest would be merely fractional with that of others, or of and with others, including the wife herself. Where can such a principle end?\nIt is not as if the legislation had invaded the common law rights of married women or some protecting right they had enjoyed at common law or protection by virtue of a long, well understood course of jurisprudence which required a wife, before contracting, to have and take the privilege of independent advice in order to enjoy the rights which this legislation has provided and suffer the burthens consequent thereon.\nThe relationship exists which will induce the courts to scrutinize closely the conduct of either party upon being charged with exercising undue influence.\nBut, notwithstanding expressions used in Cox v. Adams[16] and other cases, I submit with confidence no court has yet held that, from that relationship alone, there arises, upon mere request for either party to do or abstain from doing something which may enure to the other\u2019s benefit, any kind of presumption of undue influence. The court will, doubtless, require that the nature of the instrument signed be understood. This one seems to have been explained by a trustworthy solicitor, who, though solicitor for the bank, was not disqualified from doing that much, went no further and refrained from giving advice either way.\nThe act of signing such an instrument involved risk. So does every case of going surety and it would be much more sensible to prohibit married women, or for that part, unmarried women also, from ever going surety, than imposing an idle and possibly mischievous form. The legislative tendencies, how- ever, are entirely and perhaps wisely directed in an opposite direction.\nThe facts having been found as they were by the learned trial judge, and such findings not being quarrelled with by the Court of Appeal, and, taking the view I do of the legal result of Cox v. Adams[17], I think that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014In the determination of this appeal we are, I think, concluded by Cox v. Adams17. In that case, at page 415, Davies J. says:\nI rest my decision upon the principle that both the wife and daughter, at the time they signed the notes sued on, stood towards E.S. Cox in the position of parties having confidential relationship with him; that the law, on grounds of public policy, presumes that the transaction was the effect of influence induced by these relations, and that the burthen lay upon Walmsley, the indorsee of the notes and the beneficial plaintiff in the action, who took them with notice and full knowledge of the relationship, of shewing that the makers had independent advice.\nThe principle thus enunciated formed the basis of the judgment of Girouard J.; and, notwithstanding the acute critical examination to which the observation of Sedgewick J. has been subjected, I cannot bring myself to doubt that, upon the same ground, that learned judge also proceeded. It is true that the judgment of Sedgewick J. and, perhaps, also that of Girouard J., rested upon another ground as well; but \u201cit is,\u201d said Lord Macnaghten, in New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[18], at page 184:\nimpossible to treat a proposition which the court declares to be a distinct and sufficient ground for its decision as a mere dictum because there is another ground upon which, standing alone, the case might have been determined. Some question is raised, whether or not we are entitled to disregard a previous decision of this court laying down a substantive rule of law. This court is, of course, not a court of final resort in the sense in which the House of Lords is because our decisions are reviewable by the Privy Council; but only in very exceptional circumstances would the Court of Exchequer Chamber or the Lords Justices, sitting in appeal, (from which courts there was an appeal as of right to the House of Lords), have felt themselves at liberty to depart from one of their own previous decisions. That is also the principle upon which the Court of Appeal now acts: Pledge v. Carr[19]; and the Court of Appeal, in any province where the basis of the law is the common law of England, would act upon the same view. Quite apart from this, there are, I think, considerations of public convenience too obvious to require statement which make it our duty to apply this principle to the decisions of this court. What exceptional circumstances would justify a departure from the general rule, we need not consider; because there was, in the circumstances in which Cox v. Adams[20] was decided, nothing in the least degree exceptional. Mr. Shepley, with his usual candour, admitted frankly, what indeed is indisputable, that under the rule laid down in the passage quoted above from the judgment of Davies J. the appellant must succeed.\nI would allow the appeal with costs; the action should be disposed of in the manner proposed by Moss C.J.O. ANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant seeks to be relieved from liability upon a guarantee given by her to the Bank of Montreal.\nThe evidence establishes the following material facts.\nThe bank did not, in any sense, seek to have the plaintiff brought into its transactions with her husband. Its manager, however, knew that it was his wife whom John Stuart procured to become his guarantor and that Mrs. Stuart assumed liability in reality for the benefit of and as surety for her husband and without any personal gain or advantage to herself. She knew that the purpose of the guarantee was to render her, to the extent of her separate estate, personally liable for a large sum of money which the bank proposed to advance to the sulphite company, in which her husband was interested, and she intended that the bank should act upon her guarantee and advance the money. She was in nowise under the control of or influenced by her husband in the transaction, but exercised her own free will. She says that if her husband had suggested her taking independent advice she would have refused to consult any other person; and she repudiates the idea of any misrepresentation or deceit. She was not misled in any way and fully understood the nature of the transaction. On the other hand, notwithstanding Mr. Shepley\u2019s contention to the contrary, the only possible conclusion upon the evidence is that she had not, in fact, independent advice. The circumstances do not support the plea of laches urged by the respondent. The question, therefore, is squarely presented for decision, whether the mere fact that she acted without independent advice, notwithstanding the absence of fraud and un- due influence and of any misunderstanding on her part, enables the appellant successfully to repudiate her liability to the bank.\nThis question, which the Judicial Committee, in Turnbull v. Duval[21], at page 434, treated as not settled and expressly left open, was, it is contended by the appellant, definitely decided in her favour by this court in Cox v. Adams[22] in 1904. If it was, and if this court is bound to follow its own previous decision, this appeal must succeed. The respondent contests both propositions.\nI entertain no doubt whatever that the judges who composed the majority of this court in Cox v. Adams22, intended to formulate, and did, in fact, formulate, as the basis of their judgments, the propositions that the relation of husband and wife is one of those confidential relations in which, on grounds of public safety, the law presumes that an obligation, contracted by the person assumed to repose confidence for the benefit of the person in whom confidence is assumed to be reposed, has been procured by the undue influence of the latter and that he, or any person claiming the benefit of the transaction with notice of the relationship, can rebut that presumption only by proving that the obligor had, in fact, independent advice.\nDavies J., at page 415, in the report of Cox v. Adams22, expressly states that he rests his decision upon this ground, and he adds that\napart from this beneficial and salutary rule of public policy, the facts would not, in themselves, be sufficient to justify interference with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHe thus excludes the idea that the fraud and misrepresentation of the husband and his agency for the creditor, which Sedgewick J. expressly found (pp. 396-7), and which Girouard J. was also inclined to think established (p. 414), at all influenced or affected his judgment.\nGirouard J., after quoting the passage of Lord Lindley\u2019s judgment in Turnbull v. Duval[23] in which he leaves open the question whether or not, if impeached upon the sole ground of lack of independent advice, the security given by Mrs. Duval should be set aside, adds:\nIn the present case, the point of law must, I conceive, be determined. (p. 412.)\nAgain he says:\nI cannot see that a material distinction can be made between the case of the mother and that of the daughter. * * * I have come to the conclusion that the rule which governs the case of Miss Cox applies also to that of Mrs. Cox.\nThese passages leave no doubt as to the ratio of Mr. Justice Girouard\u2019s judgment.\nSedgewick J. commences his opinion by stating:\nI entirely agree with the conclusion at which my brother Girouard has arrived in his very able and exhaustive judgment.\nAnd he concludes by stating that as to\nthe equitable principles regarding undue influence * * * I can usefully add nothing to what my brother Girouard and my brother Davies have said.\nIn the course of his opinion he expresses very strongly his own view that the fraudulent and deceitful\u2014he calls it criminal\u2014conduct of the husband must invalidate the security in the hands of the creditor and that it is, therefore, unnecessary to resort to the proposition of law upon which Girouard J. rested his opinion. But I entertain no doubt that he intended to express, and did in fact express, as a distinct ground of his decision, his concurrence in the conclusions of Girouard and Davies JJ. that the equitable doctrine invoked by them was applicable to the case of Mrs. Cox.\nIn New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[24], Lord Macnaghten, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, says, at page 184:\nIt is impossible to treat a proposition which the court declares to be a distinct and sufficient ground for its decision as a mere dictum, simply because there is also another ground stated upon which, standing alone, the case might have been determined.\nIn Membery v. The Great Western Railway Co.[25], at page 187, Lord Bramwell said:\nOf course it is in a sense not necessary that I should express an opinion on this as the ground I have first mentioned, in my opinion, disposes of the case. But if, instead of mentioning that ground first, I had mentioned the one I am now dealing with, it would, on the same reasoning, be unnecessary to mention that. What I am saying is not obiter, not a needless expression of opinion on a matter not relevant to the decision. There are two answers to the plaintiff; and I decide against him on both; on one as much as on the other.\nReference may also be made to the remarks of Rose J. in Landreville v. Gouin[26], at page 464.\nBeing satisfied that all three judges who composed the majority in Cox v. Adams[27] (and only their opinions need be considered in determining what was the principle of the decision: Suffell v. Bank of England[28], at page 560) concurred in assigning as a ground of judgment the applicability of the rule above stated to the relation of husband and wife, we must regard this conclusion not as a mere dictum, but as the ratio decidendi of the case, and, therefore, binding, unless members of this court are at liberty to reconsider and review its former deliberate and explicit decision upon a question of law, merely because they would, if the matter were res integra, reach a different conclusion.\nCox v. Adams27 was decided in the year 1904. The rule against interference with a decision which has stood unchallenged and has been acted upon in transactions of daily life throughout the country for many years, especially if titles to property depend upon it. has no application in this instance. On the other hand, Cox v. Adams27 has not itself been questioned nor has the principle upon which it proceeded been controverted in this court, or in any tribunal of co-ordinate or quasi-co-ordinate jurisdiction, since it was decided.\nThe case of Chaplin & Co. v. Brammall, in the English Court of Appeal[29], proceeded upon the fact that the true nature of the guarantee given by the wife was not understood by her when she signed it, and is, therefore, distinguishable from the present case. The proposition involved here was not passed upon by the court. This is the only case at all similar to the present which has received consideration from a court of appeal, either in England or in this country since Cox v. Adams[30] was decided.\nBischoff\u2019s Trustee Y. Frank[31], though decided before Cox v. Adams30, does not appear to have been adverted to by counsel or by the court. But, in that case also, Mr. Justice Wright found that the defendant, whom he held not liable, did not sufficiently understand the nature of the guarantee which she had signed.\nIn Howes v. Bishop and Wife[32] Mr. Justice Jelf stated a proposition quite inconsistent with the decision in Cox v. Adams30; and in Bank of Africa v. Cohen[33], Mr. Justice Eve said that he would not be prepared to hold that in England the mere absence of independent advice would operate to avoid a contract of the wife for the benefit of the husband.\nIf the matter were res Integra in this court, I should certainly treat the opinions of Wright, Jelf and Eve JJ. and those of Leach M.R in Field v. Sowle[34], of Hardwicke L.C. in Grigby v. Cox[35], of Parker V.C. in Nedby v. Nedby[36], and of Cozens-Hardy J. in Barron v. Willis[37], as entitled to the very greatest consideration; but the opinion of any judge of first instance, however eminent, cannot be permitted to weigh in this court against a previous deliberate and definite decision by itself.\nHow far should we, in these circumstances, hold ourselves bound by the comparatively recent decision in Cox v. Adams30?\nThere are instances in which judges of this court have considered themselves free to decline to follow its earlier decisions with which they did not agree. In the Burrard Election Case[38], Gwynne J. (dissenting) expressed his opinion that the Supreme Court is competent to overrule a judgment of the court differently constituted, if it clearly appears to be erroneous. In Stephens v. McArthur[39], at page 460, Patterson J. (dissenting) said\nit is indisputable that, as a matter of principle, the reasons given by the court for its judgment in any case may properly be reconsidered, and, if found to be erroneous, corrected, when a similar question arises in another case;\nand he indicated that the Supreme Court of Canada should, in this matter, be governed rather by the rules which prevail in intermediate appellate tribunals\u2014such as the English Court of Appeal\u2014than by those which now govern such a final appellate tribunal as the House of Lords.\nIn the Stanstead Election Case[40] this court refused to hold itself bound by a previous judgment dismissing an appeal upon an equal division: Megantic Election Case[41]; but there is no case in which the court has refused to follow a previous judgment in which a majority concurred. The nearest approach to such a position is that taken by Strong C.J. in The Queen v. Grenier[42], where he says, at page 53:\nSince the case of Robertson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[43], it would seem that Vogel\u2019s Case[44] can scarcely be considered as a binding authority and, at all events, I should not hesitate to reconsider it if a similar question arose.\nIn The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Miller[45] Taschereau C.J. followed the decision in The Queen v. Grenier42, though, if unfettered by authority, he would probably have decided otherwise. Girouard J. also followed it, adding that he was of opinion that it was correctly decided. Davies J. accepted the Grenier decision as binding, as did also Killam J.,\nwithout intending to indicate any opinion upon the question involved. In the Privy Council[46], at page 195, in reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, Lord Davey significantly said:\nTheir lordships are not sure that * * * they are differing from the real opinion of the learned judges of the Supreme Court.\nI have not found any other case in this court in which a previous decision of the court, although tacitly, if not expressly, disapproved of, has nevertheless been followed.\nThe instances are innumerable in which the court has accepted its own previous decisions as authority without questioning their accuracy. In Salvas v. Vassal[47], at page 89, Girouard J. said:\nIl n\u2019entre pas dans les attributions de cette cour de reviser ses propres decisions.\nIn several judgments since The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Miller[48], there occur individual expressions of opinion that the court is bound by its own previous decisions. In Hebert v. La Banque Nationale[49], Idington J. says:\nThe case of The Merchants Bank v. Lucas[50] binds this court.\nIn Leroux v. The Parish of Ste. Justine[51] the court, considering that the case Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[52] was binding, quashed the appeal. In Canada Carriage Co. v. Lea[53], Davies J. held the Town of Aurora v. Village of Markham[54] \u201capplicable and conclusive.\u201d In no case since the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Miller48 has any member of this court, so far as I can find, expressed the view that the court is at liberty to decline to follow its previous decisions in matters of law.\nFor a summary of the history of stare decisis in England, and some of the authorities upon its application in English courts, reference may be made to the first book of Pollock\u2019s Jurisprudence (2 ed.), at pages 312 et seq., and to Beal\u2019s Legal Interpretation (2 ed.) pages 20 et seq.\nLord Eldon, Lord Lyndhurst and Lord St. Leonards are distinguished law lords who thought that judgments of the House of Lords did not absolutely bind the House itself. Lord Campbell always held the opposite opinion to which Lord Wensleydale, Lord Cranworth and Lord Chelmsford assented.\nSince the decision in Beamish v. Beamish[55] the House of Lords has consistently acted upon the latter view. Instances are to be found in Mersey Docks. Trustees v. Gibbs[56], at page 125; Houldsworth v. City of Glasgow Bank[57], and Darley Main Colliery Co. v. Mitchell[58], at page 134. Finally, in London Street Tramways Co. v. London County Council[59], it was expressly held by Lord Halsbury L.C., the other members of the House, Lords Macnaghten, Morris and James of Hereford, concurring, that\na decision of this House upon a question of law is conclusive and nothing but an Act of Parliament can set right that which is alleged to be wrong in a judgment of this House. (P. 381.)\nOn this sole ground the appeal was dismissed. It may be taken, therefore, as definitely settled that the House of Lords is bound by its own decisions. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council apparently claims greater freedom in dealing with its former decisions. This is illustrated in a passage from the judgment of Cairns L.C. in Ridsdale v. Clifton[60], at p. 306, quoted with approval by Halsbury L.C, in Read v. Bishop of Lincoln[61], at p. 654. See also Tooth v. Power[62], at p. 292. But the Judicial Committee is not a court of law in the strict sense. Its decision is the advice of a Board to the Sovereign.\nComing to the English Court of Appeal\u2014an intermediate tribunal\u2014we find cases in which that court has felt itself at liberty to decline to follow the decisions of courts of co-ordinate authority: Mills v. Jennings[63], at p. 648; and In re Dewhirst\u2019s Trusts[64], are instances. While the court still considered itself free to decline to follow judgments of courts of equal rank, the view was expressed that\nit would not be right to overrule the decision of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction unless we are clearly satisfied that it was wrong. (Per James L.J. in Wake v. Varah[65], at page 357.)\nSeveral other similar statements might be quoted. But in more recent years the Court of Appeal has held itself bound by its own previous decisions, as well as by those of English courts of equal rank. In Palmer v. Johnson[66], at p. 355, Brett M.R. said:\nA court of law is not justified, according to the comity of our courts, in overruling the decision of another court of co-ordinate jurisdiction.\nIn Nugent v. Smith[67] Cockburn C.J. stated, at p. 433: We (the Court of Appeal) are, of course, bound by the decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, in the case referred to, as that of a court of appellate jurisdiction, and which, therefore, can only be reviewed by a court of ultimate appeal.\nIn London County Council v. Schewzik[68], Ridley J. considered himself bound by Hull v. London County Council[69], the decision of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction, although, if applicable, he thought it wrongly decided. Joyce J. took a similar view in Lyon & Co. v. London City and Midland Bank[70], at p. 138. In Merry v. Nickalls[71], James L.J. said:\nTo say that the decisions are wrong in point of principle, if that principle was clearly laid down, does not relieve us from the obligation of following the principle of the decision, because the whole theory of our system is that the decision of a superior court is binding on an inferior court and on a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction so far as it is a statement of the law which the court is bound to accept.\nIn Pledge v. Carr[72], at page 52, Lord Herschell L.C. said:\nWe cannot overrule Vint v. Padget[73], for that was a decision of a court co-ordinate in jurisdiction with ourselves.\nand the appeal was dismissed solely on this ground. In Lavy v. London County Council[74] Lindley L.J., at page 581, said:\nThe case of London County Council v. Cross[75], is a decision which I not only think is correct, but it is a decision of the Court of Appeal which we should be bound to follow whether we think it right or not.\nIn Dibden v. Skirrow[76], at page 45, Cozens-Hardy M.R. said:\nI consider that the later decision (Hopkins v. Great Northern Railway Co.[77]) binds us. Fletcher-Moulton L.J. said:\nI base my decision on the ground that we are bound by that decision.\nFarwell L.J. said:\nIn my view, the case is governed by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Hopkins v. Great Northern Railway Co.[78], which, of course, binds us.\nIn Re North-Western Rubber Co. and Hiittenbach & Co.[79] Vaughan-Williams L.J., referring to Hutcheson & Co. v. Eaton & Son[80], said:\nWe are bound to follow that decision.\nBuckley L.J., although he would have come to a contrary conclusion if at liberty to apply his own judgment to the facts, felt constrained to agree with the other members of the court on the authority of Hutcheson & Co. v. Eaton.& Son80, a decision of Brett M.R., and Bowen L.J., from which Fry L.J. dissented. While preferring the view of Fry L.J., he thought he ought loyally to apply the opinion of the majority of the court. Other recent instances may be found in the following cases: In re Coles and Ravenshear[81]; In re Russian Petroleum and Liquid Fuel Co.[82]; Fear v. Morgan[83]; In re Stucley[84]; Fitzroy v. Cave[85]; Williams v. Hunt[86], and In re Ambler; Woodhead v. Ambler[87].\nIt is fairly well established, therefore, that the English Court of Appeal now holds itself bound by its own previous decisions in matters of law. Since the express decision of that court in Pledge v. Carr[88], it is quite improbable that any of its members will in the future hold the view that the court is at liberty, even for grave reasons, to disregard such decisions.\nIn the House of Lords, in the English Court of Appeal and in this court the recent judgments have all been in the direction of holding previous decisions of these respective courts to be binding on themselves. \u201cJudicia posteriora sunt in lege fortiora,\u201d 8 Co. 97\u2014\u201cJudiciis posterioribus fides est abhibenda,\u201d 13 Co. 14.\nA later and more deliberate decision should be followed in preference to one which is earlier,\nCaledonia Railway Co. v. Walker\u2019s Trustees[89], at page 302, per Lord Blackburn.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada occupies a somewhat peculiar position. From it no appeal lies as of right. By special leave an appeal may be had to the Judicial Committee. In the great majority of the cases which it hears it is a final appellate tribunal; in other cases, it occupies the position of an intermediate appellate court. But, whether it be regarded as final or intermediate, in view of the current of recent decisions to which reference has been made, the attitude of this court towards its previous decisions upon questions of law should, in my opinion, be the same. Of course, if the Privy Council should determine that the law is not what this court has declared it to be, the view of this court must be deemed to be overruled. A decision of the House of Lords should, likewise, be respected and followed though inconsistent with a previous judgment of this court. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict upon a question of law between a decision of this court and a subsequent decision of the English Court of Appeal\u2014should such a case arise\u2014in view of what was said by the Privy Council in Trimble v. Hill[90], the duty of this court would require most careful consideration. (See Jacobs v. Beaver[91].) But we should not, in my opinion, hesitate now to determine that, in other cases, unless perhaps in very exceptional circumstances, a previous deliberate and definite decision of this court will be held binding, if it is clear that it was not the result of some mere slip or inadvertence: Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council[92]. The decision of this court in the Stanstead Election Case[93], which is in accord with the views expressed in such cases as Smith v. Lambeth Assessment Committee[94], at page 328, and The \u201cVera Cruz\u201d No. 2[95], at page 98, may be deemed conclusive authority that judgments of dismissal which have proceeded upon an equal division of opinion are not to be regarded as decisions of this court, but merely as decisions of the court whose judgment has been thus affirmed. See, however, Lumsden v. Temiskaming and Northern Railway Commission[96], at pages 473, 474.\nThough, as stated by Brett M.R. in The \u201cVera Cruz\u201d No. 2[97], it is (except in Ontario, as to which see R.S.O. [1897], ch. 51, sec. 81) no doubt true that\nthere is no common law or statutory rule to oblige a court of law to bow to its own decision\u2014it does so on the ground of judicial comity\u2014\nit is of supreme importance that people may know with certainty what the law is, and this end can only be attained by a loyal adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis. I see no good reason why this doctrine should not be applied, and many very cogent reasons why it should prevail in this court. As tersely put by Pratt J. in Rex v. Inhabitantes de Haughton[98]:\nLittle respect will be paid to our judgments if we overthrow that one day which we have resolved the day before.\nThe case at bar is, no doubt, an important case. It may be in one sense \u201cnot an ordinary case.\u201d It may be that the application to it of the principle of the decision in Cox v. Adams[99] will do some injustice to the present respondents. But, to quote the Earl of Halsbury, in London Street Tramways Co. v. London County Council[100], at page 380,\nwhat is an occasional interference with what is, perhaps, abstract justice as compared with the inconvenience\u2014the disastrous inconvenience\u2014of having each question subject to being re-argued and the dealings of mankind rendered doubtful by reason of different decisions.\nI have discussed the authorities at length because, in Ontario, this case is regarded as very important and it has been a subject of much speculation how far this court would deem itself bound to follow Cox v. Adams99.\nSolely because I am convinced that the present case falls within the principle of the decision in Cox v. Adams99, and because I consider that that decision binds this court, I would allow the appeal of the plaintiff with costs here and below and would direct that judgment be entered as indicated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.

The County of Carleton originally joined with the City of Ottawa in applying to the Board for an order for this work. Subsequently the Village of Hinton-burgh, in which the proposed viaduct would be situated was incorporated with the city, and the work, which had been within a few feet of the county boundary was then distant from it nearly a mile. The county, therefore, withdrew from the joint application and it was proceeded with by the city alone. The Board, however, held that the county was still a \"party interested\" and in granting the application ordered it to pay a portion of the cost. The county appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada challenging the jurisdiction of the Board to make such order.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. and D. H. McLean for the appellants.\nMcVeity for the respondents the City of Ottawa.\nEwart K.C. for the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nW. L. Scott for the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\nThe Chief Justice and Duff and Anglin JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014The question on which leave to appeal was given in this case, from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners directing the municipality of the County of Carleton to pay a proportion of the cost of certain protective works ordered at the crossing of the Richmond Road and the Canada Atlantic and other railways, was limited to the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order it did as against the municipality of the County of Carleton.\nThe ground upon which the jurisdiction was challenged was that, while the crossing in question was, at the time the application was made to the Board for such protective works, within a few hundred feet of the municipal boundary, subsequently, before the case came on for hearing and at the time the order was made, the area within which the crossing existed had been legally withdrawn for about a mile from the municipal boundary and the intervening territory brought within the City of Ottawa and, so, the proposed protective works were neither within the municipal bounds of the county or immediately adjoining them.\nIt was contended on behalf of the municipality that it could not be held to be an \"interested party\" within the meaning of the \"Railway Act\" with respect to protective works ordered by the Board at highway crossings which were not within the boundaries of the municipality, and the more so in a case such as the one before us where, it was contended, the highway was not vested in the municipality, but in a toll company.\nAll questions as to sections 186 and 187 of the \"Railway Act of 1903\" being intra vires of the Parliament of Canada have been set at rest by the decision of this court in the case of The City of Toronto v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[1], and that of Toronto Corporation v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2], decided on appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nThe powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners to order municipalities to pay a proportion of the cost of protective works ordered to be built at highway and railway crossings on railways within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament so far as these crossings were within the municipal bounds or immediately adjoining them were, by these two cases, finally settled against the municipality.\nIn the latter case, decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, two of the crossings there in question were over a railway, the southern boundary of which was the northern boundary of the City of Toronto and so outside of but immediately adjoining the city boundaries.\nThe question raised in the case before us was whether a municipality was liable if the crossings where the works were ordered was beyond its bounds and not immediately adjoining them.\nI am unable to discern any substantial reason for limiting the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners in the manner suggested.\nIf that Board has jurisdiction to order a municipality to pay a proportion of the cost of any work ordered by it to be done at a railway and highway crossing in cases where that work is beyond the bounds of the municipality, even though adjoining it, I fail to see why its jurisdiction should cease if the crossing happened not to adjoin, but to be a short distance beyond the municipal bounds.\nThe municipality was not an \"interested party\" within the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" and so liable to pay a share of the cost of the work at a railway and highway crossing simply because the crossing was within its bounds or \"immediately adjoining\" them, or because the municipality owned the highway crossing the railway or being crossed by it, but because the works ordered were, in the words of the statute, for the \"protection, safety and convenience of the public\" and such\nas, under the circumstances, appeared to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction arising or likely to arise therefrom,\nand because the Board found the inhabitants of the municipality specially interested in these protective works. What Parliament was conferring on the Board were powers for the \"protection, safety and convenience of the public\" at the crossings, alike that portion of the public being carried by the railway and that portion using the highway.\nThe decision of the Board as to whether a municipality was or was not a party interested was made by the statute binding and conclusive. It is a question of fact to be determined under all the circumstances of each case. The circumstance of a crossing where protective works were ordered being within or without the municipality might be or not be, under all the special circumstances of the case, most material to the decision of the fact whether or not the municipality was an interested party, but it was not, in itself, conclusive. Such a crossing might be within the boundaries of the municipality and yet its inhabitants be very slightly interested in the protective works ordered, or it might be just beyond the precincts of the municipality and yet so situated that a large number of the inhabitants of the municipality were vitally interested in the protective works ordered. In each case the question of fact and the amount of the municipality's contribution were to be determined by the Board.\nThe municipality represented its inhabitants; the works to be ordered were works for the \"protection, safety and convenience\" of such inhabitants as part of the public; and the. degree and extent to which the municipality was to share the expense of the protective works determined on as necessary was to be decided by the Board. In all cases it was necessarily a question of fact to be decided in the light of all the circumstances and not necessarily dependent upon the arbitrary fact of the protective works being within or immediately adjoining the municipality.\nThough not within the express terms of the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case above cited, of Toronto Corporation v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[3], this case is within the reasoning on which that judgment and also the judgment of this court in the City of Toronto v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[4] above cited, were founded.\nThe following extract from the judgment of the Judicial Committee, as delivered by Lord Collins, shews, in part, the reasoning by which their lordships reached the conclusions they did:\nIn the present case it seems quite clear to their lordships that if, to use the language above quoted, \"the field were clear,\" the sections impugned do no more than provide reasonable means for safeguarding, in the common interest, the public and the railway which is committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislature which enacted them, and were, therefore, intra vires. If the precautions ordered are reasonably necessary, it is obvious that they must be paid for, and, in the view of their lordships, there is nothing ultra vires in the ancillary power conferred by the sections on the committee to make an equitable adjustment of the expenses among the persons interested. This legislation is clearly passed from a point of view more natural in a young and growing community interested in developing the resources of a vast territory as yet not fully settled than it could possibly be in the narrow and thickly populated area of such a country as England. To such a community it might well seem, reasonable that those who derived special advantage from the proximity of a railway might bear a special share of the expenses of safeguarding it. Both the substantive and the ancillary provisions are alike reasonable and intra vires of the Dominion Legislature, and, on the principles above cited, must prevail, even if there is legislation intra vires of the provincial legislature dealing with the same subject-matter and in some sense inconsistent.\nI think, therefore, the limitations upon the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners sought to be put by the County of Carleton in this case are not maintainable and that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe power of the commission as to directing a municipal corporation to aid in protecting a railway company has been, ever since The City of Toronto v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5], was decided here, dependent entirely upon the finding of the commission as to whether or not any of the inhabitants of such municipality were interested.\nThe majority of the court in that case held, as beyond doubt, that, if the inhabitants were interested, the corporation must be held so.\nI had supposed, until then, that though the inhabitants had been incorporated, they and the corporation were not, in law, convertible terms, and that the latter could only represent the former so far as its legislative creator had determined it might.\nI had also supposed that \"municipal institutions\" in a province, having as a subject matter been assigned by the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" to the legislature of the province, exclusively to make laws in relation to matters coming within such a subject so assigned, it was not competent for the Dominion Parliament either to add to such power as the creating legislature had seen fit to confer or, above all, to use these institutions for the purpose of levying taxes upon the inhabitants so incorporated when given no such power, merely to subserve the execution of any of the powers conferred on the Dominion.\nI had supposed any such corporation, in respect of its property, whether of roads or aught else, might, as any other property owner, become, of necessity, subject in relation to such property to the will of Parliament lawfully empowering or directing railway construction and suggested a line might well be drawn for exercising the jurisdiction now in question to cover this property relation, as within the manifest interest of the corporation.\nThe opinions given by the other members of the court left us no room for doubt that the line should not be so drawn or any line drawn save where Parliament saw fit to draw it.\nThe \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and the \"Railway Act\" so interpreted left the matter wholly to the commissioners to find and say what municipal corporations were \"interested\" within such meaning as was thus assigned in the latter Act.\nThis case was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and, later, The Toronto Corporation v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[6], not only carried quite logically (if I may be permitted to say so) the doctrine further than the former case; but also lays down so wide a principle of action to be applied that it is hard to see what appellants can have hoped to gain by thus flying in the face of judicial authority when armed only with nothing new but only such arguments as had proved of no weight in the highest courts of law entitled to pass upon the matter.

He signed a document authorizing the bank to realize on the same in its discretion, to grant extensions and give up securities, accept compositions, grant releases and discharges and otherwise deal with them as it might see fit without prejudice to B.'s liability. The note not being paid at maturity, the bank sued the Syndicat and B. upon it and on the covenants in the mortgages and obtained judgment against both. In the same action, the Syndicat, on counter-claim for damages for deceit, had judgment against B. which was eventually set aside, but, while it existed, the bank made a settlement with the Syndicat and discharged the latter from all liability on the judgment of the bank on payment of over $20,000 less than the debt. B. was not a party to this settlement and the bank afterwards refused to give him any information about it or to give him a statement of his account with the bank itself. In an action by B. for an account and to have the bank enjoined from further dealings with the securities:\u2014\nHeld, that the power given to the bank to deal with the securities was to be exercised for the purpose of liquidating B.'s debt, and, as to the surplus, for B.'s benefit; that, the settlement having been made solely for the benefit of the bank and in sacrifice of B.'s interests, the bank violated its duty, and had not satisfied the onus upon it of shewing that, had the whole amount of the judgment been recovered from the Syndicat, B. would not have benefited thereby.\nAPPEAL by the Canadian Bank of Commerce (defendant) and CROSS-APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory, in banco, varying the judgment and a supplementary judgment in the action by Craig J., and dismissing the appeal from the first judgment by the present appellant.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated, in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nA. W. Anglin K.C. and Glyn Osler for the appellant.\nHolman K.C. and Congdon K.C. for the respondent and cross-appellant Barrette.\nC. J. Bethune for the respondent, Le Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke.\nThe Chief Justice and Girouard and Davies JJ. concurred in the opinion of Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent Barrette sold several mining properties to the respondent, the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke, hereinafter called the Syndicat, and got from it for the balance of purchase money a promissory note for $92,500, secured by mortgages for the like amount respectively on the real and personal property so sold. These securities were all transferred by Barrette to the bank to secure such sums as he owed or might come to owe it, and the face value of them was largely in excess of any then existent indebtedness due by him.\nThe note fell due on the 1st October, 1902, and the bank sued the Syndicat as makers and Barrette as indorser and claimed under the mortgages also.\nThe Syndicat set up by way of counterclaim thereto a claim of damages for deceit alleged to have been so practised by Barrette as to induce the Syndicat to give the note for a larger sum than it should have given.\nThe claim was made against the bank that its local manager was either party to the alleged fraud or knew of it, and hence the bank not entitled to recover upon the promissory note or at all events only beyond the damages to which the Syndicat might be found entitled.\nThe case went to trial in this shape and after the trial had lasted some days (and I apprehend the charges against the bank and its manager had failed) Barrette agreed to plead to this counterclaim though not served and fight out the issue thus framed against him.\nUpon Barrette taking this bold stand the appellant had no further concern in the issue raised by the counterclaim and the Syndicat was content to fight out that issue with him and let judgment go against it for full amount of the note. The result was a judgment on the counterclaim dismissing it as against the bank, but in favour of the Syndicat against Barrette for $40,500 and for the bank for $101,204.15. against both the Syndicat and Barrette and a reference to adjust accounts on this basis.\nThis judgment for the bank never was intended to be against any one except the Syndicat and on the discovery of its standing also against Barrette, was set aside as against him some years after the order of release I am about to refer to.\nExcept for the interpretation of the said order of release we are not concerned how it came about or why it disappeared.\nThis judgment was entered up on the 4th of March, 1903. On the 1st of April, 1903, Barrette appealed to the court in banco, and on the 16th of June, 1904, that court reversed the learned trial judge's judgment and dismissed the counterclaim with costs.\nMeantime on the 6th May, 1903, the bank and the Syndicat having settled, carried out their settlement by means of an order in the case made by the learned trial judge on a consent signed by their respective solicitors, and without notice to or consultation with Barrette or his solicitors, who were served with it the same day.\nThis remarkable document, explicit in the earlier and main part of it as anything can well be, distributed the moneys in court between the bank, its solicitors and the solicitors of the Syndicat in sums aggregating $87,156.62 and proceeded thus:\nsaid payment being intended as a release and settlement in full from all and any claim for moneys, or costs, whatsoever between the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke in this action, or by counterclaim, and an adjustment of all matters of difference between them to this date.\nIt is further ordered that the plaintiff's suit against the defendant corporation the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke be and the same is hereby dismissed without costs and the counterclaim of the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke against the plaintiff be, and the same is hereby dismissed without costs.\nThis would, as I have said, seem comprehensive enough to release the judgment in which had merged the above-mentioned note in respect of which Barrette could only claim by and through the bank.\nIs its effect saved from such result by the following later part of the order? It is as follows:\nIt is further ordered that neither this order nor the settlement between the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke made this day shall, in any way, affect the rights or remedies, if any, which the above named defendant by counterclaim, Joseph Barrette, may have against the above named defendant the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke, or that the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke may have against the said defendant Joseph Barrette. Nor shall this order affect any rights which either the said Joseph Barrette or the said Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke may have to appeal the judgment now standing against the said Joseph Barrette in this cause, or any rights which either of them may have under the judgment now signed against the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke.\nWhat rights had Barrette that were covered by this? In law he had no rights against the Syndicat and hence no remedies. 'His rights on this judgment were through and against the bank to have it collect and account for this judgment thus released.\nHis other rights as to the appeal against the judgment of the Syndicat were his own and needed no reservation. Nor had the Syndicat against him any rights or remedies save relative to that under the counterclaim. At the date of this order of release the judgment stood against both as entered up improperly, but when the judgment is read as it now has to be, not as against joint defendants, but only as against the Syndicat, the paragraph seems senseless. Do the last two lines help the matter?\nI am unable to see how any officer of the court could have ventured in face of this order on record to have issued an execution to enforce the judgment. I suggested this difficulty in the course of the argument and am yet without any effective answer to it. Most ingenious and plausible arguments were put forward to shew that the purport of the whole dealing was to settle the judgment so far only as it stood then effective and until the reversal of the judgment on the counterclaim when such rights as Barrette had would enure to him.\nI fail to see how that reversal would revive any right in the officer of the court to enforce it by issuing execution. And I think no attempt having been made, as was open to the bank in this case, to rectify the form of release or restore the unpaid claim of Barrette, it must have deliberately intended and agreed to the absolute release that appears in the order and it could not hope to reform it.\nIf ever, men were properly pressed by a debtor, whose securities they had, to give needed explanation and help the bank managers and solicitors were by the repeated and long continued demands of Barrette's solicitors from the time of the reversal of the judgment.\nThey asked for an account and were told Barrette had his pass book and could make it for himself.\nComplications needless to dwell upon rendered this an inadequate and improper reply.\nWhenever that reversal took place it was Barrette's right and the duty of the bank, pressed as it was, to have issued execution to recover from the Syndicat, or if by reason of this order of release that course had become impossible to have had it amended or account for and make good the loss Barrette had incurred thereby.\nThey did neither. The manager said it was time enough to ask for an account when a demand was made upon Barrette that none was being made and thereupon being requested to hand over the securities he refused, and refused explanations of what the ambiguous settlement meant.\nThe correspondence lasted months before this action was begun.\nBarrette's solicitors repeat the request for an account and demand of the bank the transfer of notes, mortgages and all securities, etc.\nThis evoked a reply from the bank solicitors merely to refer to their answer of the 13th July, which states as follows:\nThe securities which were taken from the Syndicat remain in exactly the same position as they were before the settlement was made.\nThe bank are prepared so soon as final judgment is given in the case to deliver over these securities to the persons properly entitled thereto.\nThis statement was either true or not. If true the execution should have been issued on the reversal of the judgment against Barrette. And if the bank had no more claim or, as the local manager put it, were not making a demand on Barrette then it was none of the business of the bank to concern itself as to the future course of litigation between Barrette and the Syndicat.\nHe was entitled the moment the judgment against him was reversed, if the bank made no claim on him, to have these securities.\nHe was entitled also to know exactly what the bank claimed if it claimed anything as against or binding these securities.\nIn default of the bank discharging any of these several alternative duties I have referred to, Barrette was well entitled to bring this action as he did in October, 1904. Had it been tried then I cannot see what answer the bank could have had to it. And as to the measure of damages Barrette, on such a trial and reference as Avould have been had then, would have been entitled to claim by reason of the loss of his securities it would just have been that measure which the learned judge has adopted in the court below.\nThe bank could not answer then that an appeal was intended by some one, nor could it succeed in setting up the claim for the consideration of the damages arising out of the alleged deceit short of and unless it established as matter of law that such a valid claim existed.\nWe know now that no such valid claim existed; that the law was always against its maintenance and there is no room for speculation as to it.\nNor, I venture to submit, was there ever any room for speculating as to what this court or any other might or might not have done or ordered.\nIf the bank had duly discharged its obvious duty in law when it learned of the reversal of the judgment en banc in the Yukon, neither it nor any one else would have had occasion to speculate.\nIt would have been protected if the court had ventured to interfere, which I very much doubt.\nCourts have long exercised the equitable jurisdiction of setting off one judgment against another when between the same parties in the same rights.\nBut beyond this they have in many cases, and I rather think uniformly, refused to go.\nThese parties were not before the court in the same way and rights at all.\nThe bank had nothing to do with the litigation after its customer came in and the court relieved it.\nNor do I see anything in the circumstances set up of the threatened appeal by the Syndicat against the bank worthy of a moment's serious consideration. The Syndicat it must be remembered had and kept possession of the properties covered by these securities, dropped their contentions of notice to the bank and their utmost limit of relief was fixed at $40,500 as against Barrette long before the settlement. Beyond relief from a law suit there was nothing to compromise or justify surrendering Barrette's rights whatever the bank saw fit to do with its own.\nI therefore conclude that in either alternative construction of the order of release the appellant's case is hopeless. If a full release thereby is given of the judgment then the rights of Barrette were sacrificed as charged. If the judgment remained after the order in full force and effect to the extent of Barrette's rights, then the bank having it in its hands as a security by way of pledge or hypothecation failed to proceed upon it in accordance with law which is almost synonymous with common sense and a proper regard for the rights of others.\nAs to items of $2,500 costs claimed by the bank as paid between solicitor and client, I see no evidence to warrant them.\nWe have not the evidence upon which to determine that it was money properly and necessarily expended in defending the title to the security or of collecting it.\nAnd in the general way it is put merely as costs between solicitor and client I suppose it includes the charge for settling with the Syndicat including the charge for drawing up and getting the above order signed.\nI doubt if in such a doubtful cause of complaint as this relative to costs we ought to interfere except upon the clearest possible ground that there has been error which assuredly does not appear.\nAs to the judgment directing re-assignment of the securities for the value of which Barrette is to be allowed in the account I do not so read the judgment. Judgments in such cases usually provide for some officer of the court settling the reconveyance of securities when parties cannot agree and if any doubt exists that precautionary clause can be inserted now if desired.\nThe same sort of thing can be done if any wrong has arisen in regard to the requirement for evidence in writing.\nThat, brings us to the question of the costs of this suit.\nCounsel took some pains to make clear that there was and is still a debt due from Barrette to the bank which was not tendered when the securities were demanded.\nI have dealt with some aspects of that already. If the case rested on trover tender of amount due might be a necessary preliminary. The case does not necessarily rest on that ground. If the case is rested on the right to redeem and account incidental thereto, then there is no inflexible rule of law requiring tender of the debt, even to entitle to costs.\nIf the conduct of the mortgagee has been oppressive or unjust in the sense I have elaborated already as existent here relative to the demand for an account or statement of claim and extent of demands by the mortgagee not only is the mortgagor or pledgor freed from the ordinary liability to pay costs when no tender had been made, but is entitled to costs if the trial court sees fit to award them. I think, in view of the facts, they were righteously awarded in this case. I do not think on the evidence here the cross-appeal can be maintained.\nI think the respondent Barrette was entitled to his costs of suit as given; that this appeal should be dismissed with costs to respondents as against appellant.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of the liability of the appellant bank to account to the respondent Barrette for moneys with which Barrette alleges the bank is chargeable in the circumstances I proceed to mention.\nOn the 27th of June, 1901, Barrette transferred to the bank as collateral security for existing and future indebtedness two mortgages, one of certain chattels, and the other of certain mining claims executed by the Syndicat Lyonnais in favour of Barrette to secure payment of $92,500 payable in October of the same year, and a promissory note of the same date payable at the same time expressed to be collateral to the mortgages.\nThe Syndicat having failed to pay the sums due under these securities, the bank commenced an action against them upon the covenants in the mortgages as well as upon the promissory note, and on the 16th of February, 1903, judgment was delivered in the action. By that judgment it was adjudged that the bank recover from the Syndicat the sum of $92,500 with interest (in all $101,204.15). At the same time, and in the same action, Barrette was adjudged to be liable to pay to the Syndicat $40,500 on a counterclaim set up against Barrette by the latter. The judgment further provided that upon certain conditions being satisfied the Syndicat might have an account taken of the moneys owing from Barrette to the bank and that the Syndicat should be at liberty to credit on its judg- ment against Barrette any amount by which the sum recovered against it by the bank as mentioned above should exceed that indebtedness.\nIn the following April, Barrette appealed from the judgment against him. On the 6th of May, the bank entered into a settlement with the Syndicat which was embodied in an order of court of that date, and which it will be necessary to consider more particularly later.\nIn June, 1904, Barrette's appeal was allowed by the Territorial Court sitting in banco. From that judgment an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was brought by the Syndicat, and in the following May judgment was given in favour of the Syndicat restoring the judgment of the trial judge with a reduction of the amount awarded by that judgment.\nIn June, 1907, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada was reversed by the Privy Council, that of the Territorial Court in banco being restored and the counterclaim against Barrette dismissed.\nIt is not disputed that at the date of the settlement referred to the Syndicat had assets in the Yukon Territory sufficient to answer the full amount of the judgment recovered against them; and it is admitted that this condition of things existed in the following June when the judgment against Barrette was reversed by the Territorial Court in banco; when, however, that judgment (having been reversed by this court) was finally restored by the Privy Council, these assets had disappeared and with them all possibilty of recovering from the Syndicat the unpaid balance of the judgment.\nThere are two principal questions for decision. The first is whether in making the settlement referred to the bank violated its duty to Barrette in relation to the securities; and the second, whether, assuming it did so, the bank is chargeable at the suit-of Barrette with the full amount which could have been recovered from the Syndicat at the time the Territorial Court in banco delivered its judgment.\nAs to the first of these questions.\nThe effect of the transactions of June, 1901, was that the legal title to the securities was vested in the bank; and that the bank alone was invested with authority to enforce them or collect the moneys secured by them. Under the special stipulations of the letter of hypothecation (so called) of 27 June, 1901, the bank was empowered to realize the securities \"in such manner as to it might seem advisable\" to \"grant extensions, \"to \"enter into compositions\" and generally to \"deal with\" the parties to the securities as \"it should see fit,\" without prejudice to the liability of Barrette. The bank acquired in other words the full control of the securities to the exclusion of the plaintiff.\nIt is not necessary and I will not attempt to define with accuracy the precise nature of the duty which in these circumstances the bank owed the plaintiff in respect of the enforcement of the securities. This much is clear: the securities were to be realized, if realized at all, for the purpose not only of liquidating Barrette's debt to the bank, but as to the surplus, for Barrette's benefit. Respecting the manner in which this was to be done a discretion was under terms of the letter reposed in the bank; a discretion, however, controlled by the dominant obligation that it should be exercised in good faith with a view to the purpose for which it was conferred, viz., to realize the moneys owing upon the securities and so far as with reason-able diligence it could be done to realize the full amount. In this view and for this purpose the bank might grant extensions, enter into compositions or special arrangements; but only in this view, and for this purpose. A compromise framed with an eye to the interests of the bank alone, in which the interests of Barrette should be recklessly disregarded or wilfully sacrificed would involve a plain violation of duty on the part of the bank. This, I think, is as much as it is necessary to say upon this point for the purpose of this case.\nThere was a good deal of controversy as to the effect of the settlement in question. I do not think it really necessary to determine the precise legal effect of it. It was argued and, I think, it is quite clear that until the judgment against Barrette on the Syndicat's counterclaim was reversed, the judgment against the Syndicat could not have been enforced beyond the amount due the bank from Barrette. But the moment the judgment on the counterclaim should be reversed the situation would become wholly changed; in that contingency it would be the plain right of Barrette in the ordinary course to have the judgment enforced to the full extent of his interest in it, to have, that is to say, payment of it or, if proceedings were to be stayed pending a further appeal, to have proper provision made by way of security for the protection of his rights in the meantime.\nNow nobody disputes that the documents in which the settlement is embodied are at least ambiguous; and it is perfectly clear that if those documents did\u2014as the bank contends\u2014reserve to Barrette the right, in the name of the bank, to enforce the judgment against the Syndicat to the extent to which Barrette should be interested in that judgment, then it is also plain that the stipulation in the settlement providing that the action be dismissed was to the extent of that interest nugatory; and that was, of course, a contention which the Syndicat would have disputed to the full extent of its means and ability. Thus Barrette's rights were beclouded by the settlement to such an extent as most seriously to impede him in the enforcement of them, if he should succeed in his appeal; so much so indeed as to substitute for a judgment against the Syndicat a stubborn and doubtful\u2014and, in my view, a hopeless\u2014dispute with the Syndicat. But the grounds of com-plaint against the bank do not end there. The settlement Avas made behind Barrette's back; the bank re-fused to give his solicitors information respecting the terms of it; and refused, too, after the judgment against Barrette had been reversed, to give him the information required in order that he should be able to make up his account with the bank, (a step necessary to enable him in any case to ascertain the extent of his interest in the judgment and to enforce it against the Syndicat); or to take any steps themselves to enforce the judgment against the Syndicat,\nIt was, I may add, frankly admitted by the bank's agent, what indeed is patent from the correspondence between the agent at Dawson and the head office in Toronto, that in so acting the agent proceeded in total disregard of Barrette's interests.\nI think it is impossible to maintain on these facts and in face of this admission .that in the dealings I have mentioned, the bank acted in good faith under the powers vested in it under the transactions of June, 1901. The only question indeed which to my mind is at all doubtful is the question whether it sufficiently appears that as a result of these transactions Barrette suffered any loss. I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff having shewn that at the date of the judgment of the Territorial Court in banco the full amount of the judgment (had the bank acted in accordance with its duty to Barrette as above indicated) could have been realized; and that the bank in violation of its duty to Barrette having so dealt with the judgment that Barrette was prevented from recovering upon it; the onus was on the bank to shew that had the sum owing under the judgment been realized or security been given the subsequent course of events would have deprived Barrette of the benefit of the security or of the sum thus recovered; and of this onus I think the bank has not acquitted itself.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

Yates (Plaintiff) Respondent,\n1909: February 23; 1909: April 5.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies. Idington and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nSale of lands\u2014Conditions\u2014Deposit of price\u2014Compliance with instructions\u2014Vendor refusing to complete\u2014Broker's commission \u2014Remuneration for procuring purchaser.\nA broker instructed to sell lands for a price to be deposited in a bank pending arrival of clear title, procured a purchaser who made the deposit to his own credit without appropriating it to any special purpose. On refusal by the vendor to complete the bargain, the broker sued him for a commission or remuneration for the services rendered.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (1 Sask. L.R. 247) Idington J. dissenting, that there had not been such compliance with the terms of the instructions as would entitle the broker to recover commission or remuneration for his services in procuring a purchaser.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, in banc[1], affirming by an equal division the judgment of Newlands J. at the trial, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nGirouard J. agreed in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nDavies J.\u2014I would allow this appeal and enter judgment for the defendant with costs.\nI agree that the nature of the plaintiff's agency was to procure a purchaser and not to effect a sale of the defendant appellant's property.\nBut I also think that under his authority the plaintiff was to procure a purchaser who would deposit\nwith the Union Bank at Swift Current the sum of $4,000 on or before the 22nd August pending arrival of clear title.\nThat condition I do not think was complied with by the purchasers procured by plaintiff depositing the $ 4,000 to their own credit and so that they could withdraw it at any moment they liked. I agree that the condition called for a payment made with the bank in some way insuring that it would remain there for at least a reasonable time as a guarantee to the vendor that the proposed purchaser would carry out the sale if the vendor within a reasonable time produced a clear title to the land.\nNo such deposit or payment was made. What was done by the proposed purchasers was to deposit a sum of $4,000 to their own credit and not having any relation or reference so far as the bank or the vendors were concerned to the contemplated purchase. The latter could at any moment withdraw it. Yates, the plaintiff, had written the purchaser a letter on August 16th, enclosing a copy of the \"terms the vendor Reser would sell on,\" and explaining to them that \"the money of course would remain in the bank until he gave the bank the clear titles.\" They knew, therefore, when they wired the money on the 20th to the bank that the deposit ought to remain in the bank until the purchaser gave or produced to the bank a clear title. But they simply deposited the money to their own credit without any notice whatever to the bank of its object or purpose.\nIt was open to Yates, the agent, when he received the telegram from the purchasers on the 20th August\nchange contract to conform to Reser's demands and have him sign them. Have wired four thousand to Union Bank to-day\nto have given the bank notice of the telegram he had received from the purchasers in reply to the letter he had written them, and that the money deposited by them was deposited with the object and purpose of fulfilling the contract of purchase on vendor's terms. If he had done so it probably would have been sufficient to satisfy the conditions prescribed by the vendor on which he (Yates) was authorized to sell. He, however, did nothing until the 22nd, the last day for the making of the deposit when instead of notifying the bank he wired the intending purchasers as follows: \"Money should be deposited to your credit to be withdrawn by Reser on production of clear title. Instruct bank promptly.\"\nIt was then too late. Their instructions were not sent to the bank as requested by Yates until the 24th and were not received until the 25th. In the meantime and at the close of business at the bank on the 22nd Reser had gone to the bank and found out the facts whereupon he immediately wrote Yates that as the condition relating to the deposit had not been complied with the \"deal was off.\"\nYates, it seems to me, has himself to blame for not having on or before the close of the 22nd August, after receiving the purchasers' telegram of the 20th, given the necessary notice to the bank of the purchase and of the purpose and object of the deposit and so earmarked the deposit as to make it a compliance with the vendor's terms of sale.\nBy neglecting to do so and taking the course he did he justified the vendor legally in declaring the deal at an end.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan affirming the judgment of the trial judge for $400 in an action for commissions respondent claimed to have earned by bringing to the appellant a purchaser for land he owned in said province.\nThe land was entrusted by the appellant to the respondent exclusively for one month from the 18th of July for sale on terms specified in writing bearing that date.\nThe respondent effected a sale in writing to parties in Illinois signed by them and by appellant through respondent as his agent, but in some respects bound appellant therein to what was in excess of his instructions.\nUpon his raising this objection the month had only two days yet to run. The agent who had been at some expense begged, having regard to the distance at which the buyers lived, four days' extension of time to see if objectionable features could not be dropped from the contract and as became a man experienced in business this was conceded by the appellant upon somewhat burthensome terms being added to what he would have been entitled to on the original arrangement with the respondent. The following is a copy of memorandum the appellant signed to shew what more he wanted:\nThe following are the terms upon which I agree to sell my farm: i.e., N.E. 1\/4 of 14-16-14 and N.W. 1\/4 of sec. 13-16-14, together with all buildings as they stand at present and one-half share of all my share of all crops now on said premises. Terms: $4,000 to be deposited with the Union Bank at Swift Current on or before August 22nd , 1906, pending arrival of clear title. Balance to be paid to suit purchaser at 8 per cent. interest or cash on arrival of title without interest if desired.\nPurchasers agree to pay any expenses incurred in building granary for said half share of crop and also half share of all harvesting operations and expenses. Possession to be given at opening up of spring, 1907.\nCommission to W. M. Yates to be 5 per cent. of purchase price.\n(Sgd.) E. W. Reser.\nThe respondent having procured this wrote the same day one of the intending purchasers who had signed, explaining the situation and enclosing copy of the above and as to the money to be deposited explained\nthe money of course would remain in the bank until he gave the bank the clear titles.\nOn the 20th of August, 1906, a telegram was sent signed by both purchasers who had signed the agreement of purchase to the respondent as follows:\nChange contract to conform to Reser's demands and have him sign them. Have wired four thousand to Union Bank today.\nThe money thus provided was duly credited by the Union Bank to Murray & Hein, the purchasers, by deposit as of the 20th August as if to their current account.\nIt seems quite clear that they had bound themselves to buy these lands on the terms set forth in their first agreement to be modified by the hand of the appellant's agent to meet the requirements of the appellant as shewn on the above quoted memorandum and had literally complied with the exact terms thereof, stipulating for a deposit of $4,000 with the Union Bank at Swift Current on or before the 22nd August.\nThe appellant got everything tendered him which his instructions required.\nThe letter of his own agent upon which the purchasers acted had specified that the deposit\nmust remain in the bank until he gave the bank the clear titles.\nAnd in accepting the terms offered and acting in pursuance thereof and depositing the money accordingly it would have been idle for them to pretend they had the money on call only.\nAll that was needed to make the matter binding on the local banker as well as his principals in Illinois was for the appellant to signify assent and inform the banker, who evidently knew no more than to accept the deposit, of the history I have related and the appellant's rights and claims under it to have the money retained for such reasonable time as might enable him to complete the title.\nWhen this stage was reached the respondent had earned his commission and was entitled to be paid, whether the appellant chose to act in the curious way he did or not and refuse to act as ordinary men would have acted.\nWe are asked to read into these words in which the appellant had framed his instructions and terms he required something that is not there. He might have insisted, if appellant chose to say so, on the gold being brought in a bag and left with the bankers. But he did not.\nNo explanation appears therein such as is alleged is usual to have done in such cases, namely, to deposit in specified terms the appellant now pretends would have suited him. No law or legal custom ever existed to interpret the words used in that way and no other.\nNor do I think a prudent business man would dream of placing so much money in the unrestricted power of another an entire stranger without providing for determining or limiting his power of detention.\nThe letter of Yates, appellant's agent, covered this by the two week's limit the appellant had requested.\nThis letter containing the two important provisions I have adverted to, one stipulating for the money remaining in the bank until title made, and the other just mentioned naming the two weeks, seems to have been overlooked by the court below. I venture to think the court could have seen in them coupled with the acceptance thereof in the way I have dealt with already, if attention had been drawn thereto, that very protection in law sought for appellant by part of the court.\nIt was suggested here that he may not have known of that. His own agent it was who, placed by him in a position having the right to do this, had effectually served him and if treated fairly would have explained, on being given a chance, all he had done.\nMoreover, the very agreement this agent had a solicitor draw up and which the appellant professes to have been willing to sign contains in it a provision suggesting all this had been provided for. A little reasonableness in this regard on the appellant's part would have led him to be fully satisfied if he had desired to act fairly.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014I think the conditions of the respondent's right to commission were that on or before the 22nd August, 1906, he should procure a purchaser, that is to say a person willing to enter into a contract of purchase; and that the purchaser should deposit in the bank specified a sum of $4,000 appropriated to the purchase, but actually payable to the vendor only when (within a reasonable time, of course) a title should be shewn.\nThe respondent had a person willing to purchase before the date mentioned, and the sum required was in the bank, but unfortunately owing apparently to his misapprehension of the terms of his engagement he failed to produce the evidence of his authority to conclude a bargain with the appellant and the sum remained at large at the disposal of the purchasers until after the limit of time specified in his instructions\u2014 without being appropriated to the purchase as the terms of the respondent's employment required. I regret the necessity of coming to this conclusion because the respondent's failure was due only to a mistake, and I think the appellant's conduct in taking advantage of that mistake merits the reprobation of all right-minded people.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with, costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Grayson & Armstrong.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Willoughby & Pickett.\n[1] 1 Sask.

The municipal corporation took proceedings for the opening of the first front road across the lands in question, caused a proc\u00e8s-verbal to be made locating the highway, took possession and proceeded to cut down trees growing thereon and to construct the road. The municipal valuators reported that, as this was a first front road, there should be no indemnity allowed upon its appropriation and there was no special description of the strip of land taken nor any mention of the names of the owners in the proc\u00e8s-verbal or award. The appellants, thereupon, brought an action for trespass, to recover possession of the land so taken and for damages. At the trial, Malouin J. dismissed the action and his judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nMethot K.C. and J. A. Ritchie for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a possessory action to which defendant pleads counter-possession by virtue of proceedings taken to expropriate the strip of land in dispute for a public highway. Plaintiffs' title and possession are admitted as alleged and the only question at issue between the parties is with respect to the validity of the expropriation proceedings. The Superior Court dismissed the action, holding that the defendant was in lawful possession and on appeal that judgment was confirmed, two judges dissenting, but all the judges there admit that there were irregularities in the expropriation proceedings, which the majority, however, say were covered by the provisions of article 16 of the Quebec Municipal Code. With this conclusion I cannot agree. The legislature delegates to rural municipal councils a very wide discretion with respect to the construction and maintenance of works of local improvement on the very proper assumption that their members have adequate knowledge of the wants and wishes of their respective communities, and, realizing that these municipal institutions must be worked out by men little versed in the science of legislation and ignorant of the forms of legal procedure, it provides that their proceedings, if attacked in the courts, are not to be too critically examined and that irregularities, where no substantial injustice is done, or the absence of formalities which are not essential to their validity, are not to be considered as grounds of nullity. I unhesitatingly declare that in my opinion it is the duty of the superior courts in the exercise of that controlling, superintending and reforming power conferred upon them by section 2329 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec to give effect in this respect to the intention of the legislature and not to embarrass or obstruct, but to cooperate with these local administrative bodies in the performance of their dirties. See Parish of Ste. Louise v. Chouinard[2]; Meredith C.J. in Parent v. Paroisse de St. Sauveur[3], at page 261; Kruse v. Johnson[4], and Slattery v. Naylor[5]. If we were called upon to consider the propriety of opening the road, the apportionment of the work to be done upon it or in any way interfere with what may be properly considered the discretionary power vested in the local authority I would admit that with their better knowledge of local conditions these representatives of the people can be trusted to honestly perform their duty in accordance with their local requirements and under the controlling influence of local public opinion.\nIn this case, however, we have to deal not with a question involving the exercise of a discretionary power, nor are we called upon to say whether, in the circumstances, the proposed action was reasonable or unreasonable. The question for us to decide is: Assuming the exercise of a wise discretion and of a \"sweet reasonableness,\" have any of the formalities which are essential to the validity of the title under which defendants have taken possession of the plaintiffs' property been omitted?\nThe Quebec Municipal Code provides for the expropriation of lands of private individuals when necessary for the purpose of opening highways the soil in which when open is vested in the municipality; (arts. 752 and 903, C.M.). Expropriation has been defined\nun acte qui enl\u00e8ve \u00e0 un particulier sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la partie expropriante (l'Etat, communes, etc.). Planiol, vol. 1, No. 1084.\nNo principle is better settled than that the power to expropriate must be strictly pursued and exercised subject to the checks and safeguards provided by the Act which authorizes the proceedings; Saunby v. London Water Commissioners[6]; or, as it is put in the French law, \"En mati\u00e8re d'expropriation, tout est de rigueur.\" The Municipal Code requires that upon a petition of the ratepayers asking for the opening of a new road the council must appoint a special superintendent whose duty it is, if, after consulting the interested parties (art. 796, M.C.), he is of opinion that the road should be opened, to make a proc\u00e8s-verbal in which he must give certain details set out in art. 799. It will be observed that no reference to the land to be expropriated is required in the proc\u00e8s-verbal, This proc\u00e8s-verbal must be deposited with the council and if homologated (art. 808, M.C.) comes into force after certain delays and notices (art 809, M.C.). After the proc\u00e8s-verbal is made and homologated then the land required must be expropriated (arts. 902 and 903, M.C), and for this purpose the municipal valuators (art. 908, M.C.) visit the locality and make their award which is the title by which the corporation becomes the proprietor (art. 903, M.C.) and is entitled to immediate possession.\nThis award by virtue of which the respondent has dispossessed the appellants does not authorize it merely to enter upon the appellants' property for the purpose of making a road, but it is a translatory title which divests appellants of the soil in the road and conveys it to the municipality with the right immediately to enter into possession, and it is the validity of this award that is in dispute in this appeal\u2014the objections to the proc\u00e8s-verbal and notices having been withdrawn at the argument here. Article 918 of the Municipal Code requires that the award which is a condition precedent to the right of the municipality to take possession of the property should contain, in \u00e0 general way, the same information as any other translatory title. It should give the names of the parties whose land is taken and the description of the property and the price (indemnity) should be fixed, if any is granted, and if not the refusal must be stated. Mr. Justice Wurt\u00e8le, in Barrette v. Paroisse de St. Barth\u00e9lemy[7], expresses the opinion that the provisions of art. 2168, C.C., are applicable to such a document and that the property should be described by cadastral number, or by metes and bounds; followed by Pomeroy v. Village of Rock Island[8], at page 343, and in O'Neil v. City of St. Henry[9]. In the award upon which respondents rely there is no mention or description of the lots of which the land taken forms a part and there is no indication of the proprietor of such land and the only reference to indemnity is contained in these words; after dealing with the indemnity due the proprietors of lot 20, the valuators say:\nQuant au reste du dit chemin, nous n'accordons aucune indemnit\u00e9, vu que ce chemin est le premier chemin de front du dit rang.\nIt would seem elementary and reasonable that, before a municipality can expropriate a land owner, \"they \" must first set out and ascertain what part of his lands they require,\" Saunby v. London Water Commissioners[10]; and it would seem equally important for the party expropriating to know what is being acquired and, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin, in all of which I concur, the names of the owners of the lots should also be given. I cannot approve of the ingenious suggestion that as these proceedings were taken to expropriate the first front road upon the lots in question, no award was necessary because the Municipal Code forbids the valuators to grant an indemnity in such cases (art. 906, M.C.). A long array of judicial decisions in the Province of Quebec, approved of in this court, has, in my opinion, settled this question finally, in so far as cases arising in that province are concerned. It was considered, in 1866, in Deal v. Corporation of Philipsburg[11], and in 1873, in the case of Doyon v. Paroisse de St. Joseph[12], where it is said, at page 195:\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les formalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es par le statut doivent \u00eatre suivies rigoureusement, et que lorsque la loi prescrit qu'une chose sera faite d'une certaine mani\u00e8re, il est non-seulement de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et de l'avantage de tout le monde de se conformer \u00e0 ses prescriptions; mais tout ce qui sera fait en violation de ces prescriptions sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une nullit\u00e9.\nIn 1876, in Township of Nelson v. Lemieux[13], the same court held again that the formalities prescribed by the statute for the opening of a road and for the expropriation of property of individuals must be rigourously followed and that on pain of nullity.\nIn 1884, in Dorchester v. Collett[14], Mr. Justice Tessier, speaking for the majority of the court says, at page 64:\nL'examen pr\u00e9alable des \u00e9valuateurs, au cas de refus d'une indemnit\u00e9, est donc n\u00e9cessaire. C'est un principe de droit constitutionnel et de droit civil que l'on ne peut exproprier personne sans indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9alable. C.C. article 407.\nAnd in King v. Township d'Irlande[15], in 1893, Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, speaking for the court, at page 272, gives as the ratio decidendi:\nElle est fond\u00e9e exclusivement sur le\u00bbfait que la sentence arbitrale \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9terminer s'il devait y avoir indemnit\u00e9 ou non, et quel devait \u00eatre le montant de cette indemnit\u00e9.\nFinally, in 1894, in Chamberland v. Fortier[16], at page 380, speaking for this court, Mr. Justice Fournier after reviewing these cases says:\nLes formalit\u00e9s prescrites par nos statuts pour l'ouverture des chemins et l'expropriation des particuliers pour la construction de chemins doivent \u00eatre rigoureusement observ\u00e9es sous peine de nullit\u00e9, comme Font d\u00e9cid\u00e9 nos cours.\nIt has been argued that the proc\u00e8s-verbal and the notices should be searched for the information omitted from the award. Even if we admit this, I cannot find in the proc\u00e8s-verbal or the notices a description of the property or a proper designation of the proprietors and, of course, there is no mention of the value, but I am of opinion that the valuators' award which is the title under which the municipality claims the right to dispossess the plaintiff should be complete in itself. The Municipal Code says that the award of the valuators vests the property in the corporation (art. 903) and entitles it to take possession, but it also says what the award must contain and all the conditions enumerated in art. 918 are essential to the validity of an award. When a statute confers a right, privilege or immunity, the regulations, forms or conditions are imperative, in this sense that non-observance of any of them is fatal. Maxwell on Statutes (ed. 1905), p. 557. I would allow the appeal and reverse the judgment of the Superior Court and of the court of appeal, with judgment as follows; and this court rendering the judgment which should have been rendered by the Superior Court doth hereby declare the plaintiffs lawful possessors of the immovables described in their declaration; and the said defendant is prohibited from troubling them in their possession thereof, in which possession it is ordered that the said plaintiffs be reinstated and maintained, and for their trespass aforesaid the said defendant is condemned to pay the said plaintiffs the sum of |25 damages with interest from this day and costs of a possessory action in the Superior Court and also the costs in the Court of King's Bench and in this court. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014In this case I have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. The grounds of my decision are that the road in question the right to possession of which was in dispute was what is known as a \"first front road\" subject at any time under the Municipal Code of Quebec to be \"appropriated\" by the municipality without any compensation except for improvements made or placed thereon. I think Mr. Ritchie, for the respondent, put it very well when he said that these \"first front roads\" were not like the rest of the lands in the township, but were in the nature of reservations out of the grant. It is true that they are not expressly reserved out of the grant, but they stand under the law in very much the same position as lands which are expressly reserved for roads. Section 906 of the Municipal Code provides for both such cases. It reads:\nNo indemnity must be allowed for the land required for the first front road upon a lot, nor for the land reserved for a public road in the grant or concession of a lot.\nIn the case before us as soon as Mr. Stewart's contention that the minerals to be found on the road bed and the trees growing thereon were to be valued as improvements had been rejected as they were on the argument at bar the appeal stood baldly as a contest with respect to the possession of the land taken as and for a \"first front road\" on which there were no improvements and as to which the law expressly prohibited any indemnity from being given when appropriated by the municipality.\nI was inclined to the opinion that in such a case no valuation at all was required to be gone through. I should have thought that all the sections requiring valuation to be made before the right to possession of the road passed to the municipality were inapplicable to a case where valuation was prohibited and being inapplicable were unnecessary.\nThe argument advanced that because article 918 of the statute directed the valuators (inter alia)\nto fix the amount of .indemnity if they grant any and if not state their refusal\ntherefore an award must be made, the lands mentioned, and the proprietor indicated, did not seem to me applicable at all to such a case as the one before us where there was not any discretion to grant or refuse indemnity the granting of such being expressly prohibited by statute. The article was obviously applicable only to those cases where the circumstances entitled valuators to .give or withhold in their judgment indemnity or damages.\nInasmuch, however, as, owing to a deviation in a part of the road In question valuators were appointed and a valuation actually made, it is not necessary to determine whether a valuation is in every case absolutely necessary or not. The only objection we have to deal with here is that a valuation made, but not containing the name of the proprietor and the number of the lot of which the land taken formed part, is bad and the omissions necessarily fatal.\nThe objection to the number of the lot being omitted could, I think, in any case be cured by reference to the proc\u00e8s-vertal which formed part of the record of the proceedings preceding the valuation. The other defect which might possibly be held fatal in cases requiring a valuation of either lands or improvements cannot in my opinion if proper effect is to be given to the curative section of the Act, art. 16, be held fatal in this case. That section reads as follows:\nNo objection founded upon form, or upon the omission of any formality even imperative, can be allowed to prevail in any action, suit or proceeding respecting municipal matters, unless substantial injustice would be done by rejecting such objection, or unless the formality omitted be such that its omission, according to the provisions of this Code, would render null the proceedings or other municipal acts needing such formality.\nA valuation of lands with respect to which no indemnity could be awarded is surely the merest formality. No substantial injustice would or could be done by rejecting an objection purely formal and it does appear to me that even assuming the necessity of going through the form of an award which was actually gone through and made in the case before us, the absence from the award of an ingredient which might be essential where land or improvements had to be valued should not in this case where no valuation was possible be held fatal.\nAssuming, therefore, I am wrong as to a valuation or award being unnecessary and putting the case at its very strongest against the municipality that the name of the proprietor and number of the lot should have been stated in the valuation or award surely in a case such as we have before us such omission would be no more than the \"omission of a formality even imperative\" which under this section the courts are directed not to allow \"unless substantial injustice would be done.\"\nI am at a loss to conceive how in this case any substantial injustice could be done and would therefore agree with the judgment below and dismiss the appeal with costs. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Lavergne and Mr. Justice Cross in support of the judgment appealed from I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIt seems that the only grounds (of the many originally taken) now held worthy of consideration are those arising out of the form of the award. One is that the land taken is not described.\nHow can that be so when it expressly sets forth that the valuators are dealing with the road directed in the homologated proc\u00e8s-verbal for the front of the 8th range from lot twenty inclusive to Coleraine township? I should have thought that comprehensive and definite enough having regard to the limits assigned by law.\nAnd when the valuators expressly state as they do in the award what and to whom compensation is due and is specifically awarded and as to the remainder of the said road that they do not allow any indemnity, seeing this road is the first road for the front of the said range, surely everything called for, including description of the lots now in question, is reduced to certainty.\nIt thus expressly declares all article 918 of the Municipal Code calls for except its requirement \"to indicate the proprietor of such land.\"\nWhy is that requirement so needed? Clearly that whatever sum is awarded may be paid the proper party.\nBut when no sum is awarded what use for the indication of any name?\nIt would seem as if the well-known maxim \"cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex\" might well be here borne in mind. It is said, however, as another reason, that the question of title is involved. Can that be so when we consider the Act, and especially article 920 thereof, which shews the money may be paid to the party in possession though not the real proprietor?\nClearly the man actually in possession might have been named though not the real proprietor and yet the title would in due time have passed to the corporation, assuming, of course, everything else as here validly done.\nThe award was made the 7th of June, 1905, after notice had been duly served on King Bros., who did not choose to appear and who did not appeal within the thirty days given by the Act for doing so.\nAfter everything had been thus done that could or need have been juridically done we are asked to say it was null because the name of King Bros., or some one else, was not inserted in the certificate, though no possible injustice was done or can be said to have been done to King Bros., whose names appear on record as parties notified as owners and who in fact owned these lots. Indeed it was after all this the appellants acquired by deed of the 13th of July, 1905, any right it now has to the lands in question.\nLet us see what the curative provision for such a thing says. Article 16 of the Municipal Code is as follows:\n16. No objection founded upon form, or upon the omission of any formality even imperative, can be allowed to prevail in any action, suit or proceeding respecting municipal matters, unless substantial injustice would be done by rejecting such objection, or unless the formality omitted be such that its omission, according to the provisions of this Code, would render null the proceedings or other municipal acts needing such formality.\nI have already indicated how little even of a shadow of \"substantial injustice\" would be done by dismissing this appeal and why as the title is not necessarily derivable from the party who may be indicated in such an award its omission would not render the proceeding null. It seems to have been only the omission of a formality; and that, under the circumstances, a needless one.\nIt strikes me- that the scope and purpose of this section was just to obviate such possible occurrences.\nDuff J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAnglin J.\u2014This action is brought for a declaration of the plaintiffs' right to possession and to recover possession of land which the defendant claims to have expropriated for a road. The validity of the expropriation proceedings taken by the defendants is impugned upon several grounds, to all of which the court of first instance and the Court of King's Bench (Cimon and Gagn\u00e9 JJ. ad hoc, dissenting) refused to give effect.\nHaving regard to the view which I take of one of these grounds of attack, I find it unnecessary to refer to the others. After proc\u00e8s-verbal determining the propriety of constructing the road and defining the land required (art. 902), the Municipal Code provides, as a condition precedent to the right of the municipality to take possession, that there shall be an award of valuators fixing or refusing indemnity to the proprietor (art. 903). The appellants impeached the award in this instance for non-compliance with the provisions of article 918 of the Municipal Code which reads as follows:\n918. In every award rendered by them, the valuators must mention the lot of which the land taken forms part, indicate the proprietor of such land, as well as the by-law, proc\u00e8s-verbal, or order of the council in virtue of which such land is taken, and fix the amount of indemnity if they grant any, and if not, state their refusal.\nThe award in this case \"mentions the lot of which the land taken forms part,\" if at all, only by reference to the proc\u00e8s-verbal. Neither directly nor by reference does it \"indicate the proprietor.\" If the requirements of article 918 be merely formalities, though imperative, (must) their non-observance may be excusable under article 16 of the Municipal Code. But, in my view, neither the requirement of the mention of the lot or of the indication of the proprietor in the award can be so regarded; each must be deemed matter of substance.\nBy article 913 the valuators are required to lodge their award in the office of the council demanding the expropriation, and the secretary-treasurer of the council is required to give public notice (article 232) of such lodgment. The time for appeal from the award is by article 914 restricted to thirty days from the time the notice is so published. As the notice given is merely that the award has been lodged it would appear to follow that a proprietor whose land is covered by it may be prejudicially affected in his right of appeal by an omission from the award of the particulars imperatively directed by article 918. The mention of the lot alone might not suffice. The particular land taken need not be described and the interested proprietor might own only part of the lot (article 19, clause 25), and therefore might not know merely from \"the mention of the lot\" that the award in fact dealt with his land; hence the requirement that the proprietor should be indicated. Again, there might be error or mistake in the indication of the proprietor; hence the provision requiring that the lot be mentioned. With both particulars set out, fair notice is given of the subject of the award and of the interests which it affects. In my opinion the reference to the proc\u00e8s-verbal which contains a description of the lands to be ex-propriated but no indication of the proprietors, is not a mention of the lot in the award sufficient to comply with article 918, which requires that the lot be mentioned \"as well as the * * * proc\u00e8s-verbal.\"\nThe reference in the award to the notice given to the proprietor\u2014apparently the only document in these proceedings containing any indication of their names \u2014is merely \"apr\u00e8s avis d\u00fbment donn\u00e9s\"\u2014quite insufficient to warrant its being treated as an indication of the proprietors in conformity with article 918. Indeed, having regard to the explicit language of the article and the character and effects of the information which it contemplates shall be given by an award duly lodged and notified, I incline to the view that no mere reference, however precise, to another document, however accessible, can be deemed a sufficient compliance with its terms.\nIn the Court of King's Bench, Mr. Justice Lavergne did not allude to this objection to the validity of the award, disposing of what he deemed \"irregularities\" on the ground that by virtue of article 914 of the Municipal Code, the \"sentence arbitrale\" had become final and the plaintiffs were, therefore, bound by it and without remedy.\nBut if the omission of the particulars in question renders the award a nullity\u2014as I think it does\u2014this answer of the learned judge is, with great respect, quite inconclusive.\nMr. Justice Cross proceeds on the assumption that the requirement of the omitted particulars is merely a matter of form and that the omission is therefore \"inoperative\" under article 16 of the Municipal Code. I have already stated why I am unable to accept this view. Mr. Justice Cimon in his dissenting judgment, in which Mr. Justice Gagn\u00e9 concurred, applied to this case a principle familiar to English lawyers, which he states in these words: \"En mati\u00e8re d'expropriation toute est de rigueur\"; (see Chamberland v. Fortier[17]); and he concludes that the omission to indicate the proprietor in the \"sentence arbitrate\" is fatal. In this view, for reasons already stated, I fully concur.\nMr. Ritchie contended that, inasmuch as it is admitted that the road to be provided is a \"first front road,\" and under article 906 \"no indemnity must be allowed for the land required for a first front road,\" there was in reality no need for any award in regard to the land taken from the plaintiffs and that title passed from them to the defendant upon the homologation of the proc\u00e8s-verbal He argued that upon its proper construction article 918 only requires that the proprietors to whom compensation is awarded shall be indicated.\nSeveral answers to this view immediately present themselves. The first is that article 918 requires not that the proprietors to whom compensation is awarded shall be indicated, but that indication shall be given of the proprietors of the land taken. Moreover, it requires that as to such land and such proprietors the valuators shall \"fix the amount of indemnity, if they grant any, and if not, state their refusal\"\u2014language which makes it clear beyond doubt that when land is expropriated, whether the owner is awarded or is refused indemnity, the land must be mentioned and the proprietor indicated in the award.\nAnd this is entirely reasonable, because the proprietor who is refused compensation should have the right to question upon appeal the grounds upon which such refusal is based, even in the case of a first front road. King v. Township d'Irlande[18], in 1893. The mention of the lot from which the land is taken as well as the indication of the proprietor is quite as important where indemnity is refused as where it is allowed. Then article 903 provides that:\nThe corporation becomes the proprietor of such land, and may take possession thereof, without any other formality, from the moment that the decision of the valuators, who fixed or refused an indemnity, has become final and without appeal.\nThe making of an award seems, therefore, to be a condition, precedent in every case to the right of the municipal corporation to take possession.\nI am, therefore, with great respect, of opinion that, although their objection is highly technical and they have shewn no real prejudice or injury, the appeal of the plaintiffs must be allowed with costs and that their claim for possession of the property in question must be upheld. They should also have their costs in the Superior Court and the Court of King's Bench to be paid by the respondents.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Samuel Deschamps.\nSolicitors for the respondents: M\u00e9thot & Lalihert\u00e9.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 566.\n[2] Q.R. 5 Q.B. 362.\n[3] 2 Q.L.R. 258.\n[4] (1898) 2 Q.B. 91.\n[5] 13 App. Cas. 446.\n[6] [1906] A.C. 110, at p. 115.\n[7] Q.R. 4 Q.B. 92, at p. 100.\n[8] 4 R\u00e9v. de Jur. 333.\n[9] 4 R\u00e9v. de Jur. 139.\n[10] [1906] A.C. 110, at p. 115.\n[11] 2 L.C.L.J. 40.\n[12] 17 L.C.

Having discovered that this statement was untrue they brought action for rescission of the contract to purchase and damages for the loss in operating during 1906. The judgment at the trial dismissing the action was affirmed by the Divisional Court. The Court of Appeal reversed the latter judgment, held that rescission could not be ordered but the only remedy was damages and ordered a reference to assess the amount. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, Girouard J. dissenting, that as it can not be ascertained from the record what the amount in controversy on the appeal was, or whether or not it is within the appealable limit, the appeal does not lie.\nHeld, per Idington J.\u2014The judgment appealed against is not a final judgment.\nPer Girouard J. dissenting.\u2014It is established by the evidence at the trial, published on the record, and admitted by the respective counsel for the parties, that the amount in dispute exceeds $1,000.

Action for rescission of contract and for unstated damages was dismissed at the trial and by the Divisional Court.

The defendants appealed.\nWallace K.C. moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nWatson K.C. contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that we cannot now hear this appeal because it is impossible for us to ascertain from the record in its present condition whether or not the amount in controversy is within the appealable limit.\nGIROUARD J.

Following the decision as to the jurisdiction of this court in The City of Toronto v. Metallic Roofing Co.[1], I am of opinion that this court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal and that the motion to quash ought to be rejected.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The statement of claim makes no demand for any stated amount of damages.\nThe judgment awards no sum or right of recovery whatever. Nor is it final, but merely reverses the judgment of the learned trial judge and directs an inquiry as to damages and reserves further directions and costs.\nThe case is distinguishable from that of The City of Toronto v. The Metallic Roofing Co., cited in Cameron\u2019s Supreme Court Practice, at page 17, inasmuch as the statement of claim therein demanded a sufficient amount to render it appealable if that should be taken as a proper test of the amount in controversy, and also because more nearly a judgment awarding a recovery.\nI cannot think that we can determine our jurisdiction, in a case of this kind, by means of affidavits respecting the amount of the claims in controversy which is the very thing yet undetermined, and directed by the judgment in question to be found.\nBesides, I am unable to find a case overruling the case of The Rural Municipality of Morris v. London & Canadian Loan & Agency Co.[2], which held that an order for judgment which finally settled the rights of the parties and for all practical purposes might have been looked upon as final, yet was held not so within the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d as it had not been entered of record.\nI cannot say that the form of judgment here of record at all approaches that in the Morris Case2 in finality.\nIt may be contrary to my impression on argument that the case falls within what we laid down in the Union Bank of Halifax v. Dickie[3].\nBut of this I desire to reserve any opinion for the present. It may be that the appellants are, though in fact entitled to recover a much larger sum than the limit assigned as appealable in Ontario cases, left without any right to appeal.\nAnd it may be that in such cases as take the form of procedure apparent in this case leave to appeal must be got.\nThe result might if the practice became general give rise to a much more rational basis for appeal than mere amount fixes.\nThe doubt of our Jurisdiction is so great we should refrain from entertaining the appeal, and I think the appeal ought to be quashed with costs of the motion, but no general costs of the appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014The judgment is, in my opinion, not a final judgment. There is a reference to ascertain damages only; no order to pay the amount ascertained; and no adjudication of liability.

Vivian and Company (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1909: March 15; 1909: April 5.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nContract\u2014Agreement for sale of land\u2014Deferred conveyance\u2014Default in payment\u2014Remedy of vendor\u2014Reading \u201cor\u201d as \u201cand.\u201d\nWhere, in accepting an offer by V. for the sale of land, C. undertook to pay certain instalments of the purchase money before receiving the deed V. could sue for recovery of unpaid instalments, his remedy not being confined to an action in damages for breach of contract. Laird v. Pim (7 M. & W. 474) distinguished.\nThe offer having been accepted by C. for \u201cmyself or assigns,\u201d to avoid holding the contract void for uncertainty as to the purchaser\u2019s identity, the word \u201cor\u201d was read as \u201cand.\u201d Idington J. dissenting, on this point.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (16 Ont. L.R. 372) maintaining that of a Divisional Court (15 Ont. L.R. 280) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court[2], in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts are stated by Mr. Justice Britton in giving judgment after the trial as follows:\n\u201cThe plaintiffs, by their agent, on June 20th, 1903, offered to sell to the defendant property consisting of 3,066\u00bd acres for $125,000, payable as follows: $500 as a deposit upon signing the agreement, $4,500 upon completion of the purchase, and $120,000, in five yearly instalments of $24,000 each in one, two, three, four and five years from the date of the offer, with interest at 5 per cent per annum, at the time of each instalment, on the whole amount that might from time to time remain unpaid. The purchase was to be completed on July 15th, 1903, at the office of Lefroy & Boulton, Toronto, and the defendant was then to be given possession. It was further stipulated and made part of the offer that the defendant as soon as he had paid three-fifths of the total purchase money, together with all interest accrued on the whole, should be entitled to call for a transfer of the lands, upon a good and sufficient first charge or mortgage being executed upon the whole of the lands to the vendors, to secure payment to them of the balance of the purchase money and interest. The defendant was to have until July 15th, 1903, to examine the title, etc. The vendors were to pay the proportion of taxes and insurance up to the date of the offer, and after that date the defendant was to assume them. Then the offer contained this special proviso: \u2018Time shall in all respects be of the essence of the agreement of sale, and unless the payments are punctually made at the time and in the manner above mentioned, and if such default shall occur before the execution of the transfers and of the charge or mortgage above mentioned, the agreement of sale shall be null and void and the sale cancelled, and in that event you shall have no right to recover any part of the purchase money already paid.\u2019\n\u201cOn June 23rd the defendant accepted the offer in these words: \u2018I do hereby accept on behalf of myself or assigns the above offer, and do agree to become the purchaser of the lands mentioned in it upon the terms and conditions therein contained. F.H. Clergue.\u2019 \u201cA supplemental agreement was made as to ore extracted from the land before payment in full of the purchase money, but this is not material for consideration in this action.\n\u201cOn July 15th, 1903, the plaintiffs accepted from the defendant his promissory note for $4,500 at four months from that date, in lieu of the cash instalment, and defendant was allowed to go into possession of the lands. Defendant put a person in charge of these lands as caretaker, and the authority of this person has never been questioned nor countermanded. The note was not paid at maturity, and the plaintiffs recovered judgment for the amount of it and interest, and that judgment has been paid.\n\u201cOn June 23rd, 1904, there fell due the instalment of principal, $24,000, and interest, for one year on $120,000 at 5 per cent., amounting to $6,000, making $30,000. This was not paid.\n\u201cOn January 19th, 1905, the defendant assigned his rights under the agreement to the Standard Mining Company of Algoma, Limited, and on March 10th, 1905, the plaintiffs, the Standard Mining Company, and the defendant entered into a new agreement, by which the plaintiffs agreed to sell this same property to that company for $125,000, on which the original deposit or payment of $500 by defendant was to be credited.\n\u201cOf the balance, the sum of $4,500, together with interest and costs, represented by the judgment against the defendant, was to be paid within one month, and the yearly instalments were to be made on June 23rd in the years 1905,1906,1907,1908 and 1909, together with interest, to be computed from June 23rd, 1903. This agreement is a very elaborate and carefully prepared instrument, but it is not necessary for my present purpose to refer to any of its provisions other than the following:\n\u201c(1) The mining company was not to be given possession of the lands until the judgment for $4,500, and interest and costs, and a further sum sufficient to make $10,000, had been paid.\n\u201c(2) Upon the execution and delivery of that agreement the mining company were for all purposes substituted for and in the place of the defendant with respect to the first agreement (made by offer and acceptance), and the first agreement was to be deemed to be merged in the latter agreement, subject to this, that the latter agreement and anything that might be done thereunder should not affect nor prejudice the claim of the plaintiffs against the defendant in respect of the sums of $24,000 which fell due on June 23rd, 1904, and on June 23rd, 1905, or upon the interest on the unpaid purchase money up to the date of the assignment, viz., January 19th, 1905, or prejudice the right of the defendant with reference thereto; but until the purchasers should pay the first and second instalments of $24,000 each, with interest as aforesaid, the rights of the plaintiffs and defendant should remain as then existing in respect of these instalments and interest. That agreement recited that the plaintiffs made the claim, as now sued for, and that the defendant resisted that claim, asserting that there was not any personal liability on his part for anything beyond the judgment recovered upon his note for $4,500. \u201cThis action is therefore brought to recover the amount due June 23rd, 1904, on principal\n$24,000\n\u201cThe part of the instalment due June 23rd, 1905\u2014say, seven-twelfths of $24,000\n14,000\n\u201cAnd interest for one year and seven months from June 23rd, 1903, to January, 19th, 1905, on $120,000\u2014say\n9,500\n\u201cApproximately................................................................................\n$47,500\nHis lordship gave judgment for the plaintiffs which was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMiddleton K.C. for the appellant. We rely upon two main defences; (1) that an action will not lie for the purchase price as the vendor has not yet conveyed the lands; and (2) that it was known that the defendant was purchasing for and on behalf of a company, and that it was the intention of both parties that, on the company assuming liability, the defendant should be discharged from all liability. The courts below have erred in holding against us on both defences.\nThe defendant submits that where a vendor of either land or chattels retains the property in the thing sold he cannot maintain an action for the price. His only remedy is for the damage sustained by the purchaser\u2019s default. The courts below have erroneously assumed that the defendant\u2019s contention is that the plaintiffs cannot recover at all because the right to recover is in some way dependent upon their readiness to convey or their having conveyed, and have re- sorted to cases upon dependent and independent covenants. The defendant\u2019s real argument on this branch of the case is that assuming no defence is shewn, the plaintiffs yet having their land can only recover the loss sustained by the breach of contract, that is, the difference between the value of the land and the price agreed on and possibly an allowance for expenses connected with the sale. On this branch of the case we rely on Laird v. Pim[3]; Moor v. Roberts[4]; Dart (7 ed.), page 999; Sugden on Vendors (14 ed.), pages 239-40, and note; Poole v. Hill[5]; East London Union v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[6]; Pordage v. Cole[7]; Dunlop v. Grote[8]; Thomas and Beatty v. Ross[9]; McArthur v. Winslow[10]; Williams \u201cVendors and Purchasers,\u201d pages 937, 958; Fraser v. Ryan[11]; Cameron v. Bradbury[12].\nThe same result would follow had the plaintiffs sued for specific performance. The lands would have been sold and the defendant would have been liable for the deficiency.\nOn the defendant\u2019s claim for reformation, the evidence clearly shews that appellant is right.\nThe court below assumes that the defendant refers to the correspondence after the contract for the purpose of shewing a new contract. The defendant relies upon the correspondence shewing admissions as to what the real bargain was in the first instance. It is in effect admitted by the respondents and by the court below that, if a formal agreement with the Standard Mining Company had been signed before the first instalment fell due, the defendant would not have been liable. The correspondence shews that the company was ready to execute the agreement long before the date in question, and it cannot fairly be argued that the question of the liability of the defendant was to depend on the degree of diligence with which the conveyancing was conducted by the solicitors engaged, and that the defendant was to be made liable because the former documents had not been signed by a named day. Such a construction of the agreement arrived at is contrary to the whole weight of evidence, documentary and oral.\nWe also refer to Eastern Counties Rway. Co. v. Hawkes[13]; and Congregation Beth Elohim v. Central Presbyterian Church[14].\nDouglas K.C. and Lefroy K.C. for the respondents. The rule that no action will lie upon an agreement for the sale of land for the price until the lands have been actually conveyed, or a conveyance tendered, has no application to a case such as this where the agreement of sale provides for payment of the purchase money by annual instalments, and where as here it is expressly agreed that the purchaser is not to be entitled to call for a transfer or conveyance of the land until a certain definite portion of the purchase money has been paid. While the general rule may be that the mutual engagements of the parties to such an agreement are to be considered dependent on each other, the contract may be so worded as to shew that they are independent. The question is to be determined by the intention and meaning of the parties as manifested in the agreement and the intention that they shall be independent is clearly manifested in the agreement in question. Pordage v. Cole[15], note 1, page 551; Yates v. Gardiner[16]; Stavers v. Curling[17], per Tindal C.J., at p. 368; Wilks v. Smith[18], at p. 360; McDonald v. Murray[19]; Dicker v. Jackson[20]; Norton on Deeds (2 ed.), p. 524; Dart on Vendors and Purchasers (7 ed.), vol. 2, p. 1001; Armstrong v. Auger[21].\nThe respondents submit that the words \u201cor assigns\u201d do not extend the operation of the agreement beyond what it would possess without them; that they amount to nothing more than saying that if the appellant assigned the benefit of the contract, no objection would be made to his doing so, provided the assignee was acceptable to the vendors, and that they fall far short of an agreement to relieve the purchaser from liability to pay according to the terms of the agreement. It must be borne in mind that the appellant personally agreed to become the purchaser, entered into possession of the property and was in possession thereof when the instalment of purchase money sued for fell due.\nThe appellant contends that it was expressly understood and agreed that he was not to be personally liable for any amount beyond the deposit and the promissory note for $4,500, and asks to have the agreement reformed accordingly. We submit that no case of mutual mistake on which reformation could be based is made on the evidence; none of the evidence establishes a case for reforming the writing, and this contention was not pressed in the Divisional Court or the Court of Appeal. Pollock on Contracts (7 ed.), pp. 513-515; Clarke v. Joselin[22].\nAs to the contention that the respondents elected to cancel the agreement of sale to appellant, inasmuch as they on 27th Jan., 1904, issued a writ of summons against him claiming \u201cdamages for breach of contract,\u201d the evidence, shews that this action went no farther than the issue and service of the writ, and that so far from its being a cancellation of the contract it was in fact brought for the object of enforcing one of the terms of the contract, viz.: that the current year\u2019s taxes upon the lands sold should be apportioned in the usual way between the vendors and the purchaser and that the purchaser should pay the part apportionable for the period between the date of the offer and the end of the year. Moreover, when that action was commenced, no instalment of purchase money had fallen due.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and DAVIES J. concurred with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I agree with the general reasoning and the result of my brother Anglin\u2019s judgment, though I do not think it is a case for reading the \u201cor\u201d as \u201cand.\u201d\nDUFF J. concurred with Anglin J. ANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario I would dismiss this appeal.\nBy the terms of his contract the defendant undertook to pay instalments of the purchase money before he should become entitled to a conveyance. As is pointed out by Parke J. in Yates v. Gardiner[23], in 1851, this fact entirely distinguishes the present case from Laird v. Pim[24], so much relied upon by the appellant.\nAssuming that there was a binding contract effected by Mr. Clergue\u2019s acceptance of the plaintiffs\u2019 offer, that contract must have been with Mr. Clergue, at all events in the first instance, and, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, the agreement contains nothing which would warrant the construction that, upon its assignment by Mr. Clergue, his personal liability under it should cease, not only as to accruing instalments but also as to instalments then overdue.\nThe only suggestion of difficulty in the case is created by the use of the words \u201cF.H. Clergue or assigns\u201d in the plaintiffs\u2019 offer and of the words \u201con behalf of himself or assigns\u201d in the defendant\u2019s acceptance. If the latter words should be read literally it might be doubtful whether there would be a contract at all. An acceptance by A., on behalf of A. or B., leaves it uncertain who is in fact the party accepting. It is manifest that the parties intended in this case to make a contract, and it is equally manifest that, although Mr. Clergue wished the contract to be so framed that it would expressly provide for his right to assign it, he did not intend to oblige himself to make an assignment of it, and he did intend to put himself in a position, in the event of his not assigning it, to claim the benefit of the contract personally.\nThere is no doubt of the intention of the parties; and, where sense requires it, there are many cases to shew that we may construe the word \u201cor\u201d into \u201cand,\u201d and \u201cand\u201d into \u201cor,\u201d in order to effectuate the intent of the parties.\n\u201cAnd there is no case in which any difference has been made as to this point between a will and a deed, when the court are considering how the intention of the parties can be effected.\u201d Per Lord Kenyon C.J., in Wright v. Kemp[25], at page 473; see also Morgan v. Thomas[26], at page 646.\nIn order to give effect to the intention of the parties the word \u201cor\u201d should be here read \u201cand.\u201d So read, the acceptance unquestionably made a contract which became binding upon Mr. Clergue personally. He was bound to pay the instalments as they accrued due, and upon failure to do so was liable to be sued for them. His assignment of the contract, at all events as to matured payments which alone are involved in this action, did not relieve him from liability.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald, Shepley, Middleton & Donald.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.H.F.

(Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1909: February 26; 1909: May 4.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nPrincipal and agent\u2014Broker selling on Grain Exchange\u2014Contract in broker's name\u2014Liability of principal\u2014\"Futures\"\u2014\"Options\"\u2014 \"Margins\"\u2014Board rules\u2014Indemnity.\nOn 14th August, 1907, the defendant, who resided in the State of Nebraska, wrote the following letter to the plaintiffs, grain dealers at Winnipeg, Man.: \"Yours of recent date enclosing market report rec'd. I shall be North in about four weeks to look after the new crop and, if you can sell No. 2 oats for 37c. or better, in store Fort William, you had better sell 4,000 bus. for me, and I will be up at Snowflake then so I can look after the loading of them, and I will send the old oats then.\" The plaintiffs, who were also brokers on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, sold the oats at 381\/2 cents on the \"Board,\" without disclosing the name of their principal, for October delivery, becoming personally liable for the performance of the contract according to the rules of the Exchange. Upon defendant refusing to deliver the oats, the plaintiffs purchased the quantity of oats so sold at an advance in price in order to make the delivery and brought the action to recover the amount of their loss thus sustained.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (18 Man. R. 111), that the authority so given did not authorize the plaintiffs to make a sale under the Grain Exchange Rules binding upon their principal; that no contract binding on the principal outside of these rules had been entered into, and, consequently, that he was not liable to indemnify them for any loss sustained by reason of their contract. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment at the trial, by Macdonald J. and maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nHaydon for the appellant. The judgment appealed from is erroneous in holding, in effect, that the rules of the \"Exchange\" were incorporated in and became part of the authority to sell and that appellant is liable to indemnify plaintiffs against any loss incurred by them as a consequence of selling in the manner in which they did; that the appellant was a foreign principal and his agents had, therefore, authority to sell in their own name and, having done so, appellant should indemnify them against loss; that instructions by a non-member to a member of a Grain Exchange authorizes the member to contract in his own name regardless of whether the non-member knows that the member belongs to an Exchange or of whether the non-member instructs him to deal or knows that he will deal on that market; that the respondents had authority to contract in their own names; and that privity of contract was established between the buyer and the appellant, still calling appellant a foreign principal.\nThe respondents were only agents to establish privity of contract between the appellant and a third party and were not authorized or justified in assuming any liability whatever. The custom or rule of the Grain Exchange whereby the \"clearing house\" became principals with its members was unreasonable and of no effect as far as the appellant was concerned. The evidence shews that the liability, if any, assumed by respondents was a liability to the \"clearing house\" and not to the purchaser of the oats and that that liability was not one of any particular trade, but rather a balancing on each day's transaction. The appellant should not be held to have contemplated as part of the authority to sell grain for him an agreement to indemnify respondents against any such liability.\nIn the absence of specific instructions to the contrary an agent to sell has only authority to establish privity of contract between his principal as vendor and some third person as purchaser. Robinson v. Mollett[2]. There were no instructions to sell on a particular market, the appellant did not know that the respondents were members of the Exchange or that it existed, he was never informed of the alleged custom, and knew nothing of \"margins\" or \"options.\" North-West Transportation Co. v. McKenzie[3]; Northern Elevator Co. v. Lake Huron & Manitoba Milling Co.[4]; Kirchner v. Venus[5], at page 399.\nThe respondent, Smith, admitted that he did not attempt to sell the grain to any one other than a member of the Exchange, but would not say that he could not have disposed of it elsewhere. He admitted that he might have sold direct to a consumer in which case he would not have incurred any personal responsibility. Even assuming a custom to be incorporated in a contract it can only control the mode of performance, it cannot change its intrinsic character. Mollett v. Robinson[6], at page 656, per Willes J. No custom, and certainly not one that is unreasonable, is binding upon a person merely because he instructs a broker on the Stock Exchange to enter into a transaction with him. Benjamin v. Barnett[7]. The principal, is not fixed with loss suffered by agents, members of a stock exchange, unless it is found that the contract contemplated that the business would be under and according to the rules of that exchange, or that the rules thereof were incorporated into the contract of employment. Bibb v. Allen[8]; Irwin v. Williar[9]; Risdon Iron and Locomotive Works v. Furness[10]; Halbronn v. International Horse Agency and Exchange[11]; Robinson v. Mollett[12], at pp. 837 and 838; Hartas v. Ribbons[13]; Chapman v . Shepherd[14], at p. 237; Van Dusen-Harrington Co. v. Morton[15]; Duncan v. Hill[16].\nNothing more unreasonable than the alleged custom could be imagined. On the contrary the appellant would expect to enter into a contract where he sold direct and was not asked for margins.\nAs to the contention that the appellant was a foreign principal and the presumption being that the appellant did not give the respondents authority to pledge his credit, even if this be so, and if in such circumstances the agents might contract in their own names, they had no power to make a contract with an outsider\u2014such as the clearing house. The authority of the agent, in such circumstances, is one of fact, and there is no finding by the trial judge on the point, nor could such a finding have been reached, on the evidence. Webb v. Sharman[17].\nThe appellant was a home producer, a farmer with land in Manitoba and the grain proposed to be sold was growing on that farm. The plaintiffs were aware of this, and in the preceding years they had themselves bought the crop from off this same farm. They did not treat him as a foreign principal, but simply continued their business relations, the only difference being that, on former occasions, they had bought direct from him instead of acting as his agents to sell. It is clear that they had authority to contract in defendant's name. He was selling the actual grain and he expected, and had a right to expect, that he would receive a contract with some third party to whom the sale was made.\nThe presumption that an agent has no authority to pledge the credit of a foreign principal only applies between merchants. It does not apply to a single transaction where the foreigner is a farmer. Hutton v. Bullock[18], per Brett J. at page 576; Kaltenbach, Fischer & Co. v. Lewis & Peat[19].\nThe rule as to a foreign principal not being liable to be sued or to sue upon a contract made on his behalf by a home agent and preventing the agent from pledging the credit of the foreign principal is based upon convenience, as the other party to the contract should not be expected to investigate the financial standing of or give credit to a foreign principal; Armstrong v. Stokes[20]; Ireland v. Livingston[21], at page 408; Elbinger Actien-Gesellschaft v. Claye[22]. The effect of Kaltenbach, Fischer & Co. v. Lewis & Peat[23], is misconceived by Perdue J. A foreigner cannot intervene and claim his rights as an undisclosed principal for all purposes.\nThe respondents contend that the appellant through his silence and on account of not answering the respondents' telegrams or letters acquiesced in what the respondents had done. The obvious answer is that before notifying the appellant they had already exceeded their authority and all the mischief had been done, they had placed themselves into a position from which they could not recede. Conmee v. Securities Holding Co.[24]. Silence with respect to transactions already past, cannot be held to alter the character of the authority conferred on the agents.\nEwart K.C. and Noble for the respondents. It is quite evident that the real reason of the appellant's default in delivering the oats was the unforeseen rise in the price. If the market price had fallen the appellant would have delivered the oats and got 381\/2 cents per bushel. There would have been no objection then to the sale the respondents had made for him or to the fact that it was made in their own name on his account. The defences raised in his pleading shew that the contention he is now relying upon was not present to his mind when he deliberately defaulted or for long after. All the contentions raised by his statement of defence he either failed to support at the trial or did not attempt to support.\nThe construction, which the respondents put upon the appellant's instructions, that they were to sell 4,000 bushels of oats for the appellant for future de- livery in the ordinary and customary way in vogue at the place where the sale was to be made is reasonable. If he intended some other construction to be put on this letter he should have made it plain. If he intended his agents to adopt an unusual, and in this case no doubt impossible, way of selling the oats he should have specified this mode of selling in his letter of instructions. Where the authority conferred on an agent is fairly capable of more than one construction, every act done by him in good faith which is warranted by any one of those constructions is deemed to have been duly authorized though the construction adopted and acted on by him was not the one intended by the principal: Boden v. French[25]; Ireland v. Livingston[26]; Bowstead on Agency (3 ed.) 66. The respondents, therefore, having adopted the most reasonable construction and the only reasonable construction under the circumstances, and having carried them out in good faith and having notified their principal, he should not have stood by for over two months without raising any objection. He should be taken as having acquiesced in and ratified what the agents did. Story on Agency, 302; Evans on Principal and Agent, 110.\nThe appellant contends that he intended his instructions to be taken to mean that the respondents were to have found some purchaser for these oats who would have been willing to look to the credit of a foreign principal for the delivery of the oats and that an agreement to that effect should have been drawn up in which the principals only and not the agents were to be bound. This would have been obviously impossible and unreasonable from any practical point of view and it is hardly possible that any grain broker or any grain producer who had for years been dealing with grain brokers would have ever contemplated such a thing. A person who employs a broker must be supposed to give him authority to act as other brokers do. It does not matter whether or not he himself is acquainted with the rules by which such brokers are governed. Sutton v. Tatham[27]; Bayliffe v. Butter-worth[28]; Pollock v. Stables[29]; Dos Passos on Stock Brokers, 424.\nThe distinction of Robinson v. Mollett[30] is quite apparent because, in the present case, the contract effected is in strict compliance with the written authority, and the custom of grain brokers contracting in their own names on sales for future delivery, especially when their principals are foreigners, residing in a foreign country, is, to say the least, reasonable.\nThe appellant being a foreigner, resident in a foreign country, the presumption is against the right of the agents to bind him unless expressly authorized. Armstrong v. Stokes[31]; Elbinger Actien-Gesellschaft v. Claye[32]; Hutton v. Bulloch[33].\nThe appellant was, under the contract, in the same position as if it had been made in his own name. His rights would have been the same. He could have sued the buyer either in his own name or in that of the respondents. Anderson & Co. v. Beard[34]; Levitt v. Hamblet[35]; Ponsolle v. Webber[36]; Scott & Norton v. Godfrey[37]; Nickalls v. Merry[38]; Browning v. Provincial Ins. Co.[39]; Bell v. Plumbly[40]; Kaltenbach, Fischer & Co. v. Lewis & Peat[41].\nThe respondents have a right to be indemnified by the appellant against liabilities incurred in executing his orders. Thacker v. Hardy[42], at p. 687; Bayley v. Wilkins[43]; Bowstead on Agency (3 ed.), pp. 202-210, and cases there collected.\nHaydon for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. and Noble for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons given in the court below.\nGirouard J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The right to maintain this action seems to me to depend entirely upon the answer to the question whether or not the rules and regulations of the Winnipeg Corn Exchange can be held applicable as against the defendant to the contract of sale of 4,000 bushels of oats alleged by the plaintiffs to have been sold by them as his brokers to Pearson, and which oats defendant failed to deliver. Both Murphy and Pearson were members of this Corn Exchange and there does not seem to be evidence to justify any holding that the sale was not as between them binding under these rules.\nIt seems equally plain to me that, apart from these rules and regulations, no binding or enforceable contract was made by the plaintiffs as defendant's brokers with respect to this sale.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action as I gather upon this ground. The Court of Appeal, proceeding mainly upon the ground that these rules and regulations were binding upon the defendant, reversed that judgment and awarded plaintiffs damages equal to the loss he had sustained by reason of defendant's refusal to carry out the contract alleged to have been made on his behalf by the plaintiffs.\nAssuming the law to be that these rules and regulations were binding upon the defendant, quoad this transaction, I see no reason to doubt that the conclusions of the Court of Appeal were correct and that the broker could recover against his client for indemnity in respect of the grain sold for the client in a way sanctioned by the rules and usages of the grain exchange.\nI am not able, however, to see upon what ground these rules can be held applicable to the contract as far as defendant is concerned. He was a farmer, living at the time he gave plaintiffs the authority to sell his oats, in Nebraska but carrying on farming also in Manitoba at a place called Snowflake,\nThe evidence is clear and uncontradicted that defendant did not know Murphy & Co. in any other character than as dealers in grain. As such he had on several different occasions sold them his surplus grain. The sales were bona fide sales and had nothing to do with \"futures,\" \"options,\" or \"margins.\" Defendant swears that his\nonly knowledge of the plaintiffs was that they were grain merchants in Winnipeg buying and selling grain at one cent per bushel. That he supposed they were independent grain merchants and that they never informed him they were in any way connected with the Grain Exchange.\nThere was no evidence in any way contradicting these statements and the previous dealings between the parties tend to confirm them. Defendant swears that \"he did not know what a 'margin' or an 'option' was\"; that he never did anything except sell his grain, and that the reason why he did not reply to the letters and telegrams the plaintiffs wrote to him asking him to put up margins, etc., was that he \"felt that they were trying to ring him into an option deal.\"\nDefendant's authority to plaintiffs to sell reads as follows:\nBellwood, Neb., August 14, 1907.\nG. B. Murphy,\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of recent date enclosing market report rec'd. I shall be North in about four weeks to look after the new crop, and if you can sell No. 2 oats for 37c. or better, in store Fort William, you had better sell 4,000 bus. for me, and I will be up at Snowflake then so I can look after the loading of them, and I will send the old oats then.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) Harry Butler.\nThere is some ambiguity about the time of delivery and, in consequence of that, I think that when plaintiffs replied they had sold his oats per slip inclosed for October delivery, he was in duty bound, had the slip been enclosed, to have promptly repudiated the construction put upon his letter of a delivery in October if that did not express his intention.\nBut, as a fact, defendant says, and he is confirmed by his wife, that no such slip was enclosed and that he had no knowledge who the purchaser was and expected further letters giving him the information. The evidence respecting the enclosure of this slip having been in accordance with mercantile custom is defective and insufficient, and my conclusion is that defendant did not receive it.\nAs a fact, the further letters and telegrams were demands upon him for $300 and $400 to be put up in margins, and he then concluded as he says that his agents were trying to \"ring him into an option deal\" and ignored their communications.\nAs I find the rules and usages of the Grain Exchange were not, under the circumstances of this case, binding on the defendant or applicable to the authority he gave the plaintiffs to sell, the only remaining question is whether or not, apart from these rules and usages, there was any contract for sale of defendant's oats made by his agents, the plaintiffs, which bound defendant.\nThis question is largely one of the intention of all the parties to be gathered or inferred from the facts and circumstances. As I have said I do not think the rules of the Exchange applied or were ever intended by defendant to apply.\nThe specific thing the plaintiffs had authority to do was to make a contract for the sale of defendant's oats.\nThey clearly had no authority to sell to themselves. The contract of sale they were authorized to make was one in which the defendant was to be one party and a person or firm found by the plaintiffs the other. The making of such a contract was, therefore, as said by Brett J. in his answer to the question put to the judges by the House of Lords in Robinson v. Mollett[44], at page 820:\nThe very essence of their contract with the defendant which is a contract of employment. This case of Robinson v. Mollett[45] does not determine the point in question here, but the reasoning on which the conclusions there reached is based is alike instructive and controlling.\nI think, in the view I take of the facts of this case, the language of Blackburn J., approved by the Lord Chancellor in delivering the judgment of the House of Lords in Robinson v. Mollett45, at page 837, very applicable to this appeal\nthat the respondent's mode of executing the appellant's orders was a departure from the ordinary duty of a broker, that duty requiring the broker to establish privity of contract between the two principals.\nIt is another mode of expressing what Brett J., said in the quotation I have above given from his opinion.\nFor the reasons, therefore, that the rules and usages of the Stock Exchange must be eliminated from our consideration in determining the defendant's liability and that the very essence of the contract of employment made between the parties required the broker to establish privity of contract between the two principals and that the contract alleged to have been made was one which though binding between the two brokers under the Stock Exchange rules was not binding upon or enforceable by the defendant, I think this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action restored with costs in all courts.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was a farmer whose home was in Nebraska at the time of the happenings that gave rise to this action, but had been in Manitoba for some years before then where he owned and farmed land, latterly worked on shares.\nIn doing so he had known respondents as grainmerchants and sold them part of his crops for three or four years in succession and, being minded to do so again with his crop of 1907, wrote them on the 2nd of August of that year asking the best price for a certain quality of oats \"on track at Snowflake\" (which was a Canadian Pacific Railway station near his Manitoba farm), \"or store Winnipeg, or Fort William\" and to have daily market list sent to him for the next thirty days. He added he should have a fair crop at Snow-flake.\nThe following correspondence ensued:\nBellwood, Neb., August 14, 1907.\nG. B. Murphy,\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of recent date enclosing market report rec'd. I shall be North in about four weeks to look after the new crop and if you can sell No. 2 oats for 37c. or better, in store Fort William, you had better sell 4,000 bus. for me, and I will be up at Snowflake then so I can look after the loading of them, and I will send the old oats then.\nYours truly,\nHarry Butler.\nWinnipeg, Aug. 20th, 1907.\nH. Butler, Esq.,\nBellwood, Nebraska.\nDear Sir,\u2014Received your favour 14th yesterday and sold 4,000 bus. October oats for you as per slip enclosed, which we hope you will find correct. Will be glad to have the handling of your car old oats as soon as you are able to get it shipped out. If you will notice we sold this 4,000 bus. for October delivery, which we presume is what you require.\nWill be glad to hear from you again at any time.\nYours truly,\nG. B. Murphy & Co.,\nW. Scott,\nPro manager.\nThe appellant denies that he ever received slip referred to, and it is not proven that any such slip was ever put in the letter. The person whose duty it would have been to enclose the slip and mail the letter was not called. No explanation is offered for this.\nI know of no case where such omission in a chain of proof was ever accepted as proof to found a claim upon.\nThe appellant says he expected the letter would be followed by a contract binding the purchaser to him and for him to sign binding himself to the purchaser.\nInstead, the next thing was a telegram from the respondents dated the 7th of Sept., 1907, asking him as follows:\nPlease wire three hundred dollars margins on oats to our credit Bank Hamilton.\nThe conflict as to another letter concerns no one now, save as to the suspicions the incident suggests, but with which I submit we have nothing to do here.\nWe have to take the two letters copied above and the telegram of the 7th September and see if it is possible to found on them any obligation on the part of the appellant which would support such a judgment as the Court of Appeal has entered for f 985 and reversing the trial judge's dismissal of the action.\nThe conduct of the appellant has been severely criticized, but boorish or stupid or dishonest conduct does not merely because of its quality found a contract.\nWe are told these respondents are brokers and hence flows much in law.\nThey are as one of them describes them \"grain merchants.\" They were not addressed as brokers or commission agents though the latter is what their solicitor calls them in his statement of claim.\nThe appellant knew them only as the buyers of his grain.\nMr. Smith says frankly in his evidence that such is the quality of the business they had done with each other and that he never knew the appellant in a margin transaction before. Nor do they offer any excuse for supposing he meant this deal to be something of a different kind from that of marketing his farm produce.\nThe letter of the appellant does not warrant the wide inferences of fact drawn therefrom to found thereon any application of the authorities cited for what may be undoubted law.\nThe letter tells them that the appellant in four weeks from the 14th August will go to Snowflake and be there looking after loading of oats and will send the old oats then. And forthwith they rush on to change next day and sell according to terms implied as binding those trading on that grain exchange, 4,000 bushels of oats for October delivery.\nThe letter does not say October, but indicates a time in September and, as a fact, the oats were stored in grain elevator between the 3rd and the 6th of October.\nThe Chief Justice of Manitoba erroneously, I submit with great respect, founds his judgment on supposed instructions to sell for October delivery given to a broker with whom the appellant had former dealings.\nThe facts and the letter do not warrant these assumptions, or any of them and yet each and all are needed to support the holding of the court below.\nThe appellant denied that he ever dealt in buying or selling any grain on the Grain Exchange or that he knew the respondents or any of them were members of the Exchange or that in any way he was expected to have bound himself to abide by the rules thereof and there is not a word to contradict him. And whatever may be said of his failure, from stupidity or want of sense of propriety, to reply to the numerous letters and telegrams the conduct of the respondents pouring out telegrams and letters unnoticed and without stopping to investigate the reason for no reply seems ridiculous. The man might, for aught they knew, have been dead from the 14th day of August; and, had that been the case, how could they have hoped to look to his estate, with nothing to rest upon but the letter of that date?\nIs their position any stronger because the appellant failed to reply?\nThe act of the agent having exceeded, his specific authority how can he add to it by silence of the principal?\nThe silent contempt of the latter for an agent clearly exceeding his authority may in some cases be most fitting.\nIn other cases it might be most contemptible conduct to so treat a communication made in good faith, yet how could the doing so add to the expressly limited authority?\nIf the agent before acting had written saying I understand your instructions to mean so and so and unless I hear from you to the contrary within a named reasonable time and no answer had been vouchsafed the principal's conduct might have bound him but where, as here, the agent goes on to do what evidently he felt was doubtful and then sought for ratification from his principal's silence he presumed too much.\nThe ratification by conduct of an agent's act as of any other person's acts can only bind when clearly attributable to such a purpose and with full knowledge and appreciation of what the agent had really done. To be able to understand the question of either ratification or aught else in the case we must determine what was the appellant's intention in his letter of the 14th of August.\nLet any one analyze the letter and see how it could be conceivable to take out of it in the light of the past relations and dealings of the parties with each other, authority to make immediate sale on a grain exchange of a future option for October delivery as within what is meant by a man going up in four weeks to harvest, sell and deliver his crop.\nThe retainer of a broker to go on change or sell or buy such options implies a readiness in the principal to put up such margins as may be necessary from time to time if and when needed and demanded as here.\nIf the respondents on the failure of the appellant, early in September, to meet such demands of indemnity had brought an action therefor and the true nakedness of this case, divested of the suspicions later events surrounded it with, had become clear, it seems hard to conceive of judgment being given for the $300. Yet, if the claim will not stand that test it must fail.\nThen the entire case of a contract made on change to be governed by the rules and practices of that market is so entirely different in every way from what the ordinary farmer's methods of marketing his crops implies that unless the former and not the latter is what an agent to sell is told to adopt the court should not, as of course, assume that such a letter as in question carries with it the authority to adopt the Grain Exchange methods.\nSo much was this and much more relative to that phase of the case clear to counsel for the respondents that they, in argument, sought to eliminate from the case all that appears therein as to the claim for margins.\nThat will not do. For if the agent had authority to go on to that market he had a right to use and submit to all the legal methods known to arise for and against an agent sent there to deal and the principal as a consequence would be bound to indemnify; and he either ratified all or nothing.\nFor example, an agent employed merely to form a contract requiring for its validity compliance with the Statute of Frauds would be bound to see the statute complied with or would fail through his own, negligence to have become entitled to either commission or indemnity.\nOn the other hand, he who sends a broker to an exchange where they both well know compliance with the Statute of Frauds may be well nigh impossible, but the other effective means of compelling an agent to observe the contracts he makes there are daily observed these conditions when known to a principal are such as to imply that the principal has undertaken to indemnify step by step if such be the rule or practice even though the Statute of Frauds may not have been complied with.\nThe rules and practice governing members of the Exchange in question having been ruled out at the trial I put the case, hypothetically, as to the Statute of Frauds, which it seemed to be admitted had not been complied with.\nNot having been complied with and the nature of the agency requiring a compliance I think that alone should end the respondent's case. See Wright on Principal and Agent (2 ed.), p. 134. The cases relative to what might be the rights and remedies between principals in two different countries or jurisdictions when an agent in the same country as one of such principals has entered into a contract on behalf of the other have little or nothing to do with this case.\nIn the last analysis all that class of cases and the agent's rights and duties and remedies rest upon, as this must rest upon, what was the intention of the parties.\nThe real point here is, taking these things into consideration, whether or not the appellant intended when penning the letter and using the expression therein \"you had better sell 4,000 bus. for me\" set as it is in relation to what is to be done, and when it is to be done, and who is to carry it out, the contract of the buyer should have been formed as it was with the agent or with his principal, the writer of the letter.\nIf it means that the appellant intended the contract to have been with himself as its language and all else I have referred to seem to imply then that privity of contract was never brought about and the respondents' action rightfully failed.\nCan any one imagine the respondents would have acted differently had the letter come from Snowflake instead of Bellwood, or that the slightest consideration was given to the International boundary line?\nTheir great error was in hastily misconceiving the nature of the business they were asked to attend to and attending to something else entirely different.\nHence they have themselves to blame entirely regardless of what the appellant's character or conduct may have been.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the trial judge's judgment restored with costs of the courts below.\nDuff J. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Richards, Affleck & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hunt, Noble & Card.\n[1] 18 Man.

By 8 Edw. VII. ch. 75 (Que.) the amount required to permit of an appeal to His Majesty in Council was fixed at $5,000 instead of \u00a3500 as theretofore.\nHeld, that said Act did not govern a case in which the judgment of the Court of Review was pronounced before it came into force.\nBy sec. 70 of the Supreme Court Act notice must be given of an appeal from the judgment, inter alia \"upon a motion for a new trial.\"\nHeld, that such provision only applies when the motion is made for a new trial and nothing else and notice is not necessary where the proposed appeal is from the judgment on a motion for judgment non obstante or, in the alternative, for a new trial.\nIn order to determine whether or not a ship is a constructive total loss under a policy of marine insurance the value of the hull when broken up should be added to the cost of repairs. Macbeth v. Maritime Insurance Co. ((1908) A.C. 144) followed. Every vessel submerged in a river is not ipso facto to be deemed a constructive total loss. The total loss of its cargo rendering the further prosecution of the particular voyage or adventure \"not worth pursuing\" does not, in itself, warrant a finding that a vessel is a constructive total loss; and the trial judge having instructed the jury that, if they found such a loss on cargo they might, thereupon, find, under article 2522 of the Civil Code, that the vessel itself was a constructive total loss, their finding that the vessel was a constructive total loss was set aside for misdirection and a partial new trial was ordered.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 34 S.C. 127) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal,[1] affirming the judgment entered in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by Mr. Justice Hutchison, upon the verdict of the jury at the trial, in favour of the plaintiffs for $2,700 with interest and costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Pope for the appellants.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and G. H. Montgomery for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendants, marine insurance underwriters, appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, sitting in review, affirming the judgment of Hutchison J. in favour of the plaintiffs (the insured) upon a policy of marine insurance on the cargo of the barge \"Maria.\" The risk, was upon \"total loss\" of the cargo caused \"by total loss of vessel.\" The jury found that there was an actual total loss of the cargo and a constructive total loss of the barge. The appeal is against the latter finding and generally upon grounds of misdirection.\nThe respondents raise two objections to the jurisiction of this court: 1st, that the amount involved, $2,700, does not give the right of appeal; 2ndly, that no notice of appeal was given by the appellant pursuant to section 70 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe provincial legislation raising the limit of cases appealable from the Court of Review to the Privy Council from \u00a3500 to $5,000 (8 Edw. VII. c. 75) became law on the 25th April, 1908. The judgment in appeal was rendered by the Court of Review on the 22nd April, 1908. The right of appeal had already vested in the appellants when the statute upon which the respondents rely was passed. The statute, which contains no provision making it retroactive and does not deal with procedure only but affects rights, does not in my opinion take away the right of appeal in this case conferred by section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe other objection, based upon section 70 of the Supreme Court Act, is, I think, also ill-founded. That section is as follows:\n70. No appeal upon a special case, or from the judgment upon a motion to enter a verdict or non-suit upon a point reserved at the trial or from the judgment upon a motion for a new trial, shall be allowed, unless notice thereof is given in writing to the opposite party, or his attorney of record, within twenty days after the decision complained of, or within such further time as the court appealed from, or a judge thereof, allows.\nThis is not an appeal upon a special case, nor from a judgment upon a motion to enter a verdict or nonsuit upon a point reserved at the trial. No point was reserved at the trial. Neither do I think it is an appeal \"from the judgment upon a motion for a new trial\" within the meaning of that phrase in section 70. The motion in the court below was for judgment in favour of the defendants non obstante veredicto, and, only in the event of the defendants not being entitled to this relief and as an incidental alternative, for a new trial. In my view the words \"motion for a new trial,\" in section 70, should be read as meaning \"motion for a new trial only\" and not as including cases in which the motion is substantially for other relief and only as an alternative for a new trial. See Leishman v. Garland[2], at page 243. Upon any other construction this section would apply to almost every appealable case, which was manifestly not intended.\nI therefore think the objections to the jurisdiction cannot prevail.\nUpon the merits there can be no doubt that there has been a partial mistrial of this action. The questions for the jury were framed and the trial itself was conducted upon the principles laid down by the English Court of Appeal in Angel v. Merchants Marine Insurance Co.[3]. The mixed question of law and fact, whether or not there had been a constructive total loss of the vessel, was left to the jury, but upon a direction by the learned judge which gave to them an entirely mistaken standard as to what constitutes a constructive total loss. The test of constructive total loss according to the Angel Case3 should be whether the cost of permanent repair would or would not exceed the value of the ship so repaired, and the shipowner is not entitled to add the value of the wreck to the cost of repair in determining whether there was a constructive total loss of the ship. This decision was distinctly overruled by the House of Lords in Macbeth v. Maritime Insurance Co.[4], and it was there decided that\nin determining the question whether a ship seriously damaged by perils insured against can be treated as a constructive total loss the test is whether a prudent, uninsured owner would have repaired her having regard to all the circumstances. In this calculation the assured is entitled to add the break-up value of the ship to the estimated cost of repairs.\nThe jury were not asked to find and have not found the break-up value of the wreck as she lay on the bottom of the river. The evidence upon this point, to which little attention seems to have been directed, is unsatisfactory and conflicting.\nBut the defendants' interests were not prejudiced by the application of the test propounded in the Angel Case[5], which is more favourable to them than that established by the Macbeth Case4. This misdirection might not therefore, without more, warrant the setting aside of the finding that the vessel was a constructive total loss.\nThat every vessel which sinks in one of our rivers is ipso facto to be deemed a constructive total loss\u2014 as contended by the learned counsel for the respondents\u2014is a view, in my opinion, not warranted by anything said in the Macbeth Case4, and not consonant with the test of constructive total loss there formulated.\nIn his charge the learned trial judge applied to the question of constructive total loss of the vessel a test prescribed by article 2522 of the Civil Code for determining when a loss is constructively total, which appears to be intended for application only to the case of loss of cargo. The article reads:\nTotal loss may be either absolute or constructive. It is abso lute when the thing insured is wholly destroyed or lost. It is constructive when, by reason of any event insured against, the thing though not wholly destroyed or lost becomes of little or no value to the insured, or the voyage and adventure are lost or rendered not worth pursuing.\nThe learned judge told the jury in effect that a total loss of the cargo would result in the voyage and adventure of the barge being lost or rendered not worth pursuing and, therefore, that if they found that the cargo was a total loss they might find for that reason that the vessel itself was a constructive total loss. He put it in this way:\nHere is the other alternative. It is constructive total loss when the voyage and adventure are lost or not worth pursuing. There is no doubt this voyage was not pursued. It was not continued. Was it worth continuing under the circumstances, with the cargo gone? Now it is a matter for you to decide.\nIt is impossible to support the finding of constructive total loss of the vessel based upon this direction.\nThere remains the question whether the motion of the appellants for judgment in their favour non obstante veredicto should prevail, or whether their relief must be limited to the granting of a new trial. Upon this question being raised in the course of argument counsel referred to articles 496 and 508 of the Code of Civil Procedure. These provisions are both found in chapter XXI, which is intituled \"Trial by jury\" and in section X, which is headed \"Remedies against Judgments and Proceedings in Reserved Cases.\" Article 496 reads: 496. The court may, in all cases where the judgment of the trial judge, or the verdict in a reserved case, is attacked, apply any remedy by which it considers that the ends of justice will be attained, even if such remedy has not been specifically demanded by any of the parties.\nArticle 508 reads:\n508. A judgment different, in whole or in part, from that rendered by the trial judge, or from the verdict in a reserved case, may be rendered in any of the following cases:\n1. When the facts as found by the jury require a judgment in favour of the party moving or inscribing, or the judge has erred as to the real effect of the verdict;\n2 When the allegations of the party in whose favour the verdict or the judgment has been rendered, are not sufficient in law to maintain his pretensions;\n3. When it is absolutely clear from all the evidence that no jury would be justified in finding any verdict other than one in favour of the party moving or inscribing.\nDealing first with article 508, it is apparent that when the party moving attacks merely the judgment and does not seek to set aside the verdict the appellate tribunal is given jurisdiction to enter in favour of the party moving any judgment warranted by the findings of fact or the real effect of the verdict. But when the party moving attacks the verdict itself and must set it aside to obtain relief, two restrictions are placed upon the exercise of its power by the court: First, it must be a verdict \"in a reserved case\"; and secondly, it must be absolutely clear from all the evidence that no jury would be justified in finding any verdict not in his favour. We are not dealing with a reserved case and it cannot be contended that the other provisions apply. It follows that the appellant cannot have judgment non obstante veredicto under article 508.\nTurning to article 496, it is apparent that a motion against a judgment merely, involving no attack upon the verdict, may be made in any case; but where the party moving would attack the verdict there must have been a reserved case to enable the court to exercise the powers conferred by this article. There was not, as already stated, a case reserved by the trial judge. This action came before the Court of Review by inscription of the defendants.\nNeither under article 508 nor under article 496, therefore, are the appellants entitled to ask that the findings of the jury should be set aside, new findings made upon conflicting evidence and thereupon judgment entered in their favour.\nAn instance in which article 496 was successfully invoked by a party dissatisfied with the judgment in an action tried with a jury is found in Roberts v. Hawkins[6], in 1898.\nWhether, where there is a reserved case under articles 496 and 508, the appellate courts in Quebec should exercise wider powers than are exercised by English appellate tribunals under the judicature rules is a question which I desire to leave open for future consideration should such a case arise. See authorities collected in Snow's Annual Practice, 1909, at page 574, in the Yearly Practice, 1909, at page 539, and in Holmested & Langton's Judicature Act, (Ont.) (3 ed.) pages 812-814, 1059; also Ferguson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[7], per Lemieux J., at p. 82.\nUpon the important question as to the break-up value of the wreck there is no finding of the jury. Their finding of constructive total loss based upon misdirection as to the application and effect of article 2522 C.C. must be set aside. The making of a new finding upon that question would involve determining the breakup value, which, according to the evidence, may be any sum between $l00 and $700, and it might be necessary to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses who give evidence upon it. That is eminently a function of the jury which should not in my view be usurped by an appellate court. McLachlan v. The Accident Ins. Co. of North America, in 1890,[8].\nSome of the findings of the jury, such as the 8th and 9th, seem quite irrelevant; but, if disregarded, they will probably be innocuous. They may, therefore, be allowed to stand with the other findings properly made. The questions covered by these latter findings it seems unnecessary to submit to the consideration of a fresh jury.\nIt follows that the judgment below should be vacated and the finding of the jury upon the 10th question set aside. The action should be remitted to the Superior Court in order that another jury may determine the break-up value of the wrecked vessel, which they should be asked to find specifically. They should also be asked to find whether the vessel was or was not a constructive total loss according to the test propounded in Macbeth & Co., Ltd. v. Maritime Ins. Co.[9]. Upon the findings already made and which are undisturbed, supplemented by such new findings, the Superior Court will then direct such judgment to be entered as it deems proper.\nThe appellants should have their costs of the appeal to this court and of the proceedings in the Court of Review. The costs of the abortive trial should abide the event of the new trial. Motion to quash dismissed and appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lafleur, Macdougall, Macfarlane & Pope.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] Q.R. 34 S.C. 127.\n[2] 3 Ont.

[1906] ch. 140, it should be decided on a rule or principle of law and not merely on what the judge of the court considers fair and just between the parties.\nIn 1873 a treaty was entered into between the Government of Canada and the Salteaux tribe of Ojibeway Indians inhabiting land acquired by the former from the Hudson Bay Co. By said treaty the Salteaux agreed to surrender to the government all their right, title and interest in and to said lands and the government agreed to provide reserves, maintain schools and prohibit the sale of liquor therein and allow the Indians to hunt and fish, to make a present of $12 for each man, woman and child in the bands and pay each Indian $5 per year and salaries and clothing to each chief and sub-chief; also to furnish farming implements and stock to those cultivating land. At the time the treaty was made the boundary between Ontario and Manitoba had not been defined. When it was finally determined, in 1884, it was found that 30,500 square miles of the territory affected by it was in Ontario and in 1903 the Dominion Government brought before the Exchequer Court a claim to be reimbursed for a proportionate part of the outlay incurred in extinguishing the Indian title. The Province disputed liability and, by counterclaim, asked for an account of the revenues received by the Dominion while administering the lands in the Province under a provisional agreement pending the adjustment of the boundary.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court (10 Ex. C.R. 445) Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting, that the Province was not liable; that the treaty was not made for the benefit of Ontario, but in pursuance of the general policy of the Dominion in dealing with Indians and with a view to the maintenance of peace, order and good government in the territory affected; and that no rule or principle of law made the Province responsible for expenses incurred in carrying out an agreement with the Indians to which it was not a party and for which it gave no mandate.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] condemning the Province of Ontario to pay a portion of the amount claimed by the Dominion as having been expended for the benefit of the province.\nIn 1873 the Dominion Government made a treaty with the Salteaux tribe of' Ojibeway Indians by which the latter surrendered all their rights and privileges in land covering the area from the watershed of Lake Superior to the North-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods and from the American border to the height of land from which the streams flow towards Hudson Bay, containing about 55,000 square miles. The payments to be made for such surrender and the obligations to be performed by the Dominion are stated in the above head-note.\nAt the time this treaty was made the boundary between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba had not been defined and the lands were administered by the Dominion and Ontario jointly pending such definition.\nIn 1878 the position of the boundary was referred to arbitration and finally determined in 1884, when it was found that some 30,000 square miles of the territory surrendered by said treaty was in Ontario. The Dominion eventually took proceedings in the Exchequer Court to recover from the province its proportionate share of the sums expended in carrying out the treaty.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court as published in the report[2], holds the province liable to re-pay the Dominion the amounts necessarily expended in extinguishing the Indian title to the lands in question and the question as to which of the sums claimed were so expended was reserved for further hearing. On Dec. 4th, 1907, judgment on the further hearing was given and formally entered as follows:\n\"Wednesday the 4th day of December, 1907.\n\"The further consideration of the questions involved in this action reserved by the judgment of this court of the 18th day of March, 1907, having come on for hearing at Ottawa on the 3rd and 4th days of December in the year of our Lord, 1907, before this court, in the presence of counsel for the respondent as well as the claimant, upon hearing the evidence and what was. alleged by counsel aforesaid. \"1. This court doth order and adjudge that the Dominion do recover from Ontario three hundred and five, four hundred and ninety-thirds (305-493) of all the following expenditures made by the Dominion to or on behalf of the Indians:\u2014\n\"(a) All expenditures made by the Dominion to the Indians in payment of annuities under the treaty in the pleadings mentioned at the rate of five dollars per annum for each Indian person from the date of the treaty to the date hereof.\n\"(b) All expenditures made by the Dominion for ammunition and twine for nets for the use of the Indians as provided by the said treaty, not however exceeding in the whole one thousand five hundred dollars per annum.\n\"(c) All expenses reasonably incurred by the Dominion for provisions and presents supplied to the Indians at the treaty negotiations, but not to exceed in the whole the sum of twenty-one thousand two hundred and ninety-six dollars and ninety-six cents, claimed in Schedule \"B\" of the statement of claim of the Dominion herein.\n\"(d) In respect of the payments made by the Dominion for or on account of the present of twelve dollars per head stipulated by the treaty to be paid to each man, woman and child of the bands of Indians represented at the treaty and claimed under the first item of Schedule \"A\" in the said statement of claim, the sum of five dollars per head.\n\"2. This court doth further order and adjudge that the action of the Dominion with respect to all classes of claims in the schedules of the said statement of claim, other than those in respect of which the Dominion has hereinbefore been adjudged to be entitled to recover, be dismissed, without prejudice, however, to the right of the Dominion to claim against Ontario by way of set-off to the counterclaim of Ontario the expenditures made for the surveys of reserves for farming lands and the other reserves for the Indians agreed for under the treaty, as part of the expense properly incurred by the Dominion in the administration of the disputed territory pursuant to the conventional boundary agreement between the Dominion and Ontario, of the 26th day of June, 1874.\n\"3. This court doth further order and adjudge that it be referred to the registrar of this court to inquire into and take an account of all sums expended by the Dominion in respect of the several classes of expenditure as to which the Dominion has hereinbefore been adjudged to be entitled to recover and report thereon to this court.\n\"4. This court doth further order and adjudge that it be referred to the registrar of this court to inquire into and take an account of all revenues collected by the Dominion under the said conventional boundary agreement, and also of all disbursements and expenditures duly made in the administration by the Dominion of the territory falling to be administered by the Dominion under the said agreement, and report thereon to this court.\n\"5. And this court doth reserve further directions until after the said registrar shall have made his report.\n\"6. This court doth make no order with respect to the question of costs in this action.\n\"(Sgd.) L. A. Audette, Registrar.\"\nThe province appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from both judgments and the Dominion cross-appealed for the amounts disallowed. Sir AEmilius Irving K.C., G. F. Shepley K.C., C. H. Ritchie K.C. and H. S. White, appeared for the appellant, the Province of Ontario.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, and W. D. Hogg K.C., appeared for the Dominion of Canada, respondent.\nRitchie K.C. opens for the appellant and deals first with the history of the proceedings in the Exchequer Court and with the general features of the Indian treaty. He then proceeds to argue that there was no liability on the part of the province to indemnify the Dominion Government for the financial burdens imposed by carrying out the treaty and goes on: The paramount object of the Dominion Government in entering into that treaty was not to extinguish the Indian title in favour of Ontario, but to enable the Dominion Government to carry out certain obligations into which it had theretofore entered. Under the \"British North America Act\" to the Dominion was assigned the obligation to maintain peace, order and good government throughout Canada. In addition to that, the care of the Indians and all responsibility in connection with the Indians was assigned to them; so that there were two obligations thrust upon them, the principal one being the maintenance of peace, order and good government throughout Canada. In 1870 the rebellion occurred and it was necessary to construct a route over which the troops might pass and they were most anxious to complete what was then known and is now known as the \"Dawson Route.\" The rebellion cost Canada a very large amount of money to quell, and in 1872 and 1873, spreading over these years from the time of the Riel Rebellion, there was a sense of uneasiness among all the Indians; they were disaffected more or less and there was also present to the Dominion Government the fear of another uprising among the Indians and they were, therefore, most anxious to do everything possible in order to effectually extinguish any ill-feeling that might exist on the part of these Indians.\nIdington J.\u2014Is there anywhere in the legislation affecting that point or anything in the practice that has prevailed upon it, to shew that the Dominion would have a claim over against any particular province that derived some direct benefit from its steps, whatever they were?\nMr. Ritchie: Nothing whatever, my lord. The liability was cast upon the Dominion and it is a national question. It was cast upon the Dominion, as the Dominion, representing all the provinces. It was something that the Dominion and the Dominion alone was liable for. If they had not made this treaty and another rebellion had occurred, an uprising of these same Indians, it would have cost, no doubt, ten times the amount of money that they are paying under this treaty to have quelled that rebellion and restored peace and order and that obligation rested on the Dominion under the express provisions of the \"British North America Act.\" So that it was not Ontario they were looking after; it was not the extinguishment of the Indian title so that Ontario might get a benefit; but they had the particular paramount object to which I have referred, as also other objects of a Dominion character, a national character, which they were obliged to carry out and in order to carry these out it was necessary for them to secure a passage through the territory occupied by these Indians, and to see that people passing over this line were not molested; it was also necessary for them to endeavour, as far as possible to obtain the good will of the chiefs of these tribes so as to get them to undertake thab they would do all in their power to preserve peace and good will and to prevent subjects of Her Majesty crossing this territory, from being molested. That is shewn by the treaty itself. When you look at the last clause of the treaty, see what it is that they get from the Indians. The undertaking they get from the Indians is an undertaking that enures to the benefit of the Dominion and the Dominion alone. All the obligations undertaken by these Indians were obligations which it was necessary that the Dominion, in the national interests, should secure. After pointing out the presents they were giving, what they were to do in the way of maintenance of schools and so on, they take from the Indians the covenants which are the consideration for what they are giving. \"And the undersigned chiefs on their own behalf and on behalf of all other Indians inhabiting the tracts within ceded, do hereby solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this treaty, and also to conduct and behave themselves as good and loyal subjects of Her Majesty the Queen. They promise and engage that they will in all respects obey and abide by the law; that they will maintain peace and good order between each other and also between themselves and other tribes of Indians, and between themselves and others of Her Majesty's subjects, whether Indians or whites, now inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit any part of the said ceded tract, and that they will not molest the person or property of any inhabitant of such ceded tract, or the property of Her Majesty the Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person passing or travel ling through the said tract or any part thereof, and that they will aid and assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to justice and punishment, any Indians offending against the stipulations of this treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the country so ceded.\" These are the covenants and promises of the Indians.\nDavies J.\u2014Are these considerations any different from the considerations which enter into the negotiation of all Indian treaties?\nMr. Ritchie: I am not able to say how that is. Probably similar stipulations have been put in other treaties. All I am emphasizing is that these are stipulations which enure to the benefit of the Dominion, to whom was assigned the obligation of maintaining peace, order and good government. Then, as I pointed out to your lordships, if a rebellion had broken out the cost of quelling that would rest upon the Dominion and be paid out of the Dominion Exchequer and no portion could be charged up against any of the provinces.\nThen, after referring to the conventional boundary agreement and the surrender by the Hudson Bay Co. of their interest in these lands counsel proceeds as follows on the question of the obligation of the Dominion to build the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThere is an Imperial order in council of 16th May, 1871, that after the 20th of July, 1871, British Columbia shall become part of the Dominion.\nClause 11 of that Imperial order in council is that the government of the Dominion undertake to secure the commencement simultaneously within two years of the date of the Union, the construction of a railway from the Pacific to the Rocky Mountains and from the east to the Rocky Mountains, and to complete that within ten years. The documents put in here shew that that is one of the objects they had in view. The documents shew, by the reports of those who were through there that the whole of this territory was not as valuable as 100 acres on the Red River.\nThen there is a report of those who were negotiating, and at that time your lordships will bear in mind that they were negotiating for a right of way simply, and the report is that they can acquire the whole title of the Indians, giving them reserves anywhere, the whole title just as easily as they can get the right of way. In other words, they could get the whole title just as easily as they could get the easement. Now, there is a letter from the Lieutenant-Governor to the Dominion of the 7th April, 1871. He says, \"practically you may count on having to deal with 1,000 savages in any treaty you make for a right of passage. Mr. Pither seems to think they would give up their rights to the whole country for much the same price they would ask for the right of way. If so, it would be useless to confine the purchase to a mere easement, though, after all, with the exception of the strip on Rainy River, they have no land worth owning.\" Up to that time they were negotiating for the passage of a right of way for an easement and they were negotiating for that easement in fulfilment of the obligations they had incurred in connection with this surrender and in connection with their obligations with British Columbia. Now then, what I say is that these are the reasons which operated upon the mind of the Dominion in endeavouring to negotiate the treaty at that time. Ontario, who owned the land, was not anxious to negotiate at that time. They had no idea of extinguishing the Indian title. They might not have done it for many years afterwards. They might have effected the surrender or extinguishment of that title on very much more advantageous terms than those obtained by the Dominion, and what right, I ask, has the Dominion to come in and simply say because for objects of their own in order to enable them to fulfil obligations they have entered into apart altogether from Ontario: We will negotiate this treaty on our own terms; true, we know you have claimed the land, but we will ignore that fact and we will go on and acquire that title, and if we find afterwards we get nothing by it we will turn around and ask you to bear the burden simply because you get the benefit of the extinguishment of the title?\nDuff J.\u2014Would Ontario have had power without the concurrence of the Dominion to make any arrangement to extinguish the title?\nMr. Ritchie: Perhaps not unless they could get it under the Proclamation of 1763, which did allow them to make arrangements with any one representing the government. Of course Ontario would represent one branch of the government and under that proclamation probably any arrangement entered into between Ontario and the Indians would be valid and binding as an extinguishment of the Indian title, unless it was contended that inasmuch as the \"British North America Act\" assigned to the Dominion the exclusive right to deal with Indian affairs, that that to some extent overrode the terms of the proclamation and would require Ontario to obtain the assent of the Dominion to any agreement that might be entered into. However that may be, I suppose there is no doubt that we could not go in there and deal with the Indians apart from getting an extinguishment of their title in any shape or form. In connection with that, as to settlement and opening up of the land, it was just as much in the interest of the Dominion, I submit, to have that opened up as Ontario. At all events to a very great extent, because when opened up for settlement, settlers were coming in from time to time and the revenues of the Dominion would be increased; the customs and excise duties would be increased. There was an interest that the Dominion might very reasonably be supposed to have in view, because the greater the settlement the greater the amount of revenue they are likely to obtain.\nNow let us consider the question on the admitted facts that the Dominion knew of the claim of Ontario to these lands; then without asking the assent of Ontario, having no mandate from Ontario and knowing, as I say, that Ontario was claiming the land as its own, the Dominion goes on and makes a treaty with the Indians, it being clear that there were many natives that would induce them to make this treaty, peculiar to the Dominion itself, and it turns out afterwards that the title they sought to acquire and which they thought might be a valid title, availed them nothing; can they turn around as a matter of law or equity and say to Ontario\u2014who claimed these lands, who did not authorize the Dominion in any way to negotiate in respect of this territory\u2014and say, because you have received some benefit you must assume the whole burden?\nIn other words, simply because two people are claiming to own a particular piece of property, why should one arrogate to himself the right to say, I know you are claiming, but I don't think your claim is good, I will ignore you and I will make a bargain off my own bat, so to speak, I will make my own bargain, I won't consult you, I will pay whatever I please and if it turns out that I get nothing by that bargain then I saddle you with the burden I have created. I submit that to permit any doctrine of that kind to get abroad would be subversive of all the interests in connection with property. If a bargain is made under these circumstances, surely the man makes the bargain at his own peril; knowing that another person is claiming to own this particular property, he enters into some contract and under that he benefits this particular individual who owns the property; I submit there is no principal of law or equity upon which he is entitled to recover. On that point take the case, for instance, of co-tenants, tenants in common of property, where one co-tenant goes on and makes improvements on the property owned by both, which necessarily benefits the other. It has been held by the Court of Appeal in England, that if he does that without the assent of the other he cannot claim any contribution, although the other undoubtedly receiver a benefit. That I submit is a stronger case than the present one.\nThe most recent case I have been able to find is directly in point and I will just read the head note. The principle is laid down in this way: \"There is no principle of law which requires a person to contribute to an outlay merely because he has derived a material benefit from it.\" That is a decision of the House of Lords; I shall not take up your lordships' time in reading the case, but the cases are all collected there. That is Ruabon Steamship Co. v. London Assurance Co.[3]. That is the statement of law laid down by the Lord Chancellor. That was a case where, during a voyage covered by a policy of marine insurance, the vessel was injured and put in dry dock; the loss had to fall upon the underwriters alone and could not be apportioned between them and the owners.\nThe learned counsel then analyzes at some length the judgment of the Exchequer Court, which is the subject of the appeal.\nShepley K.C. follows for the appellant; My lords, there are two or three observations which have fallen from the Bench during the argument of my learned friend as to which before dealing at all with the principal questions involved in the appeal, I desire to say a word or two. Perhaps the most important subject is that suggested by his lordship, Mr. Justice Duff, which, if I appreciate the point, was this: Assuming that the Indian right in these lands was a burden on the interests of the province within the meaning of the \"British North America Act,\" and assuming further, that there was residing in some sovereign power, say the Imperial or Dominion, the right to deal with that interest, is there not implied a corresponding obligation on the part of Ontario to indemnify that sovereign power in whatever shape that Indian interest may be transmitted? Have I appreciated what your lordship said?\nDuff J.\u2014May I carry it a little further, to indicate the idea in my mind at the time? Whether Ontario came under the implied obligation to assume the burden of extinguishing the title, whenever the Dominion in the exercise of its powers should think it desirable to extinguish it.\nMr. Shepley: That is putting the question in another form.\nIdington J.\u2014The way it struck my mind at the time was the possibly analogous case of a person who, having a trust to discharge and incurring some expense incidentally to the discharge of that trust, has to be indemnified.\nMr. Shepley: Out of the trust estate.\nIdington J.\u2014That is the point. Where is the trust estate here?\nMr. Shepley: That is one of the answers I was going to attempt to make. But it seems to me there are two or three considerations that ought to be dwelt on briefly in this aspect of the case. In the first place the Crown\u2014whether the Crown represented by the sovereign at home or the Crown represented by the Dominion\u2014the Crown by the very terms of the \"British North America Act,\" vested all the rights that the Crown had in these lands in Ontario. And as a Crown claim no such claim as this can possibly be maintained. It must be maintained, if at all, because the interest of the Indians, subject to which Ontario took the lands, has been transmuted in the claim to the Dominion and is recognizable as the interest of Ontario because it represents some form of the Indian interest. The first answer to that seems to me that by the decision of the Privy Council in the St. Catharines Milling Case[4] there never was any transmutation or transfer of that interest to the Crown or anybody else. There was the bare extinguishment of it and nothing more. Perhaps your lordships will let me dwell a little upon a passage in the judgment in the Privy Council at the top of page 60. Lord Watson said: \"By the treaty of 1873 the Indian inhabitants ceded and released the territory in dispute, in order that it might be opened up for settlement, immigration and such other purpose as to Her Majesty might seem fit, to the Government of the Dominion of Canada,' for the Queen and her successors for ever. 'It was argued that a cession in these terms was in effect a conveyance to the Dominion Government of the whole rights of the Indians, with consent of the Crown.\" What is that but a statement that the argument was that the Indian right had been transmuted into something else in the hands of the Crown? \"That is not the natural import of the language of the treaty, which purports to be from beginning to end a transaction between the Indians and the Crown; and the surrender is in substance made to the Crown. Even if its language had been more favourable to the argument of the Dominion upon this point, it is abundantly clear that the Commissioners who represented Her Majesty, whilst they had full authority to accept a surrender to the Crown, had neither authority nor power to take away from Ontario the interest which had been assigned to that province by the Imperial statute of 1867.\" It occurred to us that that afforded a complete answer to your lordship's question; that it was not possible in the negotiation of this treaty for the Crown to set up anything arising out of these negotiations, or out of this treaty, by way of claim against the Province of Ontario. Then there is another consideration which I think your lordships have not clearly appreciated. It seems to us that the Dominion had put it out of its power to raise any such question as this by an issue which has been made and which is upon this record. In presenting the documents, my learned friend Mr. Hogg put in an agreement between the two Governments made on the 16th of April, 1894. It recites the treaty and it recites that by the treaty certain reserves were to be selected and laid aside for the benefit of the Indians; the Indians were, amongst other things, to have the right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered, subject to such regulation as might be made by the Government and saving such tracts as might be taken up for settlement and so on. Then it recites that the two boundaries of Ontario have since been ascertained and declared to include part of the territory surrendered by the treaty and other territory north of the height of land with respect to which the Indians are understood to make a claim as being occupants thereof according to their mode of occupying and as not having yet surrendered their claim thereto or their interest therein. \"And whereas before the true boundaries had been declared as aforesaid, the Government of Canada had selected and set aside certain reserves for the Indians in intended pursuance of the said treaty and the said Government of Ontario was no party to the selection and has not yet concurred therein.\" Then it is stated that it is deemed desirable for the two Governments to come to a friendly understanding and it is therefore agreed between the two Governments as follows, \"with respect to the tracts to be from time to time taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes, and to the regulations required in that behalf, as in the said treaty mentioned, it is hereby conceded and declared that, as the Crown lands in the surrendered tract have been decided to belong to the Province of Ontario or to Her Majesty in right of the said province, the rights of hunting and fishing by the Indians\nthroughout the tract surrendered, not including the reserves to be made thereunder, do not continue with reference to any tracts which have been made, or from time to time may be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes by the Government of Ontario or persons duly authorized by the said Government of Ontario; and that the concurrence of the Province of Ontario is required in the selection of the said reserves.\" There is a declaration that in order to effectively deal with the question of reserves and therefore to effectively deal with any interest Ontario has in these lands or had in these lands, the consent of Ontario was necessary. That brings me to the second answer to your lordship's question, and that is, it is perhaps for this purpose necessary to admit\u2014perhaps not at all undesirable to admit\u2014that the Dominion had the sole treaty making power, that that power did not reside with Ontario; but inasmuch as the making of such a treaty involved the dealing with the property of Ontario, the consent and concurrence of Ontario would be necessary in the making of any such treaty.\nThe learned counsel then deals with the questions of the conventional boundary, the surrender of Rupert's Land by the Hudson Bay Co. and the acquirement of the whole territory instead of enough only for the right of way of the Canadian Pacific Railway because the land was of so little value. He then criticizes the judgment of the Exchequer Court reading from pages 482-5 of the report in 10 Ex. C.R. and proceeds. Here your lordships are called upon to administer the lex loci, because it is a contract with regard to lands in the Province of Ontario, and it is a law of Ontario that the Court of Exchequer and your lordships must administer in disposing of these questions. Then after referring to the statutes which the Dominion and the Province of Ontario passed and which enabled this controversy to be brought into the Court of Exchequer, his lordship says: \"I agree with Mr. Shepley that the mere fact that there is a controversy does not give the court authority to decide against the province simply because it should think that as a matter of good conscience and honourable dealing the province, having derived the benefit from the treaty, should relieve the Dominion from a proportionate part of the burden arising therefrom; that it is not simply a question of what the court might think to be fair in the premises without regard to the principles of law applicable to the case.\"\nSo his lordship disclaimed any intention or right to adjudicate upon the grounds of conscience merely.\n\"At the same time,\" he said, \"as Mr. Newcombe pointed out the question arises between governments, each of which within its own sphere exercises the authority of one and the same Crown. For that reason one cannot expect the analogies of the law as applied between subject and subject to be perfect or in every way adequate to the just determination of the case.\" I do not know just what his lordship means by that, but I think it answers itself in the subsequent part of the case because he comes to the conclusion that for the purposes of this controversy the Dominion and the province are upon the same footing as two subjects. Then after that he deals with the question of what was the result of the treaty. At pages 489-90 he says: \"There is no question as to its validity. In the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[5], Lord Watson stated that they had full authority to accept a surrender to the Crown; but that they had no authority or power to take away from Ontario the interest which had been assigned to that province by the Imperial Statute of 1867. There can, I think, be no doubt of that authority to bind the Crown to make the payments stipulated for in the treaty. The case cited shews that the lands thereby surrendered were, or might fall, within the true construction of the words of section 91 (24) of the Act of 1867, 'lands reserved for the Indians,' p. 59.\" With that I venture respectfully to find fault. I think the whole course of that decision is absolutely contrary to any such idea as that. With the exception of the strong dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Strong, in this court, I think every court that pronounced upon it declared that these lands were not, in any sense, lands reserved for Indians, in any sense in which those words were used in the statute. And I think the Privy Council agreed with that.\n\"The difficulty is that in one aspect of the matter they were, although it was not known at the time, dealing with the public lands belonging to the Province of Ontario, and removing a burden therefrom. It is argued for the Dominion that Ontario must be taken to have acquiesced in what the Dominion authorities did in negotiating this treaty, and that the province is bound by such acquiescence. I am not able to accede to that contention or to rest my judgment on that ground.\" So that that is excluded. He says: \"The most that can be said on that branch of the case is, it seems to me, that while on the one hand the Government of Canada holding, in good faith, but erroneously as it turned out, the view that all the lands to be surrendered belonged to the Dominion, did not consult the Government of Ontario in respect of the negotiations with the Indians for the surrender of their title in such lands; on the other hand the Government of the province did not raise any objection to the matter so proceeding and did not prefer any request to be represented in the negotiation of the treaty.\"\nI do not think it was shewn\u2014I speak subject to correction, because there is a great deal of correspondence here\u2014but I do not think it can be suggested on this correspondence that Ontario was made aware that negotiations were going on. I daresay individuals, perhaps those concerned in advising the Lieutenant-Governor, read in the press from time to time things that were going on, but that there was any official communication of any kind between the two Governments does not, I venture to think, appear anywhere.\nThen comes the question which really lies at the root of this controversy. \"Now, with regard to the contention that inasmuch as a part of the benefit arising from the surrender of the lands mentioned in the treaty accrues to Ontario that province should relieve the Dominion from a proportionate part of the obligations thereby created, it appears to me that that consideration is not, of itself, sufficient to make the province liable.\" He accedes to the argument of Ontario on that point, that you cannot create a liability merely because a burden has been removed or a benefit conferred. He says: \"If the province had had any option in the matter, if it had been open to it to accept or decline such benefit, and it had accepted it, then the province would have been liable for its bare proportion. But that is not the case. The burden of the Indian title was removed from these lands before it was determined whether any part of them was within the province or not. When it was decided that a large proportion of such lands was within the Province of Ontario, there was nothing the province could do but accept the lands and administer them free from such burden.\"\nThen he refers to the Ruabon Case[6] and he says the principle which that case lays down, \"is, I think, as clearly applicable to the transaction of the Dominion and Provincial Governments as it is to those which occur between individuals.\"\nSo far your lordships will see that everything he has said is in favour of the contentions which we are making. Then he says: \"If the Parliament of Canada should appropriate and the Government of Canada should extend public moneys of the Dominion for Dominion purposes, with the result that a province was benefited, and there was no agreement with the province or request from it, then it would be clear that the province was under no obligation to contribute to such expenditure or to indemnify the Dominion against any part thereof.\" That is at page 491. That is as strong a statement as anything that can possibly fall from us in the course of this argument. \"Equally it seems clear that if the Parliament of Canada should appropriate and the Government of Canada should expend the public moneys of the Dominion for a provincial purpose for the benefit of a province, there being no agreement with the province or request from it, no obligation would arise on the part of the province to contribute towards such expenditure or to reimburse the Dominion for any part thereof.\"\nHe carries it a step farther. He is assuming here that the Dominion had, with the intention of benefiting the province and, therefore, of carrying out some provincial purpose or some provincial object, expended moneys, there would be no right to contribution or indemnity against the province without the previous acquiescence of the province. \"The principle would apply as well to expenditures made by a province, with the result that the Dominion as a whole was benefited. In all such cases the appropriation and expenditure would be voluntary and no obligation to contribute would arise.\"\nThen comes the principle upon which he has decided this case and that I venture to criticize, respectfully but strongly. He says: \"The present case appears to me to differ from those stated in some material respects. At the time when the treaty was negotiated the boundaries of the province were unsettled and uncertain.\" That is common ground, of course. \"The lands described in the treaty formed part of the territory that the Hudson's Bay Company had claimed and had surrendered to the Crown. The surrender embraced all lands belonging to the company or claimed by it. That, of course, did not affect Ontario's title to such part of the lands claimed by the company as were actually within the province. But on the admission of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory into the Union, the Government of Canada acquired the right to administer all. the lands that the company had the right to administer. And with respect to that portion of the territory which the company had claimed, but which was in fact within the Province of Ontario, the Dominion Government occupied a position analogous to that of a bon\u00e0 fide possessor or purchaser of lands of which the actual title was in another person.\"\nI have always been unable to understand why the Hudson's Bay surrender was adopted as the basis of this judgment. Every word that is said with regard to the Hudson Bay surrender is equally applicable to the Indian surrender. The Dominion did not acquire any title by either, but by either or both it thought that it got some title. I do not know why the Hudson's Bay Company surrender was the one picked out rather than the Indian surrender. Either would have answered the purpose which the Hudson's Bay Company surrender is made to do in this judgment. What he says is, it is true the Hudson's Bay could not give you any title, it is true you did not get any title but you got into the position of a bon\u00e0 fide possessor or purchaser of Ontario lands. By virtue of what? The transfer or the surrender of those lands by the Hudson's Bay Company to you. Then what follows? \"The question of the extinguishment of the Indian title in these lands could not, with prudence, be deferred until such boundaries were determined.\" It could not, of course, having regard to the national objects to be served by the treaty. It could with reference to the provincial objects. As Mr. Justice Burbidge himself has said, the lands were not then wanted for settlement or any other purpose and the surrender was not obtained because of that; the surrender was obtained because it served the national purposes to which reference has been made.\u201d It was necessary to the peace, order and good government of the country that the question should be settled at the earliest possible time. The Dominion authorities held the view that the lands belonged to the Dominion, and that they had a right to administer the same. In this they were in a large measure mistaken, but no doubt the view was held in good faith. They proceeded with the negotiations for the treaty without consulting the province. The latter, although it claimed the lands to be surrendered, or the greater part thereof, raised no objection, and did not ask to be represented in such negotiations. The case bears some analogy to one in which a person, in consequence of unskilful survey, or in the belief that the land is his own, makes improvements on lands that are not his own. In such a case the statutes of the old Province of Canada made, and those of the Province of Ontario make, provision to protect him from loss in respect of such improvements or to give him a lien therefor.\"\nIdington J.\u2014If it existed in law already, why was there a necessity for this statute?\nMr. Shepley: That seems to me an entirely pertinent question. If there ever could have been a right at law, if there ever was, why were these statutes passed? The creation of any lien or right of that kind required a statute, but you cannot find in our law, in the law of Ontario or the law of England any such right apart from the statute.\nThen, my lords, how does Mr. Justice Burbidge conclude? At page 495 after referring to what is laid down in Beaty v. Shaw[7], he says: \"It appears, therefore, that if the question in issue were to be determined by analogy to the law of Ontario applicable to individuals, the province could not maintain its counterclaim for the moneys which the Dominion collected as revenue from the disputed territory, without submitting to the enforcement of the equity existing in favour of the Dominion in respect of the charges incurred in extinguishing the burden of the Indian title; but that it is, to say the least, extremely doubtful if this equity could be enforced in an action by the Dominion against the province.\"\nLet me pause there for a moment. My learned friend has already pointed out to your lordships how utterly foreign to this controversy is the question arising on the counterclaim. By the conventional boundary agreement the Dominion and the province mutually undertook with each other in the event of the boundary award determining or the boundary dispute resulting in shewing that the territory which had been administered did not belong to the person administering, to account for all the revenues they had derived from the territory during the course of that administration. It was just as simple as that, and our counterclaim says to the Dominion, in the course of our administration under the conventional boundary agreement, of the territory which that agreement assigned to your administration and management, you derived certain revenue and you undertook under that agreement to account, that is, if we turned out to be the owners of the land and entitled to those revenues, to account to us accordingly. That is our counterclaim. What has that to do with the Indian title or any question resting upon contract? If we brought an action against the Dominion upon a promissory note, could the Dominion say, your coming into court against us on that promissory note gives us an opportunity of setting up every equitable claim and having you refused relief unless you agree to it? Now that is what this case has been decided upon. That is the point which has been taken by Mr. Justice Burbidge and upon which the case has been decided.\nThen, my lords, he goes on to deal with what is no doubt at the bottom of all this litigation. In the course of the delivering of the judgment in the St. Catharines Milling Case[8], Lord Watson used this language, and I will read the whole of two sentences here rather than confine myself to the one which is the foundation of this claim. \"Seeing that the benefit of the surrender accrues to her, Ontario must, of course, relieve the Crown, and the Dominion, of all obligations involving the payment of money which were undertaken by Her Majesty, and which are said to have been in part fulfilled by the Dominion. There may be other questions behind, with respect to the right to determine to what extent, and at what periods, the disputed territory, over which the Indians still exercised their avocations of hunting and fishing, is to be taken up for settlement or other purposes, but none of these questions are raised for decision in the present suit.\"\nIdington J.\u2014Is there any track of that having been argued?\nMr. Shepley: I will tell your lordships how that is. I was reading from page 60 of the report. In order to determine the weight to be given to that, let us see what the St. Catharines litigation was about, what the issues in it were, and what place in the adjudication of those issues this obligation had. As I told your lordships, the Dominion, notwithstanding the adverse result of the boundary dispute, claiming to have acquired the paramount title to that of Ontario by virtue of the alleged transfer of the Indian title under this treaty, issued a license to cut timber to the St. Catharines Milling Company in territory which was within that in question. The Attorney-General of Ontario brought an action in the courts of Ontario against the licensee, alleging that the licensee was trespassing upon Crown lands belonging to Ontario and obtained an injunction restraining that trespass. The Dominion was no party to that at all and the sole question for adjudication there was whether or not the St. Catharines Milling Company, the licensees, setting up as it did the license of the Dominion, justified the acts of trespass. That is, in other words, whether the licensee had acquired a right to cut that timber as against the rights that Ontario had by virtue of the license issued by the Dominion. That was the sole question. I will give your lordships a reference to the case in its various stages. Your lordships will find it first in 10 Ontario, at page 196. That is the decision of the Chancellor, a very lengthy decision and your lordships are very familiar with it no doubt. I only refer to it because I want to shew just what the Chancellor had in his mind with regard to the very question which Lord Watson afterwards expressed himself upon. At page 235 of the report he says: \"In the present case, my judgment is, that the extinction of title procured by and for the Dominion enures to the benefit of the province as constitutional proprietor by title paramount, and that it is not possible to preserve that title or transfer it in such wise as to oust the vested right of the province to this as part of the public domain of Ontario. \"Whatever equities\u2014I use this word for want of a more suitable one\u2014may exist between the two governments in regard to the consideration given and to be given to the tribes, that is a matter not agitated on this record.\"\nThat case went to the Court of Appeal and came to this court and then to the Privy Council and up to that time the Dominion had not been a party to the controversy at all. Of course it goes without saying that none of the evidence which is on the present record before your lordships was before either the Chancellor or either of the appellate courts. There was not a word of the evidence which Mr. Justice Burbidge heard or which is before your lordships to-day with regard to the circumstances under which the treaty was negotiated. The whole question was: Did the treaty confer upon the Dominion such a title as was paramount to that of Ontario, and by reason of that paramount title was the license of the alleged trespasser a license which authorized him to do what he did and which effectively answered the claim of the Province of Ontario for an injunction?\nThen what happened in the Privy Council is this and it is stated in the judgment. I will take the statement from the judgment. At pages 52 and 53 Lord Watson says: \"Although the present case relates exclusively to the right of the Government of Canada to dispose of the timber in question to the appellant company, yet its decision necessarily involves the determination of the larger question between that government and the Province of Ontario with respect to the legal consequences of the treaty of 1873. In these circumstances, Her Majesty, by the same order which gave the appellants leave to bring the judgment of the court below under the review of this Board, was pleased to direct that the Government of the Dominion of Canada should be at liberty to intervene in this appeal, or to argue the same upon, a special case, raising the legal question in dispute. The Dominion Government elected to take the first of these courses and their lordships have had the advantage of hearing from their counsel an able and exhaustive argument in support of their claim to that part of the ceded territory which lies within the provincial boundaries of Ontario.\" They appeared upon that intervention; they intervened in the St. Catharines Milling Company Case[9] on that appeal and they argued that the St. Catharines Milling Company ought to succeed in that appeal; that is, that the St. Catharines Milling Company's license gave a valid right to cut the timber as against any right on the part of Ontario. The whole question was argued there and that is the whole question raised upon that record, and in the result the order that was made simply dismissed the licensees' appeal and no more. It made no declaration between the Dominion and the province. Your lordships have upon this record the formal judgment before you. All that the formal order of the Privy Council did was to dismiss the licenseholder's appeal. The whole thing done was to dismiss the appeal.\nDuff J.-\u2014Is there anything to shew, Mr. Shepley, that this statement of Lord Watson's was the result of any concession or confession made on behalf of the province?\nMr. Shepley: We thought we had here a copy of the shorthand notes of the argument; unfortunately we have not, but it can be found and given to your lordships, or a reference to the sessional papers in which it will be found. I can tell your lordships from recollection\u2014because of course we studied that matter very carefully\u2014from time to time spasmodic attempts during the argument were made to introduce that discussion and, in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[10], invariably the court said, \"We have nothing to do with that, that does not arise in this appeal; it has not to do with any question as to whether or not Ontario ought to bear any portion of the burden.\" That was during the argument. Then to say, my lords, in these circumstances, that the Privy Council has gone out of its way, without any evidence before it whatever and in a case where the question was not raised, to determine our rights, rights between the Dominion and the province, was going much farther than it was possible to go. No doubt that dictum is the foundation of this litigation and your lordships will find, I think, that the right of the Dominion in this statement of claim is in the words of the dictum. We say it cannot be binding between the parties in this controversy; that was not a controversy between the Dominion and the province and there was no estoppel.\nDavies J.\u2014What was the controversy? There must have been some or they would not have been allowed to intervene.\nMr. Shepley: Whether or not the right of Ontario against the licenseholder should be sustained. There was nothing before the Privy Council to indicate the circumstances under which the Dominion Government had extinguished the title, whether it had done that for the benefit of Ontario or for reasons such as are shewn to your lordships to-day. They could not have known whether Ontario acquiesced or was consulted or not.\nMy learned friends have found a good deal of comfort in the civil law, the law of negotiorum gestor, but that is not our law. Apart from that, there was no mandate, no commission from Ontario to the Dominion to go and extinguish this title on behalf of Ontario and no ratification.\nDuff J.\u2014Except such mandate as the \"British North America Act\" would give the Dominion. Though that is going back to the same thing. Mr. Shepley: Yes, my lord, perhaps that is coming back to the same point again. I have tried to shew how any mandate from the \"British North America Act\" can only be construed as a mandate to deal with the lands of Ontario with the concurrence of Ontario. You cannot go adversely to Ontario and deal with Ontario's rights. What Mr. Justice Burbidge says with regard to that statement, at page 496, is\u2014and I find it very difficult to understand exactly what he means by it\u2014\"So far as the questions in this case relate to the extent to which the province is liable to contribute to the expenses incurred by the Crown in fulfilment of the obligations created by the treaty this case, no doubt, differs materially from the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company's Case\"[11]. That is what we say. We say the two cases raise entirely different issues. Then he goes on to say:-\"But with respect to the principal question at issue, namely, whether the province is liable to contribute anything, this case presents, I think, no new fact or aspect,\" I confess I am utterly unable to understand that. First he says that to the extent to which the province is liable to contribute there is a new case, but with respect to the question of whether it is liable to contribute anything there is no new factor. I should have thought that neither of these issues was before the Privy Council. Then he says: \"The province's main defence here is that it was not a party to the treaty.\" That is not our main defence. Your lordships have heard elaborated, at perhaps too great length, what we think our defences are, but your lordships have not, I am sure, got the idea that our main defence is that we were not a party to the treaty. That is one of our comments upon the situation, of course.\nThen he says: \"By the order which gave the appellants leave to bring the judgment of that court under review, Her Majesty was pleased to direct that the Government of the Dominion should be at liberty to intervene in the appeal or to argue the same upon a special case, raising the legal question in dispute. The Dominion Government elected to take the first of these courses, with the result that between the Dominion and the province there was no formal judgment on the questions at issue between them.\" Well, the question at issue between them was the question at issue between the province and the license-holder. There was no other question. You could not extend the record by mere intervention on the license-holder's appeal. The record could not be expanded by the intervention of the Dominion. Then he says further: \"In the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company's Case[12] the Province of Ontario stood in the position of a plaintiff; and as between the province and the Dominion the views of their lordships as to the province's liability to indemnify the Dominion may, I think, with fairness, be taken as a part or condition of the judgment of the province, although such views found no place in the formal judgment pronounced.\" That again I am unable to understand. The judgment was a judgment dismissing the license-holder's appeal. I do not know whether Mr. Justice Burbidge means that they would have allowed the appeal if they had not imposed this condition upon Ontario. There is no indication of any such view in anything that I have been able to find in the record.\nOne other question I propose to trouble your lordships with and that is the question which has already been quite fully covered, perhaps, by my learned friend Mr. Ritchie, namely, whether or not upon the hypothesis of this judgment it was essential that the relative part played by the various considerations moving the Dominion to this treaty should have been played. In other words, in 1873, that all the elements entering into the negotiation of the treaty, which Mr. Justice Burbidge speaks of, the obligation imposed by the \"British North America Act,\" the obligation imposed by the Hudson Bay Company's surrender, the obligation imposed by the terms made with British Columbia when British Columbia came into the Union and the surrender of the title to this barren piece of territory as it was supposed to be., that these considerations upon the theory of this judgment entered into the treaty. Then why is the Dominion to recover against Ontario any more than a measured proportion having regard to the respective values of these different considerations? Mr. Justice Burbidge acceded to that in the principal judgment; he said it was difficult of ascertainment, but further evidence might be given. Further evidence was given, but not upon that point. The thing is incapable of measurement, that is why. The Dominion made no attempt to produce any evidence upon that subject. We venture to think that it is inherently incapable of measurement; that you cannot say at this time\u2014that indeed at any time you could not have said\u2014this great project the trans-continental road, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, this great territory, Rupert's Land, that we want to open up and want a road to, the pacification of the Indians, the acquisition of the title to the few barren rocks that they have got here, you cannot put those together, you never could have put them together and said, so much for this and so much for that and so much for the other. The thing is unthinkable, that you can sit down and make a sum in arithmetic of propositions such as these. If that is so, how can the Dominion hope to recover anything here?\nDavies J.\u2014Does the extinguishment of the Indian title depend at all upon the value of the land? I suppose there would be some evidence of general dealing.\nMr. Shepley: That is a point that I had almost overlooked. It is said by Mr. Justice Burbidge that we know pretty generally what other treaties have cost; but we do not know what was the value of the lands those treaties covered, nor do we know the value of the lands covered by this treaty. You cannot compare the price paid for a farm in a county away north with the value of a farm situated along the River St. Lawr ence. You must have some evidence. Supposing the fact to be\u2014I do not say it is at all, but it is fair to test the question that way\u2014that the whole of the 30,000 square miles of land which Ontario got the Indian title extinguished in, supposing the whole value of that was nothing whatever, that it was all rocks like the north shore of Lake Superior without of any valuable mineral, this judgment must have proceeded upon precisely the same principle and Ontario would have had to pay for land which she never would have opened up for settlement; she would have had to pay because the Dominion extinguished this title not for the purpose of getting the land at all, but for the purpose of the construction of these great national works.\nNewcombe K.C. opens for the respondent. After referring to the material parts of the treaty and to the conventional boundary agreement the learned counsel combats the argument that the land surrendered was of no value, contending that the grounds on which it was based were not sufficient and then proceeds as follows.\nBefore going further with the question in difference here, let us consider what was the state of the title at Confederation and what sort of an asset did the Indians have in this territory. That has been pretty clearly defined by the numerous cases which have been before the courts and before the Judicial Committee, I think. The judgment of Chief Justice Strong in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[13], which was a dissenting judgment, is nevertheless a very instructive judgment with regard to the nature of the Indian title and it is the judgment, of all the judgments which were pronounced in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case which came nearest to accord with that of the Judicial Committee. I mean to say, he took the view that the title was in the Dominion but, so far as considerations of Indian title, the quality of the Indian title, the nature of the Indian reserves and considerations of that sort are concerned, which are more or less material here, the view of the learned Chief Justice coincided entirely with that later expressed by Lord Watson in appeal.\nNow it seems to have been supposed in the Ontario courts that the Indian title was nothing except such as might be recognized as a matter of grace; that they had no legal right; that they might be recognized or not, as the authorities determined. But that is not the case, as shewn by Chief Justice Strong. His judgment is a long one and I do not propose to refer to it at length.\nNow, in the judgment in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[14], at pages 58 to 60, it is said: \"The Crown has all along had a present proprietary estate in the land, upon which the Indian title was a mere burden. The ceded territory was at the time of the Union land vested in the Crown, subject to an interest other than that of the province in the same within the meaning of section 109, and must now belong to Ontario in terms of that clause unless its rights have been taken away by some provision of the Act of 1867 other than those already noticed.\" That is to say at Confederation this territory, in so far as it ultimately turned out to be within the boundaries of Ontario, was by force of the \"Confederation Act\" vested in Ontario subject to an interest other than that of Ontario therein. That is the Indian interest. Now that is further explained in Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Ontario[15], known as the Robinson Treaties Case, and there Lord Watson said, at pages 210 to 211, that the expression in section 109, \"an interest other than that of the province in the same appeared to their lordships to denote some kind of right or interest in a third party independent of and capable of being vindicated in competition with the beneficial interest of the province.\" Therefore, previous to this surrender, from the time of Confederation down to the time of the surrender the Indians had an interest in the land other than that of the province and an interest capable of being vindicated in competition with the beneficial interest of the province. So that, my lords, they had a title, as I submit, of occupation and possession; a title which made it legally impossible for the province to administer the lands, to make grants and administer the lands in the way in which they have administered them since the surrender was made.\nYour lordships will see, too, by the proclamation of 1763, which is the evidence of the Indian title here, that the Government was prohibited from dealing with these lands, from making grants, or doing anything with them pending the cession of the Indian title. The proclamation declares that \"no governor or commander-in-chief of any of the new colonies of Quebec, East Florida or West Florida do presume on any pretence to grant warrants of survey or pass any patents for lands beyond the boundaries of their respective governments, or until our further pleasure is known, upon lands which, not having been ceded or purchased as aforesaid are reserved to the Indians or any of them. It is further declared to be our royal will to reserve under our sovereignty and protection all the lands not included within the limits of our said three governments or within the limits of the lands granted to the Hudson Bay Company.\" Therefore I submit that the Indians had title inconsistent with the right of Ontario to do any of the things with this land which she immediately proceeded to do after this treaty was made.\nCounsel then quotes at length from the speech of the Lieutenant-Governor on opening the legislature of Ontario, in January, 1874, in which he speaks of the boundary question and refers to these lands as \"the important territory in dispute,\" and to a report from Mr. Laird to the governor in council dated June 2nd, 1874, quoting from it as follows:\n\"That as the Indian title of a considerable part of the territory in dispute had not then been extinguished, it was thought desirable to postpone the negotiations for a conventional arrangement, under which the territory might be opened for sale or settlement, until a treaty was concluded with the Indians.\"\nThat is very strong evidence, my lords, as to what was taking place. The project was the settlement and administration of this territory. There was the mineral wealth, the timber and the settlers going in and contention and strife to be avoided, and there was the question of the boundary to be settled. Negotiations had been begun and then, according to this report, by mutual consent between Ontario and the Dominion it had been conceded as expedient that those negotiations should be postponed pending the surrender of the Indian title, which, of course, the Dominion undertook to bring about as speedily as possible.\nThen he says: \"That barrier being now removed, the undersigned has the honour to recommend that as some considerable time must yet elapse before the boundaries of Ontario can be finally adjusted, it is desirable in the meantime to agree upon conventional boundaries, otherwise the development of that import- ant portion of Canada lying between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods will be seriously retarded, as applications to take up lands in that section are being constantly made, and the inability to obtain recognition of claims from either the Government at Ottawa or Toronto is impeding the settlement of the country.\" Then there is a recommendation of the appointment of Commissioners and this report is communicated to Ontario under order in council printed on the following page and then there is a memorandum of supplementary agreement, the conventional agree- ment, where it is mentioned that Ontario acted on the suggestion of the Privy Council by appointing a Commissioner. They acted on the suggestion set out in this report of Mr. Laird. There is no question by Ontario that that does not represent the state of the facts as they existed.\nThere can be no doubt, it seems to me, that this project was mainly in aid of the settlement of the country. What sort of a position would it have been in? My learned friend says: \"Oh, they wanted to build a railway through there; they wanted to build a railway and they might just as well take a release of the whole thing.\" Suppose they had stipulated with the Indians, as they might have stipulated with them, to get the surrender of the right of way of the Canadian Pacific Railway and gone through there with that and left the whole thing. How much less, I would like to know, would Ontario have had to pay if she waited and got a surrender from the Indians afterwards, after the settlers began to come in and the railway to go through there?\nThen, after referring to a letter from the Under Secretary of State to the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, dated July 15th, 1874, respecting the selection of Indian reserves under the treaty and asking for a schedule or plan of the mineral lands in the territory surrendered and the reply thereto on July 31st enclosing such plan he proceeds:\nNow we pass from that to the statutory agreement, to the Dominion statute of which the agreement is a schedule. The statute I do not think is set out in the case, but the agreement is. The Dominion statute simply contained one section, that it shall be lawful for the Governor in Council, if he shall see fit, to enter into an agreement with the Government of Ontario, according to the schedule to this Act, and such agreement when entered into and every matter and thing therein shall be as binding on the Dominion of Canada as if set forth by statute. The Ontario Act I have not got, but presumably it is to the same affect.\nNow this agreement is with respect to what we call the special reserves. Your lordships are aware that under the treaty by the first provision, the first covenant on behalf of the Crown, the Crown was to lay aside reserves for farming lands, due respect being had to lands at present cultivated by the Indians. \"Also to lay aside and reserve for the benefit of the said Indians, to be administered and dealt with for them by Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada, in such a manner as shall seem best, other reserves of land in the said territory hereby ceded, which said reserves shall be selected and set aside where it shall be deemed most convenient and advantageous for each band of Indians.\" Then the Dominion proceeded to lay aside these reserves. You see the effect of the treaty or surrender as ultimately held by the Judicial Committee, was to vest the whole title in Ontario. The Indians did not reserve or except their special reserves; they surrendered their original Indian title, the title which existed under the proclamation; they surrendered the whole thing to the Crown and it enured to the benefit of Ontario. Therefore Ontario held the whole freed from their interests. The Indians reserved nothing, but they took a covenant from the Crown that the Dominion would give them special reserves. The Dominion did so without any special acquiescence by Ontario. I have shewn your lordships that there was some reference to the subject because they did not want to give them the mineral lands, but without Ontario becoming bound the Dominion laid aside these reserves, and then questions arose, Ontario claiming that we had set them aside out of their Crown lands in which the Indians had no interest, we had taken their Crown lands and made reserves of them. They said we had no right to do that. That was ultimately conceded, but the Indians had been put on these reserves and were occupying them in fact, and the situation had been dealt with and it was dealt with by this agreement. Now this agreement recites the treaty. \"Whereas by articles of a treaty made on the 3rd of October, 1873, between Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, by Her Commissioners, the Honourable Alexander Morris, Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba and the North-West Territories,\" and soon, \"the Ojibeway Indians, inhabitants of the country within the limits thereinafter defined and described by their chiefs chosen and named as thereinafter mentioned, of the other part, which said treaty is usually known as the North-West Angle Treaty No. 3, the Salteaux tribe of the Ojibeway Indians and all other Indians inhabiting the country therein defined and described surrendered to Her Majesty all their rights, titles and privileges whatsoever to the lands therein defined and described on certain terms and considerations therein mentioned.'' Now that was the recital they made of it in 1894, and it is a correct recital. It states the effect of the treaty precisely, in a solemn agreement ratified by the statutes of both Governments; and it says what is apparent on the face of the instrument, that they did surrender these to Her Majesty on certain terms and considerations therein mentioned. That is, they gave up their title to the Crown and the Crown in consideration of that gave them certain covenants, and I am going to refer to that again. One of those covenants is as much a consideration for this transfer as another. There is no method of separating them. Then it goes on with further recitals and the last one is: \"Whereas it is deemed desirable for the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario to come to a friendly and just understanding in respect of the said matters, and the Governor-General of Canada in Council and the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario in Council have given authority for the execution on their behalf respectively, pursuant to the said statutes of an agreement in terms of these presents.\" It is therefore agreed as follows: \"With respect to the tracts to be from time to time taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering, or other purposes, and to the regulations required in that behalf, as in the said treaty mentioned, it is hereby conceded and declared that, as the Crown lands in the surrendered tract have been decided to belong to the Province of Ontario or to Her Majesty in right of the said province, the rights of hunting and fishing by the Indians throughout the tract surrendered, not including the reserves to be made thereunder do not continue with reference to any tracts which have been, or from time to time may be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes by the Government of Ontario or persons duly authorized by the said Government of Ontario; and that the concurrence of the Province of Ontario is required in the selection of the said reserves.\"\nThere Ontario is saying that inasmuch as this treaty has been made, these lands have become provincial Crown lands and the Indian rights have been extinguished.\nNow, by lords, there is the other agreement made with regard to these reserves. That is the agreement between Mr. Blake and myself made in London. \"Agreement between counsel on behalf of the Dominion and Ontario, intervening parties upon the appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Ontario Mining Co. v. Seybold et al.[16].\n\"As to all treaty Indian reserves in Ontario (including those in the territory covered by the North-West Angle Treaty) which are or shall be duly established pursuant to the statutory agreement of 1894, and which have been or shall be duly surrendered by the Indians, to sell or lease for their benefit, Ontario agrees to confirm the titles heretofore made by the Dominion and that the Dominion shall have full power and authority to sell or lease and convey title in fee simple or for any less estate.\n\"The Dominion agrees to hold the proceeds of such lands when or so far as they have been converted into money upon the extinction of the Indian interest therein subject to such rights of Ontario thereto as may exist by law.\n\"As to the reserves in the territory covered by the North-West Angle Treaty which may be duly established as aforesaid, Ontario agrees that the precious metals shall be considered to form part of the reserves, and may be disposed of by the Dominion for the benefit of the Indians to the same extent and subject to the same undertaking as to the proceeds as heretofore agreed with regard to the lands in such reserves.\n\"The question as to whether other reserves in Ontario include the precious metals to depend upon the instruments and circumstances and law affecting each case respectively.\n\"Nothing is hereby conceded by either party with regard to the constitutional or legal rights of the Dominion or Ontario, as to the sale or title to Indian reserves or precious metals, or as to any of the contentions submitted by the cases of either Government herein, but it is intended that as a matter of policy and convenience the reserves may be administered as hereinbefore agreed.\"\nThis agreement was made and acted upon and it settled the differences existing between Ontario and the Dominion in that case, so that while it was argued by the parties it was not argued by the Dominion.\nDuff J.\u2014I see that presents a point that did not occur to me before. You put it, but I did not appreciate it. The making of these reserves under the treaty involved giving the Indians an interest in the land which even after the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[17] might have been contended at all events to be a greater interest than they had before the treaty, than the original interest.\nMr. Newcombe: Yes, my lord.\nDuff J.\u2014And that would necessarily involve Ontario?\nMr. Newcombe: Yes. I may be in conflict with some decisions, but not in conflict with any decision of the Judicial Committee\u2014doubtless in conflict with the Chancellor of Ontario, at all events\u2014but I submit that with regard to those special reserves which are set aside for the Indians uniformly upon the surrender of their original title in the large areas over which they claimed it, in those special reserves which are set aside, the Indians acquire a larger interest, a different interest from the interest which can be conveyed by surrender to the Crown for sale.\nDuff J.\u2014That is a disputed point.\nMr. Newcombe: I admit it is a disputed point, but the reasons in favour of that proposition appeal very clear to me. What happened in the Seybold Case was this: One of these special reserves, \"38B\" which had been laid off for the Indians by the Dominion without any reference to Ontario and out of the Ontario Crown lands, was found to contain mineral and it was deemed desirable that it should be sold and converted into money so that the Indians might have greater enjoyment of their property. It was surrendered under the terms of the \"Indian Act\" to the Dominion and sold to this mining company who thereupon took up the mining, and Ontario made a grant, I think, of the same property. The question arose as to whether the Ontario patent was to prevail or whether the Dominion patent was to prevail. It was held or assumed that this was a good reserve. It was assumed by the courts below, at all events by the Chancellor, and I think by this court too; it was not decided that it was a good reserve, but it was disposed of on the assumption that it was a good reserve. And it was said that when the Indians surrendered that to the Dominion for sale that a patent could only be made by Ontario and therefore the Dominion patent was no good, and the Ontario patent was good. Of course that was a serious question and upon that and upon the denial of Ontario that the Indians were to have the metal in these properties the Dominion intervened and proposed to argue that question in the Judicial Committee, but the settlement was made and the Committee decided what, of course, was the turning point of the case, that there was no reserve there, that Ontario had to acquiesce in the reserve, that the reserve never was laid off, and the point upon which the Chancellor had decided the case had never arisen.\nNow, in dealing with this case and what I have to say in the following part of my argument, it must not be forgotten that it is not like an ordinary case between individuals. There is only one Crown and really only one party to the case; while we speak of Ontario and Quebec and the Dominion and so on, they are not separate and independent governments like the governments of the United States.\nEach represents the same Crown in respect of separate departments of the same government. As illustrating that to some extent I want to refer to a case, Williams v. Howarth[18]. That was a case where the Government of New South Wales, I think it was, sent a force of soldiers to the war in South Africa, and they had contracted with these soldiers to pay them certain rates per day during the period of their enlistment. When these men reached South Africa they fell under Imperial command and Imperial regulations and they got certain allowances, certain pay from the Imperial Government for their services there. I do not remember what the amounts were, but we will suppose that the Government of New South Wales was to pay them ten shillings a day and they got four shillings from the Imperial Government. They went back, having served out the enlistment and one of these men brought his action claiming his ten shillings a day. They said, you have received four shillings a day from the Imperial Government and we only owe you six, and that was the question before the court. The courts in the colony held that there were two separate transactions altogether, that the Government of New South Wales had contracted with this man to pay him so much. But when it went to the Judicial Committee, the Committee held that this was all a transaction on behalf of the Crown, that there was one Crown, not a Crown for New South Wales and another for the Empire and that the man was entitled to what he had contracted for with the Crown, and he had got so much and he was entitled to the balance. The decision, doubtless, would have been different if it had been the case of an allied power, if it had been some foreign government. But here was a matter of the same Crown.\nThat illustrates the point that I make as to the indivisibility of the Crown. In these circumstances the Dominion claims that Ontario, who received the benefit of the treaty, shall assume and discharge the burdens of the treaty and this seems to be, I submit, a proposition founded in common honesty and justice. But we do not have to rely on that solely because the right has been affirmed both in the Judicial Committee and in this court. I remember in arguing this case below I quoted an observation from a very eminent judge that seems to me to apply to this case better than it does to most cases, perhaps. He said that the business of a judge was to find a legal reason consistent with the conclusions of common sense. If your lordships approach this case with the idea of finding a legal reason which will give effect to the common sense idea, to the view which would ordinarily be taken by the man in the street, I do not think there would be any difficulty about the result to which your lordships would come; because there was this very valuable territory with an encumbrance upon it which stands in the way of Ontario's enjoyment, removed at the expense of the Dominion by the payment of a comparatively very reasonable amount, Ontario entering in and taking the benefit and denying the obligation to make compensation.\nNow let me refer to the words of Lord Watson in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[19] . \"Seeing that the benefit of the surrender accrues to her, Ontario must, of course, relieve the Crown and the Dominion of all obligations involving the payment of money which were undertaken by Her Majesty, and which are said to have been in part fulfilled by the Dominion Government.\"\nGirouard J.\u2014Is that a dictum?\nMr. Newcombe: No, my lord, we say not.\nIdington J.\u2014How do you shew that it is not?\nMr. Newcombe: Will your lordship allow me to refer to the judgment of this court upon that point in the Robinson Treaty Case[20]. That was the case of a treaty made in 1850, a case of a treaty very much the same as this, made between the Indians and the old Province of Canada, whereby the Indians surrendered a territory situate wholly in the Province of Ontario and there were annuities and continuing benefits to the Indians under that treaty which had to be discharged after Confederation. The Dominion became pledged to do that by reason of the \"British North America Act.\" This was an obligation of the old Province of Canada which was cast upon the Dominion, but inasmuch as these payments constituted part of the excess debt over the amount limited by the \"British North America Act,\" there was an express statutory obligation by Ontario and Quebec jointly to indemnify the Dominion. Now in this case the Dominion based its claim upon the St. Catharines Milling Co, Case[21], that is this very judgment of Lord Watson wherein he said, \"seeing that Ontario receives the benefit she must bear the burden.\" The Dominion said that seeing Ontario got the benefit of the Robinson Treaty made in 1850, because the whole property fell to her afterwards at the division, at Confederation, she got the territory discharged from the Indian claim, and seeing that that property fell to Ontario she must bear the burden and, therefore, the Dominion was entitled to indemnity solely from Ontario and the claim was made against Ontario. The arbitrators held that Ontario was responsible. That was reversed in this court and the Privy Council upheld this court. Because of no reason other than the \"British North America Act\" had come in in the meantime and converted this into a statutory obligation, it had put this obligation upon the new government of the Dominion and it provided that Ontario and Quebec, conjointly, should indemnify; therefore the proceeding had to be taken against Ontario and Quebec who, of course, had to indemnify conjointly, although Quebec, as far as that individual transaction was concerned, had no benefit whatever from the surrender. That was the action and it was argued in this court upon the authority of the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[22]. In the judgment of the court Chief Justice, Sir Henry Strong, says: \"An argument against the Province of Ontario is attempted to be deduced from the decision of the Privy Council in the case of the St. Catharines Milling Company v. The Queen22. In that case there was an Indian surrender to the Crown, represented by the Dominion Government, made in 1873, subsequent to Confederation. The Privy Council held that this surrender enured to the benefit of the Province of Ontario, and so holding it also decided that Ontario was bound to pay the consideration for which the Indians ceded their rights in the lands. I see no analogy between that case and the present. In the case before us no one doubts that the Province of Canada, which acquired the lands, was originally bound to pay the consideration. In the case before the Privy Council the question was, as it were, between two departments of the government of the Crown and the most obvious principles of justice required that the government which got the lands should pay for them. Here the lands were originally acquired by the Province of Canada, which was to pay for them, and the present question only arises on a severance of that government into two separate provinces and a consequential partition of its assets and liabilities.\" In the case before the Privy Council the words are, \"as between two departments of the government of the Crown\" and \"the most obvious principles of justice require.\" Now, my lords, there is no place here for the authorities which my learned friend quotes, that you cannot recover a payment made on behalf of a man unless it is made by his request. That is a general principle of the common law. The principle of the civil law is the other way. You can recover if a man gets a benefit. As between individuals you may say there are certainly exceptions in the common law to which I am going to refer. But you may say the general rule is to that effect and the general rule of the civil law is the other way. But here you have got a question between two departments of the same government and it is a question to be worked out according to the justice of the case.\nIs this case going to be decided differently from what it would have been if the area had been in Quebec? Take the case of a restrictive building covenant and the division of the property afterwards, the one man getting a release. There is, perhaps, not so much difference, except in measuring the value of it. This question I submit is really one under the \"British North America Act.\"\nWhat we are doing here is to determine a controversy. Section 140 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" founds the jurisdiction of this court. A statute passed by each giving the jurisdiction.\nIdington J.\u2014On what ground are we to proceed under that Act?\nMr. Newcombe: You are to proceed, my lord, to give effect to the principle that has been laid down heretofore by the Committee and by this court; to have regard to the \"British North America Act\" and the constitutional situation and the fact that there are two departments of the same government, with a controversy and you are to try to determine that controversy according to justice.\nThat being so the release or surrender having been brought about by the act of the Indians, concurred in and authorized by the Dominion, as it must have been, and upon considerations involving the payment of money which the Dominion undertook to execute, the lands were relieved of the Indian title for the benefit of the province, as the Judicial Committee has determined.\nThe liability of the province may rest upon either one or other of two views and I will put them both to your lordships. That is, it may rest upon some other views, some of the views which have been discussed, or it may rest upon the view which the learned judge has taken, although I am not going to argue that; I leave that with your lordships as to how far it may commend itself to your lordships' judgment. But this treaty I submit, may have operated to vest the title in Ontario and impose an obligation upon Ontario by virtue of the constitutional agency of the Dominion, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case.\nEither that or, the Dominion not being an agent in any sense, it made a contract which could only operate for the benefit of the province. And this contract being only capable of operation for the benefit of the province became operative when the province came in and took the benefit of it, and, therefore, as a direct party became subject to the burden. Now these are the two views on either one of which the obligation may rest. I will deal with the first situation first.\nNow, I submit that there is no constitutional anomaly or impropriety or anything which might not be fairly expected as the result of the perusal of a constitutional measure like the \"British North America Act,\" in supposing that whether Ontario was a party to the surrender or not and irrespective of the measure of benefit, whatever that might be, derived by Ontario in the discharge of these lands from the Indian title, the payment of the consideration for the surrender should fall upon Ontario as the department of the King's Government in aid of whose title the surrender had been made. That is a no more extraordinary result I submit than that which took place in the case of Williams v. Howarth[23], about the soldier. What is the nature of the trust or interest other than that of the province in these lands arising out of the Indian title? The interest is in the Indians and the control and management of the lands and property is with the Superintendent-General of Indian affairs. That is, it is with the Dominion Government. The first legislation after Confederation with relation to Indians is the Act providing for the organization of the Department of State, 31 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 5. Section 5 says that the Secretary of State shall be the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs and as such have the control and management of the lands and property of the Indians in Canada. Then by section 8 of the same Act it is provided that no release or surrender of lands reserved for the use of the Indians shall be binding except assented to by the chiefs in the presence of the Secretary of State or a person authorized by him and accepted by the Governor-General. That is to say, in the presence of an officer authorized by the government and who must be accepted by the government. Now there can be no doubt as to the legislative authority of the Dominion to pass these Acts, they being given the exclusive legislative authority over these lands which are reserved for Indians. That is, lands reserved for Indians within the meaning of that expression as used in the \"British North America Act,\" as determined by the Judicial Committee in the St. Catharines Case[24]. That had been a matter of debate. It was held otherwise by all the courts here, before that was determined. So that was the legislative position. Then section 10 of the same Act provided that no release or surrender of any such lands to any party other than the Crown shall be valid. That was in 31 Vict. Then in 1873 the Act was passed, assented to on the 3rd of May, 1873, establishing the Department of the Interior. Chapter 4, section 3, provides that the Minister of the Interior shall be the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs and shall, as such, have the control and management of the lands and property of the Indians in Canada. The general purpose of that Act so far as the Indians were concerned was to transfer the administration from the State Department to the Interior Department. That was the legislation as it stood at the time this treaty was made and, of course, the whole thing is continued in the \"Indian Act\" at present. The present statute is chapter 81, R.S.C. 1906. Therefore in view of that legislation I say it was not competent to Ontario to make a treaty with the Indians or to obtain any transfer or surrender from the Indians. Neither has the Provincial Government the right to require the Dominion upon any terms to obtain a surrender or refrain from obtaining a surrender. The whole administration is exclusively in the hands of the Dominion Government.\nNow, is it not possible to provide by the use of the legislative power that the Indians shall enjoy in some other form the interest which they have in their lands and can it not be provided that they shall have that in money rather than in lands even if the province is unwilling.? Does not that follow? Wherein rests the jurisdiction, for instance, with regard to Indian lands similar to that which the Imperial Parliament exercises in passing a \"Settled Lands Act,\" as to tenancies? A tenant for life, a settled estate and a remainderman, the tenant for life has his interest in the land which he can only enjoy as land until the legislature comes in, as it does, and says he can sell it and convey the whole interest and he enjoys the value of that estate in money. Is it not competent for the Dominion to do that with regard to the Indian title?\nWe find the obligation to recoup the Dominion in the general intention of the Act. The Indians were scattered all over the country, from one end to the other, in various provinces. The same band very often inhabited different parts of the same province. It was necessary no doubt that there should be a uniform policy in dealing with them and that they should be under one legislative power and one executive power. At the same time they owned their property, if we may call it so, their territories, under various provincial governments. The only way to work it out was to put the whole thing, so far as legislative and executive power is concerned, in the hands of the Dominion Government. That being so, why should not the province on the extinguishment of the title, within whose lands the area happened to be, bear the burden of the extinguishment of the title? Is it not fair and reasonable? Is it not that which you ought to read into this constitutional Act as the apparent intention.\nNow, the other view simply involves this, that it takes two parties to make a contract. It takes two parties to make a treaty. The province had the beneficial interest in the lands subject to the Indian title. The Indian title could not be transferred or assigned, but while it existed and was recognized by the law it was only capable of being extinguished; that is as it-were, transferred to the province, so as to merge in the paramount title. Now the Dominion had no interest in the lands and no interest in the transaction at all, except as the guardian of the Indians for the purpose of seeing that their interests were safeguarded in any surrender that might be made. Consequently, if Ontario desired to have this surrender made, she could go to the Dominion and ask the Dominion to negotiate, or stand by while she negotiated with the Indians for a treaty whereby the surrender would be made, the Indians surrendering through the Dominion and Ontario accepting. Now that might have been done; they might have done it in that way and I am not so sure that they did not do it in that way. If Ontario had gone to the Dominion, and said, we want to open up this territory but we cannot touch it because of the Indian title and we want you to go to work and get the Indian title surrendered, and then they had gone, the three parties together, the Indians and Ontario being the contracting parties, the Dominion present as the guardian and trustee of the Indians as it were, and a contract had been made just as was made in this case between the Indians on the one side and the Crown on the other, the obligation of the covenants to pay and provide which are in this treaty would unquestionably have fallen on Ontario.\nThen it was said that in the circumstances here Ontario was not a party. The Dominion made a contract with the Indians that nobody had anything to do with except Ontario. It made a contract in the name of the Crown. The Crown is the name that stands for Ontario just as much as it stands for the Dominion. It took an assignment to the Crown of property, which could not operate except in favour of the Crown, represented by Ontario, and it assumed in the name of the Crown a number of obligations in consideration of that transfer. That transfer was taken, communicated to Ontario, and what does Ontario do? Does she say, it is unreasonable, we don't want this, we had no part in this? No, she said, that is just the thing we wanted, we wanted to go in there, it is ours, it belongs to us, and she took advantage of it, made her grants, sold her timber, made her mining leases, and has administered the property from that day to this. I put it first, that it is a matter that rested wholly with the Dominion; that is the way I argued it first, and that the Dominion could negotiate the treaty independently, as it must, make its terms and provisions and stipulations and take the surrender which then operates for the benefit of the province, and the consequence of that is that the province has to bear the burden. That is the one view of it. The other view of it is that the province cannot be bound without its consent and then you have the contract made which operates when the province consents, and here there is no doubt that both antecedently and subsequently the province was anxious to assume the administration. It has been designated a principle of universal application that where a contract has been entered into by one man as agent for another, the person on whose behalf it has been made cannot take the benefit of it without bearing the burden; the contract must be performed in its integrity. Accordingly where a person adopts a contract which was made on his behalf, but without his authority, he must adopt it altogether, he cannot ratify that part which is beneficial to himself and reject the remainder, he must take the benefit to be derived from the transaction, cum onere.\nThen so far as the question of area is concerned, this is exactly what happened; the judge puts a paragraph in his judgment in this way: \"Now it is to be observed that whatever moneys have been expended under this treaty by the Dominion Government have been expended in respect of the Indians inhabiting a tract of land part of which only is within the Province of Ontario, and it is suggested by Mr. Newcombe for the Dominion that the province should contribute to such expenditure in the proportion that the area of the surrendered territory within the province, bears to the whole area surrendered by the treaty. There is no other suggestion on that branch of the case, and I do not see that any fairer or better rule could be adopted.\" No one could pretend to say that an acre of this land or the whole of it within Ontario is proportionately of any greater or less value than that without. There is an area of 55,000 square miles purchased, presumably each square mile of the same value; and one-third of that goes to the Dominion and two-thirds to Ontario. It is to be paid for proportionately.\nThat is all I wanted to say about the area, because my learned friend referred to it. Then the other question is equally simple, I think.\nI refer to the terms of the treaty again. The Indians having surrendered this territory to the Crown, Her Majesty undertakes and agrees for, I think, nine different things. In the first place to lay aside these special reserves. Secondly, with a view to shew the satisfaction of Her Majesty with the behaviour and good conduct of her Indians, she hereby, through her Commissioners, makes them a present of $12. Thirdly, to maintain schools for instruction. Fourthly, to suppress the liquor traffic. Fifthly, to distribute and pay annuities of $5 per head, yearly. Then to expend the sum of $1,500 per year for the purchase of ammunition and twine. Then to furnish agricultural implements; and an annual salary of $25 to the chiefs. Now that is all done in consideration, so far as the basis of the treaty is concerned, of the surrender of these lands. Now, my lords, I say you cannot go outside of that and imagine other considerations. All these things are referable to the surrender. None of them would have been undertaken as and when they were or at all if it had not been for the surrender. The only asset the Indians had was their interest in the land. That was the occasion and the only occasion for going there and bargaining with them. The best evidence in the record, to which I have referred, shews that the object was to let the settlers in and to get rid of this title. In other words that the transaction was what it professes to be upon the face of it, a transaction whereby they, on the one part, parted with an asset which they had in consideration of certain obligations which the Crown undertook. Now, my learned friend wants to make the tail wag the dog, because he reads this last covenant here; the undersigned chiefs solemnly promise to be good and loyal subjects, to obey the treaty and observe the law and all that sort of thing. That is what he says is the principal consideration, but what is the fact; that form is the usual form; if they had printed forms of treaties that would be printed in every one of them. It is a common form of covenant which they put in, because it is a good enough thing, no doubt, to impress upon these Indians that they ought to obey the law, but does any one suppose if they had had no title to surrender that we would have gone up there and paid a lot of money to them to take a covenant from them to keep the peace?\nHere is a treaty made in 1871. This is a book that is in evidence called the Indian Treaties and Surrenders. On page 293 is a treaty with another tribe of Indians altogether, with the very same term in it. Word for word the same. \"Do hereby solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe the treaty and behave themselves as good and loyal subjects.\"\nHere is one in 1781, the 21st year of George III. Here is another treaty that I open to off-hand. It says that the undersigned chiefs do hereby bind and pledge themselves and their people to observe this treaty and maintain perpetual peace between themselves and Her Majesty's white subjects and not interfere with the property or molest the persons of Her Majesty's white subjects. Is it a question of dividing the consideration? What does my learned friend's argument involve? Does it involve more than this, that the time this surrender was taken was an inexpedient time, that it was taken too soon. The present position is, we have got so far in the argument that we are considering now what is Ontario to pay. Ontario is to pay the consideration of this treaty. The consideration I mean of the surrender. There was only one thing surrendered, only one thing dealt with so far as the Indians were concerned, and that is their title to this real estate. That is what passed. On the face of the treaty, as I have said, all the covenants we enter into are relative to that.\nWhatever the motive was that actuated the Dominion, that had nothing to do with the Indians; the Indian was selling that for the best he could. Now they may say, you bought that too soon. I say we are the judges of the time when it was to be bought. But to say we paid any more for it because we wanted to build a railway or settle Hudson Bay claims or anything of that sort, that is not so on this evidence and your lordships, I submit, cannot find it.\nHogg K.C. follows. Your lordships are now seized, I think, not only, of the facts of this case, but also of the principles which underlie our claim and contention. My observations will be directed more to the cross appeal, taking it for granted that my learned friend, my leader, in his able argument has placed the matter so completely before you that it will not be necessary for me to take up time.\nThe cross appeal arises in this way. It has been explained to your lordships that first there was a trial before the judge of the Exchequer Court, and the question that was then debated and decided was the question of general liability; whether there was a liability at all or not; whether Ontario was liable under the treaty. What his lordship found was this: \"This court doth declare that the Province of Ontario is, in respect of the obligation incurred by the Dominion under the North-West Angle Treaty, No. 3, which involved the payment of money, liable to pay to the Dominion all sums paid by the Dominion which are referable to the extinguishment of the Indian title in the lands described in the said treaty in the proportion that the area of such land within the Province of Ontario bears to the whole area covered by the treaty,\" which we have discussed. Then followed a further consideration of the question of the classes of items under the treaty for which Ontario should be held liable, and what might be called a continuation of the trial took place. Evidence was taken upon the different items mentioned in the treaty itself, that is the different classes of expenditures which were undertaken by the Dominion, and upon that continuation of the trial, or as it was called, the further consideration of these questions, his lordship gave a judgment and by that judgment he decided as follows: that there was to be 305-493rds of specified expenditures made by the Dominion to or on behalf of the Indians, paid by Ontario. That direction has reference to the territorial area. In other words there was 49,500 square miles found by the evidence instead of 55,000 as it was generally stated, of which 30,500 miles were within Ontario. Then he says, these are the expenditures which the province should be liable to repay the Dominion (see p. 4). The judgment proceeds: \"(d) In respect of the payments made by the Dominion for or on account of the present of $12 per head stipulated by the treaty to be paid to each man, woman and child of the bands of Indians represented at the treaty and claimed under the first item of Schedule A in the said statement of claim the sum of $5 per head.\"\nNow we say that to the extent that he has allowed in favour of the Dominion, his judgment is right, but what we complain of is that he overlooked the instructions in the treaty and endeavoured to appropriate certain amounts which he said Ontario should be liable for and other amounts for which the Dominion should be liable itself, and he put it upon two grounds. One was that in any case where it had been the policy of the government of the Dominion or the policy of the Province of Canada to make allowances to the Indians as a matter of policy, in those cases Ontario should not be asked to pay.\nThen the other ground that he places that judgment upon is that to the extent to which the payment of any of these amounts came within the proper administration of the Department of Indian Affairs, the province should not be liable. Now, of course, upon both of these his lordship was to some extent naturally and necessarily speculating. There was not evidence to support these exceptions which he made.\nTake the question of schools. He excluded that, all expenditure for schools.\nI say that upon the evidence there were no schools in this territory prior to 1873. There was nothing in the way of schools till this treaty was made, and then there were treaty schools or schools that were asked for by the Indians under the treaty. Then again, while it is a fact that there were schools for Indians in other parts of the country, and while the government were allowing the Indians to have schools in other parts of the country, in the Province of Quebec and in other provinces, these were schools which were built and maintained out of funds which belonged to the Indians themselves. In other words, for many years, the Province of Canada and the Dominion were accepting surrenders from the Indians of parts of their reserves and selling for the benefit of the Indians and at Confederation a very large fund, a fund amounting to about two million dollars, had come into existence.\nIdington J.\u2014As a result of sales of lands?\nMr. Hogg: Yes, as the result of sales of reserves; where the Indians did not require so big a reserve they gave up part of it and asked the government to sell. These were treated as Indian trust funds. This was a revenue-bearing fund\u2014that is, the government were allowing interest upon it, and out of this revenue schools were maintained. While that was part of the policy of the government to allow the Indians to have schools, the Indians were having the schools and maintaining them out of their own money. So that it was not until we have this treaty, and I think one or two prior to it\u2014the one of 71 my learned friend referred to\u2014it was not until this treaty that the government agreed as part of the consideration for the surrender of the title to maintain schools when they were requested by the Indians. We say then that while it may have been a policy to educate the Indians and to guard their funds and to use their funds for the purpose of civilizing them, still that did not take away or make less the fact that the maintenance of schools under the treaty was a consideration for the extinguishment of the Indian title and whatever sum was expended in that way was, I submit, a payment which must be made by Ontario.\nMy learned friends on the other side have said that the question of twine, and fishing lines and so on should not have been allowed by his lordship. Well, I simply say that that is one of the considerations and that it should be allowed and that his lordship was right in that.\nThen he has excluded the supply of cattle and the farming implements and all the things that were necessary to help the Indians to become farmers and civilized. Now these were expressly given by the treaty. It was one of the considerations, part of the general consideration for the extinguishment of the title. There is no good ground that I have ever been able to see why he should allow the twine and fishing tackle and exclude the cattle and implements of trade to make them civilized. It is said these things were given to them as a matter of policy and that, therefore, the judge was right in excluding them, but all the evidence really is that occasionally, for the purpose of relieving extreme distress, it was better to give them a gun and a pound of shot and some powder to carry on and make a living than to give them money. But here we have a case where the government are giving them cattle, tools and so on for the purpose of civilizing them and making them good citizens, and I can see no distinction between giving them $ 5 a head which has been allowed and which seems to have been assented to all round, $5 a head as an annuity, and giving cattle and implements of trade.\nThen just a word with reference to the surveys. I think I have finished now with reference to the classes of items that his lordship has excluded from his consideration. Now, my learned friends have stated in advance in answer to the cross appeal, that the amount for surveys should never have been allowed by his lordship. His lordship put it in this way. Following the making of the treaty they immediately, or very shortly afterwards, within the next year, I think, commenced to lay out the reserves, and they had communications, as my learned friend has read, of the necessity of these reserves being laid out and a map was sent shewing the areas in which mineral land occurred, which were to be excluded and, if possible, not taken into the reserves. They then went on and made these surveys; that is they went on to expend money in carrying out the objects of the treaty, and his lordship in the court below allowed these surveys.\nThere were surveys of two kinds, for the purpose of opening up the country for settlement and surveys consequent upon the making of the treaty; that is the laying out of certain reserves for the Indians. Now what his lordship said was this; that it is true there is an agreement that these reserves are to be consented to later on, but to the extent that you have made surveys for both purposes, these are a proper expenditure by the Dominion under the treaty, and outside of the treaty if you like; these are proper expenditures and it is only fair and right and the proper way to deal with that is to set it off against the counterclaim of the province. He does not allow it as one of the items which is chargeable against Ontario by the treaty, but he says it is a proper charge against Ontario's counterclaim and when you come to take your accounts the referee will take that into consideration.\nMr. Newcombe: My lord, I have my learned friend's permission, if your lordships will allow me to refer to one treaty which I intended to quote yesterday and which I omitted. It was on the point I made that this territory is vested in Ontario subject to an interest other than that of the province; that that interest constitutes a burden on the land which has to be discharged some time or another and whenever it is discharged that the obligation falls upon Ontario to pay the consideration for the discharge. That is under the \"British North America Act.\" The fact that Ontario cannot herself bring about the discharge or that perhaps she has no voice in it or of the fixing of the consideration does not affect that situation. Section 109 I had referred to which provides that all lands, mines, minerals and realties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due, shall belong to the several provinces in which they are situate, subject to any trusts subsisting in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same. Now that section fell to be construed in the Robinson Treaties Case[25], which I cited yesterday and I referred to what Lord Watson said at pages 210 and 211 of that case (1). In addition to what I read yesterday\u2014I may read it again to make it clear\u2014these words are from the judgment: \"The expressions 'subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof,\u2019 and 'subject to any interest other than that of the province,' appear to their lordships to be intended to refer to different classes of right. Their lordships are not prepared to hold that the word 'trust' was meant by the legislature to be strictly limited to such proper trusts as a court of equity would under-take to administer; but, in their opinion, it must at least have been intended to signify the existence of a contractual or legal duty, incumbent upon the holder of the beneficial estate or its proceeds, to make payment, out of one or other of these, of the debt due to the creditor. * * On the other hand, 'an interest other than that of the province in the same,' appears to them to denote some right or interest in a third party, independent of and capable of being vindicated in competition with the beneficial interest of the old province. Their lordships have been unable to discover any reasonable grounds for holding that, by the terms of the treaties, any independent interest of that kind was conferred upon the Indian communities; and, in the argument addressed to them for the appellants, the claim against Ontario was chiefly, if not wholly, based upon the provisions of section 109 with respect to trusts.\" That is pages 210 and 211. Now then during the argument in amplification of that and shewing what I think follows from the judgment, Lord Watson said this, and this is what I intended to read yesterday. Your lordships will find this, I may say, reported in Lefroy on Legislative Power in Canada, page 612 in the note, what I am going to read. The case is reported, but this is an observation made during the argument and your lordships will have to refer to Lefroy for that at page 612. \"If the Crown right was subject to a burden upon the land, the interest is to pass to the province under that burden. There was to be no change in the position of the Crown.\" There was no change in the position of the Crown, neither was there any change in the position of the Indians, at Confederation. \"I think the whole effect of this clause is to appropriate to the Province of Ontario all the interest in lands within that province as vested in the Crown, subject to all the conditions under which they were vested in the Crown.\" * * \"The policy of these sections of the Act, 109 and 112 and 111 and 142, when read together, appears to me to be generally this beyond all dispute. * * The intention obviously was to provide with regard to all those debts and liabilities of the old Province of Canada, which were simply debts and liabilities charged generally upon the revenues of the provinces, the creditors were to be paid by the Dominion, and to a certain extent, in excess of a particular sum, the Dominion was to be recouped by the two new provinces in the proportions which might be determined under the provisions of section 142. On the other hand to this extent it is made plain\u2014at least I hold it to be made very plain under section 109 \u2014that any debt or liability which was made a proper charge upon any property or assets passing to the province under section 109, was to remain that charge, and was not to be satisfied by the Dominion Government under section 111.\"\nMr. Hogg: I said, my lords, that the judge of the Exchequer Court dealt with the expenditure on surveys by giving the Dominion the right to set-off the amount against the counterclaim of Ontario. That was the judgment of his lordship in the court below. Now we complain that that is one of the items which constitute part of the consideration referable to the extinguishment of the Indian title.\nI have only now a reference to one other item and that is this present of $12 which was made to the Indians at the time the treaty was made. No treaty could be made without giving them some present. In all these treaties you will find that they got some amount of money as a present for their good behaviour.\nFor several years efforts were being made to get a treaty; in '71 and '72 Commissioners were sent and they could not arrive at an agreement, and it appears they had grievances more because they had been trespassed upon, because their rights had been invaded and infringed, and it was true that for the purpose of the Dawson route some timber had been taken, I think to build a boat on one of the lakes and for other purposes of that kind.\nDavies J.\u2014The point is that the only way to settle that was to extinguish the right there quoad the land over which the road ran, or to extinguish the whole matter. Ontario had no interest in having it extinguished over a mere 50 foot road, therefore it had to be extinguished over the whole land or not at all. Your point is how far we are bound to hold all of these considerations mentioned in the treaty are necessarily attributable to the extinguishment.\nMr. Hogg: Yes, my lord, and his lordship below, as I say, divided them and we cannot see why that should have been done.\nRitchie K.C. in reply: From what has been developed on the argument I think it may be said to be reasonably clear now that the whole Dominion case is based on the dictum of Lord Watson in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[26]. That that is a mere dictum and no part of the judgment and not necessary for the determination of the issues involved is, I think, abundantly clear.\nHaving regard to the record in that case, no evidence could have been adduced such as has been adduced here to shew the moving consideration, to shew the state of affairs as between the Dominion and the province. What could the Privy Council have known in 1888, when that case was before them, of what the state of affairs was in Canada in 1873? We know now here, that there was a fear of an uprising, and these were all these other considerations to which my learned friend Mr. Shepley has alluded, the contract with British Columbia, the contract with the Hudson Bay Company and all these other factors that have been adduced in evidence here. None of these were before the learned law lords.\nI submit that expression was not at all necessary for the determination of the issues involved in that suit, and if that question had been in any way agitated on the record and if the Province of Canada had been represented there, all these considerations that are now presented to your lordships would have been presented to the Judicial Committee. I can say no more on that subject.\nThen I propose to refer briefly to the conventional boundary agreement of 1874, and I desire to point-out to your lordships that by that agreement what was stipulated for was that when the true boundary was ascertained the whole of the moneys received by the Dominion in respect of the particular portion that was found to be within Ontario should be paid over to the Province of Ontario. It was manifestly not intended at that time to put forward any claim on behalf of the Dominion in respect of the obligations assumed under the treaty. If there had been any such idea we would have found, no doubt, in this conventional boundary agreement a provision for deduction of such sums as Ontario might be liable for to the Dominion arising in any way out of the obligations assumed by the Dominion under that treaty.\nIn 1874 there was no stipulation in the agreement as to the liability of Ontario arising out of any obligation under the treaty. Then I pass on from that to the agreement of 16th April, 1894, some twenty years after the conventional boundary agreement, and some six years after the decision in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case.[27].\nNow let us see what the provisions of that agreement are. I say the Dominion itself must have regarded that as a mere dictum or at all events they felt that they had no claim against Ontario, as 1 submit is evidenced by this agreement of 1894. They must have known of that dictum at that time, or at least of that statement, whether dictum or not, but what do we find them doing? We find this agreement entered into on the 15th of April in which they recite the treaty itself. Reference is made to the treaty; \"and whereas by the said treaty out of the lands so surrendered reserves were to be selected and laid aside for the benefit of the said Indians, and the said Indians were, amongst other things hereinafter provided, to have the right of hunting and fishing\" and so on, throughout the tract. \"And whereas the true boundaries of Ontario have since been ascertained\"\u2014I am just giving the skeleton, not reading the clauses in full\u2014\"and whereas certain reserves have been laid out in intended pursuance of the said treaty and the said Government of Ontario was no party to the selection and has not yet concurred therein.\" \"And whereas it is deemed desirable for the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario to come to a friendly and just understanding in respect of the said matters\" and so on. \"Therefore it is hereby agreed between the two governments, with respect to the tracts to be from time to time taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes and to the regulations required in that behalf, as in the said treaty mentioned, it is hereby conceded and declared that, as the Crown lands in the surrendered tract have been decided to belong to the Province of Ontario or to Her Majesty in right of the said province, the rights of hunting and fishing by the Indians throughout the tract surrendered, not including the reserves to be made thereunder, do not continue with reference to any tracts which have been, or from time to time may be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes by the Government of Ontario.\"\nThen it is agreed that the concurrence of the Province of Ontario is required in the selection of the said reserves. Manifestly Ontario was taking objection to the treaty and simply said, these are our lands, you have no right to agree to reserve to the Indians any right of hunting or fishing over our territory; you have no right to select reserves there without our concurrence. These are .the two matters affecting the property itself; Ontario objected and the Government of the Dominion acceded to it, and not only that, but they expressly entered into this agreement.\nThen, my lord, we have clause 6: \"That any future treaties with the Indians in respect of territory in Ontario to which they have not before the passing of the said statutes surrendered their claim aforesaid, shall be deemed to require the concurrence of the Government of Ontario.'' There Ontario was manifestly asserting its right to this territory freed from any burden placed upon it by the Dominion of Canada under that particular treaty and we find the Dominion assenting to the position taken by Ontario, presumably for this reason, that the question arose, could they select these reserves without paying for them? They could not, of course, without legislation. But could they legislate so as to expropriate these lands for the purpose of reserves for these Indians without making just compensation for them? Presumably that was one of the matters that they were considering and they wished to get Ontario's acquiescence in the selection of these reserves, the Dominion not being required to pay Ontario anything for it.\nNow we would naturally expect in reciting this treaty, if these large sums of money were due by Ontario to the Dominion in respect of the obligations entered into by the Dominion under that treaty, to find that matter dealt with by that agreement or dealt with at that time; but all these years have elapsed and from 1873 until 1903, the time the action is commenced, so far as I know, no formal demand has ever been made for this money. No pretence that the province is liable in any way to the Dominion in respect to the obligations assumed by the Dominion under that treaty. Now then, if, as a matter of fact, it is conceded, that they had no right to enter into' an obligation as to hunting and fishing, no right to enter into an agreement to select and give reserves so as to bind Ontario, does it not follow from that that they had no right to enter into any obligations at all that would bind Ontario without Ontario's consent? I submit that the moment you concede that you must concede the rest, that without the consent of Ontario you have no right to impose a burden upon Ontario with respect to obligations entered into by the Dominion. The agreement, your lordships will observe, was not entered into until the 16th of April, 1894. The agreement is set out in full in the statute 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 5, the Dominion statute of 1891.\n\"It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council, if he shall see fit, to enter into an agreement with the Governor of Ontario in accordance with the terms of the draft contained in the schedule to this Act, together with any additional stipulations which may be agreed to between the two governments and such agreement shall be as binding on the Dominion of Canada as if the same were specified and set forth in an Act of this Parliament and the Governor in Council is hereby authorized to carry out the provisions of the agreement.\" I need not press my argument any further. I say the moment it is conceded that they had no right to bind Ontario in connection with the agreement as to hunting or fishing or in connection with their obligation to set aside special reserves, the moment that is conceded I say it follows that they had no right to bind Ontario by any of the other obligations which appear in that treaty.\nNow in that connection I refer to Ontario Mining Co. v. Seybold[28], commencing at page 73, the judgment of the court as delivered by Lord Davey. I refer particularly to pages 79 and 80 and to 82 and 83. Lord Davey says: \"In delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Watson observed that in construing the enactments of the 'British North America Act, 1867,' 'it must always be kept in view that where-ever public land with its incidents is described as 'the property of or as 'belonging to' the Dominion or a province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use or its proceeds has been appropriated to the Dominion or the province, as the case may be, and is subject to the control of its legislature, the land itself being vested in the Crown.\" The reference there is to the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[29]. Then Lord Davey says: \"Their lordships think that it should be added that the right of disposing of the land can only be exercised by the Crown under the advice of the Ministers of the Dominion or province, as the case may be, to which the beneficial use of the land or its proceeds has been appropriated, and by an instrument under the seal of the Dominion or the province.\" Then on page 80, speaking of this same surrender: \"This surrender was made in accordance with the provisions of the 'Dominion Act,' known as the 'Indian Act, 1880.' But it was not suggested that this Act purports, either expressly or by implication, to authorize the Dominion Government to dispose of the public lands of Ontario without the consent of the Provincial Government. No question as to its being within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion therefore arises.\" Then he says, dealing with the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case29 again: \"By section 91 of the 'British North America Act, 1867,' the Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority over 'Indians and lands reserved for the Indians.' But this did not vest in the government of the Dominion any proprietary rights in such lands or any power by such legislation to appropriate land which, by the surrender of the Indian title had become the free public lands of the province as an Indian reserve, in infringement of the proprietary rights of the province. Their lordships repeat for the purpose of the present argument what was said by Lord Herschell in delivering the judgment of this Board in the Provincial Fisheries Case[30], as to the broad distinction between proprietary rights and legislative jurisdiction. Let it be assumed that the government of the province, taking advantage of the surrender of 1873\"\u2014that is the very surrender that is before your lordships\u2014\"came at least under an honourable engagement to fulfil the terms on the faith of which the surrender was made, and therefore to concur with the Dominion Government in appropriating certain undefined portions of the surrendered lands as Indian reserves.\" There he puts it as an honourable engagement; no suggestion that it is based upon any legal or equitable liability, but an honourable engagement. Then he says: \"The result, however, is that the choice and location of the lands to be so appropriated could only be effectively made by the joint action of the two governments.\"\n\"It is unnecessary to say more on this point, for, as between the two governments, the question has been set at rest by an agreement incorporated in two identical Acts of the Parliament of Canada (54 & 55 Vict. ch. 5), and the Legislature of Ontario (54 Vict. ch. 3), and subsequently signed (April 16th, 1894), by the proper officers of the two governments. In this statutory agreement it is recited that since the treaty of 1873 the true boundaries of Ontario have been ascertained and declared to include part of the territory surrendered by the treaty and that, before the true boundaries had been ascertained, the Government of Canada had selected and set aside certain reserves for the Indians in intended pursuance of the treaty, and that the Government of Ontario was no party to the selection, and had not concurred therein; and it is agreed by article 1 (amongst other things), that the concurrence of the Province of Ontario is required in the selection. By subsequent articles provision is made, 'in order to avoid dissatisfaction or discontent among the Indians\/ for full inquiry being made by the Government of Ontario as to the reserves, and in case of dissatisfaction by the last named government with any of the reserves already selected or in case of the selection of other reserves, for the appointment of a joint commission to settle and determine all questions relating thereto.\"\nThere your lordships will see the view that was taken. They certainly did not take the view that the question of legal liability had been settled by Lord Watson in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[31]. He says: \"Assuming that they came under an honourable engagement,\" not putting it under the question of liability at all, that honourable obligation was to be fulfilled because this agreement had been entered into and was validated by the Dominion and the province respectively.\nNow my learned friend Mr. Newcombe relied upon the recitals in this treaty as to what was the true consideration. I point out to your lordships that Ontario is a stranger to it; Ontario is no party to it, and what is there to prevent a stranger to a treaty or a contract who is sought to be made liable in respect to some of the obligations contained in it, from shewing what the true consideration was, or that there were considerations other than those specifically entered in the treaty. Of course if he had been a party to it that would be an entirely different thing. But here the Dominion is seeking to make us liable in respect of these obligations and claiming that the only consideration was the surrender of this title. Surely it is open to us to shew that that, if it was a consideration, was only a very small part of the true consideration.\nMy learned friend also says that the Dominion had no interest except that of their wards, the Indians. I point out that they had a very much greater interest than that. The recital is that they wished to open up this particular tract for the purpose of settlement. That, of course, is quite true, they wished to open that up. But no one at that time ever thought that this land was land fitted for settlement in the ordinary way. What they wanted to do was to settle with the Indians so as to open a right of way to the fertile prairies of the west, in which the Dominion was interested. Moreover, they had an interest, as we now know, to the extent of about one-third of this surrendered territory, and they had the Dominion interest at large of opening up the Dominion for settlement and of increasing the population. The Dominion has as much interest in that as Ontario has.\nNow my learned friend referred to the \"Indian Act of 1868\" and claimed that Ontario could not, under any circumstances, have entered into any arrangement with the Indians for a treaty, and he relied upon section 8 of chapter 42 of the Act of 1868, that no release or surrender of land reserved for the use of the Indians or any tribe should be valid or binding except on the specified conditions the assent of the Dominion officials being required. I merely refer to it now to point out to your lordships that it only extends to a surrender of lands reserved for the use of Indians. These lands were not reserved for the use of the Indians within the provisions of that Act at all. By that was intended reserves set apart such as the Dominion undertook to set apart in this particular tract. Not lands over which the Indians had a right to roam, but lands specially set apart for the Indians and which became their property.\nDuff J.\u2014Mr. Newcombe rather put it, or at least his argument proceeded, on the assumption that lands reserved for Indians, reserved for the use of the Indians in the statute, would have the same scope as the similar words in the \"British North America Act\" which the Privy Council held applied to the whole of this tract by reason of the proclamation of 1763. Is there anything whatever in the statute there that would restrict the use of the words?\nMr. Ritchie: No, my lord, I do not think there is.\nDuff J.\u2014Why do you say these were not lands reserved then under that statute?\nMr. Ritchie: I had forgotten the construction placed upon the words in the \"British North America Act.\" I do not know, I will ask my learned friend to look and see if there is anything. It struck me that lands reserved for Indians would naturally mean that, but if that is the decision under the \"British North America Act\" my argument goes for nothing.\nNo surrender of lands reserved for the use of the Indians shall be binding. I will have a search made to see if it is limited. Of course if it is not limited, I have to bow to the decision in construing similar words in the \"British North America Act.\"\nNow we have dealt with this case so far upon narrow grounds. I take the broad general ground now that under no circumstances, in no manner, shape or form could they impose the burden, the obligation which the Dominion incurred under this treaty, up on any province. Suppose, for instance, that the Dominion should, as a matter of national policy decide to agree with the Indians to- have one large Indian reservation in either the Northwest Territory or the Maritime Provinces or any other part of Canada; should agree to supply them with ammunition and twine and establish schools, enact laws and enforce them for the suppression of the liquor traffic, could it be contended that each province would have to contribute to the obligation assumed by the Dominion in proportion to the number of Indians in that particular province? I submit that under the \"British North America Act\" wherever there is a subject assigned to the Dominion to deal with and incur money obligations, in every case these money obligations were to be discharged and intended to be discharged out of the Dominion treasury. Now, amongst the special subjects assigned was Indians and lands reserved for Indians. That was one of the subjects specially assigned and in respect of which there was to be uniform l\u00e9gislation by the Dominion affecting these different bands of Indians and their lands, and I say it was contemplated that these expenditures, just in the same way as all expenditures for railways, canals, ferries, improvements to harbours, all these were to be paid out of the Dominion treasury. The scheme of Confederation never contemplated any such thing as a local improvement plan. It was never intended that each province should be assessed for the cost of a Dominion object in proportion to the benefit derived by it. Suppose that in the Maritime Provinces they expended a million dollars on the seashore for improvements. Could it be said that the whole of that should fall upon the Maritime Provinces? It is something that comes within the federal jurisdiction; they and they alone are authorized to legislate in respect of it. And I submit that it was contemplated under the \"British North America Act\" that all these expenditures that were to be made by the Dominion in furtherance of Dominion national policy were to be paid out of the Dominion treasury, and there is not to be found within the four corners of the \"British North America Act\" that any of these were to be assessed back on the provinces under what might be called a local improvement system.\nNow we have presented to your lordships many reasons why this treaty should have been entered into and entered into at that particular time. The Dominion regarded the making of that treaty as one coming within their jurisdiction and as one coming within the scope of national authority. We find that they went on and made this treaty without ever consulting Ontario. Is not that the best evidence that they were not contemplating benefiting Ontario by the making of this treaty? They had no right to consider what the effect might be on Ontario, on any one province, whether a benefit or a burden. Their sole consideration was to legislate in the best interest of the Indians and their lands. They had the exclusive authority and when, without consulting any one of the provinces, they make this bargain, is it not manifest that they were making it under the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the \"British North America Act?\" The care of the Indians was assigned to them, they were charged with the maintenance of peace, order and good government throughout the provinces, we have the fact that there had been a rebellion and there was disaffection among the Indians. We have the additional fact that there was a highway to be built to connect the Province of Ontario with Manitoba and so on, a transcontinental railway to be built and in addition to that the further obligation which they had to discharge under their contract with the Hudson's Bay Company. I say that all these were considerations within the sphere of the Dominion Government and that the Dominion Government in pursuance of its powers and for these national objects entered into that treaty, and having entered into that treaty for these purposes, for the purpose of preserving the peace, order and good government of Canada, that they cannot assess against Ontario, Manitoba or any province any portion of the cost, but it must all come out of the Dominion treasury. It might be said that we get the benefit because these Indians who were roaming over our territory are removed to some locality far distant and will trouble us no more; they are taken off our lands. In order to accomplish that, the Dominion says we want all these Indians put in one place and they select land for that in Manitoba. And suppose they were not obliged to give compensation, could Manitoba come back and say to Ontario, this land has been taken by the Dominion in pursuance of its powers under the \"British North America Act\" as a reserve for Indians; all the Indians in your territory have been removed, the Indians from Nova Scotia and Quebec have been removed there and we ask you and Nova Scotia and Quebec to contribute to the value of this land in proportion to the benefit you have derived by the removal of the number of Indians within your territory? I submit the case upon that broad ground alone and that is the view the Dominion has taken until 1893, and it was only after that that they ever dreamed of making this claim as against the Province of Ontario. I submit upon that broad general ground that nothing can be assessed as against this province and that the decision of this court may rest upon, as \u00cf submit, that broad ground, without going into all the arguments that have been advanced in connection Avith the burden and benefit and so on, all based, as I submit, upon what I conceive to be a mere dictum of Lord Watson's in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[32].\nIt is said that this is a benefit. The Canadian Pacific Railway going through Ontario was a very great benefit. It might just as reasonably be asked that Ontario should bear a portion of the cost of the construction of that railway having regard to the benefits derived under it. The same way as to any Dominion expenditure in respect of matters coming under Dominion control. The Dominion must first determine whether in the national interest a certain thing should be done, and having determined that in the national interest a certain thing shall be done, the cost of doing that must be paid wholly out of the Dominion treasury and cannot be apportioned upon the different provinces.\nThen with reference to the cross-appeal. My learned friend has referred to schools and stated that there were no schools, of course, in this district\u2014I apprehend that is quite correct\u2014prior to the making of this treaty. But I point out that there was an Indian fund, something like, as my learned friend says, $2,000,000 at the time of Confederation, which was afterwards increased, and out of this, irrespective of whether Indians were treaty or non-treaty, schools were established at places where the government saw fit to establish them.\nThis was a general fund that the Province of Canada took over from the Imperial Government and that fund at Confederation, as you will see by the evidence of Mr. Scott, went to the Dominion and was not confined, as I submit, to the establishment of schools for Indians in any particular province.\nMy learned friend will admit that these were appropriations. They say, under this particular treaty they made an agreement to establish schools and instead of paying it out of this general fund as they otherwise would have had to do, they say, we won't take it out of this general fund, but we will go to Parliament and ask for an appropriation and that appropriation was charged against these particular treaties, but these expenditures within the boundaries of the reserves created were all under appropriations by Parliament and did not come out of the Indian fund.\nLet us see what the legislation was with regard to that long prior to this treaty in 1873. In 1860, the Legislature of the Province of Canada enacted that \"the Governor in Council may direct how and in what manner and for whom the moneys arising from sales of Indian lands and the property held or to be held in trust for the Indians shall be invested from time to time and how the payments to which the Indians may be entitled may be made.\" I am reading, my lords, from the Act of 1860, ch. 151, sec. 8. They may do all these things and may from time to time pay out these moneys for repair of roads passing through such land and by way of contribution to schools frequented by Indians. That is, they were allowed to contribute to the support of these schools. That is followed up in 1868, ch. 42, sec. 11. This is after Confederation and it is carried in in the same terms.\nThat is all I have to say, my lords, on the question of schools.\nNow one of the claims made there is for expenditure in connection with the enforcement of the liquor law; that is preventing the sale of liquor to Indians.\nOn that I refer your lordships to the Act of 1860, ch. 38, sec. 2, and the Act of 1868, ch. 42, sec. 9. These are laws for the suppression of the liquor traffic among the Indians. I shall not take up time more than giving references. I merely point to that to shew that long prior to the making of the treaty it was the policy of the Crown to enforce these laws and that, no doubt, would be done under the head of peace, order and good government.\nThen my learned friend referred to farming implements and seeds. All I say on that point is to call your lordships' attention to the language of the treaty itself. \"To be given once for all for the encouragement of the practice of agriculture among the Indians.\" The treaty itself, on its face, shews why that was done, for the encouragement of the practice of agriculture among the Indians. Surely that was something coming within the purview of the Indian authority and not referable at all to a benefit to the Dominion.\nThen as to surveys. His lordship Mr. Justice Idington has referred to the fact that we have not yet concurred in them and they have not been set aside, and if there is any liability this action is premature in this respect. There were two classes of surveys; there were what are called block surveys, and surveys of the Indian reserves. As to the surveys of the Indian reserves, if there is any liability the action is premature. As to the block surveys, these were made in respect of Dominion property, the Dominion expecting the lands would belong to them, and their base lines were put in so as to connect the system with Manitoba and the West, instead of being designed to benefit Ontario in any shape or form. The evidence of Mr. Kirkpatrick shews that with some trifling exceptions they were absolutely useless to the province so that the province did not receive any benefit with respect to these.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014The two main questions to be determined upon this appeal are, first, the liability of the Province of Ontario to repay to the Dominion certain expenditures made by the latter under the treaty obligations assumed by it where it made the treaty with the Salteaux tribe of the Ojibeway Indians in October, 1873, known as the North-West Angle Treaty, No. 3, for the extinguishment of the Indian title in the lands covered by the treaty; and secondly, whether if such liability does exist at all it extends to all of such expenditure incurred under the obligations of the treaty or to only part, and if part only, which part?\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court, the late Mr. Justice Burbidge, before whom the case was heard held that the liability of the province did exist, but limited that liability in his judgment to such expenditure as in his opinion could fairly be attributable to the extinguishment of the Indian title to the lands described in the treaty, and rejected the claim beyond that on the ground that it was expenditure incurred not simply in extinguishing the Indian title, but as part of the general policy of the Government of the Dominion in their administration of Indian affairs.\nFrom this judgment so far as it imposes a liability upon it the Province of Ontario appeals and the Dominion cross-appeals against that portion of the judgment which rejects part of their claim.\nThe tract of land in which, under the treaty, the Indians surrendered their title covers the area from the watershed of Lake Superior to the North-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods and from the American border line to the height of land from which the streams flow towards Hudson Bay, and was proved at the trial to contain about forty-nine thousand three hundred (49,300) square miles.\nOf this great area it was subsequently found when the boundaries of Ontario and Manitoba were finally adjusted that 30,500 square miles only were part of Ontario.\nIn 1873, however, when the treaty was made the westerly boundary of Ontario had not been determined, and this boundary was not definitely established until the Imperial order in council of 11th August, 1884, was passed.\nThe liability of the Province of Ontario was limited by the judgment to the expenditure made by the Dominion and which was found to be referable to the extinguishment of the Indian title in the treaty lands and in the proportion that the area of such lands within Ontario bore to the whole area covered by the treaty. If liability existed at all that seemed to be the only and proper way to adjust it.\nAfter the treaty was entered into the Dominion commenced and continued to carry out its provisions and to pay the annuities and make the other expenditures mentioned therein and which on the face of the treaty formed the consideration to the Indians for the extinguishment of their title and the release of their claims.\nIn view of the fact that in consequence of the confirmation of the arbitrators' award with respect to its boundaries the benefit of the surrender of the Indian title to the lands, within those boundaries accrued to Ontario, the Dominion contends that the province must be held liable for such a proportion of the amounts paid by it under and for the purposes of the treaty as the area of land within its boundaries relieved from the burden of the Indian title bore to the whole area released in and by the treaty.\nAt the time of the making of the treaty the Dominion no doubt entertained the view that no part of these lands were within the boundaries of Ontario, but that the whole of the tract covered by the treaty belonged to the Dominion, and as a fact no notice of their intention to enter into the treaty was given to Ontario, though it was contended that the province knew in-formally of such intention, and of the making of the treaty.\nThe Dominion subsequently adopted the position that by virtue of the surrender of the Indian title the beneficial ownership of the treaty lands had become vested in it; and this question and contention was litigated at great length in the courts until it was finally disposed of by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in favour of the Province of Ontario: The Queen v. St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Co.[33].\nIn the present action Ontario in its defence denied all liability alleging that the treaty was made without the privity of or any mandate from the province. It set up that the interests of the province were in no way involved in the considerations which induced the Dominion to undertake the negotiation of the treaty, and specified the laying out of highways and the building of railways to connect eastern and western Canada, and the relation of the Indians towards the Dominion as its wards or pupils as forming some of such inducing considerations.\nIt also set up as a reason underlying the treaty and in which Ontario was not concerned a condition contained in the surrender of its lands and rights by the Hudson's Bay Company to the Dominion made in pursuance of the Imperial Act, 31 & 32 Vict. ch. 105, by which condition the Dominion was bound to extinguish the Indian claims to the lands surrendered by the company, but as the Dominion was the only authority that could negotiate a treaty extinguishing the Indian rights, and as those rights had to be extinguished by treaty before the lands could be settled, I have not been able to see how this condition can affect the relative rights of the parties to this suit.\nThe proposition of law upon which Ontario relies for its exemption from liability for any of the expenditures incurred by the Dominion under the treaty in question is that no expenditure made for his own purposes by one will entitle him to contribution or indemnity from another because that other receives a material benefit from the expenditure, and in support of this the case of Ruabon Steamship Co. v. London Assurance Co.[34], and other cases cited in their factum were relied upon.\nThe Dominion does not in support of its claim controvert this proposition or any of the decisions referred to, simply denying their application to the facts and litigants of this case.\nThat claim, as I understand it, is based upon the relative rights, obligations and duties given to and imposed upon the Dominion and the provinces respectively by the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and upon the liabilities which may arise from one to the other from the discharge of those obligations and duties of government.\nBy section 91(24) the exclusive power to legislate with respect to \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\" was given to the Dominion, and in the St. Catharines Milling Co. Case[35] above referred to, these words were held by the Judicial Committee to be broad and comprehensive enough\nto include all lands reserved upon any terms or conditions for Indian occupation. It appeared to their lordships to be the plain policy of the Act that in order to ensure uniformity of administration all such lands and Indian affairs generally should be under the legislative control of one central authority.\nThe Dominion Parliament by its legislation of 1868, 31 Vict. ch. 42, prescribed the manner in which the Indian title to lands might be surrendered up or ceded. I take it that after this exercise of legislative power, the Dominion and the Dominion alone could act so as to extinguish the Indian title to any lands within the Dominion. As to the argument as I understand it put forward by the Province of Ontario that the Dominion could only act in this matter, so far as the lands within that province was concerned, when they were requested to do so by the province, and that if they did so act without such mandate or request and extinguished the Indian title to such lands their action could not impose any obligation or liability upon the province, I am not able to accept it.\nThe right and duty of determining when and the terms on which such title ought to be extinguished rests with the Dominion and with it alone. Considerations arising out of and affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada and other considerations affecting the best interests of the Indians may well have entered into the minds of that government when determining the times and seasons at which it was desirable or necessary to make such a treaty as the one made in the case before us.\nIt probably would act in all cases where the interests and rights of the province and the Dominion were concerned as a matter of policy in unison and conjunction with the Provincial Government interested, but the mandate or authority of that government to proceed would certainly not be necessary to the validity of the treaty, nor it seems to me would the Dominion Government, entering into such treaty without the express mandate or request of the province, cease to be its constitutional agent for the purpose. As such constitutional agent, authorized by the law and having alike the power and the duty of entering into a treaty, I am unable to see why it could not in that way, when extinguishing the Indian title, impose upon the province for whose benefit it was extinguished a liability commensurate with the consideration agreed to be given to the Indians for the cession of their rights. In the case before us there was, of course, no mandate from the province to the Dominion to enter into the treaty, nor was the province consulted in the matter. No one knew at the time whether the lands formed part of the Province of Ontario or of Manitoba, or of the North-West Territory. The Dominion authorities believed them to form part of the North-West Territories, and no doubt entered into the treaty under that belief. The Province of Ontario did not know exactly where its western boundary line was. But everything was done bon\u00e0 fide and it was not till years afterwards when the boundary award was made and confirmed that the lands were found to form part of the territory of Ontario.\nThe fact that the Dominion Government after the treaty was made wrongfully claimed that the cession from the Indians of these treaty lands vested them in the Crown for its beneficial use and not for that of the province has, it appears to me, little or nothing to do with the question before us.\nAs far as I am concerned I am of the opinion that this court should feel itself bound by the clear and definite pronouncement made on the point now before us by the Judicial. Committee in the case of the St. Catharines Milling Co.[36], and I am not prepared to accede to the argument that such pronouncement was nothing more than a mere dictum of Lord Watson's which we should ignore as not correctly expressing the law on the subject.\nThat case as originally instituted and carried on in the courts of Canada was brought in the name of the Queen on the information of the Attorney-General of Ontario to test the validity of a license to cut timber granted by the Dominion Government to the St. Catharines Milling Co. on the treaty lands in question. The Dominion, as I have said, claimed that the legal effect of the extinguishment of the Indian title had been to transmit to it the entire beneficial interest in the lands as then vested in the Crown. The province claimed such entire beneficial interest had been transmitted to it. When the case reached the Judicial Committee on appeal that Board directed that the Dominion should be at liberty to intervene in the appeal or to argue the same upon a special case raising the legal question in dispute. The Dominion Government elected to intervene and the case was most elaborately argued.\nThe Judicial Committee decided that the conflicting claims to the ceded territory maintained by the Dominion and the Province of Ontario were wholly dependent upon the provisions of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" After reviewing such of the sections of that Act as appeared to their lordships pertinent to the question in dispute and setting out section 108 in full, their lordships went on to say, p. 57: The enactments of section 109 are in the opinion of their lordships sufficient to give to each province subject to the administration and control of its own legislature the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in all lands within its boundaries which at the time of the union were vested in the Crown with the exception of such lands as the Dominion acquired right to under section 108 or might assume for the purposes specified in section 117. Its legal effect is to exclude from the duties and revenues appropriated to the Dominion all the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown arising within the provinces.\nAnd further, on page 58, they say:\nHad its Indian inhabitants been the owners in fee simple of the territory which they surrendered by the treaty of 1873, Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer [37] might have been an authority for holding that the Province of Ontario could derive no benefit from the cession, in respect that the land was not vested in the Crown at the time of the union. But that was not the character of the Indian interest. The Crown has had all along a present proprietary estate in the land, upon which the Indian title was a mere burden. The ceded territory was, at the time of the union, land vested in the Crown, subject to \"an interest other than that of the province in the same,\" within the meaning of section 109; and must now belong to Ontario in terms of that clause, unless its rights have been taken away by some provision of the Act of 1867 other than those already noticed.\nHaving decided that the lands in question became, within the meaning of section 109, on the extinguishment of the Indian title the property of Ontario in terms of that clause and giving their reasons for not assenting to the argument ior the Dominion founded on section 91(24), their lordships go on, at page 60 of the report, to state their opinion of the effect of the extinguishment of the Indian title so far as the liability of the province was concerned for the considerations which the Dominion Government had paid or agreed to pay for that extinguishment in the following terms:\nSeeing that the benefit of the surrender now accrues to her Ontario must of course relieve the Crown and the Dominion of all obligations involving the payment of money which were undertaken by Her Majesty and which are said to have been in part fulfilled by the Dominion Government.\nI do not look upon this as merely a dictum. It did not form part of the formal judgment, it is true. That was not absolutely necessary as between the parties to the original suit. But it was a clear and distinct pronouncement as between the two governments then before the court on the general question they were debating to the effect that neither of their contentions were unreservedly accepted, but that while the lands belonged to Ontario in terms of section 109 they did so subject to the obligation that the province should refund to the Dominion the considerations paid by the latter for the removal of the Indian title burden on these lands which they held to be within the terms of the section 109, \"an interest other than that of the province in the same.\"\nFor me this clear and unambiguous expression of judicial opinion on the question what as between the two governments was the nature of the interest acquired by the province is sufficient. I feel that it is my duty, so far as this controversy before us is concerned, to give effect to that opinion. I feel the less doubt upon the point from the very strong expression of opinion given by Chief Justice Strong in the Robinson Treaty case[38], at page 505, as to the meaning and effect of the above statement of their opinion by the Judicial Committee. He there says:\nAn argument against the Province of Ontario is attempted to be deduced from the decision of the Privy Council in the case of the St. Catharines Milling Company v. The Queen[39]. In that case there was an Indian surrender to the Crown, represented by the Dominion Government made in 1873, subsequent to Confederation. The Privy Council held that this surrender inured to the benefit of the Province of Ontario, and so holding it also decided that Ontario was bound to pay the consideration for which the Indians ceded their rights in the lands. I see no analogy between that case and the present\u00bb In the case before us no one doubts that the Province of Canada, which acquired the lands, was originally bound to pay the consideration. In the case before the Privy Council the question was, as it were, between two departments of the government of the Crown and the most obvious principles of justice required that the government which got the lands should pay for them. Here the lands were originally acquired by the Province of Canada, which was to pay for them, and the present question only arises on a severance of that government into two separate provinces and a consequential partition of its assets and liabilities.\nSo far, therefore, as the main question before us is concerned I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nWith respect to the subordinate, but important question as to the extent of the liability of the province for these treaty obligations undertaken by the Dominion Government, I find it difficult to accept the reasoning by which the learned judge supports all of his conclusions.\nThe treaty expresses upon its face the considerations which the Indians were to receive in return for the extinguishment of their title. Some few of these considerations may be found to be in excess of those which in former years were accustomed to be given in analogous cases, and one or two of them may perhaps be held to be simply a declaration of the general policy of the government in their administration of Indian affairs. Some others may be new and additional for which precedents may not be found. But while I can gather from the evidence much to convince me that the Dominion Government was moved to enter into this treaty at the time it did by public considerations affecting alike the interests of the Indians as those of the Dominion and its peace, order and good government, I am not able to say that I have any evidence on which I could determine that any of the considerations appearing on the face of the treaty, with the possible exception of the three subjects of expenditure for schools, agriculture and the liquor traffic, were agreed to or given for any other purpose than that of extinguishing the Indian title.\nThe facts that the government desired for broad public reasons to see highways and roadways running from east to west through the ceded territory as early as might be so as to enable the fertile prairies of the North-West Territories to be settled by way of Canadian territory instead of through a foreign country, or that they had entered into obligations with the Province of British Columbia for the construction of a transcontinental railway and desired to remove all possible impediments to the fulfilment, when the time came, of their obligation are not grounds, even if proved, which would justify me in assuming that greater obligations were incurred for the extinguishment of the Indian title than otherwise would have been. They merely indicate a condition of things which in the opinion of the Government made a treaty desirable and probably would determine them to forward its being entered into earlier than in the absence of such conditions it might have been. Nor can I draw any inference from the last clause of the treaty wherein the Indians agree \"to\" obey and abide by the law and to maintain peace and good order between each other and also between themselves and other tribes\" and other people, and not molest person or property in the ceded district or interfere with any person passing or travelling through it, etc., from which I would be justified in concluding that the considerations of the treaty had been agreed to for other purposes than those of extinguishing the Indian title. Such a clause appears to have been common to many, if not all, treaties with the Indians made by Canada.\nI think it is not unfair to hold that while many public considerations may hare existed at the particular season when the treaty was made for entering into it and may have had the effect of anticipating the time when such a treaty might otherwise have been made, none of them can be determined to have been the things or objects or purposes for which the considerations of the treaty were agreed to be paid.\nAnd so on like reasoning I am not able to support the reduction of the $12 made as a present to each man, woman and child of the bands represented at the time the treaty was entered into down to $5.\nNor am I able to agree to the judge's refusal to allow the expenditures made for the salaries of the chiefs and for a triennial distribution of clothing to them. I think all these things should be allowed.\nWith regard to the expenditure for schools, the suppression of the liquor traffic and the encouragement of agriculture, I am inclined to think the learned judge's disallowance of all these items might be justified on the grounds stated by him. They were really intended when put in the treaty more as a declaration of the general policy of the government on these questions than as considerations referable to the extinguishment of the title and were, as the judge says, legitimate objects of administration.\nI would therefore allow the cross appeal in part as above stated, and dismiss the main appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014We should, I think, first consider the nature of the jurisdiction given by section 32 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" in assigning to that court the power to determine \"controversies\" arising between the Dominion and a province that has acceded thereto.\nThe language is comprehensive enough to cover claims founded on some principles of honour, generosity or supposed natural justice, but no one in argument ventured to say the court was given any right to proceed upon any such ground. It seemed conceded that we must find a basis for the claim either in a contractual or (bearing in mind that the controversy is the Crown against the Crown for both parties act in the name of the Crown) quasi-contractual relation between the parties hereto or on some ground of legal equity.\nThis is supplemented in the respondent's factum by an argument resting upon quasi-contracts of the civil law respecting which a long list of authorities is cited. But on argument that law and these authorities did not seem to be pressed.\nLet us bear all this in mind when measuring the claims in question.\nThe appellant's counsel in opening had challenged the applicability of any law but that of Ontario, and pointed out that the contest arose out of dealings relative to land in Ontario and what was done in regard thereto; and might have added that the seat of each government concerned was and is in Ontario. Save a' casual allusion to the authorities on civil law or French law as set forth in the factum of the respondent I heard no serious attempt to confute this claim for the law prevailing in Ontario as that proper to be observed herein. As to the civil law, invaluable as it often is to afford light upon the origin of what is found in much of the Civil Code of Quebec and the exceptional cases arising in that province, left unprovided for by that Code, it is no disparagement of the civil law to say that it is not of much direct service when we come to consider questions arising upon the \"British North America Act,\" or upon legislation of the Dominion which usually applies uniformly to all the provinces; and of still less value is it when we have, as here, to consider the legislation of another province than Quebec.\nThe civil law is the ultimate origin of much that concerns property and civil rights in Quebec, but when these subject matters were relegated by the \"British North America Act\" to the respective jurisdictions of the provinces there was no longer need for its consideration as having any binding or operative effect in relation to the formation of the Government of the Dominion as a whole or its relation to its several parts or anything springing therefrom.\nMoreover, such lessons as may be derived therefrom do not furnish to my mind much encouragement for the respondent here when due regard is had to the facts presented to us. Not only is that law inapplicable for the reason I point out, but that law does not furnish any basis upon which to rest a claim in favour of one acting, not for another, or as representing another, or instead of another, but for itself solely, in direct hostility to that other, discards that other when and where present and in defiance of the other's claim proceeds to expend accordingly; not in ignorance of fact or want of opportunity to know the law and the fact. I think we therefore must assume that the law in force in Ontario is to govern the rights between the parties hereto, so far as we are given any authority to pass upon them.\nI might add that having regard to the possible technical difficulty arising from each power representing or being represented by the same Crown when we come to work out the statutes assigning this jurisdiction and seek for the law applicable, we may well assume and hold it to have been designed by each enacting power to treat each actor, Dominion and province, as a separate and independent legal entity, capable of legal relations notwithstanding the technical difficulty that I allude to, which would be swept away by thus interpreting the said statutes.\nThe claim in the case made by the Dominion (which by the way rests on transactions had seven years before these statutes) is to be re-paid moneys disbursed in procuring and in observing the terms of a treaty made on the 3rd of October, 1873, with Indians and known as the North-West Angle Treaty No. 3. How did this treaty come about? A brief historical reply to this question ought to go far to solve the question of liability raised here.\nThe negotiations leading up to the treaty spread over three years and kept pace, as it were, with some of the events to be referred to.\nA line of policy begotten of prudence, humanity and justice adopted by the British Crown to be observed in all future dealings with the Indians in respect of such rights as they might suppose themselves to possess was outlined in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 erecting, after the Treaty of Paris in that year, amongst others, a separate government for Quebec, ceded by that treaty to the British Crown. That policy adhered to thenceforward, by those responsible for the honour of the Crown led to many treaties whereby Indians agreed to surrender such rights as they were supposed to have in areas respectively specified in such treaties.\nIn these surrendering treaties there generally were reserves provided for. Indians making such surrenders to enter into or be confined to for purposes of residence.\nThe history of this mode of dealing is very fully outlined in the judgment of the learned Chancellor Boyd in the case of The Queen v. The St. Catharines Milling Co.[40].\nThe North-West Angle Treaty No. 3 made by the Dominion is of that class.\nImportant as it was at all times to secure the continuation of the policy I have referred to the Confederation of the provinces, in 1867, rendered it doubly so because it was anticipated then that Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory, a land of vast extent and Imperial possibilities, yet roamed over by Indians, would soon become part of the Dominion.\nProvision was made in section 149 of the \"British North America Act\" for such event.\nIt was thus well known then, that instead of the Indian problem being likely soon to diminish in importance or the burthens incident to it become less, the contrary was almost certain to be the case and hence as a matter of the greatest importance for the welfare of Canada as a whole the subject was assigned to the Dominion by section 91, sub-section 24, of the \"British North America Act,\" which is as follows:\nIndians and lands reserved for the Indians. In the first session of the first Parliament of the Dominion the Senate and Commons of Canada adopted an address to Her late Majesty praying that she would be graciously pleased by and with the advice of Her Most Honourable Privy Council under the section 146 I have already referred to of the \"British North America Act,\" to unite Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory with the Dominion and to grant to the Parliament of Canada authority to legislate for their future welfare and good government, and assuring Her Majesty of the willingness of the Parliament of Canada to assume the duties and obligations of government and legislation as regarded those territories.\nIn that address a special paragraph relative to the Indians was inserted as follows:\nAnd furthermore, that, upon the transference of the territories in question to the Canadian Government, the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required for purposes of settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles which have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aborigines.\nIn pursuance of this address and the agreement of the Dominion with the Hudson Bay Company, arrived at with the concurrence of the British Government, for the surrender of those territories to Her Majesty, upon the understanding that upon their transfer to the Dominion the latter should pay the company \u00a3300,000, and also of an Act of the Imperial Parliament assented to on the 31st of July, 1868, they were transferred by an order in council on the 23rd June, 1870, to come into force on the then ensuing 15th of July.\nIt was supposed by many concerned in these proceedings that these territories extended over a very large part if not all of those lands now in the Province of Ontario and in part respect of which the treaty now in question was arrived at.\nThe Province of Manitoba was created out of part of the new acquisition of territory. A rebellion broke out there. It becomes necessary to send troops through a long stretch of wilderness forming part of the land in question on which only Indians dwelt or over which they roamed. Many of those who had risen in rebellion were partly of Indian blood. It was thus brought home to those who had to deal with such a situation that the sooner these Indians roaming over the lands looked upon by them as their land and across which the troops had been transported were settled with the better for Canada.\nPrior to this rising the negotiations pursuant to section 146 of the \"British North America Act,\" for British Columbia becoming a Province of Canada, had so taken shape that the terms of that project were practically settled. British Columbia thus became part of Canada from first of July, 1871. The terms of this acquisition imposed upon the Dominion the obligation to build within a few years the Canadian Pacific Railway which of necessity must pass through the same territory I have already referred to as having to be crossed fey the troops.\nContemporaneously with the progress of these events leading to these annexations to the Dominion a waggon road, known as the Dawson route, was built by the Dominion, through parts of the same territory to aid in travel to the North-West.\nIn the course of doing so, as well as of the transportation of troops, timber was cut and incidentally the land used as of right, and the Indians complained of these invasions of their territory and the incidental cutting of what they claimed was their timber.\nThe items allowed them, by the treaty, to soothe their wounded feelings in respect of these last mentioned grievances, form part of the claims now in question.\nThe chief items, however, are for the price paid for the extinction of what for want of a better term is spoken of as the Indian title, and of which in the case of The St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[41], at p. 54, Lord Watson said that\nthe tenure of the Indians was a personal and usufructary right dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign.\nThe extinction of this Indian title, shadowy as it was, no doubt was a most substantial advantage to Ontario.\nBut what was there in that which of necessity would give to any one extinguishing it the legal right to be re-paid the money expended in bringing its extinction about?\nThe extinction of the Hudson's Bay Company's title was directly and indirectly of tenfold more importance to Ontario.\nThe removal of that shadow from Ontario's title paved the way for the removal of the other.\nIf benefits derived from acts of, and money expended by, government were to be held, without more, a legal basis for directing re-payment to the government of money or part of money expended, a share of the \u00a3300,000 paid the Hudson Bay Co. might as well be held due. Then where would the matter end? Where should the line be drawn? It is not pretended that there was anything said or done on behalf of Ontario that induced the Government of the Dominion to move in the matter of negotiating the Indian treaty; nor is it pretended that there was any actionable legal obligation resting on the Dominion towards Ontario to discharge this burthen; nor can it be maintained that, in the largest sense which a trust can have in law such as indicated by Lord Selborne in Kinloch v. Secretary of State for India[42], at pp. 625 and 626, in truth a trust existed out of which or the execution of it or something incident to such execution of it, there could arise a legal or equitable claim to be repaid by any one money expended as the moneys in question were expended; nor can it be claimed now, even if there was some reason for claiming so before the decision of the St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[43], that the Indian title passed to the Dominion; nor can it be as put in an argument I may not have properly grasped, that, as the land thus freed has been from time to time occupied by Ontario as the Indians receded in consequence of being compensated, Ontario has become under some legal obligation as a result thereof; nor can it be that the Dominion erred through ignorance of any of the facts that bore on the matter in any way, upon discovery of which by any imaginable circuity of actions for which this may be taken as a substitute it could recover for money paid by mistake.\nI confess I seem to myself chasing shadows for the utmost pressure could not induce any one in argument to put the claim on any legal principle of law or equity that is usually recognizable. I have tried to reduce what was said as possibly falling within any of these possible or impossible grounds. In light of the details of the history of which I have given only an outline, the agency theory put forward, I respectfully submit, seems altogether without foundation in law or fact.\nSo far from acting as an agent or as representing another, not only was the Dominion by virtue of its obligations to British Columbia and by other reasons of interest and duty which I will advert to later on, impelled to settle with the Indians, but was also so careful to exclude any such notion that it purposely awaited, as the report of the Minister of the Interior shews, its entering into contractual relations with Ontario on the very subject of these lands pending the negotiations of the treaty until after it had been finally agreed to.\nThe boundary between Ontario and Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory had never been well defined. The Hudson Bay Company's claims covered nearly, if not the entire, land that became the subject of this North-West Angle Treaty, No. 3.\nAs things turned out Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory covered, according to the judgment appealed from, about two-fifths and Ontario three-fifths of that land.\nThe matter of fixing this boundary of Ontario was ultimately referred, by the parties hereto, to arbitration and determined by an award made on the 3rd of August, 1878.\nThe negotiations leading to this result were begun in July, 1871, and continued for some years before the arbitrators were appointed.\nOn the 26th July, 1874, the parties hereto entered into an agreement for the establishment of a conventional boundary pending the ultimate result of the determination of the true boundary and for the issuing of patents for lands on either side of this conventional boundary; those to the east and south thereof to be issued by the Government of Ontario, and those to the west and north thereof to be issued by the Dominion Government, and that when the true boundaries had been definitely adjusted each government should confirm such patents as had been issued by the other and should also account for the proceeds of such lands as the true boundaries when determined might shew to belong of right to the other.\nBut why if it ever had been supposed that in any event any such claims as those now set up could be conceivable were they not provided for when the parties concerned were dealing with what was the actual corrollary of the very transactions which had so recently given rise to such claims, if at all possible?\nAnd above all why should such a claim be recovered in a judgment founded, as that appealed from appears to be, on the assertion of the rights this very agreement gives rise to? The one was deliberately adopted and we are left to infer the other was either not supposed to exist or almost as deliberately abandoned.\nIf ever such a claim as now set up had arisen in law it existed then, and if a court had existed to try it and this action could conceivably have been brought then I venture to think the considerations I have adverted to would have furnished a complete answer thereto.\nIt may be interesting to follow its later history.\nIt is alleged Ontario entered into possession and therefore must pay. It always had been in possession. Its civil laws and administration of justice reigned over it all. The administration of criminal justice so far as needed devolved upon that province. Its inhabitants hunted and fished there as well as the Indians, and when the cloud was removed the duty devolved, as of course, on its government to facilitate the land's development. It is alleged the land had turned out rich in minerals and timber. Is the obligation one turning upon the nature of the soil? Or would it not exist if timber and gold had not been found there, but only a vast barren waste?\nNor did the province come to the court seeking aid as against the Dominion or any one else to recover possession of the lands in question. The province did nothing but discharge those duties of government of which settling, selling, leasing or improving lands are in new countries such expensive, but common, incidents. It is not the case of an individual who could refrain from acting or accepting. The duty which arose, the only duty the province owed the Dominion, was to do all these things when given a chance.\nWe have not, therefore, any ground upon which to say that in seeking equity it must do equity.\nIndeed, the province has not yet got any actual, but only in a limited legal sense, possession of much of the land over which the Indian roams in his hunting and fishing as he had done before. His reserves, of a more limited character, are not yet finally selected. If, contrary to my impressions, any contract could be implied as suggested in the argument I have already referred to, from the Dominion doing something and the province entering into and accepting that, it has not yet been completed, for the contract of 1894, hereinafter referred to, defines how that is to be done, and it appears it is not yet done.\nBut we are told the liability has been already passed upon by the judgment of the Privy Council in a dictum found in the case of The St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[44].\nIt seems to me there are two answers to this: One that it is mere dictum; and the other that the parties concerned by their action I am about to refer to so recognized it and proceeded to agree upon such an entirely different view of it from that now pressed by one of them that it is hardly open to the respondent to rely much on such a contention.\nLet us appreciate the true value of that dictum for our present purpose by considering what happened.\nThe boundary award, after confirmation by the Privy Council to which it was submitted, was confirmed by the parties hereto under such circumstances as I need not state in detail, but finally so in 1883.\nIn that year the Dominion Government issued a license to the St. Catharines Milling Co. to cut timber on the land found by this award to have been part of the Province of Ontario and also forming part of the land over which the Indian title had been extinguished by the said Treaty No. 3.\nOntario claimed the land in question fell within section 109 of the \"British North America Act,\" and hence was the absolute property of that province and began in the name of the Crown a suit against the Milling Co. to restrain its cutting of timber there.\nThe Milling Co. asserted that by virtue of the surrender of the Indian title (to the Dominion as the claim was put) the Dominion was the absolute owner of the timber.\nThis suit already referred to was tried in 1885 by the learned Chancellor of Ontario and decided in favour of Ontario's contention.\nThe respondent was not a party to that suit. But when the case had passed through its various stages of trial, appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and an appeal to this court, with the result that each court maintained the contention of the present appellant in its claim that the timber belonged not to the present respondent, but to the appellant, it was carried by way of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nWhen the case reached there the now respondent, for the first time, asked leave to intervene, and the result of such application was that counsel for the present respondent were heard.\nNo change took place in the record raising new issues. The issue raised here was not and could not appear on that record.\nWe are told that sometime during the argument the counsel thus representing present respondent attempted unsuccessfully to introduce the question of the right of the Dominion to be recouped what it paid to the Indians to procure the extinction of the Indian title.\nIt appears from the judgment already referred to that counsel also set up the entirely different claim that the Indian title had been acquired by the Dominion, and hence possessed the property in the timber in question. In the closing part of the judgment of Lord Watson the following sentences occur: Seeing that the benefit of the surrender accrues to her, Ontario must of course relieve the Crown, and the Dominion, of all obligations involving the payment of money which were undertaken by Her Majesty, and which are said to have been in part fulfilled by the Dominion Government. There may be other questions behind, with respect to the right to determine to what extent, and at what periods, the disputed territory, over which the Indians still exercise their avocations of hunting and fishing, is to be taken up for settlement or other purposes, but none of these questions are raised for decision in the present suit.\nThis has been pressed strongly upon us as an authoritative exposition of the law if not an absolute decision of the actual point raised in this case.\nOn such a case as and so presented can we accept as binding the dictum I have quoted from the judgment of Lord Watson?\nIt does not seem to me we can escape by that easy means the responsibility resting upon us.\nThe case as presented to us was not before the Judicial Committee; the arguments now presented were not possible for full presentation there, and the limitations that bind our jurisdiction were not and could not be, so far as I can see, present to the mind of that court.\nIf it had been intended by the court to have it held as binding I would have expected in the later case of The Ontario Mining Co. v. Seybold[45], to have found direct language to the effect that such had been the declared result or at all events was then the opinion of the court. The language used falls far short of any such thing;\nI infer that on this latter occasion the court neither felt bound by the dictum nor quite sure that it contained that exposition of the law which it would expect to be observed by us as matter of course. With great respect I venture to submit that the expression in the first sentence of the dictum \"must, of course, relieve the Crown, and the Dominion'' does not indicate (if I am permitted to draw an inference from the habitual accuracy of the writer) that consideration had been had to the peculiarity that it was as the representative of the Crown that Ontario had succeeded.\nIt indicates clearly enough, I submit, that the peculiar limits of our jurisdiction to decide between two (shall I say departments of government or branches of sovereignty), of which each represented the Crown, had not been fully and finally considered, much less the definite, character of the obligation, if any.\nI conclude that we have a duty to discharge and are not relieved by this dictum, which must be held obiter, yet received with that respect due to the first impressions of such high authority, and given due consideration.\nFollowing the decision in that case and the dictum now rested upon came an agreement entered into on the 16th of April, 1894, between the parties hereto, not hastily, not as part of routine work of departments of the Government, when attention had not been drawn to the full import of the step taken, but as the deliberate result of each government and of Parliament and legislature having given due consideration thereto.\nThis agreement on its face purports to be in pursuance of the Statute of Canada passed in the 54th and 55th years of Her Majesty's reign, chaptered 5, and the Statute of Ontario passed in the 54th year of Her Majesty's reign, chaptered 3. It is provided by the first operative clause of it that as the Crown lands in the surrendered territory have been decided to belong to Ontario or Her Majesty in right of said province, the Indian rights of hunting and fishing, throughout the tract surrendered, not including the reserves to be made thereunder, do not continue so far as regards lands required for settlement, lumbering, mining and other purposes, by the Government of Ontario, \"and that the concurrence of the Province of Ontario is required in the selection of the said reserves.\"\nThe 6th paragraph is as follows:\nThat any future treaties with the Indiana in respect of territory in Ontario to which they have not before the passing of the said statutes surrendered their claim aforesaid, shall be deemed to require the concurrence of the Government of Ontario.\nNot a word appears in this agreement in regard to these claims now made, though, if due to-day they had been for great part, if not the most part, then due for twenty-one years. One might have expected them if weak originally, to have attained their majority and full strength and to speak then or forever be silent when an abandonment so complete and utter of all old contentions was about to be thus deliberately made.\nThe dictum now relied upon had then been standing before all concerned for about six years, with the rights of the parties fully cleared up. But nothing is done for nearly eight years more.\nThen when the case of Ontario Mining Co. v. Seybold[46] was pending before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the Dominion was represented by counsel, besides those representing the parties, the dictum, I have no doubt, was pressed and evoked the reply I have already referred to.\nSix months after we have these claims now in question presented for the first time and action brought.\nLeaving out of view one thing to which I will advert later on, what would be said of such a claim if presented by one private individual as against another at such a length of time from its origin and with such a history of opportunities to put it forward yet kept in abeyance?\nThe probable answer to this question may be left to meet and cover the rather vague, but wide and persistent, demands for a kind of justice that does not fall within the narrow limits of the law.\nI think we must, to appreciate the legal nature of this claim, have regard above all else to the terms of the \"British North America Act\" and understand the obligations arising thereunder and resting upon each actor and their relations to each other, and especially so in regard to these matters antecedent to the origin of the claim.\nThe case as it presents itself to my mind is that the Dominion was assigned by the \"British North America Act,\" sec. 91, sub-sec. 24, quoted above, the high, honourable, and onerous duties' of the guardians of the many races of Indians then within or that might at any future time fall within the borders of Canada; that these duties were to be discharged as occasion called for, having in mind always the peace, order and good government of Canada and, as part and parcel thereof and not the least factor in promoting all implied therein, the due observance of those duties towards the Indians, which the policy of the British Crown had rendered of paramount importance; that the discharging, in a statesmanlike way, when the several occasions I have recited called for, these high duties of national importance they were discharged all the better by being freed from the trammels of being confined within the narrow views that the provincial range of vision might have restricted action to, if the needs and wishes of a single province were to be considered, or even the dominant factor used as a guide, perhaps to the detriment of national interests; and that there arose on the part of Ontario no contractual or equitable obligation enforceable in a suit at law to make good any moneys expended in the way claimed. Nay, more, I am unable to see how short of an express understanding there ever could have arisen from the discharge by the Dominion of its responsibilities under sub-section 24 any such legal liability on the part of any province.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, the cross-appeal be dismissed and the judgment for appellant on its counterclaim stand.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDuff J.\u2014The \"Exchequer Court Act\" confers upon that court jurisdiction to decide a controversy such as this. It says nothing about the rule to be applied in reaching a decision; but it is not to be supposed that (acting as a court) that court is to proceed only upon such views as the judge of the court may have concerning what (in the circumstances presented to him) it would be fair and just and proper that one or the other party to the controversy should do. I think that in providing for the determination of controversies the Act speaks of controversies about rights; pre-supposing some rule or principle according to which such rights can be ascertained; which rule or principle could, it should seem, be no other than the appropriate rule or principle of law. I think we should not presume that the Exchequer Court has been authorized to make a rule of law for the purpose of determining such a dispute; or to apply to such a controversy a rule or principle prevailing in one locality when, according to accepted principles, it should be determined upon the law of another locality. This view of the functions of the court under the Act does not so circumscribe those functions as greatly to re- strict the beneficial operation of the statute. Whatever the right of the Dominion in such a case as the present it is difficult to see how the province could (apart from the statute and without its consent given in the particular case) be brought before any court to answer the Dominion's claim. The statute referred to and the correlative statute of the province once for all give a legal sanction to such proceedings, and provide a tribunal (where none existed) by which, at the instance of either of them, their reciprocal rights and obligations touching any dispute may be ascertained and authoritatively declared.\nThe claim which is made in this action is that Ontario shall be declared to be liable to indemnify the Dominion in respect of the money payments assumed by the Dominion on behalf of the Crown under the treaty in question. In the view I take of the case it will not be necessary to distinguish the different undertakings. I think the claim fails in toto.\nThe learned trial judge, who has in part sustained the Dominion contention bases the liability upon this reasoning. He says it is a settled principle of law of England that where a person having the legal title to land and believing himself to be the true owner, makes improvements at his own expense, the equitable owner suing for possession and mesne profits in a court of equity may be compelled to make, as against his claim for mesne profits, an allowance for the cost of the improvements so made. That principle, he thinks (by reason of the counterclaim of the Dominion) comes into operation here.\nAssuming this principle applicable in the circumstances, I am unable to follow the learned judge in the reasoning by which it is made the basis of his judgment. The receipts for which the Dominion is asked to account amount, roughly speaking, to something like $150,000. The judgment imposes upon Ontario a liability which, as regards past payments, is much greater than this sum and consequentially establishes an obligation extending to payments which may be spread over an indefinite period in future. That is a form of relief far beyond any mere allowance by way of set-off and is an extension of the principle invoked for which with great respect I can see no warrant.\nBut the rule has, I think, no sort of application to this case.\nAdmittedly the benefit of the treaty expenditures in part accrued to the Dominion. Admittedly, at the time they were made, the Dominion had full notice of Ontario's claim to the territory. In this state of facts the agreement on which the counterclaim is based was made that is to say, after the obligation to make the expenditures had under the treaty been incurred, and while the claim of Ontario to the territory was being actively asserted; and that agreement is silent upon the treaty obligations. With full knowledge of the equity, so called, which is now set up the Dominion undertook by an unqualified undertaking to account to Ontario for the sums now claimed by that province. Observe now that for our present purpose ex hypothesi the claims asserted by the Dominion were of such a character that in respect of them, independently of the alleged right of set-off, no liability rested upon Ontario. I cannot then imagine anything more repugnant to equity than to say in these circumstances, to the province: This agreement of yours cannot be enforced until you have satisfied claims of the Dominion (otherwise unenforceable) which were fully known to the Dominion at the time the agreement was made, but were not asserted until twenty years afterwards. The parties agreed irrespective of the alleged equities that in the contingency which occurred the payments should be made. The court is asked to declare that the Dominion is not liable to make these payments except upon the terms of satisfying those self-same unenforceable equities. If this, the true meaning of the parties had been put in words as I have put it, the true effect of the contention I am dealing with would at once appear, viz., that the court is asked, in order to give effect to these claims, to reform the bargain between the parties.\nOn the argument Mr. Newcombe supported the judgment upon other grounds.\nFirst, he broadly asserts the right of the Dominion upon the principle (recognized in the civil law and applied by Story J. in Bright v. Boyd[47]) under which a bon\u00e2 fide possessor of real estate believing himself to be the true owner is entitled as against the owner seeking to recover possession to be repaid the sums paid by him in discharging an encumbrance.\nThe principle thus broadly stated has, as the learned judge says, no place in English law or in the law of Ontario except in the qualified sense of certain statutes which have no application here. It cannot, therefore, I think, be applied to this case because such a claim would plainly be governed by the lex situs.\nBut, assuming the principle to be applicable, consider briefly in the light of the evidence the circumstances which led to the treaty. The learned judge thus recounts them:\nThe question of obtaining the surrender of the Indian title in the lands described in the North-West Angle Treaty No. 3, was in 1870, when Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were admitted to the union, a very urgent and pressing one, not because such lands were at that time required or deemed to be desirable or available for settlement, but because it was necessary for the good government of the country to open up and maintain through such lands a line or way of communication between the eastern and settled portions of Canada and the great and fertile western territory that was added to the Dominion. At that time a line of communication, known as the Dawson Route, was being opened up through such lands. During the summer of that year it became necessary to send through this territory a military force to maintain the Queen's authority, and establish order in the country about the Red River. Early in the year the Government of Canada had sent an agent to Fort Frances \"to keep up a friendly intercourse\" with the chiefs and Indians who assembled there, and to \"disabuse their minds of any idle reports they might hear as to the views and intentions of the Government of Canada in reference to them.\" In May the government sent Mr. Simpson to the same place to secure from the Salteaux Indians a right-of-way for the troops and to prevent any interruption of surveying parties during the summer. The demands that the Indians made were considered so excessive that Mr. Simpson did not come to any agreement with them. They, however, stated that it was not their intention to try and stop the troops from passing through their lands on their way to the Red River, but that if Mr. Dawson was to make roads through their country they expected to be paid for the right-of-way. In the next year another attempt was made to arrive at a settlement with these Indians. But on this occasion it was not a question of obtaining merely a right-of-way through their lands, but of acquiring a surrender of the Indian title therein so that such lands would be open for settlement; By a commission issued under the Great Seal of Canada, and bearing date the 27th of April, 1871, and in which it was recited that the Indian title in the lands therein mentioned had not been extinguished, and that such lands were required for settlement, Her late Majesty appointed Mr. Simpson, Mr. Dawson and Mr. Pither commissioners to make a treaty with the several bands of the Ojibeway tribe of Indians occupying and claiming the lands in that portion of her North-Western Territory lying and being between Lake Shebandowan and the North-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods. The commissioners, as appears from their report of the 11th day of July, 1871, entered into negotiations with the Indians and settled, as they thought, \"all past claims\" that the Indians had, but \"various causes prevented them from entering into a formal and permanent arrangement\" with the Indians at that time. On the 20th day of July, 1871, by an order in council passed on the 16th day of May in that year, British Columbia was admitted into the union. By the terms of the union the Government of Canada, among t)ther things, undertook to construct a railway \"to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada.\" That involved the construction of a railway through the lands for the surrender of the Indian title in which the Government of Canada was in that year negotiating. It afforded another reason, if another were needed, for the early extinguishment of such title. It is put forward on behalf of Ontario that the conclusion of a treaty with these Indians was a prime necessity in the carrying out of the railway policy necessary to implement the agreement of the Dominion with the Province of British Columbia. That the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway would in the course of time have made it necessary to extinguish the Indian title in these lands, or at least in so much thereof as was needed for a right-of-way through the same, cannot admit of doubt. But it is not at all clear that this matter was in 1871 pressing or urgent if anything were thought to turn upon that point. But it is, it seems to me, clear that for a number of reasons, either relating or deemed by the Government of Canada to relate, to the administration of the affairs of the Dominion, it was at the time necessary that the Indian title in these lands should be extinguished.\nThis latter the evidence clearly shews was only a means to an end. It was deemed advisable to provide a passage through this territory for immigrants into the newly acquired North-West. It was necessary if the obligations of the Dominion undertaken in the terms of union with British Columbia were to be fulfilled to arrange for the immediate commencement and prosecution of. the construction of a line of railway between Eastern Canada and that province. These were objects of Dominion policy affecting the Dominion as a whole. To attain these objects it was necessary to induce the Indians to abandon their pretensions to occupy the whole territory in question to the exclusion of whites and to settle on more limited reservations. Upon this necessity the Dominion acted, hence the treaty.\nThe traditional policy in Canada respecting the Indians themselves pointed in the same direction. That policy was that when the progress of advancing settlement brought with it danger of collision between white settlers and Indians still in a savage and pagan state, to induce, if possible, the Indians to settle on limited areas and by slow degrees to lead them into the ways of civilized life. The responsibility in respect of all these matters is by the \"British North America Act\" cast upon the Dominion; and it is quite clear, I think, that if in the judgment of the Dominion apart from the considerations of policy above mentioned the time had arrived when in the interests of the Indian as well as of the settlers and to secure tranquillity, this Course was to be taken\u2014the evidence leaves no room for doubt that an essential condition of success would be that the rights the Indians believed they possessed in the larger area should be given up; and, that in order to procure the surrender of those rights something in the nature of compensation must have bi\u00eaen promised, as always had been done in previous arrangements of the same character. The acquisition of the Indian title was not, I should think, in itself even in the slightest degree at that time an object of Dominion policy. Not until a date much later than the treaty does it appear to have occurred to anybody that the Dominion had acquired any territorial rights under the treaty. The surrender of the Indian interest was in truth a mere incident in a large policy looking to the settlement of that part of Canada lying between the Great Lakes and the Pacific, the prosecution of which necessarily required an arrangement with these Indians after the traditional practice.\nIn these circumstances, I cannot conceive on what principle a court of equity could proceed to adjust equitably as between the Dominion and the province the burden of the obligations undertaken by the former. It is a case very different from the simple case of the extinction by payment of a pecuniary charge; that there should be a right of indemnity in such a case is at least intelligible. Here we have a usufruct which, conceived as mere burden on the title, cannot be appraised; and we have the case of a petitioner who, to serve his own ends, to meet his own obligations, to protect his own interests, has been obliged to procure the surrender of the burden, and who, to procure that surrender, has, without consulting the owners, compounded for it in money on his own terms. Has a court of equity any rule or principle which will serve to effect a just distribution between the owner and the petitioner of the burden?\nOr if we add, as we must to complete the parallel, that these ends, obligations and interests have no special relation to any interest in the land and that everything is done pending an active dispute with the true owner concerning the title and that the petitioner is not in possession\u2014at all events has no better possession than the owner\u2014can there really be any principle of justice upon which it can be averred that the whole of the burdens thus assumed by the petitioner must be borne by the true owner?\nI think Mr. Newcombe's argument mainly rested, however, on his contention that in concluding the treaty and, therefore, in undertaking the obligations referred to the Dominion acted as the agent of Ontario. This contention was based on three grounds which are: 1st, the acquiescence of Ontario; 2nd, ratification by Ontario; and 3rd, a constitutional agency arising out of the powers and duties with which the Dominion is invested and burdened by the \"British North America Act.\"\nOf the first and second of the three grounds it is, I think, enough to say that the Dominion did not in concluding the treaty profess to act as the agent of Ontario and that the treaty having been concluded Ontario did nothing but accept what has been declared to be the legal result of it irrespective of any action or inaction on her part. In these circumstances it is difficult to see how in any sense germane to the question of the existence or non-existence of agency either acquiescence or ratification can be imputed to the province.\nThe third ground raises a question of the utmost general importance. It is a question which, I think, must be answered in a sense opposed to Mr. Newcombe's contention. It is, I think, true\u2014as Mr. Newcombe argues\u2014that the Dominion alone was competent to authorize the treaty in question. In that matter the Dominion, in other words, represented the authority of the Crown. But in what sense was the Dominion the agent of Ontario? I think the argument seems to come to this, that because the whole authority of the Crown in respect of the Indians and the Indian lands is committed to the Dominion, the Dominion may in the course of exercising that authority in the prosecution of Dominion policy conceived in the interest of the Dominion as a whole undertake on behalf of a province without its consent and thereby effectively bind the province to an obligation involving the payment of money. That is a far-reaching proposition, and one which I think cannot be maintained.\nThe Crown on the advice of the Legislature of a province (acting within the limits prescribed by the \"British North America Act\") may authorize the undertaking on behalf of the province of a financial or other obligation. I do not think the Act creates any other agency having authority to fasten upon a province as such any such obligation. The view advanced on behalf of the Dominion, as I have just indicated it, is, of course, the negation of this; but, as I conceive, that view is incompatible with the true view of the status of the provinces under the \"British North America Act.\"\nThe status is thus explained by Lord Watson who, speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee in The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. The Receiver General of New Brunswick[48], at pp. 441 and 442, said:\nThe object of the Act was neither to weld the provinces into one, nor to subordinate provincial governments to a central authority, but to create a federal government in which they should all be represented, entrusted with the exclusive administration of affairs in which they had a common interest, each province retaining its independence and autonomy. That object was accomplished by distributing, between the Dominion and the provinces, all powers executive and legislative, and all public property and revenues which had previously belonged to the provinces; so that the Dominion Government should be vested with such of these powers, property, and revenues as were necessary for the due performance of its constitutional functions, and that the remainder should be retained by the provinces for the purposes of provincial government * * *.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the provincial legislature of New Brunswick does not occupy the subordinate position which was ascribed to it in the argument of the appellants. It derives no authority from the Government of Canada, and its status is in no way analogous to that of a municipal institution which is an authority constituted for purposes of local administration. It possesses powers, not of administration merely, but of legislation, in the strictest sense of that word; and, within the limits assigned by section 92 of the Act of 1867, these powers are exclusive and supreme.\nThe independence of the provinces as regards their control of the property and revenues appropriated to them by the Act has been emphasized in a series of decisions; and it has been frequently pointed out that the parts of the Act in which property and revenues are declared to \"belong to\" or to be \"the property of\" the provinces import simply that the public property and revenues referred to while continuing to be vested in the Crown are made subject to the exclusive disposition of the provincial legislatures. Thus Lord Watson in St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[49], at p. 5.6:\nIn construing these enactments it must always he kept in view that, wherever public land with its incidents is described as \"the property of\" \"or as \"belonging to\" the Dominion or a province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use, or to its proceeds, has been appropriated to the Dominion or to the province, as the case may be, and is subject to the control of its legislature, the land itself being vested in the Crown * * *.\nAnd again at pp. 57 and 58:\nThe enactments of section 109 are, in the opinion of their lordships, sufficient to give to each province, subject to the administration and control of its own legislature, the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in all lands within its boundaries which at the time of the union were vested in the Crown, with the exception of such lands as the Dominion acquired right to under section 108, or might assume for the purposes specified in section 117. Its legal effect is to exclude from the \"duties and revenues\" appropriated to the Dominion, all the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown arising within the provinces.\nIn Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[50] Lord Selborne referring to the section just mentioned uses these words:\nThe general subject of the whole section is of a high political nature; it is the attribution of Royal territorial rights, for purposes of revenue and government to the provinces in which they are situate, or arise.\nAnd in the Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Ontario et al.[51] Lord Herschell delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee after a full argument in which all the provinces participated, said, at pp. 709 and 710:\nIt must also be borne in mind that there is a broad distinction between proprietary rights and legislative jurisdiction. The fact that such jurisdiction in respect of a particular subject-matter is conferred on the Dominion Legislature, for example, affords no evidence that any proprietary rights with respect to it were transferred to the Dominion. There is no presumption that because legislative jurisdiction was vested in the Dominion Parliament proprietary rights were transferred to it. The Dominion of Canada was called into existence by the British North America Act, 1867. Whatever proprietary rights were at the time of the passing of that Act possessed by the provinces remain vested in them except such as are by any of its express enactments transferred to the Dominion of Canada.\nAnd again at p. 713:\nIf, however, the legislature purports to confer upon others proprietary rights where it possesses none itself, that in their lordships' opinion is not an exercise of the legislative jurisdiction conferred by section 91. If the contrary were held, it would follow that the Dominion might practically transfer to itself property which has, by the British North America Act, been left to the provinces and not vested in it. I am unable to reconcile these views touching the constitutional position of the provinces and the measure of control conferred upon the provincial legislatures respecting the property and revenues vested in them with the contention that the grant to the Dominion of legislative power in respect of the subjects enumerated in section 91 implies the right in the exercise of that power to dispose, indirectly (without the consent of the provincial legislatures) of such properties and revenues by fastening upon the provinces without any such consent obligations of a financial character. This view, if accepted, would, I think, be simply destructive of what Lord Watson in the passage quoted above describes as \"the independence and autonomy of the provinces.\"\nIt remains to consider the observation of Lord Watson in the course of the judgment delivered in The St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[52], and that of Strong C.J. in the Robinson Treaty Case[53]. The observation of Strong C.J. (being a dictum founded upon the observation of Lord Watson) will not require separate consideration.\nThe observation of Lord Watson forms, I think, no part of the decision of the Privy Council. The question which it touches upon was not raised upon the record nor discussed at the hearing or considered by the learned trial judge; it was neither raised nor considered before this court; it was not argued as one of the points in dispute before the Judicial Committee. The formal judgment of that tribunal does not mention it. These circumstances in themselves are, I think, sufficient to shew that it cannot be treated as a term of the judgment in favour of the province; and as the consideration of any equities between the province and the Dominion arising ont of the obligations assumed by the Dominion under the treaty was, obviously, not regarded by Lord Watson as in any way germane to the sole question decided (and the sole question litigated)\u2014the legal title to the lands affected by the surrender\u2014it should seem that the remark in question ought not to be regarded as indicating one of the grounds on which the decision proceeded.\nIt is, I suppose, needless to say that any observation of Lord Watson whether strictly authoritative or not (even a passing expression of opinion) is entitled to and would always receive the most careful and respectful consideration of this court; but when such an observation is addressed to an unargued question depending to some extent upon the consideration of facts and circumstances not brought to the attention of the court one cannot, I think, relieve one's self from one's responsibility by treating it as immediately decisive.\nThere are two reasons why, with great respect, I think the dictum in question should not govern our decision in this case. The first is based upon the circumstance I have just mentioned, viz., that the facts now before us were not all before the Privy Council in the St. Catharines Milling Go. Case[54], and even upon such as were before them there was no argument touching their bearing upon the point now in issue.\nThe second is that it is, I think, at least doubtful whether Lord Watson was in that observation intending to pass upon any question of legal right. The question of the legal right of the Dominion to indemnity from the province had not, as I have said, been litigated; and it was consequently still open to the Dominion to raise it in another proceeding. I do not think that in these circumstances Lord Watson could have intended to anticipate the action of the courts in respect of a question which they might be called upon to decide in an appropriate proceeding and commit the Judicial Committee to an opinion upon it in a proceeding in which that question had not been discussed. The preferable view of the import of the remark seems to be that upon the facts as they appeared as a matter of fair dealing Ontario would be expected to assume the obligations in question. In the view I have expressed concerning the functions of the Exchequer Court in deciding controversies such as this, such an opinion, even if one should not, upon a consideration of all the circumstances, differ from it, would not be conclusive of this appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed without costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Tanguay, (1909) 42 S.C.R. 133\nDate: 1909-05-04\nPrice Brothers & Co. (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nPierre Tanguay and another (Defendants) Respondents.\n1909: March 10; 1909: May 4.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Rivers and streams\u2014Right of floating logs\u2014 Servitude\u2014Faculty or license\u2014Possessory action\u2014Injunction\u2014 Matter in controversy\u2014Practice\u2014Costs.\nIn the Province of Quebec the privilege of floating timber down watercourses, in common with others, is not a predial servitude nor does it confer an exclusive right of property in respect of which a possessory action would lie, and, in a case where the only controversy relates to the exercise of such a privilege, the Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.\nThe appeal was quashed without costs as the objection to the jurisdiction was not taken by the respondents in the manner provided by the Rules of Practice.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montmagny, (Larue J.) and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe plaintiffs complained that they were impeded in the right to drive logs down the course of a river and brought suit for a declaration of their right to do so, for an injunction and an order for the removal of a movable boom placed across the river by the defendants. No claim was made for damages.\nThe final judgment on the merits of the case, delivered by Mr. Justice Larue at the trial, declared that the parties had, according to law, the common right of using the river for the transmission of timber, subject to the obligation, the one towards the other, of respecting the free exercise of that right, made absolute the interlocutory injunction issued in the case on the 8th of June, 1906, and ordered that the defendants should afford free passage down the river for the plaintiffs' timber. The plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs, and their right of further action to recover damages was reserved to them. By the judgment appealed from the Court of King's Bench reversed the judgment at the trial, set aside the injunction and order, and dismissed the action with costs, Boss\u00e9 and Blanchet JJ. dissenting.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. appeared for the appellants.\nA. Lemieux K.C. and Ernest Roy for the respondents.\nDuring the hearing of the appeal the court, of its own motion, raised a question as to its jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, and, after hearing counsel upon that question, reserved judgment and enlarged the hearing on the merits of the case until the question of jurisdiction had been disposed of. The question was whether or not, under the above circumstances, the court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nAt the following session of the court the appeal was quashed for want of jurisdiction, the judgment of the court being rendered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014At the argument a question of jurisdiction was raised by the court. It appeared by the statement of counsel on the opening that the appellant company are the owners of timber limits and of a saw-mill on the Rivi\u00e8re du Sud in the County of Montmagny, Quebec; that they were prevented from exercising their right to drive logs cut on the limits to the mill (a distance of several miles) by a boom stretched across the river by the respondents, riparian proprietors on the same river, between the limits above and the mill below, and this action is brought complaining of this infringement of their rights. The appellants ask for a declaration that they are entitled to float their logs from the limits to the mill and for an order on the defendants to cease troubling them and for the removal of the obstruction, a movable boom. The appellants' right to float logs down the river is not denied by the respondents. The only question for us to decide is whether or not, on these facts, we have jurisdiction to hear this case. There is no question of future rights or of title to property at issue in my opinion. The right of the riparian owner to use the water which passes by or crosses over his property for the purposes mentioned in art. 503 C.C. is not involved either in this appeal. Appellants' counsel in answer to the objection made by the court put forward the contention that this is a possessory action and that we have jurisdiction to hear it and Delisle v. Arcand[1], was referred to. It was held in that case that we have jurisdiction to hear a possessory action because in such an action titles are in issue in a secondary manner. In the same case it was decided, when the case was finally disposed of on the merits[2], that the possessory action lies only in favour of persons in exclusive possession \"\u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire.\"\nThis is not a possessory action; it is merely an action on the case for a nuisance infringing plaintiffs' rights and there is no claim made for actual ascertained damages. The plaintiffs have no exclusive right of property in the running waters of this natural stream and they have no right to the use of them beyond that enjoyed by the general public. This is not a right of use such as is provided for in arts. 487 and 381 C.C.\nCurasson, \"Action possessoire,\" p. 150:\nL'action possessoire ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu'autant que la prescription afin d'acqu\u00e9rir ou de perdre un droit immobilier peut r\u00e9sulter de la possession.\nIn France it is settled law that the waters of such a stream are of the class of things which have no owner and the use of which is common to all (res communes) and there can be no possession of the running waters of a stream in its natural state which could lead to prescription and give rise to a possessory action. Dalloz, 1891,1, 291.\nPothier (ed. Buquet), vol. 9, p. 13:\nLe fluide, l'eau prise comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment, est une chose commune qui appartient \u00e0 tous les hommes sans qu'aucun puisse s'en dire le propri\u00e9taire tant qu'elle reste en cet \u00e9tat.\nGirard, \"Droit Romain,\" p. 338: Les res communes (v.g. l'air, l'eau) sont celles qui sont \u00e0 l'usage de tous les hommes parce qu'elles \u00e9chappent \u00e0 toute appropriation priv\u00e9e,\nand article 585 C.C.\nIn the Province of Quebec it has been held that the public have a right to all the advantages which a river in its natural state and its banks can afford but there can be no exclusive right of property or of user in the running waters of a natural stream which can only be appropriated by severance. M.C. arts. 868, 891. McBean v. Carlisle[3]; Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Light Co.[4]. This right, or rather this faculty or license which the public enjoy, because it is not properly a right, non jus sed fas, has been called at times a servitude; Atkinson v. Couture[5], and Ward v. Township of Grenville[6]; but, I respectfully and with much deference submit, improperly. There can be no servitude over a thing which is not susceptible of becoming the object of a private right of property or the use of which can only be enjoyed by the individual claiming the right as one of the public.\nThis supposed right or privilege which is merely, I say, a faculty or license vested at common law in the general public has received formal legislative sanction in Quebec. Article 2972 R.S.Q.; 54 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 1; 4 Edw. VII. ch. 14, sec. 2. Subject to the right of the riparian owners to improve watercourses running or passing across their property these statutes authorise any person, firm or company, during the Spring, Summer or Autumn high waters to float and transmit timber, rafts, etc., down the rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and creeks in the Province of Quebec. But no exclusive right of possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire is conferred by them upon those who use the waters to drive their timber which could be the foundation of a possessory action.\nCarr\u00e9, vol. 1, p. 91;\nIl faut pouvoir maintenir qu'on poss\u00e8de la chose \u00e0 titre de ma\u00eetre non tanquam alienam, sed animo domini. Il faut aussi que la chose poss\u00e9d\u00e9e soit susceptible d'\u00eatre acquise par la prescription, c'est-\u00e0-dire par la continuation de la possession durant le laps de temps fix\u00e9 par la loi.\nSee arts. 2192, 2193 C.C.; 1064 C.P.Q. The principle may be briefly stated:\nPoint de possession, point de possessoire; il faut une possession qui \u00e0 la longue conduit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nNo public right can be acquired by private user.\nThere can be no possessory action where the plaintiff has not such possession as if enjoyed for a sufficient length of time would result in a title being acquired to the thing possessed by prescription. Running water is undoubtedly res communes. As there can be no exclusive possession of a thing that is at law the common property of all there can be no private right of property in the waters of this stream. The most interesting case on this subject is to be found reported in S.V. 1902, 2, 1, in a note to which Mr. Saleilles, the eminent French jurist, says (S.V. 1902, 2, 2):\nRemarquons enfin que les riverains qui usaient de ce droit de circulation \u00e0 travers les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines ne l'exer\u00e7aient pas \u00e0 titre de fait constitutif de servitude et susceptible de leur acqu\u00e9rir un droit sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 l'encontre des droits des autres propri\u00e9taires riverains, mais \u00e0 titre de simple facult\u00e9 rentrant dans le droit d'usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la communaut\u00e9, et ne pouvant fonder, \u00e0 rencontre d'autrui, ni possession ni prescription. Pour pouvoir donner lieu \u00e0 prescription, il aurait fallu que les faits de circulation pussent constituer un empi\u00e9tement sur le droit d'autrui, alors que, dans la pens\u00e9e de celui qui les exer\u00e7ait, et dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 juridique elle-m\u00eame, au moins dans le syst\u00e8me de la jurisprudence, ils n'\u00e9taient que l'exercice d'un droit. Id. p. 3. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, il n'est ni raisonnements ni fictions qui puissent porter atteinte \u00e0 cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de fait que les rivi\u00e8res sont par destination naturelle et sociale des moyens de circulation collective; et cela est vrai, m\u00eame des petites rivi\u00e8res incapables de se pr\u00eater \u00e0 une navigation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Si peu d'importance qu'elles soient, elles peuvent rendre encore quelques services qui ne sont pas de pur agr\u00e9ment, et qui profitent au flottage de certains mat\u00e9riaux, ou facilitent la rentr\u00e9e des r\u00e9coltes. Il faut prendre ces agents naturels tel qu'ils sont, en tant qu'ils sont ouverts \u00e0 tout le monde et qu'ils constituent un bien de la communaut\u00e9. L\u00e8s droits de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 individuelle ne peuvent pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 d\u00e9truire la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 commune.\nSee also M. Claro's note to same arr\u00eat reported in Dalloz 1902, 2, 201.\nThe same principles, in almost the same words, are laid down in Bell v. Corporation of Quebec[7].\nThe appeal should be quashed but without costs as the objection was not taken by the respondent as provided by the Rules of Practice.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Turgeon, Roy & Langlais.\n[1] 36 Can.

Power), (1909) 42 S.C.R. 140\nDate: 1909-05-10\nControverted Election for The Electoral District of Quebec West.\nWilliam Price (Respondent) Appellant;\nand\nEdward Neville, Junior (Petitioner) Respondent.\nWilliam Power (Respondent) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam Price (Cross-Petitioner) Respondent.\n1909: May 5; 1909: May 10.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE LANGELIER AND MCCORKILL J.\nElection law\u2014Election petition\u2014Preliminary objections\u2014Cross-petition\u2014Sufficiency of charge of corrupt acts\u2014-Particulars.\nBy a preliminary objection to an election petition it was claimed that the petitioner was not a person entitled to vote at the election and the next following objection charged that he had disqualified himself from voting by treating on polling day.\nHeld, that the second objection was not merely explanatory of the first but the two were separate and independent; that the second objection was properly dismissed as treating only disqualifies a voter after conviction and not ipso facto; and that the first objection should not have been dismissed the respondent to the petition being entitled to give evidence as to the status of the petitioner.\nThe respondent, by cross-petition, alleged that the defeated candidate personally and by agents \"committed acts and the offence of undue influence.\" Held, that it would have been desirable to state the facts relied on to establish the charge of undue influence but as these facts could be obtained by a demand for particulars a preliminary objection was properly dismissed.\nAPPEAL from judgments rendered, respectively, by Langelier C.J. and McCorkill J. in the Controverted Elections Court, in the matter of the controverted election of a member for the Electoral District of Quebec-West in the House of Commons of Canada.\nThe member returned as elected, Price, the respondent to the petition to avoid his election, appealed from the judgment of Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier C.J. maintaining a motion to quash his preliminary objections to the petition against his return and dismissing those objections with costs. On a counter-petition filed by Price, acts of corruption were charged against the defeated candidate, Power, and his disqualification was prayed for, and he appealed from the judgment of Mr. Justice McCorkill dismissing his preliminary objections to the counter-petition.\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment now reported.\nFlynn K.C. for the appellant and respondent, Price.\nC.E. Dorion K.C. for the respondent Neville, and the appellant Power.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin J.:\u2014The respondent to an election petition appeals from the judgment of Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier C.J. allowing a motion to quash preliminary objections taken by him to the petition. Upon the argument the court expressed its view that with the exception of the objections numbered 4 and 5, as to which judgment was reserved, the preliminary objections were properly quashed.\nObjections numbers 4 and 5 are as follows:\u2014\n4. Because the said petitioner is not a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates, and respondent expressly denies the allegations of paragraph one of petition.\n5. Because, moreover, the said petitioner had no right to vote at the said election, for the reason that he was then disqualified as such. voter by the fact that, on the polling day, he being an hotel-keeper, gave and caused to be given to numerous voters of the said Electoral District of Quebec-West, on account of such voters having voted, and being about to vote, drink and refreshments, and became thereby guilty of a corrupt practice consisting of treating on polling day.\nThe learned Chief Justice treated objection number 5 as merely a statement of the particular ground upon which the respondent intended to challenge the right of the petitioner to vote at the election, put in issue by objection number 4. He says: \"Le paragraphe 5 explique le paragraphe 4.\"\nSo treating it he held that if the allegation of fact made in the fifth objection were established, it would not prevent the petitioner from proceeding with his petition.\nWith great respect I am unable to agree in the view that paragraph 5 is merely an explanation or particularization of the lack of qualification to vote charged by paragraph 4. Paragraph 4 deals with an absence of qualification such as the omission of the voter's name from the voters' list. Paragraph 5 deals not with lack of qualification but with disqualification due to some act of the voter, which, although he otherwise possessed the requisite qualification of a voter, would invalidate any vote that he might cast. The introduction of the word \"moreover,\" in paragraph 5, makes it perfectly clear that by that paragraph the respondent intended to challenge the status of the petitioner upon a ground entirely distinct from that raised in paragraph 4.\nThe motion before the learned Chief Justice was in the nature of a demurrer and was disposed of without any evidence being taken to establish the facts alleged by the preliminary objections. The objections could properly be so disposed of only upon the assumption that if the facts alleged in them were proved they would not constitute valid objections to the petition. As to the allegation in paragraph 4 that\nthe said petitioner is not a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates,\nit is manifest from the mere statement of the objection that, if established, it would be fatal to the petitioner's status. The respondent is clearly entitled to have this objection disposed of on the merits. The motion to quash it should not have prevailed. I venture to think that it succeeded only because the learned Chief Justice construed paragraph 5 as a specification of the objection to the petitioner's status taken generally by paragraph 4.\nBut when we come to consider paragraph 5, the same authority which establishes the right of the respondent to raise these questions as to the status of the petitioner by preliminary objections\u2014The Cumberland Election Case[1]\u2014also establishes that such an objection as that taken in paragraph 5 would not if established render the petitioner ineligible. The judgment of Mr. Justice Girouard and that of Mr. Justice Davies, in which Mr. Justice Nesbitt concurred, determine that a corrupt practice such as that charged in the 5th paragraph disqualifies only from the date of a conviction of the offender by a court of competent jurisdiction or of a finding of such a court that the offence has been committed, and that a petitioner, though guilty of such an offence, is not a person who had not a right to vote at the election within the meaning of the section declaring the requisite qualifications of a petitioner. This decision is of course binding upon us.\nIt follows that the judgment in appeal must be sustained as to the 5th objection, but that, as to the 4th objection, it must be vacated. In view of the very limited extent of the appellant's success, there should be no costs to either party.\nThe respondent to a cross-petition appeals from the judgment of McCorkill J. dismissing his preliminary objections. The appeal is confined to the overruling of the 5th objection, which is in the following terms:\u2014\n5. The allegations contained in paragraph 11 of said petition do not disclose any actual act of undue influence and are in law insufficient to have the respondent declared guilty of such offence.\nParagraph 11 of the cross-petition is as follows:\u2014\n11. And your petitioner also says that the said William Power, during the said election, directly and indirectly, by himself and by his agents, with his actual knowledge, consent and privity, has committed acts and the offence of undue influence.\nWhile this paragraph is objectionable on the ground that it states a conclusion of law, and although it is no doubt desirable that a petitioner preferring a charge of undue influence should state the facts upon which he relies to establish the charge, it is manifest that these facts can readily be obtained by a demand for particulars, and where that is the case the taking of a preliminary objection upon such a ground should be discouraged. For this reason the learned judge overruled this objection. I think that in doing so he was well advised and that this appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal in Price v. Neville allowed in part without costs. Appeal in Power v. Price dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant and respondent, Price:E. J. Flynn.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Neville: Dorion &Marchand.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Power: Dorion &Marchand.\n[1] 36 Can. S.C.R. 542.\n",

Danjou v. Marquis, 3 Can. S.C.R. 258, referred to.\nMotion to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming the order made by Mathers J. committing the appellant to twelve months' imprisonment under the authority of the Manitoba Court of King's Bench, rule 755. A statement of the case is given in the judgments now reported.\nW. L. Scott supported the motion.\nTrueman contra. The Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is quashed with costs fixed at $50. I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nGirouard and Davies JJ. also agreed with Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014There is not sufficient resemblance in the language establishing or the scope and purpose of the establishment of the respective courts of appeal in England and Ontario to that in the Supreme Court Act defining our jurisdiction to render the cases cited to us relative to the distinctions drawn between final and interlocutory judgments of much help herein.\nNor do I think the cases determining and distinguishing the nature and quality of the acts or offences committed by persons under examination which had involved them in imprisonment under orders of judges in chambers are much more helpful in leading to a right conclusion on this motion.\nAssuming for argument's sake that the offence in question herein was criminal brings us to consider whether or not it is so in the sense of the section of the Supreme Court Act prohibiting, (unless upon certain terms and following certain conditions of things), an appeal here. I have no hesitation in saying that it was not a criminal offence in the sense used in that section.\nBut how far does the finding it, if we do find it, a criminal offence in the sense in which local laws punishing specified acts with imprisonment, lead such acts to be spoken of as criminal offences bring us? Is it any more appealable when thus looked at than if merely held to be a contempt of court in the ordinary sense; that is in the presence and face of the court? There formerly prevailed many cases of enforcing by imprisonment obedience to orders of courts in order that justice should be done between parties and for which alternative methods are now substituted.\nFor example, the attachment of the person to enforce an interim order for costs is replaced by ordinary execution; the refusal to attend or submit to examination for discovery by an order striking out the defence or dismissing the action and the vesting order takes the place of the former process. Are any such orders appealable to this court?\nSuppose the former practice or law and practice restored and imprisonment directed instead of any such order would appeal lie here? Any appeal of that kind involving mere procedure would, I venture to think, be met by the practice adopted here long ago and consistently followed of refusing to hear the appeal unless there appeared some violation of the principles of natural justice.\nHow can this case be distinguished from those? What is this if not matter of procedure?\nI have always supposed that the legislation of Ontario, from which that of Manitoba now in question was evidently copied, was but a substitution for the right which the judgment creditor formerly had to issue, as of course, a writ of capias ad satisfaciendum. Imprisonment for debt was abolished but I rather think the intention was and at all events the practical result was not to extend this amelioration of the law to the case of the fraudulent debtor but, in his case, to leave it in the discretion of the court or judge conditioned upon satisfactory answers being made upon examination. I will not say that this view has always prevailed or that the later cases are clearly consistent with the earlier ones. The order for a writ of ca. sa. was more common at one time as the result of such examinations, than later when it became so fruitless partly as the result of continued amendments as to the effect to be given the writ, that the order therefor fell into disuse.\nThe order to commit was effective and the power to make it formed part of the same section.\nAnother power to make orders for examinations of debtors was that brought in with the Common Law Procedure Act in order to found proceedings for garnishee proceedings.\nIt was quite usual and I think properly so in asking for an order to commit under either such Acts to treat the subject matter of the complaint as one for contempt of court implied in the disobedience of the order.\nIt was often just as much so as the other instances I have adverted to which subjected the party to attachment.\nIt was competent for a judge to take and he some times did take the examination before himself.\nIn the cases of Henderson v. Dickson[2], and Baird v. Story[3], such eminent judges as the late Sir John Beverley Robinson, Chief Justice Draper and Hagarty J., afterwards C.J., all living in the times when these changes were made and knew what they involved or implied, either directly or impliedly deal with the matter as one of contempt.\nBut again, how far does holding them matters of contempt clear matters up for us?\nThirty years later the rules, which are statutory in character, enabled the creditor to have the examination before certain officers of the court without any order, but merely an appointment. And such seems to be the nature of the Manitoba rule now in question.\nSuch being the history of the law, does it not indicate that it is a matter of indifference whether the substance of the offence be treated as contempt or the proceeding be held in aid of the execution or as substitute for execution by way of ca. sa., or whatever we choose to call the proceeding and order made? They are but in the nature of procedure and, hence, even if within the jurisdiction of the court, something the court has uniformly refused to hear unless there appeared something done in violation of natural justice.\nIt seems, moreover, as something hardly within the general purview of the Supreme Court Act to suppose it intended thereby to have such orders appealable here.\nI should have had no hesitation in holding either on this latter and broad ground that there was no jurisdiction to hear such an appeal or that, in any event, it being in the nature of matter of procedure should not be heard, but for the cases of Wallace v. Bossom[4], where an appeal allowed from an order letting aside an execution, Mackinnon v. Keroack[5], a capias case but which took the form of pleadings and an issue to be tried, and the case of In re O'Brien[6].\nThese cases I think each and all distinguishable. The first is, perhaps, in principle the least possible of being distinguished. But the facts are far from being the same and the case an early one inconsistent with the later jurisprudence of the court, as, for example, the case of Martin v. Moore[7], and McGugan v. Mc-Gugan[8].\nAnd the others seem of the same nature as interpleader in being proceedings quite independent of those involving the rights of the parties in the issues raised in the action.\nI incline very much, subject to reservation of opinion, as it was not argued as other points above referred to were, to hold also as the result of much consideration of the case in all its bearings that the order was discretionary and, hence, not the subject of appeal. Suppose the converse case of an appeal because the Court of Appeal had set aside an order, or both judge and appellate court refused to make an order, would we not answer, that they had merely exercised their discretion?\nNo necessity exists to rest upon this point of discretion for, in my view, the grounds I have just stated are sufficient to enable me to hold the appeal will not lie or ought not to be heard as being a matter in the nature of procedure.\nThere is in support of this latter ground also this, that on its face the appeal involves only costs and would be fruitless, for the appellant is now discharged. The acquiescence relied on would but for the peculiar facts be also fatal, but, on account of such facts, I say nothing as to that.\nCarter v. Molson[9] is instructive as to the scope of the appellant's right intended. There it was held no appeal would lie as of right to the Privy Council from an order for ca. sa. in a similar case in Quebec, where the statute limiting appeals from Quebec to the Privy Council is identical with that defining as to that province, appeal to this court. The express provision for appeal in case of habeas corpus in other than criminal cases provided for by-section 39, sub-section (c) of the Supreme Court Act rather implies that such an appeal as this is not intended. In case habeas corpus would apply that is the proper mode of relief, if beyond the power of the court to make the order.\nThe appeal should be quashed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The Court of Appeal for Manitoba, by the judgment appealed from, dismissed an appeal from an order of Mathers J. committing the appellant to gaol for twelve months under the authority of rule 755 of the Court of King's Bench. \"The order is expressed to be based upon an adjudication that the appellant was \"guilty of contempt\" in not making satisfactory answers \"upon her examination as a judgment debtor\" under rule 748 \"as to her property or her transactions respecting the same.\"\nI think this order is not a final judgment within sub-section (e) of section 2 of the Supreme Court Act. That sub-section is as follows:\u2014\n(e) \"Final judgment\" means any judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding in finally determined and concluded.\nThe order of Mathers J. did, it is true, finally dispose of the matter in question upon the application before him; and, if that application was a \"matter or other judicial proceeding\" within the meaning of the definition just quoted, the order disposing of it must be held to be a final judgment within that definition. The point for determination is whether the application was such a \"matter or other judicial proceeding.\" I think it is not such a \"matter or other judicial proceeding\"; and I base my opinion upon the short ground that a proceeding under rule 755 is merely ancillary to the proceedings by which a judgment creditor is authorized to obtain execution of his judgment. The examination under rule 748 is designed to enable the creditor to obtain, (through the oral examination of the debtor), discovery of the debtor's assets which are subject to execution in satisfaction of his judgment. By rule 755, the court is invested with power to commit the debtor for failing to make, upon such an examination, a full and true disclosure respecting his property and his dealings with it. Taylor's Case[10], per Lord Eldon; Re Courtney[11]; Dougall v. Yager[12]; Hobbs v. Scott[13], per Draper C.J.; Lemon v. Lemon[14], per Strong V.C.; Graham v. Delvin[15], per Boyd C; Ross v. Van Etten[16], at page 600, per Taylor C.J. The rule 755 is thus but the necessary complement of rule 748; and a proceeding under it is not, to use the language of Sir James Colville, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Goldring v. La Banque d'Hochelaga[17], referring to the proceedings under the articles of the Civil Code of Quebec relating to capias ad respondendum, \"so severed from the general suit that\" it is \"to be treated as something separate\" in its nature, \"and not as incident to the suit\"; on the contrary \"from its nature\" it is \"merely incidental to the suit and in the nature of process therein.\" A proceeding thus incidental to the principal action, and not touching the rights of the parties in respect of the matters in controversy in that action, cannot be treated as a \"matter or other judicial proceeding\" within the enactment under consideration. To hold otherwise would lead to the result (which it is impossible to suppose Parliament could have contemplated) that any order made in the course of an action\u2014though touching exclusively the course of the proceedings and having no relation to the merits of the controversy in the action itself\u2014is a final judgment within the Supreme Court Act as finally disposing of the particular application in which it was pronounced.\nThere is, perhaps, some reason to think that this view is in conflict with the view of Strong J., as indicated in his observation in Danjou v. Marquis[18], that the phrase \"final judgment\" as used in the Supreme Court Act comprehends any order or judgment which is\nfinal as regards the particular motion or application and not necessarily final and conclusive of the whole litigation.\nI do not think the learned judge could have meant to say that every order disposing of an interlocutory proceeding in the course of an action is, as such, a final judgment and appealable under the Supreme Court Act; if so, I must, with respect, dissent from that view. Other cases which may, at first sight, appear inconsistent with the opinion above expressed will be found, on examination, to be either, (1) cases in which, by the order or judgment appealed from, the rights of the parties in respect to some distinct ground of action or defence in the principal proceeding have been determined; or (2) cases in which the proceeding in which the order or judgment in question was pronounced, (although bearing some relation to another proceeding), was held by this court to be, in substance, independent.\nI think the appeal should be quashed with costs.\nAnglin J. agreed with Duff J.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Bonnar, Timmant & Thorburn.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hull, Sparling & Sparling.\n[1] 18 Man.

On an appeal from a judgment maintaining the plaintiff's action:\nHeld, Girouard and Idington JJ. dissenting, that, as it did not appear from the record that the sum or value demanded by the action was of the amount limited by the Supreme Court Act in respect to appeals from the Province of Quebec nor that any title to lands or future rights were affected, an appeal would not lie to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMotion to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs. The nature of the relief sought by the plaintiff's action is stated in the head-note. By the judgment in the Superior Court (affirmed by the judgment appealed from) it was declared that the plaintiff had the exclusive right, under a municipal by-law, of placing water-pipes on certain streets in the Village of St. Ambroise de la Jeune-Lorette (the mise-en-cause), for the purpose of supplying water to part of the municipality during twenty-five years from the 10th April, 1893, and that the defendants had infringed that privilege by placing water-pipes, in connection with their rival system of waterworks, on those streets to the injury of the plaintiff, and it was ordered that the water-pipes so placed by the defendants should be removed; the defendants were enjoined against operating waterworks within the area in question, condemned to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $50 damages, with costs, and the right was reserved to the plaintiff to take such further action as he might be advised for the recovery of damages subsequent to the date of his action. At the hearing of the motion to quash the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada for want of jurisdiction, affidavits were filed, on behalf of the appellants, shewing that the total value of their system of waterworks was from $20,000 to $25,000; that the actual value of their works in the Village of St. Ambroise de la Jeune-Lorette, apart from the value of the land, was $16,000; that the portion ordered to be demolished was capable of returning them an annual revenue of $500 or $600 from one part of the municipality and that the remainder, which would be destroyed in consequence of the judgment, was of the value of from $8,000 to $10,000 and capable of producing an annual revenue of $600.\nE. J. Flynn K.G. supported the motion.\nG. E. Dorion K.G. contras The Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. This action was brought by Verrett against La Compagnie de l'Aqueduc and the corporation of the Village of St. Ambroise mise-en-cause. By his action the plaintiff asks for a declaration that certain rights and privileges to construct an aqueduct granted to him by the municipal corporation, defendant, were exclusive; and that in constructing another aqueduct La Compagnie de l'Aqueduc de la Jeune-Lorette had infringed his rights and should be enjoined and restrained from constructing their aqueduct, and he also asks for a condemnation against the defendant for $86 for special damages. The franchise is not in question and the water company may, by diverting their line, still carry on their operations. The action was maintained in the Superior Court and the judgment was affirmed by the court of appeal. Respondent says that no appeal lies here. The amount claimed is not within the appealable limit and no title to land or rights in future are involved.\nI would grant the motion with costs fixed at $ 50.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014The matter in dispute in this case exceeds $2,000 as the value of the works to be demolished, as proved in the action, is more than $2,000. What we have to consider is not only the few pipes to be demolished, but also how far the whole aqueduct will be affected by the judgment. If those pipes be removed the whole value of the aqueduct is involved and it was admitted before us that it exceeds $2,000.\nI think, therefore, that we have jurisdiction.\nDavies J-\u2014I concur with the opinion of the Chief Justice. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014I cannot see how to distinguish this case in principle from that upon which this court proceeded to hear the case of Rouleau v. Pouliot[1].\nIn that as here the existence of a franchise and extent thereof was all that was in question.\nThere a toll bridge franchise created by 58 Geo. III, ch. 20 (L.C.), was invoked by the grantee thereof to have another and competitive bridge demolished.\nHere the respondent as owner of a water supply franchise has got a judgment of demolition against the appellant in respect of a water supply pipe the municipal authorities had permitted to be laid down in the street to or over which the respondent's franchise extended.\nThe one owner's property earned for him profits by tolls on travel and the other by tolls on water supplied.\nMoreover, Rouleau v. Pouliot1, followed Galarneau v. Guilbault[2], which was the case of a toll bridge plus a ferry.\nI think the jurisprudence of this court has determined by these and numerous other cases not so directly, but yet in principle alike thereto the meaning to be attached to the words (\"other matters or things where rights in future might be bound\") in section 46, sub-section (6), of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and that they thereby cover this case.\nThe motion should be therefore dismissed.\nDuff and Anglin JJ. agreed in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.

In 1902 the Privy Council held that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to entertain a claim by Quebec to have Ontario declared liable for the purchase money of school lands yet unpatented allowed to remain uncollected for many years. In making their final award in 1907, the arbitrators refused an application by Quebec for inclusion therein of the amounts found due from Ontario for remissions and non-collections and held that they had exceeded their jurisdiction in determining such liability. On appeal from this determination embodied in the final award: \u2014\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. expressing no opinion, that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to determine the liability of Ontario for moneys remitted or not collected. Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Quebec ((1903) A.C. 39) followed.\nHeld, also, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that awards Nos. 2 and 4 in so far as they determined this liability were absolutely null, and, therefore, not binding on Ontario.\nAPPEAL from an award of the arbitrators appointed to settle the account between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively, by which they decided that awards Nos. 2 and 4, relating to the common school fund determining that Ontario was liable to accounts for sums remitted on the purchase money of school lands and the price of lands patented which had not been collected had been made in excess of their jurisdiction.\nThe following is the award appealed against, dated the sixth day of January, A.D. 1908, omitting the formal parts.\n\"Whereas by an agreement made on the tenth of April, 1893, on behalf of the Government of Canada of the first part, the Government of Ontario of the second part, and the Government of Quebec of the third part, it was, among other things, agreed by and between the said several Governments, parties thereto, that the following questions, among others, mentioned in the order of the Governor-General in Council of the twelfth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety, be, and they were thereby, referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award, in accordance with the said statutes, namely:\u2014\n'The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which should be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest.\n'In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration, not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.'\n\"And whereas certain questions respecting the Common School Fund were submitted to the said arbitrators, and among others a claim made on behalf of the Province of Quebec that the Province of Ontario is liable to the Common School Fund for the following amount:\n\"1. Moneys collected by Ontario which they have omitted to credit to the Common School Fund in their accounts as rendered...........$ 9,468.59\n\"2. Deductions made by Ontario on balances due in capital and interest on sales of land prior to the 30th June, 1867...............260,445.19\n\"3. Deductions on balances due in principal and interest on sales made subsequent to the 1st July, 1867.........................2,975.99\n\"4. Balances due in principal and interest on lots sold prior to the 30th June, 1867, patents having been issued by the Ontario Government to the occupants of lots without payment of any money........................7,270.62 \"5. Amounts due in principal and interest on sales made prior to the 30th June, 1867, but subsequently cancelled and re-sold by Ontario at reduced rates...............20,662.58\nTotal................$300,822.97\n\"And whereas dealing with that claim, among others, and exercising their authority to make an award in respect thereof, the said arbitrators did, on the sixth day of March, 1896, among other things (Sir John Alexander Boyd dissenting from so much of the award as made the Province of Ontario liable for any sums of money remitted to or not collected from the purchaser of any common school lands and for interest on any sums so remitted or not collected) award and adjudge in and upon the premises as follows, that is to say:\n\"2. That in computing the amount of principal money of the Common School Fund for which the Province of Ontario is liable, the following sums shall be deemed to be and shall be treated in all respects as moneys received by the province from or on account of the common school lands set apart in aid of the common schools of the late Province of Canada, that is to say:\n'(a) Any sum of money due for principal or interest from any purchaser of said common school lands, remitted by the Province of Ontario to the purchaser, unless it be shewn by the province that such remission was made in a fair and prudent administration of the common school lands and fund; and\n'(b) Any sum of money due for principal or interest from any purchaser of said common school lands, at the time when letters patent for such lands were issued to him by the Province of Ontario, and not collected by the province, unless it be shewn by the province that there was good cause for not collecting the same.\n'3. That where, in a fair and prudent administration of the common school lands, any sale of such lands has been cancelled by the Province of Ontario, and the same re-sold at a price less than that first obtained, the province shall not be liable for the loss resulting therefrom.'\n\"And whereas the parties having proceeded further with the said claims, and having filed statements shewing the particulars thereof, and having submitted evidence in respect thereto; and the said arbitrators having heard the parties and considered the evidence, did, on the 21st day of October, 1899, make a further award in the premises whereby they did, among other things, award, order, and adjudge as follows, that is to say:\n'1. That subject to any revision and correction of the amount of the item in each case (which shall be ascertained by accountants, to be appointed by the arbitrators, in case the parties themselves do not otherwise agree) that may appear necessary and proper in the further taking of the accounts, that the Province of Ontario shall be debited with the sum of $9,468.59 hereinbefore mentioned for moneys collected on account of the common school lands and not credited to the Common School Fund in the accounts as rendered. This amount, being the difference in sums omitted to be credited to that fund and sums wrongly credited thereto, the several items as they appear in the statement prepared by Mr. Hyde and laid before us are (subject to such revision and correction) allowed as claimed by Quebec.\n'2. That subject to such revision and correction as aforesaid, the Province of Ontario shall be debited, and the Common School Fund credited, with the several items and amounts shewn in the said statement prepared by Mr. Hyde, that go to make up the amount of $260,445.19 hereinbefore mentioned, and for which the Province of Quebec claims that the Province of Ontario is liable, with the exception of an item of $359.31, which appears at page 54 of the said statement in connection with sale numbered 9762.\n'3. That subject to such revision and correction as aforesaid the Province of Ontario shall be debited and the Common School Fund credited with the several items and amounts shewn in the said statement prepared by Mr. Hyde that go to make up the sum of $2,975.99 hereinbefore mentioned, and for which the Province of Quebec claims that the Province of Ontario is liable.\n'4. That subject to such revision and correction as aforesaid the Province of Ontario shall be debited and the Common School Fund credited with the several items and amounts shewn in the said statement prepared by Mr. Hyde that go to make up the sum of $7,270.62 hereinbefore mentioned, and for which the Province of Quebec claims that the Province of Ontario is liable.\n'5. In respect to the amount of $20,662.58 hereinbefore mentioned, and for which the Province of Quebec claims that the Province of Ontario is liable in respect of the cancellations of certain sales of land and the re-sale thereof at reduced rates, that the Province of Ontario, subject to such revision and correction as aforesaid, be debited and the Common School Fund credited with certain items amounting in the whole to the sum of $ 6,230.35. * * *\"\n\"And whereas no final award and declaration of the amount for which the Province of Ontario is liable to the Common School Fund as mentioned in the submission of the 10th day of April, 1893, has been made, and counsel for the Province of Quebec have moved the said arbitrators to give, among other things, orders and directions as to the method of making up the accounts of the Common School Fund referred to in the said agreement of submission, brought down and extended to the 31st December, 1892, inclusive, carrying into the same all the items and figures resulting from the various awards or orders of the Board made or to be made affecting the said Fund;\n\"And whereas on that motion the question has arisen as to whether in the final award and disposition of the said matter effect should be given to the directions and provisions mentioned and contained in the second and third paragraphs of the said award of the 6th day of March, 1896, and in the second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of the said award of the 21st day of October, 1899, as being within the jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrators under the submission of the 10th day of April, 1893;\n\"And whereas the parties have been heard in respect to the said question;\n\"Now, therefore, we, the said John Alexander Boyd, George Wheelock Burbidge and Francois Langelier, the said arbitrators, exercising our authority to make a separate award at this time respecting the said matter, and proceeding upon our view of a disputed question of law, do answer the said question in the negative, and do award, order and adjudge in and upon the premises that the directions and provisions mentioned and contained in the second and third para- graphs of the said award of the 6th day of March, 1896, and in the second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of the said award of the 21st day of October, 1899, were in excess of the authority and jurisdiction of this Board under the said submission of the 10th day of April, 1893, and that no effect should be given to such directions and provisions in the final award and declaration of the Board as to the amount for which the Province of Ontario is liable to the Common School Fund.\n\"The Honourable Sir Francois Langelier dissents from the present award on the grounds that the Board of Arbitrators had jurisdiction to deal with claims heretofore allowed in the awards of the 6th day of March, 1896, and the 21st day of October, 1899, and is of opinion that the said awards should not be disturbed.\"\nParagraphs 2 and 3 of the award of the sixth of March, 1896, which the arbitrators held in their final award to be in excess of their jurisdiction are as follows:\n\"Now, therefore, we the said arbitrators, exercising our authority to make a further award at this time respecting the same do award and adjudge in and upon the premises as follows, that is to say:\n\"2.

The arbitrators had jurisdiction to determine the liability of Ontario to account for amounts remitted to purchasers of school lands. Consideration of the judgment of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Quebec[4], shews that this matter is very different from the one in question in that case and does not fall within the principle of the decision.\nIf the arbitrators had jurisdiction Ontario, of course, is liable. In re Bourne[5].\nIn any case, as no objection to the jurisdiction of the Board was taken until long after the awards were made, and as they were acquiesced in and acted upon by Ontario, the objection cannot prevail now.\nSir AEmilius Irving K.C and Shepley K.C. for the respondent. Under the submission Ontario can be made liable for moneys actually received and for those alone.\nThe case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Quebec4, concludes the matter against the appellants.\nLafleur K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nSir AEmilius Irving K.C and Shepley K.C. for the respondent.\nHogg K.C. for the Dominion of Canada did not wish to be heard.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting) agreed with Duff J.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial questions raised in this appeal are whether or not the arbitrators appointed under certain identic statutes of Canada, Ontario and Quebec, for the ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund of the late Province of Canada had jurisdiction to entertain and decide upon the claim of Quebec against Ontario with respect to portions of the price for which certain of the common school lands had been sold and which Quebec alleged Ontario had improperly remitted to the purchasers of those lands; and secondly, assuming the submission under which the arbitrators acted was not wide enough to confer such jurisdiction upon them, whether or not the arbitrators in making their final award were concluded and estopped by their previous interim award upon the said claim and unable to rectify their error in assuming such jurisdiction.\nThe first question depends upon the proper construction of the agreement or submission defining the scope and extent of the arbitrator's jurisdiction made between the three Governments of the Dominion, and of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nThat agreement of submission was entered into on the 10th April, 1893, pursuant to the terms of identic legislation passed by the Parliament of Canada and by the legislatures of the two Provinces of Quebec and Ontario.\nThe powers of the arbitrators are therefore statutory and it is important to bear this in mind in view of one of the arguments pressed by the Province of Quebec in support of its appeal as to the arbitrators being concluded by a previous award they had made whether strictly within the terms of the submission or not to which I will refer later on.\nThe terms of the deed of submission of the 10th April, 1893, so far as they relate to the questions arising on this appeal, are as follows: 3. It is further agreed that the following matters shall be referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award in accordance with the provisions of the said statutes, namely:\n(h) The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which should be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest.\n(i) In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the common school lands which have not yet been sold.\nThe question as to the true meaning and construction of the terms of this submission came before this court in the year 1901 on an appeal from an award made by a majority of the arbitrators holding that they had no jurisdiction to entertain a claim of the Province of Quebec that the Province of Ontario should be debited with such part of the uncollected balances of the sale price of the common school lands theretofore sold as the arbitrators should determine was under the circumstances right, fair and just.\nI was a member of this court at that time and concurred in the judgment delivered by Chief Justice Strong,[6], at page 529, holding that the arbitrators had jurisdiction to entertain such claim. The Chief Justice speaking for the majority of the court said:\nThe clear and distinct words of the reference which require the arbitrators \"to take into consideration the amount for which Ontario is liable\" seems to us to make it impossible that a claim that Ontario is liable for uncollected balances of purchase moneys as well as for the wilful default and neglect of its officers can possibly be outside the terms of the reference.\nOn appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, this judgment was reversed and the award of the majority of the arbitrators declining jurisdiction affirmed.\nThe reasons of their lordships for reversing and for holding that the Board of Arbitrators had not jurisdiction to entertain Quebec's claim for any portion whatever of the uncollected balances of purchase money were delivered by Lord Robertson,[7]. They seem to me conclusive against the present appeal in so far as it asserts jurisdiction in the Board of Arbitrators to entertain a claim of Quebec to charge Ontario with remissions to the purchasers of the purchase price of the common school lands sold to them whether made in the course of wise and prudent administration or otherwise.\nLord Robertson in delivering the reasons of the Judicial Committee says:\nIn ascertaining the true nature of the claim of Quebec, it is necessary to observe that the claim relates to the uncollected prices of lands sold by Ontario and to nothing else. The case, be it understood, is that of lands sold but no title to which has yet been granted. The gravamen is that those sales ought to have been completed and the prices ought to have been collected long ago, and that those prices have not been collected. Apart from this, Quebec has no case and does not profess to have one. The respondent endeavoured to make out that he was not necessarily committed to the very strong statements made in the claim of wilful violation of duty. Now, while it may not be of the essence of the claim to advance, as the respondent has done, the theory that those moneys have not been collected because it is the settled purpose of Ontario to keep them in the province, the facts set out in the claim amount to a case of wilful neglect and default and to nothing else, and the remedy sought is that those moneys which are not in the hands of the defaulter shall be treated as if they were and shall be debited against him. This; is. the gist of the claim\u2014a claim against a trustee who, whether from intention or from negligence-, leaves moneys uncollected which he ought to have in his hands. The remedy claimed by Quebec is that Ontario shall be debited with a specific sum, to wit, $485, 801.65, interest to run on it from a stated date. This is an appropriate remedy for breach of trust, but it can be justified on no other ground. Now the question is whether such a claim falls within heads (h) and (i) of the submission. \"The Common School Fund\" the principal of which is to be \"ascertained and determined\" according to the conception of the statutes which relate to it, consists of moneys in the hands of Government. Now, the substance of the claim of Quebec is that the Ontario Government is to be debited with what in fact is not in their hands, and is alleged to be uncollected owing to the fault of that Government. Their lordships are unable to hold that a claim of this nature is to be found within the language of arts, (h) and (i) of the submission when there is no recital or suggestion of it in the rest of the submission. The question is not whether the claim is suitable for arbitration, but whether it has been submitted by this instrument. As their lordships read the claim, it is a claim founded on wilful neglect and default and of the nature of damages, and is heterogeneous to the questions which are clearly included in the submission. The specified matters which the arbitrators are to take into consideration do not include the present claim, and the fact that they are mentioned makes it impossible to suppose that the parties would have omitted to mention the matter now in question, if it had been within the scope of the reference.\nI agree with the majority of the Board of Arbitrators that this reasoning is entirely applicable to the claims for remissions allowed in the awards of 1896 and 1899, now under review in this appeal and that the Judicial Committee's declaration of the law as to the scope of that submission is conclusive and binding upon us. On the question of the construction of the submission and the jurisdiction of the arbitrators I am quite unable to distinguish between a claim by Quebec to charge Ontario for a loss of the Common School Funds arising out of the improper refusal or wilful neglect of the Ontario Government to collect the purchase price of the school lands sold by them and a similar claim for a loss arising out of the improper and unjust abatement or remission to the purchasers of part of their contract price of purchase. In each case alike the moneys have not been received by the Province and each alike comes within the words of Lord Robertson a claim founded on wilful neglect and default, and of the nature of damages and is heterogeneous to the questions which are clearly included in the submission.\nHolding, therefore, as I do that the decision of the Judicial Committee above referred to covers the question of the arbitrators' jurisdiction over improper and unjust remissions of the purchase money for which the lands were sold as well as for wilful neglect and default in not collecting such purchase moneys, I would be prepared to dismiss this appeal.\nThere remains, however, for consideration the second question raised by the Province of Quebec, namely, that the Board of Arbitrators were incompetent to decline jurisdiction in making their final award with respect to the sums remitted to the patentees (after the grants of their patents) out of the purchase moneys of such lands because they had already decided that Ontario was chargeable with such remissions up to an ascertained amount specified in a previous interim award made by a majority of them and the question was res judicata.\nI confess myself entirely unable to appreciate this argument. Once it is conceded that the powers of the arbitrators were statutory, it seems to me to follow as a necessary consequence that anything they did beyond what they were authorized to do could not be binding upon the parties to the statutory submission or have any possible effect. If there was no jurisdiction in the Board of Arbitrators to consider and determine the question of Ontario's liability for remission of the purchase price of the lands, how can it possibly be maintained that an award made on the false assumption of such jurisdiction can be binding on the arbitrators or on any or on either of the Provinces parties to the submission? When, as in the case now before us, the Board was invited by the Province of Quebec to make a final award and to carry into that final award the interim award it had already made with regard to these re-missions of the purchase prices at which the lands had been sold it surely was open to them to decline doing so when they found that the highest judicial court of the Colonial Empire had determined that the scope of the statutory submission made by the Dominion and the two Provinces was not broad enough to enable them to deal at all with these questions of remissions. It is true that in its answer to Quebec's statement of claim charging Ontario with these remissions, Ontario had not raised any objection to the Board's jurisdiction over the claim although Chancellor Boyd, one of the arbitrators, dissented from the award on that ground.\nBut the absence of protest by Ontario against the Board assuming jurisdiction could not alter or enlarge the scope of the submission nor operate to estop the Province from disputing the jurisdiction of the arbitrators when it was found afterwards that the scope of the submission has been misunderstood. When Quebec moved the arbitrators in terms of the motion set out at page 34 of the case and practically asked them to assemble in a final award the results of their interim awards upon the subject of the Common School Fund including the awards Nos. 2 and 4 holding Ontario liable for purchase moneys of such lands improperly forgiven or remitted to the patentees it was clearly in my opinion open to Ontario to protest against the Board of Arbitrators doing so on the ground of want of jurisdiction. It does seem to me reasonably clear that if the submission did not authorize the arbitrators to deal with these remissions their attempts to do so in their interim awards Nos. 2 and 4 were nullities as being beyond their statutory powers, and that any further attempt to give vitality to their interim awards would necessarily be ultra vires. The jurisdiction of this court to hear an appeal from the award of the arbitrators is dependent upon the fact that the arbitrators should certify that in making the award they proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law. In the present appeal the arbitrators did so certify upon the face of the award and our jurisdiction therefore to hear the appeal cannot be questioned.\nIt may be true also that Ontario did not until long after the rejected interim awards were made protest against the jurisdiction of the arbitrators to entertain the claim, and that after making award No. 4 the arbitrators declined on application made to them to certify that in making that interim award they had proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law, and so an appeal against it to this court was defeated. But I am not able to see what these facts combined have to do with this question now before us. None of them nor all of them combined could operate either to extend the scope of the statutory submission or create a power in the arbitrators which it did not confer. The Board of Arbitrators now called upon by Quebec to make their final award and incorporate in it the interim awards they had previously made refuse in the light of the fuller knowledge they had gained of their jurisdictional powers to repeat the mistakes they had previously made. They formally decline to exercise a jurisdiction which they now learn they never possessed and never should have attempted to exercise and substantially award, order and adjudge that their awards Nos. 2 and 4 so far as they relate to this claim for remissions were made in excess of their authority and jurisdiction under the submission of the 10th April, 1893. In doing so I think they acted properly and are not estopped by their previous action. There is no principle upon which a Board of Arbitrators or a court acting under statutory authority can be called upon, by reason of some supposed estoppel, to assert a jurisdiction which it does not possess, merely because the tribunal, in a previous and interlocutory stage, had deemed itself jurisdictionally seized of the subject matter. The rule is that absence of jurisdiction must invalidate any proceedings, at any stage, and the arbitrators, being asked in their final award to bring in and include a liability over which they had, at a previous interlocutory stage, erroneously deemed themselves to have jurisdiction, were not only justified in correcting the previous error, but were in my judgment bound to do so.\nThen with respect to the argument pressed upon us so energetically by Mr. Geoffrion arising out of the passing by Ontario of the Act 35 Vict. ch. 22, which professed to authorize in certain cases a reduction or an abatement in the prices of common school lands without affecting the share or interest of the Province of Quebec, I confess I find it difficult to understand the principle upon which the Act can be relied on as conferring any additional jurisdiction on the Board of Arbitrators. I gather from the reasons of Chancellor Boyd and Mr. Justice Burbidge for the award made by them and now under appeal, that it was common ground for both parties when awards Nos. 2 and 4 were made that this statute had never been acted upon and that the remissions and reductions in price of which Quebec complained were not authorized by it. But even if I was to go so far as to assume, contrary to the conclusion I have reached, that this statute and its amendments of 1877 could be invoked as applicable to the actual remissions made, it is difficult to see how that would assist the argument that the Board had jurisdiction over the claims in question. The moneys claimed were not in fact received by Ontario whether the failure to receive them is referable to the Act in question or not; and whether such failure is attempted to be justified by Ontario under that Act or otherwise, the foundation of the claim of Quebec is not altered. It is a claim as put by Mr. Shepley based upon neglect or default with or without the sanction of the ex parte legislation of Ontario and so stamps itself as \"heterogeneous\" to the questions included in the submission of 10th April, 1893, made by the Dominion and by the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec to the Board of Arbitrators.\nIdington J.\u2014The submission now in question received the interpretation in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Quebec[8], which binds us.\nIt was held there that it did not authorize the arbitrators to adjudicate upon the liability of the respondent herein to account for moneys that might but for its wilful neglect or default have been collected.\nThe words \"but also the amount for which Ontario is liable\" which are used in the submission and pressed herein on our attention were under consideration in that case. Though they are possibly, if unlimited in any way, of wide enough import to have included the uncollected moneys then in question and also to include those now in question, yet the court held they did not when limited as the court found cover the case of moneys uncollected yet collectable.\nIt is easy to distinguish the facts of that case from those of this case but impossible to distinguish the interpretation adopted from that which must govern us herein. It is not an argument founded on reason to say that because the court properly and with due regard to accuracy limited its decision to the actual facts before it we must infer it intended to hold that the interpretation adopted and applied should be limited in its operation only to identical facts.\nThe court was careful not to embarrass by including other possible cases not before it.\nFor that obvious reason as well as the observation of a safe rule of judicial expression not to presume or seem to decide anything but the case in hand or needlessly extend by anticipation the principles necessary for its decision the court left it open to appellants ably to argue in many ways here that the other cases thus distinguishable in fact and circumstances are not to be governed by that case.\nWhen however we look at the judgment in that case to find why the comprehensive words of reference are not to extend so far as they at first blush seem to imply we observe that the entire legal history of the trust is outlined in the judgment; that by the award of the 3rd September, 1870, it was laid down that the moneys received by Ontario since the 30th June, 1867, from the common school lands should be paid to the Dominion subject to certain deductions; that a new set of questions having arisen this submission now in question was made, and thereupon there had been raised a question of the jurisdiction of the arbitrators to adjudicate in respect of a claim of the now appellants that from the long delay of a quarter of a century to get in from sales of said land the uncollected balances of principal and interest they\nought to be and be deemed held and treated in all respects as moneys received by Ontario from or on account of the common school lands and as part of the Common School Fund or moneys in the hands of Ontario.\nIt was held by the arbitrators that they had not jurisdiction but upon appeal to this court such decision was reversed and hence the appeal cited above.\nIt was thereupon decided that such a claim put in the mildest form it was possible in law to state it was but\na claim against a trustee who, whether from intention or from negligence leaves moneys uncollected which he ought to have in his hands, * * * and the remedy sought was an appropriate remedy for a breach of trust.\nAnd it was held accordingly that such an issue was beyond the language of the submission or suggestion of it in the rest of the submission.\nHow can the refusal to collect now in question be held to be different in quality from the wilful neglect there? Both are covered by the express words above quoted of \"intention or from negligence.\"\nThe intention is made clear in regard to the remissions now in question. The twenty-five years of failure there in question was almost as expressive of intention as of neglect. But the questions of intention as well as of neglect are classed as of the same kind as a legal basis for complaint or reason for remedy and held beyond the submission.\nI cannot understand, notwithstanding the argument so lucidly and so well put, how the moneys now in question can be held any more than those there in question to be deemed as money received. The legal wrong done if any is of the same character. The appropriate legal remedy sought here is absolutely the same.\nCan it make any difference what the reason or motive leading to the intention was? If the remedy is not to be found in the one case in the exercise of the powers conferred I fail to see how it can be found in the other by looking at the motive which formed the foundation for the act complained of.\nIt is said there was a statute passed by the Ontario Legislature which expressed what was to be done but as the statute never was observed and never formed part of the constituting instruments establishing the trust I fail to see how it can in any case be relied upon by the appellant.\nMuch less can we find in its non-observance reason for holding that its existence can constitute in law the remission of moneys, within or without its provisions as a receipt of said moneys.\nThe failure to receive remains but an intention or neglect such as passed upon in the case I have cited.\nNor can I see how the granting of titles to the purchasers thus relieved from payment can convert the legal wrong as regards the appellant, if any, into anything but wilful default.\nAs regards the theory strongly urged of \"constructive receipt\" as the embodiment of results following Ontario legislation it seems but a twin brother to the conception put forward in the former case that the moneys should be \"deemed * * * as moneys received by Ontario.\" Neither seems more than an ingenious hypothesis. I cannot find the one more workable than the other.\nI am not passing upon this whole matter any opinion of whether or not a legal wrong in truth exists. It may or may not have been. We have nothing for that but a tribunal unauthorized to pass upon it. If there was no power in the tribunal that passed upon it to do so its findings in that regard must be treated as null.\nAnd if through oversight they did pass upon it I fail to see how or why they cannot so declare and refrain from giving any countenance to its validity.\nNay more, on the face of each award there appears clearly set forth the ground (now found prohibited as ill-founded ground), upon which they proceeded.\nI might add that of any or of the whole of the means suggested (outside of the actual receipt of the money) to rectify the matter each ends when analyzed in a reconstitution of the trust the Dominion has to execute.\nWe are asked in substance to find that the Dominion remain not as the trust declared the trustee of the fund to pay out its whole income in certain defined proportions but become as to a part a trustee for Quebec only.\nThis equalizing method was to my mind much more clearly beyond the range of the submission than anything I have already dealt with.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the appeal should be allowed. Upon the point of law raised by Ontario the Board was it seems to me concluded by its previous deliverances. The claim of Quebec was that Ontario be charged with the sums remitted to patentees (after the grant of their patents) out of the purchase money of patented lands as well as with the unpaid balances of purchase money due in respect of such lands. The Board had already decided that Ontario was chargeable in respect of these moneys. These adjudications phad been embodied in two formal instruments in which the arbitrators declare they \"award and adjudge\" upon the points in issue. Assuming these documents to be \"awards\" within section 5 of the identic statutes under which the submission took place the argument in favour of the view that they were binding on Ontario seems difficult to answer. The statutes authorize the submission of certain questions to the Board; empower the Board to make awards from time to time; provide that where the Board decides upon a disputed question of law the question shall be stated on the face of the award; and that an appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board upon any such question to the Supreme Court of Canada and thence to the Privy Council. The statutes further declare, subject to any such appeal, that \"the award of the arbitrators in writing\" shall be binding on the parties to the submission.\nNow it has not been doubted that a question touching the scope of the submission would be a question of law which if disputed the arbitrators should state in. their award and in respect of which the appropriate mode of questioning their decision would be by the appeal provided by the statutes. The language used is quite broad enough to embrace such a question; and in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Quebec[9], the question of the competence of the arbitrators to entertain the claim of Quebec was treated as, and indeed expressly declared, at page 42, to be a question of law within these provisions. Section 8, moreover, seems to make any award under the statute binding on the parties notwithstanding it should involve the determination of some question of law which not having been disputed or stated on the face of the award could not be raised by way of appeal under the statute.\nThere is nothing startling in the view that this section extends to questions relating to the scope of the submission, when one considers the character of the tribunal and the fact that where there is a dispute upon a question of law. the arbitrators are peremptorily required to state it\u2014and that in such cases an appeal is given as of right. When the Governments concerned agreed to constitute a tribunal empowered to dispose finally of the questions arising on the settlement of the accounts in question, it is not, I think, to be supposed that the final award of this tribunal (to be composed as the statute provided, exclusively of judges, one of whom should be nominated by each of the Provinces, and one by the Dominion and each of whom should be approved by all the Governments) was to be open to dispute by any one of the parties on the ground that some matter had been taken into consideration by the tribunal which was outside of the scope of the submission (unless indeed the question raised by the objection should be stated in the award in the manner provided for by the enactments). On the contrary it would seem that one might confidently assume all parties to have intended that any such objection (escaping both the vigilance of counsel and the attention of the tribunal) should be finally set at rest by the award of the tribunal. Consider the effect of the opposite view. Let us suppose the very objection which was the subject of the adjudication in question on this appeal to be taken by Ontario for the first time after the final (i.e. the last) award of the arbitrators; that in other words, Ontario should then for the first time dispute the validity of the award on the ground that the claims to which the objection is directed were outside the scope of the submission. There would be no court to which such a controversy as between Ontario and Quebec could be submitted without the consent of both parties. It could only be determined, therefore, by a submission to another arbitral tribunal or with the consent of all parties to one of the courts of the country. Is it really conceivable that the parties could have intended that such a second submission should in any circumstances be necessary? It seems to me that to state the question is to answer it. Finality upon all questions as to the scope of the submission was just as important as finality upon other questions of law and upon questions of fact. The importance of the questions involved, and the composition of the tribunal, were such as to make it in the last degree improbable that any serious objection to any claim as being outside the submission would be overlooked. It must be essential to finality that any such objection if overlooked should be set at rest by the adjudication of the arbitrators upon the claim; and we should not, I think, be justified in so limiting the language of section 8 as to give to that section a construction which would have the effect of frustrating the common purpose which all the legislatures plainly had in view in agreeing to the constitution of the Board.\nI do not understand Sir John Boyd to have raised, by his dissent, the question of the competency of the Board, under the submission, to pass upon the point on which his dissent was based. The awards, moreover, have not been attacked in the only way in which, if I am right in the views above expressed, they could be attacked, namely by appeal under section 6 of the constituent statutes.\nNor (with great respect to the learned Chancellor of Ontario) do I think there is any room for the implication he finds in the legislation to the effect that until the last award should be made, the \"interim awards\" so called should be open to review. The enactment seems explicit. The Board is empowered to make \"awards\" from time to time; and \"the award in writing\" of the arbitrators, it is declared, is to be binding on the parties. Morover if on this ground open to review on a question of law any such adjudication must (pending the final settlement of the precise sum payable by Ontario) be open on any question of fact; and having regard to the character of the inquiry, it is difficult to suppose that the legislatures could have intended that.\nI think also that the instruments in which the adjudication upon the point under consideration is embodied are \"awards\" within the meaning of the statute.\nIt was argued by Sir AEmilius Irving that being in their nature interlocutory deliverances having only a temporary operation they lack the essential features of awards. I do not think that is the character of them. The Board does not in these documents profess to be regulating the proceedings or making provisional rulings upon the subject of the dispute: it, (as already mentioned) deals with the rights of the parties and in respect of their rights \"awards and adjudges\" languages which does not seem consonant with the intention that those pronouncements should have only a provisional effect. The circumstance alone that the instruments in question did not determine the precise sum which should be chargeable against Ontario in respect of the heads of controversy under which that Province was held to be liable does not I think effect the finality of the adjudications upon the points dealt with; Re Herbert Reeves & Co.[10], at pages 32-33; Ex parte Moore[11], at pages 633-34; the precise sum had in fact been determined pursuant to the directions contained in the awards long before the question of competency was raised.\nIf I am right in the view I have expressed that the statutes empowered the Board to decide finally and conclusively from time to time upon such controversies as those dealt with in the instruments in question then on this branch of the case the only remaining point upon which controversy could arise would be whether the Board has in these instruments manifested an intention of so deciding. That, as I have already said, seems to me very plain on the face of the instruments.\nAnglin J.\u2014Two distinct questions are presented by this appeal\u2014one a question of the jurisdiction of the Board of Arbitrators; the other a question of res judicata, or estoppel.\nBy an award, dated the 6th March, 1896, (known as No. 2) the arbitrators determined (Boyd C., dissenting) that the following should be deemed moneys received by Ontario, viz.: (a) moneys remitted to purchasers of school lands, except in so far as Ontario should shew that the remissions were made in fair and prudent administration; (&) purchase moneys not collected by Ontario for lands for which patents have issued, unless Ontario should shew good cause for such non-collection. This adjudication was made upon a claim submitted by Quebec, and entertained by the arbitrators without any exception to their jurisdiction being taken by Ontario. The representatives of Ontario accepted the award and proceeded with the trial of the issue thereby defined, adducing evidence by which they sought to justify the reductions in and non-collection of purchase moneys. A further award, dated 21st October, 1899 (known as No. 4) determined the amounts with which Ontario should be charged in respect of the liability declared by the earlier award, subject only to a revision of the figures which were declared to be complete on the 21st of August, 1901.\nMeantime Ontario had sought to appeal from both these awards. Neither award contained a declaration by the arbitrators that they had proceeded on their view of a disputed question of law. Upon this ground a motion by Quebec to quash the appeal prevailed.[12].\nIn 1899, Quebec brought before the arbitrators a supplemental claim that Ontario should be held liable to pay, as part of the Common School Fund, purchase moneys of school lands yet unpatented, but which Ontario had allowed to stand uncollected for upwards of 25 years. By her plea to this claim Ontario contested the jurisdiction of the Board to entertain it. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators that they had not such jurisdiction, set aside by the Supreme Court[13], was restored by the Judicial Committee[14].\nIn December, 1907, Quebec moved the Board for directions as to the inclusion in its final award of the amounts found due from Ontario in respect of remission and non-collections, interest upon the same, etc. On the return of this motion Ontario raised the question whether the awards of the Board as to remissions and non-collections of purchase money in the case of patented lands were within its jurisdiction. The arbitrators (Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier, dissenting) held that in making these awards the Board had exceeded its jurisdiction by dealing with matters not within the submission, and that, as to them, in the final award effect should not be given to the former awards. From this determination, embodied in an award, dated 6th January, 1908, in which the arbitrators stated that they proceeded upon their view of a disputed question of law, Quebec has taken the present appeal.\nCounsel for Ontario maintain that the matter of jurisdiction is conclusively determined in her favour by the decision of the Judicial Committee in the matter of the \"Uncollected Balances\"[15]. The question in that case was whether or not the arbitrators had jurisdiction to entertain the claim that Ontario should be charged with balances of purchase moneys of lands not yet patented, which she had failed to collect. The answer to this question depended, in the judgment of the Privy Council, upon whether or not Quebec's claim fell within the terms of the submission. The function of the arbitrators in regard to the principal of the Common School Fund was\nthe ascertainment and determination of its amount, taking into consideration not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable.\nLord Robertson answers the contention, that the latter words confer jurisdiction to entertain the claim for \"uncollected balances,\" by pointing out first that the Common School Fund \"consists of moneys in the hands of Government\"\u2014according to article IX. of the award of 1870, moneys then in the hands of the Dominion and moneys theretofore or thereafter received by Ontario as proceeds of the sale of common school lands\u2014and secondly that\nthe substance of the claim of Quebec is that the Ontario Government is to be debited with what in fact is not in their hands and is alleged to be uncollected owing to the fault of that Government * * * a claim founded on wilful neglect and default and of the nature of damages * * * heterogeneous to the questions which are clearly included in the submission.\nThe Judicial Committee determined that the words, \"the amount for which Ontario is liable,\" (having regard to the nature of the Common School Fund, to the matters specified in the submission and to its recitals and general tenor) extend only to moneys received by Ontario from sales of school lands and do not include moneys uncollected \"from intention or from negligence,\" which she ought to have in her hands\u2014\"moneys which are not in the hands of the defaulter\" through her \"wilful neglect or default,\" and which it is sought to treat as if they were in her hands and to debit against her. \"This,\" say their lordships,\nis an appropriate remedy for breach of trust, but it could be justified on no other ground.\nIn effect conceding that, under the decision of the Privy Council, the submission does not empower the Board to entertain claims against Ontario in the nature of claims for damages for breach of trust, counsel for Quebec maintain that the sums representing purchase moneys remitted or not collected in respect of patented lands should be deemed moneys constructively received by Ontario. In support of this contention they refer to Ontario legislation of 1872[16], whereby the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was authorized to reduce the prices of school lands sold prior to the 1st July, 1867, and to abate interest on unpaid instalments of purchase money,\nprovided that such reductions and abatements be made only in respect of and in proportion to the shares of Ontario and do not in any wise extend to or affect the share or interest of Quebec in such lands or the price thereof.\nThe statute further provided that a reduction or abatement should be affected by paying the amount thereof to the person entitled out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, on his paying the full amount of the purchase money and interest, and it enabled the Lieutenant-Governor by Order in Council to confer on the Commissioner of Crown Lands authority to make such reductions or abatements.\nThe admitted facts are that no reductions or abatements in purchase money or interest were made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; all were in fact made by the Commissioner of Crown Lands; and there never was an Order in Council conferring authority on him pursuant to the statute. The position, having regard to what was actually done, is the same as if the statute had contained a provision that it should not come into force until declared operative by an Order in Council and such Order in Council had not been passed. Without an Order in Council conferring them upon him, the Commissioner could not exercise these statutory powers. Whatever he might do would not be done under the statute. No payments were ever made out of The Consolidated Revenue Fund, and, where there were reductions or abatements, the full purchase money and interest was not paid by the settler, but only the reduced amount.\nThe statute of 1872 was carried into the revisions of 1877 and 1887, the provisions as to payment in full and repayment out of The Consolidated Revenue Fund being omitted.\nFor Quebec it is contended that, although the statute was not complied with, the reductions and abatements made by Ontario should be deemed to have been made under its authority and that her liability and accountability should be the same as if the statute had been strictly carried out. I do not pause to inquire whether this position is now taken by Quebec for the first time, or whether it is or is not consistent with the allegations in her statement of claim. I assume that Quebec is within her right in presenting her present contention.\nOntario has always maintained that the reductions and abatements were made not as a matter of grace or favour to her settlers under the statute, but in the course of fair and prudent administration and for the advantage and benefit of both cestuis que trustent.\nNotwithstanding one or two allusions to it in a couple of early letters from the Commissioner of Crown Lands, referred to by Mr. Lafleur, it is clear that the Act of 1872 was not acted upon, and I am unable to perceive why its mere presence upon her statute books should estop Ontario from so asserting.\nThe arbitrators have not found upon what authority Ontario purported to make reductions and abatements. Sir John Boyd states that the statute was never acted upon. Mr. Justice Burbidge, who had formerly said that Ontario should be deemed to have acted under it, though its terms were not followed, in his reasons in support of the award now in appeal, says:\nWhatever view one may take of this statute, it is clear of course that the moneys in question have never been received by Ontario, and by the award of 1870 the province is liable to the Common School Fund for moneys received, and a claim to have the fund augmented by moneys not so received is, as their lordships have pointed out, in the case of The Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for Quebec[17], a claim in the nature of damages for some neglect or default which, as decided in that case, is heterogeneous to the questions included in the submission of the 10th of April, 1892.\nSir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier, the dissenting arbitrator, in his reasons makes no reference to the Ontario statute.\nWhile it is, therefore, quite correct to say that the arbitrators have not in fact determined that the reductions and abatements were not made, or professedly made, by Ontario under the authority of the legislation of 1872, the admitted fact, that the reductions and abatements in question were all made by the Commissioner of Crown Lands without the authority of an order in council, appears to render that conclusion so clearly inevitable that it would seem supererogatory to require a formal statement of it by the arbitrators.\nEven if the Commissioner of Crown Lands had assumed to act upon the authority of the statute of 1872, he having in fact acted without its authority and in a manner quite inconsistent with its provisions, a case of constructive receipt by Ontario of the amounts by which the purchase moneys were reduced or interest thereon was abated, could not, in my judgment, be made out. Had the order in council necessary to clothe the Commissioner with the statutory powers been in fact passed, the situation would have been very different. All that Quebec would then need to ask would be that the Commissioner's acts should be ascribed to the exercise of powers which he actually possessed. She is, however, asking that he should be deemed to have exercised powers which he did not possess. This, in my opinion, cannot be done.\nNo other ground has been suggested upon which it could be held that these moneys not actually received by Ontario should be treated as having been constructively received. Unless actual or constructive receipt of the moneys is established, any claim that Ontario should account for them as if they had been so received must be a claim \"founded on wilful neglect or default and in the nature of damages,'\" and as such not within the scope of the reference.\nI fully realize that in the Privy Council judgment Lord Robertson defines precisely the immediate subject of the appeal and carefully points out that the claim then under consideration was not for moneys remitted or abated and not for moneys uncollected in respect of patented lands, but only for uncollected balances of purchase moneys of \"land sold but no title to which had yet been granted.\" I do not read this portion of the judgment as meaning that the principles upon which it proceeds have no application to the case of reductions and abatements of purchase money of patented lands, but merely as pointing out that that particular question was not then presented for adjudication.\nI am of opinion that the majority of the learned arbitrators were right in. concluding that the awards Nos. 2 and 4 dealt with matters dehors the submission upon which they were founded.\nIf Ontario should be held bound by awards of the arbitrators as to matters not within the terms of the submission formally approved of by her Government by order in council, it must be either because a further parol submission binding upon her has been made by the acts or conduct of her representatives and what has been thus submitted is now res judicata, or I because she is estopped by her representatives and the arbitrators having, owing to a misconception of its scope, treated the matters now in question as within the terms of the formal submission.\nAs against the subject the terms of a written submission may be enlarged by acts of the parties and an award upon matters not within them may be supported by a parol submission so made. The scope of the submission is deemed to be thus widened although the extraneous matters have been dealt with only because, by common mistake of parties and arbitrators, they were assumed to be within it. Thames Iron Shipbuilding Co. v. The Queen[18], cited with approval in Russell on Awards (10 ed.) p. 54, and in Redman on Awards (3 ed.) p. 165.\nBut we are here dealing with a statutory reference and it. is against the Crown that an estoppel is asserted.\nThe reference, according to the Acts of Ontario and Quebec, is of such \"questions as the Governments of the Dominion and of the two provinces shall mutually agree to submit\"; and, according to the Dominion Act,\nof such questions as the Governor-General and the Lieutenant-Governors of the said provinces shall agree to submit.\nThe three Acts were intended to be identic and, read together, they authorize the submission only of such questions as the several Governments with the concurrence of their respective heads, the Governor-General and Lieutenant-Governors, shall approve. Action by a Governor-General and his Government, or by a Lieutenant-Governor and his Government is invariably taken by order in council. Its constating Acts, therefore, restrict the functions of the Board to matters the submission of which is sanctioned by orders in council, and the Governments themselves could not empower their representatives to submit, or the arbitrators to entertain, matters the submission of which had not been so authorized.\nMoreover, apart entirely from the provisions of these statutes, executive acts in matters of such importance must be authorized by order in council. Todd's Parliamentary Government (2 ed.), Vol. II., p. 673. In these matters acts of representatives of the Crown not so authorized\u2014even acts of individual ministers\u2014will not bind the Government. Reg. v. Lavery in 1896[19], at page 322; Reg. v. Waterous Engine Works Co. in 1893[20], at pages 235-6-7; see, too, Jacques Cartier Bank v. The Queen[21], at page 92. It would be exceedingly dangerous if, where a Government has taken the precaution to determine and define by order in council the terms of a reference, matters not covered by the order in council could be brought within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators and the scope of the reference intentionally or unintentionally enlarged by the acts or conduct of counsel or solicitors. Neither counsel nor solicitors representing it could bind the Government of Ontario by a parol submission of matters not included in the formal submission ratified by order in council. Their deliberate acts beyond the tenor of their instructions would have no effect upon the rights of the Crown. Neither can their mistakes or accquiescence estop it, since the Crown may not be held bound by estoppel or be prejudiced by the laches, mistakes, or defaults of its servants or agents. The failure of its representatives to call in question the jurisdiction of the arbitrators and their subsequent acquiescent attitude towards the awards now said to have been made without jurisdiction cannot therefore be successfully invoked against Ontario.\nThe 5th section of the Ontario statute authorizing the submission empowers the arbitrators, or any two of them \"to make one or more awards,\" and the 8th section provides that\nthe appointment of the arbitrators by order in council and their award in writing shall bind this province save in case of appeal on questions of law as hereinbefore mentioned.\nThe corresponding sections of the Quebec and Dominion statutes are couched in the same language. But these provisions, when read with the other sections of the statute, seem plainly to be applicable only to awards within the terms of the submission. Otherwise, although the statute by its first section restricts the scope of the arbitration to questions which \"the Governments * * * shall mutually agree to submit,\" they might find themselves bound by an award in which the arbitrators had disposed of matters not merely dehors the submission, but which neither parties nor counsel intended should be dealt with, and such an award would not be subject to appeal unless the arbitrators had certified that in making it they had proceeded \"on their view of a disputed question of law.\" A consideration of the results which would follow from holding that the words \"awards\" and \"their awards in writing,\" in sections 5 and 8, respectively, include awards upon matters outside the submission and, therefore, made without jurisdiction, makes it clear, in my opinion, that the operation of these sections is confined to awards which the arbitrators had jurisdiction to make and that it is such awards only which are declared binding.\nCounsel for Quebec also argued that, because Ontario did not raise the question of jurisdiction in her statement of defence as required by the third of the general rules regulating their proceedings promulgated by the arbitrators, she cannot now be heard to say that awards Nos. 2 and 4 were made without jurisdiction. This is tantamount to saying that, unless their jurisdiction has been contested in the manner which the arbitrators have prescribed, it is to be deemed established as to all matters of claim dealt with by their awards. A sufficient answer to this contention seems to be that a Board constituted with defined statutory jurisdiction cannot by promulgating rules without statutory sanction enlarge that jurisdiction.\nIf the arbitrators were not fundi officiis in regard to Quebec's claims in respect of reductions and abatements, Ontario was not precluded, however late in the proceedings, from raising before them the question of their jurisdiction, for \"the King shall not be concluded if he has matter to serve him.\" (Brown on Estoppel, p. 206.) That Quebec did not consider the Board to be functus regard to the matters covered by awards Nos. 2 and 4, is made reasonably clear by her application to the arbitrators on the 18th of December, 1907., for \"an order and directions as to the method of making up the accounts of the Common School Fund * . * . * carrying into the same all the items and figures resulting from the various awards or orders of the Board, etc.\" It was on this motion that the question of jurisdiction arose. What, the arbitrators have done is not to reconsider a question upon which they had formerly pronounced (this question of jurisdiction was not then raised), but merely to refuse to perform a fresh act which, had their former awards been valid, might have been requisite to carry them into effect\u2014an act, the performance of which would involve a further assumption by them of a jurisdiction with which they are now satisfied that they have not been clothed.\nBut, though the award now in appeal should be regarded as a re-consideration by the arbitrators of questions upon which they had already passed and a reversal of decisions which they had already formulated, the position taken by them would, in my opinion, be correct. To support it, it does not seem to me to be necessary to consider whether awards Nos. 2 and 4 are interim awards or final awards. The power of a Board of Arbitrators to re-consider matters within its jurisdiction and upon which it has definitely pronounced, although it has not made an award finally disposing of all matters submitted, may possibly be questionable. But that, which has been merely coram non judice, cannot be res judicata. An award made entirely without jurisdiction is absolutely void, and it is therefore unnecessary to set it aside. Whenever the nullity of their former action becomes apparent arbitrators not only may, but must, decline to hold themselves bound thereby. As to any future action on their part their duty in this respect is the same whether their former action be regarded as interim or as final in its character. Made without jurisdiction awards Nos. 2 and 4 are simply null and must be ignored. Nor does their nullity at all depend upon its declaration by the last award. That declaration may be viewed as a statement by the arbitrators of their reason for refusing to act upon awards Nos. 2 and 4, and the last award may itself be treated as merely a refusal so to act. In substance and reality it amounts to that. From what I have said it follows that in my opinion, such refusal was fully justified.\nFor these reasons, which are perhaps stated at unnecessary length, I am of opinion that the appeal fails and should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] See p. 163, ante.\n[2] See p. 163, ante.\n2 See p. 163, ante.\n2 See p. 163, ante.\n[3] See, p. 164, ante.\n[4] [1903] A.C. 39.\n[5] 22 Times L.R. 417.\n4 [1903] A.C. 39.\n[6] 31 Can.

Davies J. dissented in respect of that part of the verdict awarding damages in favour of one of the sons who was almost 21 years of age and earning wages at the time deceased was killed.\nQu\u0153re.\u2014In an action under article 1056 C.C. can a jury award damages in solatium doloris? Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([1892] A.C. 481) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Montreal[1], .affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Saint Francis, entered by Demers J. upon the verdict of the jury at the trial, awarding the plaintiffs $4,000 damages with interest and costs.\nIn their answers to the questions submitted to them the jury found that the defendants had been guilty of negligence which was the cause of the death of the deceased and awarded damages which they assessed and distributed as follows: $300 to one of the sons of the deceased, aged 20 years and 7 months at the time of the accident; $700 to another son aged 14 years, and $3,000 to the widow. At the time of the accident, by which deceased lost his life he was in his sixty-third year and, during the last year of his life, he had earned $600 in his employment as a car-repairer in the defendants' railway yard at the City of Sherbrooke, Que.\nThe material questions for decision on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Wells for the appellants.\nPanneton K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the court below.\nGirouard J. agreed with Duff J.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question upon this appeal was whether or not the damages awarded by the jury to the widow and younger son were so \"grossly excessive\" within the meaning of those words as used in article 503 of the Code of Civil Procedure for Quebec as to justify the granting of a new trial.\nSo far as the damages awarded to the widow ($3,000) and the younger son ($700) are concerned I will not, after reflection, dissent from the view entertained by the rest of my colleagues that they are not so grossly excessive as to make it evident that \"the jurors had been influenced by improper motives\" in fixing those amounts, though they are certainly much more than if I were a juror I would feel justified in awarding. We have not before us in the record any notes of the charge of the trial judge, and I am therefore unable to say whether the jury were \"led into error\" in awarding the sums they did.\nWith respect, however, to the $300 awarded the eldest son, Albert, I am not able to agree with the rest of the court. At the time of the accident this son was twenty years and seven months of age, and there is no proof in the record that he sustained any damage by reason of his father's death.\nAt the time of the accident he was working in Sherbrooke on the street railway there receiving $1.50 a day. Subsequent to his father's death he went to Montreal and entered an architect's office accepting, in order to learn his chosen profession, a much smaller wage than he was receiving at Sherbrooke.\nHis voluntary action in giving up after his father's death his wages of $1.50 a day and accepting a smaller wage in order to learn the profession of an architect is no reason why he should be made to benefit by that death.\nNo evidence of any kind was called to our attention shewing that if the father had lived he would have contributed to his son's support, and I do not think the condition of life of the parties, the wages they were respectively earning and the general circumstances of the case justify us or justified the jury in assuming that to be a fact upon which no evidence was offered and which cannot be said to be a fair inference deducible from the facts as proved. Under the circumstances I cannot agree that this part of the verdict can be upheld.\nIdington J. agreed with Anglin J.\nDuff J.\u2014The only question presented by the appeal which requires discussion is that involved in the contention of the appellants that the verdict should be set aside as awarding damages which are unreasonably excessive.\nIt is not necessary to consider whether (a point which received some attention during the argument) in an action based upon article 1056 of the Civil Code a sum of money may be given as damages in solatium doloris. The decision of this court in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[2], to the effect that in such an action compensation for mental distress is not recoverable was supported upon grounds which are no doubt to some extent shaken by the later judgment of the Privy Council in the same case[3]; whether so much shaken as to justify us in treating the question as open for reconsideration in this court may be left for determination when a case arises in which the point actually requires decision. The jury may unquestionably take into consideration every other loss and every other disadvantage which are in the natural and ordinary course attributable to the death out of which the action arises and can fairly be appraised in money. Here the compensation awarded is not so much out of keeping with the circumstances of the parties as to justify the presumption that in computing it the jury have taken into account as an element of loss anything which does not fairly fall within that description. I would dismiss the appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendants appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review affirming the judgment for the plaintiffs entered at the trial upon the findings of the jury. The appeal is taken upon the grounds that the jury erred in negativing contributory negligence and that the amount of the verdict is excessive.\nDuring the argument the court expressed its view that the finding of the jury upon the question of contributory negligence had not been successfully attacked;\nWhile the amount of the damages awarded by the jury is greater than I would have allowed if myself making the assessment, I cannot say that the verdict is so grossly excessive that a new trial should be ordered under article 502 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or the verdict reduced under article 503. If the only element for consideration in estimating the damages in this case were the actual wages or earnings of the deceased, the task of the appellants in impeaching the verdict would be less difficult. But for loss of his services at home\u2014of his care and protection of his wife and family\u2014of his assistance in husbanding the family resources\u2014for the loss of these and other kindred and substantial benefits and advantages of which the death of the husband and father has deprived them, the plaintiffs were justified in asking compensation from the jury under article 1056 C.C., which declares them entitled to recover \"all damages occasioned by such death.\" While I have not disregarded the construction put upon this article in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[4], I express no opinion upon the question how far that decision should be deemed an authority since the judgment of the Privy Council in the same case[5].\nIt is only in very clear cases that I should feel warranted in interfering with the verdict of a jury on the ground that the amount of damages awarded is either excessive or inadequate. The able argument of counsel for the appellants has not made it clear to me that\nthe amount awarded is so grossly excessive * * * that it is evident that the jurors, have been influenced by improper motives or led into error. Art. 502, C.P.Q.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cate, Wells & White.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Panneton & Leblanc.\n[1] Q.R. 35 S.C. 494.\n[2] 14 Can.

Act, 1867, s. 91, s.-s. 2; s. 92, s.-ss. 8, 13, 16\u201457 V. c. 50 (Que.).\nProvincial legislation authorizing a municipality to regulate the closing of shops of a particular character within its limits, is a subject which falls within the classes of matters enumerated as being within the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial legislatures under sub-section 13 or sub-section 16 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and is not an interference with the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada conferred by the second sub-section of section 91 of that Act.\nUnless a by-law, enacted in good faith under the authority of the Quebec statutes, 57 Vict. c. 50, and 4 Edw. VII. c. 39, appears to be so unreasonable, unfair or oppressive as to be a plain abuse of the powers conferred upon the municipal council it should not be set aside.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 17 K.B. 420) reversed.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], which maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs. The action was to set aside a by-law of the City of Montreal, enacted under the authority of the statutes of the Province of Quebec, 57 Vict. ch. 50, and 4 Edw. VII. ch. 29, and providing that all shops and places or business, with certain exceptions, within the city where merchandise was offered for sale by retail, should be closed at seven o'clock in the afternoon on certain days of each week, throughout the year, and should remain closed until five o'clock on the following mornings. At the trial Mr. Justice Archibald gave judgment in favour of the plaintiffs and his decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff now reported.\nAtwater K.C. and J. L. Archambault K.C. for the appellant.\nBisaillon K.C. and H. R. Bisaillon for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is allowed with costs. I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nGirouard J. also agreed with the opinion stated by Duff J:\nIdington J.\u2014Whatever possible implications may rest in the words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" as used in the \"British North America Act,\" section 91, sub-section 2, I do not think, having regard to the scope and purposes of that Act, they ever were intended to cover powers of legislation of the purely local and municipal character in question herein.\nNor do I find the by-law in question either exceeds the power given by this legislation or infringes any of the principles of reasonableness or impartiality often applied as tests of what a by-law must conform to in order to avoid any abuse of a statute conferring the authority to make by-laws.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The principal question raised by this appeal concerns the competency of the legislature of Quebec to pass section 1 of 57 Vict. ch. 50, and section 1 of 4 Edw. VII. ch. 39. The last named enactment merely authorized the imposition of a penalty for breaches of by-laws passed under the first named, which is in the following words:\nIn every city and town, the municipal council may make, amend and repeal by-laws ordering that during the whole or any part of the year, stores of one or more categories in the municipality be closed and remain closed every day or any day of the week, provided the times and hours fixed and determined for that purpose by the said bylaws shall not be sooner than seven o'clock in the evening and later than seven o'clock in the morning.\nApplying the established canon the first step in examining the constitutional validity of this legislation is to ascertain whether the subject matter of it prim\u00e0 facie falls within any of the categories which as subjects of legislation are assigned to the provinces by section 92 of the \"British North America Act\"; that is to say, whether reading the provisions of that section, as they stand without reference to section 91 the given subject-matter falls within one or more of those categories.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[3], at pages 363 and 364, makes it plain that the power given to the provinces by sub-section 8 of section 92\nsimply gives (to quote Lord Watson's words) provincial legislatures the right to create a legal body for the management of municipal affairs. * * * The extent and nature of the functions which it can commit to a municipal body of its own creation must depend upon the legislative authority which it derives from the powers of section 92 other than 8.\nWith great respect, however, to the learned judges below who have taken the opposite view it appears to me that in the sense above indicated the subject-matter of the legislation in question falls within either subsection 13 or sub-section 16; whether it falls within sub-section 13 may be a more debatable question, but, assuming it does not, then I must say I have great difficulty in finding any sound reason for holding that it is not a \"local matter\" within sub-section 16. The latest authoritative pronouncement respecting the criterion to be applied in ascertaining whether a given subject-matter of legislation falls within sub-section 16 is to be found in the judgment delivered by Lord Macnaghten, on behalf of the Judicial Committee, in Attorney-General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders Association[4], at page 79:\nThe judgment (meaning the judgment of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada3) therefore as it stands (says his lordship) and the report to Her late Majesty consequent thereon shew that in the opinion of this tribunal matters which are \"substantially of local or of private interest\" in a province\u2014matters which are of a local or private nature \"from a provincial point of view,\" to use expressions to be found in the judgment\u2014are not excluded from the category of \"matters of a merely local or private nature,\" because legislation dealing with them, how- ever carefully it may be framed, may or must have an effect outside the limits of the province, and may or must interfere with the sources of Dominion revenue and the industrial pursuits of persons licensed under Dominion statutes to carry on particular trades.\nIt seems clear that the matter of the hours at which shops of specified classes shall close in particular localities in the Province of Quebec is a matter which is substantial of local interest in the province and which in itself is not of any direct or substantial interest to the Dominion as a whole. Such being the case it is made clear in the passage quoted that we may leave out of consideration any of the indirect and collateral effects so strongly dwelt upon by counsel for the respondent which may be supposed to result from the legislation.\nWe have still to consider whether the enactment falls within any of the classes of legislation committed to the Dominion by the \"enumerative heads\" of section 91. Counsel for the respondent vigourously argued that it is an invasion of the field defined by sub-section .2, \"The Regulation of Trade and Commerce.\" If the enactment were in its essential character an attempt to regulate trade and commerce within the meaning of that sub-section then, of course, it could not be sustained as an exercise of any of the provincial powers of legislation. A province cannot (it is probably needless to say) by simply restricting the operation of it territorially, validly enact legislation that, in its real scope and purpose, deals with a subject committed exclusively to the Dominion. Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[5].\nThe meaning of the words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" in sub-section 2 of section 91, was considered by The Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[6] at pages 112 and 113, and they were there held not to extend to the regulation of the contracts of a particular business or trade in a single province. Without defining the limits of the authority conferred their lordships expressed the view that the words quoted\nwould include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of Parliament, regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern, and it may be that they would include general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion.\nIt would not, I think, be consistent with the views indicated by their lordships in this case (or with their subsequent decisions in the cases to which I have already particularly referred) to hold that legislation regulating the hours of the closing of shops of one or more classes in a particular province any more than legislation regulating the hours of labour in particular kinds of employment in one province alone would fall within the scope of the powers conferred by sub-section 2.\nThe by-law in question is also impugned as unreasonable and oppressive. To establish this contention in any sense germane to the question of the validity of the by-law it was necessary that the respondents should make it appear either that it was not passed in good faith in the exercise of the powers conferred by the statute or that it is so unreasonable, unfair or oppressive as to be upon any fair construction an abuse of those powers. Slattefy v. Naylor[7]; Kruse v. Johnson[8]. In the last mentioned case Lord Russell of Killowen said, at page 99:\nI do not mean to say that there may not be cases in which it would be the duty of the court to condemn by-laws, made under such authority as these were made, as invalid because unreasonable. But unreasonable in what sense? If, for instance, they were found to be partial and unequal in their operation as between different classes; if they were manifestly unjust; if they disclosed bad faith; if they involved such oppressive or gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to them as could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men, the court might well say, \"Parliament never intended to give authority to make such rules; they are unreasonable and ultr\u00e0 vires\" But it is in this sense, and in this sense only, as I conceive, that the question of unreasonableness can properly be regarded. A by-law is not unreasonable merely because particular judges may think that it goes further than is prudent or necessary or convenient, or because it is not accompanied by a qualification or an exception which some judges may think ought to be there. Surely it is not too much to say that in matters which directly and mainly concern the people of the county, who have the right to choose those whom they think best fitted to represent them in their local government bodies, such representatives may be trusted to understand their own requirements better than judges. Indeed, if the question of the validity of by-laws were to be determined by the opinion of judges as to what was reasonable in the narrow sense of that word, the cases in the books on this subject are no guide; for they reveal, as indeed one would expect, a wide diversity of judicial opinion, and they lay down no principle or definite standard by which reasonableness or unreasonableness may be tested.\nIn this case I can see nothing in any of the circumstances relied upon indicating that the municipal council have exceeded the bounds of the discretion which the law has committed to them.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ethier, Archambault, Lavall\u00e9e, Damphouse, Jerry & Butler\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bisaillon & Brossard.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 420.\n[2] Q.R. 30 S.C. 427.\n[3] [1896] A.C. 348.\n[4] [1902] A.C. 73.\n3 [1896] A.C. 348.\n[5] [1899] A.C. 580, at p. 587.\n[6] 7 App. Cas. 96.\n[7] 13 App. Cas. 446.\n[8] [1898] 2 Q.B.91.\n",

The plaintiff, Gordon, and two of the defendants (the Hollands), were partners as real estate brokers and, aside from the agency business, entered into investments on their own account in the purchase of three lots of land, making a payment on account of the price. When instalments of the balance became due they took Horne into the transaction, it being agreed that he was to pay 85% of the price and the others to contribute 15%, and that the profits should be divided between them. Horne took over the agreements for the purchase and the lots were eventually conveyed to him. Under a verbal agreement, if a sale of the lands could be effected before the second instalment became due and netted 15% profit, the old partnership was to share in the profits equally with Horne. This sale was not made, but four months after the instalment fell due Horne sold a half interest. At the trial Morrison J. held that no partnership had been proved and dismissed the action. By the judgment appealed from, it was held by Hunter C.J. and Clement J. that Horne was a trustee for the partnership consisting of the plaintiff, himself and his co-defendants. Irving J. was of opinion that Horne could not be called upon to account until he had been re-imbursed the money he had put into the transaction. The defendant Horne appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada in order to have the judgment of Morrison J. restored.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the parties to the appeal the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, the appeal was allowed with costs, Girouard and Idington JJ. dissenting. The majority of the court considered that the question being one of fact depending upon the proper view of conflicting testimony the judgment of the trial judge should not have been disturbed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nLafleur K.C. and W.

At the formal investigation into the causes of the foundering of the ship, the wreck commissioner, assisted by two nautical assessors, reported that the ship was seaworthy when she left Quebec on her last voyage; that her life-boat and appliances were sufficient to have saved all lives on board had the master made proper use of them, and that the evidence did not explain the cause of the casualty by which these sailors' lives were lost. It was also found that the master and mate had been guilty of cowardice and desertion of the ship and their certificates were cancelled. The actions were first brought in the District of Quebec, but the court declared itself incompetent and referred the case to the Superior Court for the District of Montreal. In the latter court the defendant (appellant), pleaded prescription, a year having elapsed before the actions came before a court of competent jurisdiction, that deceased were not passengers, but were engaged as part of the ship's crew, that the ship was seaworthy and that the disaster was due to the perils of the sea. At the trials and by the judgments appealed from the plea of prescription was dismissed and judgments were entered in favour of the plaintiffs, respectively. The defendant raised the same questions on the present appeals.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the appellant and without calling upon counsel for the respondents for any argument, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nPerron K.C. for the appellant.\nBeulac for the respondents.\n[1] Q.R. 34 S.C. 405.\n",

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Scott J., at the trial[2], which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was upon a promissory note, which had been obtained by fraud and had been transferred by the payee to the plaintiff, who sought to recover upon it as a holder in due course for valuable consideration without notice of invalidity. At the trial Scott J. dismissed the action, holding that the makers were not liable, that the note, on its face, shewed that interest thereon was overdue at the time of the transfer, and, consequently, that the transferee was put upon inquiry before purchasing it, and that, this circumstance, coupled with other suspicious circumstances, prevented the plaintiff being deemed a holder in due course. The Supreme Court of Alberta, in banco, affirmed this decision by the judgment appealed from, and held that the burden of proving affirmatively that he became holder of the note in question honestly and in good faith had not been satisfied by the plaintiff, and that his neglect to make inquiries, though not inconsistent with good faith, constituted some evidence of bad faith.\nAfter hearing counsel for the parties on the appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, allowed the appeal and maintained the action with costs, the Chief Justice and Idington J. dissenting. The majority of the court were of the opinion that the courts below were not justified, under the circumstances of the case, in refusing to accept the uncontradicted testimony of a witness, (examined abroad under commission), as to particular facts, of which notice had not been given in the pleadings or otherwise, relating to circumstances relied upon as sustaining or pointing to the imputation of bad faith and no opportunity afforded to the witness of explaining or qualifying the facts or conduct on which the attack upon his veracity or honesty was based.

A road from the highway over a part of the saw mill property had been used for access to the grist mill from the time it was built, but was obstructed by the defendants in 1906, and an action was brought for an injunction to restrain them from continuing such obstruction and for damages.\nThe plaintiff succeeded at the trial, but the judgment in his favour was reversed by the Divisional Court, which held that the easement was extinguished by the unity of ownership in 1891, and that, as the subsequent conveyances contained no reservation, express or implied, of the right to use the road, the plaintiff could not recover.

Varley v. Coppard (L.R. 7 C.P. 505) followed.\nThe lease provided that, having performed all their covenants and agreements contained in the lease the lessees on giving six months\u2019 notice in writing to the lessor before the expiration of the term that they required it, would be entitled to a renewal.\nHeld, that a breach (after the said notice was given) of their covenant in the lease not to assign without leave caused a forfeiture of the right to renewal.\nJudgment appealed from (17 Ont. L.R. 254) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nIn 1904 the appellant Loveless and one Barbour, partners in business, became assignees of a lease for a term to expire in August, 1907, and signed an agree- ment to pay the rent and observe all the obligations, stipulations and agreements contained therein. The lease contained a covenant by the lessees not \u201cto assign or sub-let without leave,\u201d and provided that the lessors, in case the lessees had kept and performed all their covenants and agreements and should give notice in writing to the lessors six months before the term expired that they required it, would grant a renewal of the lease for a further term of five years.\nThe six months\u2019 notice for renewal was given, but before the term expired the partnership between the lessees was dissolved and Barbour, without leave of the lessors, assigned all his interest in the lease to his co-lessee Loveless. When the term ended the lessors refused to renew and brought an action for possession of the premises.\nThe two questions raised for decision in the case were: 1. Was the assignment by Barbour to his co\u2011partner a breach of the covenant not to assign without leave? 2. If it was, having been made after the notice was given did it work a forfeiture of the right to a renewal?\nThe trial judge and Court of Appeal held that there had been a breach of the covenant not to assign, which entitled the lessors to re-enter and take possession of the premises. The lessee Loveless appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGibbons K.C. and Geo. S. Gibbons for the appellant. As soon as the notice was given, no breach having occurred up to that time at all events, the term was extended. 24 Cyc., p. 1008; Finch v. Underwood[2]; Bastin v. Bidwell[3].\nThe breach, if any, was waived by the subsequent acceptance of rent. Foa on Landlord and Tenant (4 ed.), pp. 263 et seq.; Davenport v. The Queen[4]; Croft v. Lumby[5].\nA transfer to a co-partner is not a breach of the covenant not to assign. Grove v. Portal[6]; Corporation of Bristol v. Westcott[7].\nVarley v. Coppard[8] is not an authority against the present appellant. In that case there was no privity of covenant between the lessor and the assignee of the term, while here the retiring partner, Barbour, still remains liable to the lessor on his covenants. Moreover, later cases have shaken its authority. See Langton v. Henson[9]; Horsey Estate, Limited v. Steiger[10].\nShepley K.C. and Judd K.C. for the respondents. The lessees were tenants in common only. R.S.O. [1897] ch. 119, sec. 11.\nNo case of waiver is made out. The trial judge decided against appellant on the point and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nVarley v. Coppard[11] is conclusive in our favour. It has been followed in England and was discussed in Munro v. Waller[12], where the distinction was made between parting with possession and assigning. THE CHIEF JUSTICE was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014During the argument I was inclined to the opinion that Mr. Gibbons has successfully distinguished Varley v. Coppard11. Subsequent reflection and consultation with my colleagues however convinced me that I was wrong, and that in this appeal that case should be treated as correctly stating the law applicable to the facts before us. I have read the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin and concur in his reasoning and conclusion.\nIDINGTON J. and DUFF J. agreed with Anglin J.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant Loveless appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Meredith C.J. awarding to his landlords possession of certain leasehold premises in the City of London.\nThe original lease of these premises, made for a term of five years to N.F. Yeo and A.P. Yeo, was assigned by them with the approval of the lessor to the defendants Barbour and Loveless, who were partners in trade. It contained a provision for extension for a further term of five years upon the tenants observing all their covenants and giving written notice six months before the expiration of the original term of their desire for such extension. The lessees had covenanted not to assign without leave. The tenants, Barbour and Loveless, gave due notice of their desire for an extension. After the notice had been given and before the expiry of the original term they dissolved partnership and thereupon Barbour, without the leave of the landlords, assigned his interest in the lease to Loveless. This, the plaintiffs maintain, was a breach of the covenant not to assign without leave, and entitled them to refuse the extension demanded. The tenant Loveless refusing to quit the premises on the expiry of the original term, this action was brought to recover possession from him.\nThe defendant rests his appeal upon two grounds: (1) that the transfer without leave, upon dissolution of the partnership, of the interest of his erst-while partner in the leasehold premises, which had been occupied by the partnership, did not constitute a breach of the covenant against assignment without leave; (2) that if it were such a breach of covenant it would not disentitle him to the benefit of the extended term because it occurred after he and his former partner had given to the landlords notice of their intention to exercise their option for an extension of their term; that an assignment thereafter could operate only\u2014if at all\u2014as a ground of forfeiture, and that as a ground of forfeiture it had not only not been taken advantage of, but had been waived by the landlords\u2019 acceptance of two gales of rent.\nThe first point is, in my opinion, concluded against the appellant by Varley v. Coppard[13]. The only differences between that case and this are, first, that there the lease was made originally to a single tenant and was afterwards assigned to two partners in trade, while in the present case there were two original lessees, who, with the landlords\u2019 consent, assigned to the appellant and his partner; and, second, that in Varley v. Coppard13 there was merely privity of estate between the landlord and the assignees of the lease, whereas here the appellant and his partner had covenanted directly with the landlord for payment of rent, etc.\nThe rights and obligations of assignees of a lease, who hold subject to a covenant against assignment without leave, must in my view be the same, whether the lease was originally made to a single lessee or to several lessees. I find nothing in the slight difference in this respect distinguishing the present case in principle from Varley v. Coppard13.\nThat there is privity of covenant between the landlord and the assignees in the present case and that the assignor therefore remained liable to the landlord for the rent of the premises for the remainder of the term, notwithstanding the assignment, whereas in Varley v. Coppard14 there being no such privity of covenant but only privity of estate, the assignor\u2019s liability to the landlord for rent ceased upon the assignment, seems at first blush a difference of substance. But the covenant not to assign without leave cannot mean one thing where the liability of the assigning tenant to pay rent depends merely upon privity of estate and quite another where that liability rests also upon covenant. What amounts to a breach in the one case must likewise constitute a breach in the other. The adventitious circumstance that the out-going partner remained liable for rent because of his covenant to pay rent during the term cannot affect the construction of the entirely independent covenant not to assign without leave. The transfer may be less palpably injurious to the landlord\u2014indeed, it may be that it does not injure or prejudice him at all\u2014yet, if Varley v. Coppard[14] is rightly decided, it is none the less a breach of the covenant and entitles the landlord to exercise whatever rights accrue to him upon such a breach.\nIn Corporation of Bristol v. Westcott[15] Jessel M.R., referring to Varley v. Coppard14, said:\nI do not know that I should have decided even that case in the same way for the deed was not in point of law an assignment,\na remark which is relied upon as casting some doubt upon the earlier case. But in Langton v. Henson[16], Buckley J. points out that this was said \u201cby way of dictum,\u201d and he adds:\nWhere one of two joint tenants assigns to another, or, as Sir George Jessel prefers to call it, releases to the other, he does most effectually deal with the estate; he destroys the privity of estate between himself and his lessor; the estate is affected; something has been parted with. The case of Corporation of Bristol v. Westcott15, in my opinion, leaves Varley v. Coppard14 altogether unaffected.\nHawkins J. expresses the same view in Horsey Estate, Limited v. Steiger[17].\nAs partners, the appellant and his former partner were not joint tenants, but tenants in common of the leasehold premises which were partnership property, and therefore a conveyance of the interest of one to the other must be by assignment and not by release.\nVarley v. Coppard[18], decided in 1872, has been accepted by leading text-writers as authority for the proposition that an assignment without leave by one of two lessee-partners to the other is a breach of a covenant not to assign without leave. Woodfall (18 ed.), p. 755; Foa (4 ed.), p. 278. It has been followed since the Bristol Case[19] in what appears to be a carefully considered case by a Divisional Court in Ontario, Munro v. Waller[20], and should, I think, be now regarded as an accepted authority.\nThe right of the lessees to the further term is made to depend upon the fulfilment of two conditions precedent\u2014one, their giving six months before the expiration of the term originally created written notice that they require a further term; and the other, performance by them of all covenants in the lease. No question arises as to the first condition; the requisite notice was duly given at a time when there had been no breach of covenant by the tenants.\nThe appellant maintains that the second condition means not that the lessees must as a condition precedent fulfil their covenants throughout the entire original term, but that observance of them shall be required as a condition precedent only up to the time when notice requiring a further term is given and that a breach thereafter is not of a condition precedent, but merely of an ordinary covenant giving to the landlord a right of forfeiture of the further term vested in the tenants by their notice. It is obvious that if this contention should prevail, the lessees, by giving the requisite notice for extension immediately after taking their lease, would entirely eliminate observance of their covenants as a condition precedent to their right to have such extension.\nThis certainly was not the intention of the parties, and I find nothing in the agreement to warrant such a construction. The agreement is that the lessor \u201cwill allow the lessees to occupy the said premises for a further term of five years commencing at the expiration of the term hereby created,\u201d \u201cif the lessees have duly kept and performed all the covenants, provisos, and agreements in these presents contained.\u201d These words clearly import observance of covenants, etc., up to the time at which the lessor agrees to permit occupation for the further term to begin, which is at \u201cthe expiration of the term hereby created.\u201d\nThe appellant relies upon a statement of Mellish L.J. in Finch v. Underwood[21], to the effect that such a condition is satisfied if the covenants \u201chave been so observed and performed that there is no existing right of action under them at the time when the lease is applied for.\u201d Kay J., quoting this language in Bastin v. Bidwell[22], at p. 250, says: \u201cThat must mean, I suppose, at the time when the notice was given.\u201d\nIn neither of these cases was it necessary to determine this point. In both the lessees had broken their covenants to repair before the notice for renewal was given, and the state of disrepair actually subsisted at the date of the notice. I must respectfully decline to follow this mere obiter dictum of Mellish L.J., as interpreted by Kay J.\nThe cases of Hersey v. Giblett[23], and Nicholson v. Smith[24], cited by the appellant upon this point do not appear to be at all relevant.\nThe assignment by Barbour to Loveless constituting a breach of a covenant at a time when its observance was still a condition precedent to the right of extension, the landlord was justified in refusing the extension demanded.

The \"originating summons\" was issued under section 57 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance,\" by Beck J. merely as persona designata or curia nominatim, and, in hearing and deciding the appeal from his order, the full court was acting in a similar capacity. There was no \"action\" taken within the meaning of the definition contained in the second section of the Alberta statute, 7 Edw. VII. ch. 3. This court, consequently, has no jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal. The matter in controversy arose before the Board of License Commissioners, appointed under the \"Liquor License Ordinance,\" and the subsequent proceedings, under section 57 of that ordinance, were merely the summary procedure provided thereby in reference to the license granted by them. We rely upon the decisions in Angus v. The Calgary School Trustees[1]; The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Little Seminary of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[2]; The James Bay Railway Co. v.

By a provincial statute, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 91, sec. 1 (Que.), the deed was validated and ratified. On the sale, in execution, of the tramway, as a going concern:\u2014\nHeld, that whether, at the time of such sale, the cars in question were movable or immovable in character the effect of the deed and ratifying statute was to subordinate the rights of other creditors to those of the trustees, and, consequently, that unpaid vendors thereof were not entitled, under article 2000 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, to priority of payment by privilege upon the distribution of the moneys realized on the sale in execution.\nPer Girouard J.\u2014Duff J., contra.\u2014After the cars in question had been delivered to the tramway company and used by it in the operation of their tramway, they became immovable by destination.\nIn the result, the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 18 K.B. 82) was affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's & Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, by which the appellants' opposition afin de conserver was dismissed with costs.\nThe property of the L\u00eavis County Railway Company, consisting of certain real estate and other property, including an electric tramway and the cars used in the operation of the tramway system, was sold in execution and the appellants filed an opposition afin de conserver claiming the right to be paid, by privilege as unpaid vendors, the amount due to them by the railway company for the price of a number of the tramcars, a rotary plough and a tower-waggon which they had sold and delivered to the railway company some time previously. The cars, etc., were operated by the company as part of their electric tramway system upon rails laid, by permission of the municipal corporation, upon public streets, the title to which remained vested in the municipality, the railway company never acquiring any title as proprietor to the soil in these streets which were public highways of the municipality.\nThe opposition was contested by the trust company, which claimed the whole amount levied by the sheriff as prior mortgagees or hypothecary creditors. Their claim was based upon a deed of hypothec by which, under art. 5132 R.S.Q., the railway company, in order to secure the payment of an issue of debenture-bonds held by the trust company, mortgaged and hypothecated to the trust company certain parcels of land and the electric railway of the company with all the real property thereof, * * * the rails, cars * * * rolling stock and equipment appurtenant thereto or used in connection therewith; and, further, to secure the interest on the bonds, the company transferred to the trust company all its movable property and all its present and future revenues. This deed and the issue of the debentures were validated and ratified by the statute, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 91, sec. 1 (Que.), prior to the sale of the cars, etc., by the appellants.\nBy the judgment appealed from, the judgment of Mr. Justice Lemieux dismissing the opposition was, in effect, confirmed. In rendering his judgment in the court below (not printed in the report), Mr. Justice Cross concludes as follows: \"It is contended for the appellant that the cars, etc., of which the price is claimed were movables and I incline to think that, as regards the cars, though perhaps not as regards the tower-waggon and sweeper, this view would be the correct one, if it were merely a case of determining in a general way whether these objects fell within the terms of article 384 C.C. or within those of article 379 C.C. These cars can be taken from place to place and it is common enough for such vehicles to be found from time to time in use on the lines of other railway companies, so that they are such objects as are mentioned in article 384. However, even if they be considered movables, the special statute has declared them to have been validly pledged, and, this being so, the privilege of the unpaid vendor would, by article 2000 C.C, have been subordinated to the right of the pledgee. The correct conclusion appears to be that the mortgage was intended to be a charge upon the railway company's undertaking as a \"going concern\" and that, in so far as may be necessary to give effect to the intention, the cars, sweeper and tower-waggon are to be considered as having been made part of the realty. I would, consequently, confirm the judgment.\"\nG. F. Henderson K.C. and Cannon, for the appellants.\nG. G. Stuart K.C., for the respondents.\nGirouard J.\u2014Article 2000 of the Civil Code does not apply. The thing sold is not in the same condition. Before delivery the cars were movable property; after delivery and being operated as part of a railway system they became immovable by destination. Art. 379 C.C. Therefore the appellants fail in their appeal and in dismissing the same we merely follow the well settled jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec, especially the following cases: Wallbridge v. Farwell[2]; Lain\u00ea v. B\u00ealand[3] and Redfield v. Corporation of Wickham, in 1888[4]. At all events the mortgage deed, ratified by statute, gives a preference to the holders of the debentures over the vendors.\nIdington J.\u2014In Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[5] the Privy Council was asked to hold cars to be real estate and their Lordships, at p. 814, say\nthey cannot accede to the argument addressed to them or adopt the reasoning of Osier J. in Kirkpatrick's Case[6] (where such a proposition was maintained) without doing violence to the English language and to elementary principles of English law.\nThat case is not decisive of this one, but is most suggestive. There was not, when the earlier Quebec cases relied on herein were decided holding locomotives to be immovable property when owned and used by a railway company, so much difference between the English law and the law of Quebec as to what constituted real property (widely different as the respective laws of these provinces governing real property were and are) that we should expect to find now such a wide divergence as will result from following in Ontario cases the reasoning in the Privy Council above referred to, and in Quebec cases the reasoning of certain cases in the courts of that province and in this court in the cases of Wallbridge v. Farwell[7], and The Ontario Car and Foundry Co. v. Farwell7.\nIt is not expedient that such a divergence should be needlessly developed.\nThe agreement relied upon by the respondent was validated by the competent authority of the Legislature of Quebec and the charges it was intended to secure declared binding to all intents and purposes in comprehensive language that needs no support from any judicial theories as to the development of art. 379 of the Civil Code.\nWhen we see the rather absurd results these theories may, if adopted, produce in the case of interprovincial railways and other cases, we should, I respectfully submit, refrain from helping to embarrass by saying that which may do so.\nThat article cannot cover the quite possible case of a street railway that never was the proprietor of any real estate on which to place its cars. But what of such a railway which had parted with its real estate and yet continued to run cars? On the theory put forward would the cars after the company's sale of its real estate be possessed of exigible or inexigible real estate whilst running by virtue of a temporary license on His Majesty's highway?\nI by no means feel that the last word has been spoken in this court on the question. It may be quite as open to the Privy Council to find that what has been said in Quebec and in this court did as much violence to the elementary principles of Quebec law and to the language of the Civil Code as that court declared the reasoning above referred to did the English law and language.\nIn view of all that I do not desire to commit myself to any expression of opinion upon the bearing of the decision and emphatic expression of the law in the judgment in the case of Toronto Railway Co. v. The City of Toronto[8] upon the case now in hand. Indeed, I do not think it has much to do with it. I prefer to rest on the safe ground the validating statute above referred to gives.\nThe appellant seeks to enforce, after the time for revendication had elapsed, a privilege in respect of the proceeds of a judicial sale of property which the legislature had, by validating the deed, in effect declared charged with the payment of other liabilities; and which became operative and charged on the property now in question the moment the appellant had delivered the goods or immediately after its rights of revendication were gone. Moreover, I incline to hold it may fairly be inferred their condition had changed and they had not remained, as required by the art. 2000 C.C. giving the privilege in the same state as when sold. The privilege is given by the Code on the proceeds of sale. But the validating Act provides specifically for the distribution of the proceeds in question and thereby overrides the general law by words that ignore such a privilege. It provides for superior liens which I take it means liens upon the property.\nThis privilege claimed herein can hardly be held to fall within the term \"liens on the property.\"\nThe point raised of the intention of the legislature in a private Act, such as this now in question, in regard to the rights of parties concerned but not named does not seem to me to have much force when we find the claim rested on transactions taking place long after the passing of the Act.\nIf the privilege had been in existence or the transaction out of which it might have arisen had taken place before the passing of the Act I think the point taken might have been more arguable.\nI hardly think the rule of interpretation invoked to except this case could ever have been intended to apply to a non-existent class of persons or personal rights.\nThe claim set up anent the payment to debenture-holders of interest in preference to the current expenses does not seem to be open in this proceeding, and the opinion expressed in the case of Farwell1)[9] above cited seems to indicate might fail in any proceeding.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014There are two questions raised by this appeal; first: Were the cars in respect of which the appellants claim a preference immeubles par destination at the time of the sale of them? And secondly: If not, is the right of the respondents under their mortgage superior to the preference to which the appellants are entitled as unpaid vendors?\nThe first question must, I think, with great respect, be answered in the negative. Article 379 provides as follows:\nLes objets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire a plac\u00e9s sur son fonds \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, ou qu'il y a incorpor\u00e9s, sont immeubles par destination tant qu'ils y restent;\nand it is well settled law that this immobilization par destination takes place only when the \"propri\u00e9taire\" of the fonds is also the propri\u00e9taire of the meuble affected. The weight of the opinion appears to be to the effect that in this provision the word \"propri\u00e9taire\" is to be construed stricto sensu.\nThus Laurent, at Vol. V., No. 437:\nDu principe que nous venons de poser, suit que le locataire et le fermier ne peuvent pas immobiliser les objets mobiliers qu'ils placent sur le fonds, ni par destination agricole ou industrielle, ni par perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. Aubry et Rau t. II., p. 12, note 33, et les auteurs et arr\u00eats qui y sont cit\u00e9s. Il en est de m\u00eame des d\u00e9tenteurs qui ont un droit r\u00e9el sur la chose; l'usufruitier, l'emphyt\u00e9ote, le superficiaire ne peuvent pas immobiliser.\nThe other authorities are referred to in 2 Mignault, p. 417. Does it appear that the railway company was the propri\u00e9taire of a fundus upon which the cars in question were placed by it \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure? There is here, of course, no question of incorporation. The railway company was empowered to operate an electric railway in the town of L\u00eavis; that is to say, they were authorized to lay their tracks and run their cars in the streets and so on. They were the owners, doubtless, of depots where the cars would be when not in use; when in use, they would be upon the company's tracks which would mainly be situated in the streets. Now it seems quite impossible to hold in respect of the depots where they were put when not in use that the cars were placed there \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure within the meaning of this article. One might as well say that the pictures in a gallery built for their reception become immeubles par destination; or the taximeters in a garage. The car, no more than the automobile, is the accessory of the building which serves to protect it when not in use; rather the inverse. And there is a stronger case for the immobilization of the pictures than that of the cars; for the car does not perform its normal function while within the car barns. Then: Did the track constitute a fundus of which the company was the propri\u00e9taire and to which the car became attached \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure? That cannot, I think, be affirmed because the track was mainly in the highway and I am unable to doubt that the agreement between the company and the municipality and the statute ratifying that agreement did not confer upon the company any proprietary interest in subsoil or surface of the highway. Precisely what the rights of the company in respect of the highway were it may not be easy to say; probably they cannot with accuracy be expressed in the terms of the Civil Code. They were statutory rights and, I should prefer to say, sui generis. I can, however, entertain no doubt, having regard to the settled legislative policy declared in article 752 of the Municipal Code (under which alienation of any part of a municipal road is forbidden), that the statute and agreement cannot fairly be read as investing the company with any proprietary interest in the streets upon which its tracks might be laid. The legislature could have departed from its settled policy, of course; but the concessionaires who contend they have done so must, in support of this view, point to language much more clearly exhibiting such an intention than any found in the agreement under which the company was operating.\nIt cannot, moreover, be said, without blinking the facts, that the cars were accessory to the tracks. The truth plainly is that depots, cars, track, all were means employed in working an enterprise of transportation. Each of these instruments was in a practical sense essential to the enterprise. They were all accessories to it; as among the instruments themselves it involves, I think, some glossing of the actual facts to describe any one of them as an accessory in relation to another.\nOn principle, therefore, I think the immobilization of these cars is not established. There are, however, authorities which my learned brother Girouard thinks decide the point, and in the opposite sense. The cases bearing on the point are referred to in Ontario Car and Foundry Co. v. Farwell[10]. I do not of course, question the authority of that decision so far as it goes. But, with great respect, I do not think it can be held to involve any principle governing the determination of the question actually before us. The decision in Farwell's Case (1), as well as the decisions of the Quebec courts upon which it was founded, related solely to railways owning the land upon which their cars would normally be in use. The first of the objections indicated above obviously would have no application in such a case and is, therefore, I think, not met by those decisions.\nThe appellants, however, fail, I think, on the second point. There is some difference of opinion respecting the legal character of the preference attached to the claim of an unpaid vendor by art. 2000 C.C. The preferable view, I think, is that it is not in the nature of a droit r\u00e9el in the thing itself since it affects no dismemberment of the property and confers neither any dominion over the thing nor the droit de suite, but is merely a right incidental to the vendors' personal claim resting upon a privilegium inter personales actiones; 3 Aubry et Rau 256; 2 Planiol 2548.\nBy the text of the law it yields to the express nantissement of the pledgee and to the implied pledge of the lessor (art. 2000 C.C.); and it obviously cannot successfully be asserted against the droit de retention. The question is: Ought it to prevail against a security of the character constituted by the respondents' mortgage? With great respect I have a good deal of difficulty in holding that this security falls within the class described as pledge in art. 2000 C.C.; but putting that question aside I think the security created by the mortgage is such that by its very nature it must prevail as against the vendor's preference.\nThe mortgage unquestionably establishes a droit r\u00e9el in all the personal as well as the real property of the company. The property in the meubles in question passed to the company and it is this property which by the express terms of the instrument is transferred to the mortgagees as security for the company's indebtedness. It would, I think, require an express text to justify the recognition of a preference resting as I have said upon a mere privilegium inter personales actiones as superior to such a security.\nIt was vigorously argued that we ought not to give to the legislation ratifying the mortgage such a meaning and effect as would prejudice pre-existing rights. But to that there seem to be several answers. The appellants' right to a preference had not accrued when the statute was passed and might never accrue. In these circumstances it may be questionable whether the rule invoked could have any application at all. Then the rule is only a canon of construction and must yield when a contrary intention sufficiently appears. Now under the \"Railway Act\" the company was expressly authorized to \"mortgage\" its movable property. Used in the context \"hypothecate, mortgage and pledge\" the word imports a legal process differing from both that of hypothecation and that of pledging; and having regard to the well known practice throughout Canada in respect of railway mortgages, of which one cannot suppose the legislature to have been ignorant, there can be no doubt that it imports the power to transfer the property as security while retaining the possession. Nobody would, of course, doubt the power of the legislature to create a form of security unknown to the common law of Quebec; and the legislative sanction of a security of the kind indicated implied an authority to the company to burden its meubles (while retaining possession of them) with charges superior to the preference of the unpaid vendors. It would unduly strain the principle invoked to hold that legislation validating the particular form in which that had been done was inoperative in respect of claims of preference advanced after the date of the legislation solely on account of such preference arising out of sales which took place before the statute was passed.\nAnglin J.\u2014Assuming that the opposants have a right of appeal from the interlocutory judgment upon demurrers dealt with in the Court of King's Bench, I am of opinion that upon this part of their appeal they must fail. I find nothing in the instrument of hypothecation or in the statute by which it was ratified, which confers upon them any right of preference over the claim of the respondents. It is not revenue of the company (upon which working expenses may be a prior charge), but proceeds of the sale of its property with which the court is dealing. The respondents' mortgage is no doubt in the form of a trust deed, but the appellants are not cestuis que trustent and the deed certainly does not create any lien in their favour superior or equal to that of the bond-holders, whom the respondents represent.\nIf we were here dealing with cars of a railway system operating upon a right of way of which the railway company was the proprietor, I would deem this case concluded by the decisions of this court in Ontario Car and Foundry Co. v. Farwell[11], and Lain\u00ea v. B\u00ealand[12], approving and adopting what has been uniform jurisprudence of half a century in the Province of Quebec.\nThe law of Quebec upon the question of immobilization is derived not from English, but from French sources; Morrison v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[13], at p. 319; and in the Farwell Case (1) Strong J., for that reason, guards himself against being taken to establish a precedent in cases arising in provinces subject to the English system of law. The decision of the Privy Council in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[14], which proceeded upon the principles of English law in force in Ontario, was not intended to be and, in my opinion, is not an authority upon the law prevailing in the Province of Quebec and would not warrant this court in treating its own decisions in the Farwell Case[15] and in Lain\u00ea v. B\u00ealaud[16], as overruled. But, in the case of a street railway operated upon highways of which the tram company is in no sense proprietor, it may well be that the foundation for an application of the provisions of art. 379 C.C. is lacking; and, in some future case in which it may be necessary to deal with that question, the status of the rolling stock of such a railway may be held not determined by the decisions of this court which have been cited\nIn the present case whatever the character of the rolling stock in question\u2014whether movable or immovable\u2014the language of the respondent's security is sufficiently comprehensive to include it. The efficacy and the validity of that security have been declared by an Act of the legislature. It contains provisions for the distribution of the proceeds of a sale of the property covered by the security which seem to be inconsistent with the existence in regard to that property of such a right as the appellants assert.

While the plaintiff was in the performance of his work in re-plugging one of these orifices an explosion occurred which caused the injuries complained of. There was no evidence of contributory negligence.\nHeld, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that, apart from any presumption arising under article 1054 C.C., the fact of the explosion occurring under such circumstances sufficiently established actionable negligence on the part of the company.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. (Girouard and Duff JJ. contra, and Idington J. expressing no opinion upon the question), that, under article 1054 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, masters and employers, as well as other persons, are responsible for damages caused by things under their control or care where they fail to establish that the cause of the injury was attributable to the fault of the person injured, to vis major or to pure accident, or that it occurred without fault imputable to themselves.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 18 K.B. 271) reversing the decision of the Court of Review (Q.R. 35 S.C. 285), affirmed, Duff J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review[2], and restoring that of Cannon J., at the trial, whereby the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the head-note.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and Howard, for the appellants.\nS. Beaudin K.C. and Martel K.C., for the respondent.\nLe Juge en Chef.\u2014J'emprunte le r\u00e9cit des faits de la cause aux notes du juge Archambault \u00e0 la cour d'appel.\nL'appelante poss\u00e8de, \u00e0 Shawinigan Falls, Province de Qu\u00e9bec, une manufacture de carbure.\nEn 1906, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 son emploi. Il \u00e9tait tenu, avec un autre compagnon de travail, nomm\u00e9 Laro-chelle, de surveiller une fournaise qui servait \u00e0 fondre le carbure.\nCette fournaise \u00e9tait chauff\u00e9e au moyen de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et fonctionnait jour et nuit.\nL'intim\u00e9 et Larochelle faisaient le travail de nuit, de sept heures du soir \u00e0 sept heures du matin.\nLeur ouvrage consistait \u00e0 remplir la fournaise de charbon et de chaux, et \u00e0 la vider chaque heure, pour en faire couler le carbure.\nCette op\u00e9ration se faisait par trois ou quatre orifices qui se trouvaient au bas de la fournaise, et par lesquels s'\u00e9chappait le carbure en fusion.\nUne fois la fournaise vid\u00e9e, on nettoyait l'orifice par lequel le carbure venait de couler; puis, avant de remplir la fournaise de nouveau, on le bouchait au moyen de tampons de mortier.\nLarochelle pla\u00e7ait un tampon \u00e0 rentr\u00e9e de l'orifice, et l'intim\u00e9 poussait le tampon jusqu'au fond de l'ouverture, \u00e0 l'aide d'une longue tige de fer termin\u00e9e par une plaque circulaire.\nLe 27 juillet 1906, l'intim\u00e9 et Larochelle se rendirent \u00e0 leur ouvrage, comme d'habitude, \u00e0 sept heures du soir.\nLa fournaise avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie par les deux ouvriers de jour, et lorsque le moment fut arriv\u00e9 de la vider, l'intim\u00e9 et Larochelle firent couler le carbure; puis l'intim\u00e9 nettoya l'ouverture par o\u00f9 le carbure venait de sortir, Larochelle pla\u00e7a un tampon de mortier \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de cette m\u00eame ouverture, et pendant que l'intim\u00e9 l'y poussait avec sa tige de fer, il se produisit tout \u00e0 coup une explosion, les deux ouvriers furent renvers\u00e9s par terre, et il s'\u00e9chappa de l'orifice un jet de carbure liquide et enflamm\u00e9 qui atteignit l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la figure, et lui br\u00fbla compl\u00e8tement les deux yeux.\nL'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9clame de l'appelante $10,000 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour l'accident dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\nLa cour de premi\u00e8re instance a maintenu l'action, et lui a accord\u00e9 $4,000 de dommages.\nL'appelante en appela \u00e0 la cour de revision qui annula le jugement et d\u00e9bouta l'intim\u00e9 de son action.\nDe la cour de revision la cause fut port\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour d'appel qui r\u00e9tablit le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nLe jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance est bas\u00e9 sur le fait que la fournaise qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage \u00e9tant sous la garde de la compagnie cette compagnie \u00e9tait responsable des dommages et que au surplus il y avait preuve de faute. La cour de revision, au contraire, d\u00e9clare que cette fournaise \u00e9tait sous le contr\u00f4le de Doucet et ajoute que ce dernier n'a montr\u00e9 aucune faute de la part de la compagnie appelante et qu'il \u00e9tait tenu de faire cette preuve pour avoir un recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats contre cette derni\u00e8re.\nA la cour d'appel, la majorit\u00e9 des juges semble avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en fait que la faute \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie et en droit que la preuve de faute n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire vu qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la fournaise \u00e9tait sous la garde de l'appelante, attendu que la faute est alors pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e par la loi.\nPour ma part je suis d'avis que la fournaise \u00e9tait sous la garde de l'appelante qui l'utilisait \u00e0 son profit et qui tirait un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du risque qu'elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9. Celui qui per\u00e7oit les \u00e9moluments procur\u00e9s par une machine susceptible de nuire au tiers doit s'attendre \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice que cette machine causera. \"Ubi emolumentum ibi onus.\" D. 1900, 2, 289: D. 1904, 2, 257. Notes de M. Josserand.\nJ'accepte donc sur le fait de la garde la conclusion tir\u00e9e de la preuve par le juge Cannon en premi\u00e8re instance et adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour d'appel. La fournaise appartenait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e qui l'exploitait \u00e0 son profit et s'en servait en vue de r\u00e9aliser des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices dans son industrie.\nEtant admis que la fournaise \u00e9tait au moment de l'accident sous la garde de l'appelante, je pense comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance; le fait m\u00eame de l'accident et ses diverses circonstances, r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par le t\u00e9moignage, fournissent toute la preuve de n\u00e9gligence que pouvait et que devait n\u00e9cessairement produire le demandeur Doucet. Le cas actuel rel\u00e8ve, \u00e0 mon avis, des m\u00eames principes que celui de McArthur v. The Dominion Cartridge Co.(1). Il est abondamment prouv\u00e9 qu'il n'y eut ni faute, ni n\u00e9gligence de la part de l'ouvrier et aucune explication ni aucun essai d'explication de l'accident ne sont donn\u00e9s par la compagnie appelante. Son surintendant, Porcheron, entendu comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 d\u00e9charge, dit qu'il ignore comment arriva l'accident, bien qu'il surveill\u00e2t lui-m\u00eame la. fournaise o\u00f9 se produisit l'explosion. A supposer, ce que d'ailleurs il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider pour les fins du pr\u00e9sent litige, que dans un cas relevant de l'article 1053 du code civil, il faille pour cr\u00e9er la responsabilit\u00e9 la preuve positive d'une faute, je ne puis justifier l'application de ce principe au cas d'un individu poursuivi, comme responsable de dommages caus\u00e9s par une chose inanim\u00e9e dont il a la garde, ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. En un mot, en face de l'article 1053 qui d'apr\u00e8s certains auteurs et la jurisprudence fait de la faute ou de la n\u00e9gligence la base de la responsabilit\u00e9 je place l'article 1054 al. 1 in fine qui est \u00e0 mon avis le seul applicable et d'apr\u00e8s lequel \"on est responsable des choses que l'on a sous sa garde.\" Le sens que je donne \u00e0 ce dernier texte c'est que tout propri\u00e9taire est responsable en raison m\u00eame de sa qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa chose lorsqu'elle est sous sa garde. Le principe de responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par cet article est l'id\u00e9e de garde. J'ajoute si faisant \u00e0 cette cause une fausse application de l'article 1053 C.C. on dit: le principe essentiel est que sans faute point d'obligation, m\u00eame alors, au dire de Lord Mac-naghten parlant au nom du comit\u00e9 judiciaire, dans la cause de Mc Arthur v. The Dominion Cartridge Co.[3], il ne serait pas raisonnable de l'appliquer en toute rigueur, vu les circonstances; en effet, comme dans\nl'affaire McArthur[4], l'accident cause du dommage\nfut l'\u0153uvre d'un instant; l'\u0153il humain n'en put d\u00e9couvrir l'origine ni en suivre le d\u00e9veloppement. \"In lege\naquilia, et culpa levissima venit.\" Domat, Lois Civiles, 1\u00e8re partie, livre II., tit. VIII., sec. 4, n, I. (\u00e9dit. R\u00e9my, L, p. 480); Baudry-Lacantinerie, Obligations, vol. 3, No. 2868. La faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re suffit pour faire encourir la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 1053 C.C. J'ai lu avec le plus grand int\u00e9r\u00eat le jugement tr\u00e8s soign\u00e9 et, s'il m'est permis de le dire, tr\u00e8s complet et tr\u00e8s savant de mon coll\u00e8gue Duff; et, tout en admettant une grande partie de sa th\u00e8se, j'h\u00e9site \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'article du code civil de Qu\u00e9bec (1054) qui pose, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, le principe de responsabilit\u00e9 applicable au cas qui nous occupe, une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente de celle que les plus hautes autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises donnent aujourd'hui \u00e0 l'article correspondant du code Napol\u00e9on. Je sugg\u00e8re que mon savant coll\u00e8gue ne donne pas au membre de phrase qui se trouve \u00e0 la fin de l'article 1054 C.C. al. 1 cit\u00e9 plus haut tout son effet. Que ces mots soient rest\u00e9s inaper\u00e7us, comme le dit Planiol, pendant pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle explique peut-\u00eatre l'erreur doctrinale sur laquelle est bas\u00e9e la jurisprudence qu'il invoque.\nDans leur rapport, les commissaires disent (p. 16) que la s\u00e9rie des articles 1053-1056 C.C. ne diff\u00e8re pas ou ne diff\u00e8re que par l'expression des articles correspondants du code Napol\u00e9on. Dans ces circonstances, nous devons attacher la plus haute valeur \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e aux articles du code fran\u00e7ais par les tribunaux et par ses commentateurs les plus autoris\u00e9s; et, dans toutes les questions de droit o\u00f9 la doctrine et la jurisprudence tombent d'accord, apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es de conflit et de discussion, je me sens presque forc\u00e9 d'accepter leur conclusion commune et d\u00e9finitive.\nIl me suffit, pour le but que je me propose ici, d'exposer les trois syst\u00e8mes qui ont pr\u00e9valu tour \u00e0 tour, en France, et en Belgique, sur cette question. Je les trouve \u00e9nonc\u00e9s avec une clart\u00e9 et une concision admirables dans Pas. 1904, 1, 246 (argument de l'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral):\nNous croyons inutile de vous rem\u00e9morer l'\u00e9tat de la doctrine et de la jurisprudence, tant en France qu'en Belgique, sur la question de droit que nous avons \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre (c'est-\u00e0-dire la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses inanim\u00e9es que l'on a sous sa garde); nous nous bornerons \u00e0 rappeler que trois syst\u00e8mes principaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis tour-\u00e0-tour:\n\"1. La responsabilit\u00e9 est encourue du moment o\u00f9 il est \u00e9tabli que le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la chose, sans qu'il soit besoin de d\u00e9montrer soit le vice de la chose, soit la faute du gardien;\n\"2. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 n'existe que si le gardien a commis une faute; mais l'article 1384, paragraphe 1er, \u00e9tablit quant \u00e0 cette faute une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale;\n\"3. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e que si la victime de l'accident caus\u00e9 par la chose d\u00e9montre l'existence d'une faute dans le chef du gardien.\"\nEt le syst\u00e8me expos\u00e9 dans le second paragraphe, comme j'aurai l'occasion de le montrer, a finalement triomph\u00e9 en France \u00e0 la cour de cassation, chambre civile et chambre des requ\u00eates, mais, pour emprunter le langage de la cour d'appel de Chamb\u00e9ry (12 juillet 1905, D. P. 1905, 2, 417) je dirais:\nSans entrer dans les controverses doctrinales soulev\u00e9es sur cette question par ceux qui veulent voir dans l'art. 1384 une pr\u00e9somption de faute, il y a lieu de reconna\u00eetre que, sainement compris, le point de vue auquel, selon nous, s'est plac\u00e9e la loi, est conforme \u00e0 la justice et \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9, puisque celui qui d\u00e9tient une chose et en tire avantage doit, par suite d'une l\u00e9gitime r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9, supporter les charges corr\u00e9latives \u00e0 cet avantage; qu'une th\u00e9orie contraire, en cas de survenance d'accident, pr\u00e9senterait le grave inconv\u00e9nient de m\u00e9conna\u00eetre les garanties de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9paration auxquelles, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bien organis\u00e9e, a droit la personne humaine. Je ne puis admettre que le mot \"faute\" soit employ\u00e9 dans l'article 1054, par.1, du code civil, pour signifier exclusivement un acte illicite et dommageable du fait de l'intention ou de la n\u00e9gligence. Saleilles dans \"Les accidents du travail' dit (p. 69):\nJe rappellerai tout d'abord certaines d\u00e9finitions anciennes qui ne laissent appara\u00eetre que le caract\u00e8re purement objectif de l'id\u00e9e de faute. Je les trouve dans Doneau, le grand initiateur parmi les anciens. Il d\u00e9finit la faute dans des termes auxquels notre article 1382[5] semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9 et qui, pas plus que lui, ne laissent appara\u00eetre aucune id\u00e9e de recherche subjective. Cest tout fait non pr\u00e9vu et exerc\u00e9 sans droit qui a caus\u00e9 dommage \u00e0 autrui, culpa est omne factum inconsultum quo nascitur alii injuria; donc une qualification mat\u00e9rielle du fait, un fait qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu, et l'on sous-entend qu'on aurait pu pr\u00e9voir, et un fait qui ne soit pas l'exercice d'un droit positif.\nAu surplus, quand on lit cet article 1054 C.C., il est impossible d'\u00e9tendre le sens du mot \"faute\" aux objets inanim\u00e9s. On ne saurait supposer que les r\u00e9dacteurs du code aient jamais voulu dire que toute personne est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par l\u00e0 faute d'une chose inanim\u00e9e dont elle a la garde; l'expression ne serait pas juridique.\nJe ne puis non plus interpr\u00e9ter les derniers mots du paragraphe en question dans le sens que celui qui a la garde ou le soin d'une chose n'est responsable des dommages qu'au cas o\u00f9 l'on prouve que l'accident r\u00e9sulte ou peut r\u00e9sulter d'un d\u00e9faut de construction dans l'objet, ou du fait de son fonctionnement. Ces mots pris dans leur sens litt\u00e9ral expriment une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 juridique que l'on retrouve dans toutes les l\u00e9gislations \"rien de ce qui appartient \u00e0 quelqu'un ne peut nuire impun\u00e9ment \u00e0 un autre.\"\nLa partie pr\u00e9tendue responsable peut n'avoir ni la connaissance du d\u00e9faut de construction, ni le moyen de s'en rendre compte; mais, si elle en a le soin et la garde, alors, d'apr\u00e8s les termes de l'article, elle est responsable des dommages caus\u00e9s par la chose dont elle a la garde. Cette interpr\u00e9tation qui applique la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle de responsabilit\u00e9 et au propri\u00e9taire ou gardien d'une chose inanim\u00e9e, et au propri\u00e9taire d'un animal, en vertu de l'article 1055, est la plus raisonnable du monde.\nSi, au lieu d'une machine, un animal e\u00fbt caus\u00e9 le dommage dont on se plaint ici, il y aurait eu pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 contre le propri\u00e9taire. Au nom de quel privil\u00e8ge pouvons-nous \u00e9tablir une distinction entre la chose mobili\u00e8re inanim\u00e9e et la b\u00eate sans raison? (Planiol, vol. 2, p. 283, no. 917, fin). De plus, pourquoi n'y aurait-il pas, dans le cas du gardien d'une chose, la m\u00eame pr\u00e9somption que celle qui existe dans le cas de celui qui a la tutelle d'un enfant, d'un ali\u00e9n\u00e9; la surveillance d'\u00e9coliers, d'apprentis? Toutes ces personnes sont vis\u00e9es par le m\u00eame article. Il n'est pas l\u00e0 question de faute. Le fait de la tutelle ou de la surveillance est le seul motif qui lie leur responsabilit\u00e9 et le seul point sur lequel le gardien, le parent, le tuteur ou le ma\u00eetre soient tenus en droit de rendre raison. La responsabilit\u00e9 sans la faute n'est pas inconnue au code civil de Qu\u00e9bec; par exemple, outre le cas vis\u00e9 par l'article 1055, l'article 1487 stipule que le vendeur d'une chose qui ne lui appartient pas est responsable des dommages \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'acheteur, sans allusion aucune \u00e0 la faute.\nQuant \u00e0 l'argument tir\u00e9 de la th\u00e9orie de l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, tel qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Duff, citant Esmein, je m'en rapporterai \u00e0 Baudry-Lacantinerie, \"Obligations,\" vol. 3, n. 2968.\nM. Esmein[6] ajoute que, suivant toutes les vraisemblances, les r\u00e9dacteurs du code n'ont admis que les cas de responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire, d\u00e9j\u00e0 connus dans notre ancien droit, c'est-\u00e0-dire la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire d'un animal et celle du propri\u00e9taire d'un b\u00e2timent. Et il renvoie aux ouvrages de Bourjon et de Domat. Selon nous, si nos anciens auteurs n'ont pas fait d'autre application du principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il ne faut point en conclure qu'ils n'ont pas reconnu l'existence de ce principe, mais simplement que les applications pr\u00e9vues par eux \u00e9taient les seules qui, de leur temps, eussent un int\u00e9r\u00eat pratique. Il est incontestable qu'au XVIIe et au XVIIIe si\u00e8cles, les choses mobili\u00e8res dangereuses \u00e9taient incomparablement moins nombreuses qu'\u00e0 notre \u00e9poque. N\u00e9anmoins, avant de parler de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des animaux, Domat pose la r\u00e8gle dans les termes les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La fa\u00e7on dont il s'exprime m\u00e9rite qu'on la remarque: \"L'ordre qui lie les hommes en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dit-il, ne les oblige pas seulement \u00e0 ne nuire en rien par eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 qui que ce soit, mais il oblige aussi chacun \u00e0 tenir tout ce qu'il poss\u00e8de en un tel \u00e9tat que personne n'en re\u00e7oive ni mal ni dommage; ce qui renferme le devoir de contenir les animaux qu'on a en sa possession, de sorte qu'ils ne \"puissent ni nuire aux personnes, ni causer dans leurs biens quelque perte ou quelque dommage.\" On voit que, pour Domat, la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des animaux n'\u00e9tait qu'une application de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cela r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9cessairement de ces mots \"ce qui renferme.\"\nJe l'accorde; autrefois, en France, la doctrine absolument en vigueur voulait qu'il n'y e\u00fbt responsabilit\u00e9 que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la faute \u00e9tait clairement prouv\u00e9e. D.1870, 1, 361. Mais cette doctrine, attaqu\u00e9e vivement et depuis longtemps, par d'\u00e9minents juristes tels que Laurent, Labb\u00e9, Lyon-Ca\u00e9n, Glasson, Esmein, Saleilles, Josse-rand, Marcad\u00e9, Demolombe, Baudry-Lacantinerie et Hue est d\u00e9finitivement abandonn\u00e9e. Il est admis, aujourd'hui, par tous les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais que quand, comme dans notre cas, un accident arrive \u00e0 un ouvrier, la responsabilit\u00e9 retombe sur le propri\u00e9taire de la machine qui a fait le dommage; sauf dans les cas d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements dus au cas fortuit ou dans ceux de force majeure; ou encore lorsque l'accident est imputable \u00e0 la faute de la personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e. D.1905, I., 417; D. 1908, I., 217. Dans une note relative au dernier arr\u00eat, Josserand donne ce commentaire:\nL'arr\u00eat ci-dessus rapport\u00e9 marque une nouvelle et importante \u00e9tape de l'\u00e9volution: dans les motifs de sa d\u00e9cision, mais tr\u00e8s nettement, la chambre des requ\u00eates reconna\u00eet qu' \"aux termes de l'art. 1384 c. civ. on est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par le fait des choses que l'on a sous sa garde.\" Et si cette proposition pouvait para\u00eetre obscure, sa signification serait mise en pleine lumi\u00e8re par la suite de l'arr\u00eat:\" * * * Cette pr\u00e9somption c\u00e8de * * *,\" ajoute la cour de cassation. C'est donc bien une pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 que la chambre des requ\u00eates lit dans l'article 1384, une responsabilit\u00e9 par le fait des choses, donc une responsabilit\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9e\u2014partiquement tout au moins et quant \u00e0 la preuv jadis impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la victime\u2014de l'exigence de la faute aquilienne.\nPr\u00e9alablement la cour de cassation, chambre civile, s'\u00e9tait prononc\u00e9e clans le m\u00eame sens (S.V. 1897, I., 17). Le tribunal constate bien dans ce cas l'existence d'un vice de construction dans la machine; mais elle ne le fait que pour \u00e9carter l'hypoth\u00e8se du cas fortuit ou de la force majeure et non pas pour placer son arr\u00eat sous la protection de l'article 1386 C.N. (1053 C.C.) Sourdat \"Responsabilit\u00e9\" (5 \u00e9d.), Nos. 1432 (ter) par. 3, et 1483 (ter) par. 3.\nC'est seulement dans ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es que les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais ont appliqu\u00e9 le principe de l'article 1054 C.C., concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 du gardien d'un chose inanim\u00e9e non immobili\u00e8re, \u00e0 des cas comme celui qui nous occupe. A la fin de l'al. 1er de l'art. 1384, C.N., se trouve un petit membre de phrase qui, dit Planiol, vol. 2, n\u00b0 916, est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s inaper\u00e7u pendant pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle. Il y est dit qu'on est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 \"par le fait * * des choses que l'on a sous sa garde.\" Autrefois le principe de la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 reposer sur l'article 1053 ou sur l'article correspondant du code Napol\u00e9on. Ce fait peut, dans une certaine mesure, expliquer l'incertitude qui a r\u00e9gn\u00e9 jusqu'ici dans la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise. Pour les fins de cette cause, j'adopte donc l'interpr\u00e9tation que la cour de cassation de France a, dans ses d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes, donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 1384 du code Napol\u00e9on auquel correspond l'article 1054 du code civil. J'avoue qu'en ce faisant, je m'\u00e9carte de l'ancienne jurisprudence des tribunaux de Qu\u00e9bec. A la suite de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise du temps, ils soutenaient que la faute est la condition et la mesure de la responsabilit\u00e9.\nAu moment de la premi\u00e8re promulgation du code civil fran\u00e7ais, en 1804, il \u00e9tait impossible \u00e0 ses auteurs de pr\u00e9voir les d\u00e9veloppements extraordinaires que l'industrie moderne allait emprunter aux applications de la vapeur et de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et le nombre infini de eus o\u00f9 l'ouvrier a cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre le ma\u00eetre pour devenir lui-m\u00eame l'outil de cet immense ensemble de machines qui de nos jours forme un \u00e9tablissement industriel moderne. Les progr\u00e8s, les exigences de l'industrie, qui, d'apr\u00e8s les juristes fran\u00e7ais, ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la transformation de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, existent aussi chez nous. Ils justifieraient, dans la m\u00eame mesure que l\u00e0-bas, l'adoption par notre cour des principes de la nouvelle jurisprudence qui faisant une juste application des mots employ\u00e9s par nos codificateurs, et qui paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en oubli au Canada comme en France, reconna\u00eet les garanties de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9paration auxquelles dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bien organis\u00e9e a droit la personne humaine. En nous \u00e9cartant de l'ancien syst\u00e8me d'interpr\u00e9tation, nous suivrions le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent cr\u00e9\u00e9, dans notre cour, en ce qui touche la r\u00e9partition des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour le cas o\u00f9 le demandeur aurait de sa part \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de n\u00e9gligence. Autrefois, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, l'employ\u00e9 coupable par n\u00e9gligence de participation \u00e0 l'accident ne pouvait m\u00eame pas partiellement obtenir gain de cause (Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Cadieux[7]; Desroches v. Gauthier[8], jugements de Dorion JVC. et Ramsay J.); mais les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux ont chang\u00e9 cela. Notre cour, suivant la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise si \u00e9quitable a, par un jugement d\u00e9finitif, statu\u00e9 que, lorsque les deux parties sont en faute, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sont partag\u00e9s proportionnellement \u00e0 la faute de chacune (Price v. Roy[9]).\nToute la question est si pleinement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e dans les jugements savants et approfondis de mes coll\u00e8gues qu'il m'est inutile d'insister davantage. Je dirai seulement \u00e0 ceux qu'int\u00e9resserait une \u00e9tude plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de la question qu'ils peuvent suivre l'\u00e9volution de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise dans les causes suivantes que je joins \u00e0 celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9es: Cour de Cassation, 16 juin 1896 et 30 mars 1896 (Dal. 1897, 1, 433), note Saleilles; Sir. 1897,1, 419, note Esmein; C. de Paris (6e ch.), 5 nov. 1904. (Rec. Gaz. des Tribunaux, 1er avril 1909) et plus particuli\u00e8rement dans les deux \u0153uvres admirables de Saleilles \"Responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses\" et \"Etude sur la th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Obligations,\" puis dans la \"Revue Critique de la L\u00e9gislation,\" 1901, p. 592.\nAttendu donc que le jugement attaqu\u00e9 a fait \u00e0 la cause une exacte application des principes qui r\u00e9gissent la mati\u00e8re je d\u00e9clare l'appel non recevable, d\u00e9pens contre l'appelante.\nGirouard J.\u2014Je suis \u00e9tonn\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de notre jurisprudence l'on ait encore \u00e0 se demander ce que c'est que le quasi-d\u00e9lit. Voil\u00e0 bient\u00f4t un demi-si\u00e8cle que la code civil du Bas-Canada est en force et pendant ce long espace de temps, m\u00eame avant, des centaines de proc\u00e8s caus\u00e9s par des quasi-d\u00e9lits, et particuli\u00e8rement des accidents du travail, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s et \u00e9tudi\u00e9s devant les tribunaux; et cependant il para\u00eetrait, dit-on, que jusqu'\u00e0 ces derniers jours avocats et juges \u00e9taient dans une profonde ignorance de la loi et que jamais ils n'ont donn\u00e9 aux articles du code le vraie interpr\u00e9tation. D'apr\u00e8s quelques juges et, disons-le, ils paraissent tr\u00e8s peu nombreux, la faute qui est la base du quasi-d\u00e9lit serait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans certains cas pr\u00e9vus par l'article 1054 C.C.\nOn affirme que les dispositions de cet article sont diff\u00e9rentes de celles du code fran\u00e7ais. Pour ma part, je ne vois de diff\u00e9rence que quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction ou phras\u00e9ologie. Les codificateurs nous en ont avertis eux-m\u00eames. Quant \u00e0 la substance, ils me paraissent semblables. Les deux codes sont bas\u00e9s sur la faute non pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e mais \u00e9tablie. L'article 1382 du code. Napol\u00e9on dit que\ntout fait quelconque de l'homme qui cause \u00e0 autrui un dommage oblige celui par la faute duquel il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 le r\u00e9parer.\nLe Code de Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9clare que\ntoute personne * * * est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui * * *.\nLe code ne peut exiger moins lorsque cette personne agit par des agents ou repr\u00e9sentants. Aussi, l'article 1054 C.C., ajoute:\nElle est responsable non-seulement du dommage qu'elle cause par sa propre faute mais encore de celui caus\u00e9 par la faute de ceux dont elle a le contr\u00f4le et par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde.\nPuis le l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9num\u00e8re certains cas o\u00f9 certaines personnes r\u00e9pondent des actes de ceux dont elle a le contr\u00f4le, le p\u00e8re, la m\u00e8re, les tuteurs, les curateurs, l'instituteur et l'artisan. Enfin l'article continue:\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus a lieu seulement lorsque la personne qui y est a sujettie ne peut prouver qu'elle n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a. caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nLe texte anglais traduit \"la responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus\" par les mots \"the responsibility in the above cases\" et je crois qu'il exprime mieux la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur. Il ne s'agit ici, en effet, que de certains quasi- d\u00e9lits \u00e9nuni\u00e9r\u00e9s, o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur fait une exception en faveur du ma\u00eetre qui doit l'invoquer et la prouver. Il est inutile d'ailleurs de nous arr\u00eater sur ce point, car la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce n'est pas un de ces cas.\nIl s'agit ici de la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants pour leurs domestiques et ouvriers\ndans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nA l'\u00e9gard de ces derniers, il importe peu qu'ils puissent prouver qu'ils n'ont pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. Qu'ils puissent le prouver ou non, ils demeurent responsables, si leurs pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. \u00e9taient dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions.\nNulle part le code n'a exprim\u00e9 la moindre intention de changer la nature de la responsabilit\u00e9. Toujours et dans tous les cas elle r\u00e9sulte de la faute qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie par le demandeur, soit par une preuve directe ou par des pr\u00e9somptions.\nC'\u00e9taient les dispositions du droit romain et du vieux droit commun de la France en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec et que Ton trouve r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans Pothier, \"Trait\u00e9 des Obligations,\" au titre des D\u00e9lits et Quasi-D\u00e9lits, Nos. 116 \u00e0 122. Pothier nous dit que\nle quasi-d\u00e9lit est le fait par lequel une personne, sans malignit\u00e9, mais par une imprudence qui n'est pas excusable, cause quelque tort \u00e0 une autre.\nIl ajoute que\non rend aussi les ma\u00eetres responsables du tort caus\u00e9 par les d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits de leurs serviteurs ou ouvriers qu'ils emploient \u00e0 quelque service. Ils le sont de m\u00eame dans le cas auquel il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en leur pouvoir d'emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit, lorsque les d\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits sont commis par les dits serviteurs ou ouvriers dans l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles ils sont employ\u00e9s par leurs ma\u00eetres, quoiqu'en l'absence de leurs ma\u00eetres; ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour rendre les ma\u00eetres plus attentifs \u00e0 ne se servir que de bons domestiques. Ces principes ont re\u00e7u leur application dans la pr\u00e9sente cause devant au moins deux cours, la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour d'appel. Elles ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les officiers pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s par rappelante au fonctionnement de ses fournaises n'\u00e9taient pas de bons ouvriers; qu'ils n'avaient pas pris les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9viter l'accident dont le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime. Leur jugement n'est aucunement appuy\u00e9 sur la faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance est bien fond\u00e9;\nvoil\u00e0 le seul motif donn\u00e9 par la cour d'appel. Il n'y a que deux juges qui parlent de la faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e et encore ils n'invoquent pas cette raison comme \u00e9tant la seule qui les engage \u00e0 supporter le jugement de la cour; ils trouvent aussi que le demandeur a prouv\u00e9 la faute de la part de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Ce jugement, comme celui de la cour de r\u00e9vision et de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, sanctionne les principes que nous venons d'\u00e9noncer. Voici le texte du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure qui est confirm\u00e9 en appel purement et simplement:\nConsid\u00e9rant que d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, les circonstances dans lesquelles l'accident est arriv\u00e9 au demandeur \u00e9tablissent que les ingr\u00e9dients avec lesquels la d\u00e9fenderesse fabriquait le carbure contenaient des mati\u00e8res explosibles qui, en faisant explosion dans la fournaise devant laquelle le demandeur travaillait rejetaient avec violence par l'orifice que le demandeur devait boucher avec du mortier qu'il poussait avec un tisonnier, le carbure \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat liquide et enflamm\u00e9.\nConsid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait responsable de cette fournaise qu'elle avait sous sa garde.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'en droit d'apr\u00e8s une jurisprudence constante, les patrons ont le devoir de veiller \u00e0 la conservation de leurs ouvriers et de les prot\u00e9ger contre les p\u00e9rils qui peuvent \u00eatre la cons\u00e9quence du travail auquel ils les emploient; que sous peine de faute, ils doivent pr\u00e9voir les causes possibles d'accidents et prendre et faire prendre par leurs agents toutes les mesures de pr\u00e9cautions pouvant les pr\u00e9venir ou les \u00e9viter;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, pour prot\u00e9ger le demandeur contre un accident comme celui dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime, la d\u00e9fenderesse devait pourvoir le demandeur et les autres ouvriers qui faisaient le m\u00eame ouvrage de lunettes et de masques;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur n'\u00e9tait aucunement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre l'explosion qui a eu lieu, sans qu'il y a\u00eet aucune faute de sa part, et qui a eu pour r\u00e9sultat de lui br\u00fbler la figure et de lui faire perdre compl\u00e8tement la vue.\nM. le juge Cannon, qui a rendu le jugement, nous avoue qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 guid\u00e9 par la jurisprudence jusqu'alors suivie dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nJ'ai suivi (dit-il), surout une d\u00e9cision dans la cause de \"Asbestos and Asbestic Company v. Durand\"[10], d\u00e9cision de la cour supr\u00eame, dont le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, rendu par M. le juge Lemieux, a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel, et confirm\u00e9 plus tard par la cour supr\u00eame, rapport\u00e9e au trenti\u00e8me volume des rapports de la cour supr\u00eame. Aussi une cause \"La Corporation de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Gosney\"[11], jugement rendu par M. le juge Lavergne. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9. confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel. Voir aussi un arr\u00eat dans Sirey pour l'ann\u00f4 1897, premier volume. Cet arr\u00eat paraissait si bien r\u00e9sumer notre loi, telle qu'interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par nos tribunaux et notre jurisprudence, que je me suis servi des m\u00eames termes dans le consid\u00e9rant o\u00f9 je d\u00e9termine la responsabilit\u00e9 de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse.\nEn r\u00e9vision, Cimon, Pelletier and Lemieux JJ. ont renvers\u00e9 ce jugement, non pas parce que les principes qu'il applique \u00e9taient mal fond\u00e9s, mais parce que la preuve faite d\u00e9montrait que\nle demandeur avait le contr\u00f4le et la garde des choses qui ont produit les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s,\net que par cons\u00e9quent s'il y avait faute, c'\u00e9tait la sienne propre et non celle de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nIl me semble, observe M. le juge Cimon dans une opinion tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9e, que le dommage n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par une chose sous la garde de la d\u00e9fenderesse; mais que ce dommage est le r\u00e9sultat de l'op\u00e9ration faite par le demandeur, op\u00e9ration absolument sous son contr\u00f4le: il \u00e9tait responsable envers la d\u00e9fenderesse de cette op\u00e9ration, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui de surveiller, de soigner, de bien faire cette op\u00e9ration. Cette op\u00e9ration et les choses dont il se servait pour la faire \u00e9taient alors sous sa garde particuli\u00e8re. Puis le savant juge conclut en insistant sur l'application des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plus haut:\nSous ces circonstances, la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut \u00eatre tenue responsable, \u00e0 moins que le demandeur montre une faute sp\u00e9ciale de la d\u00e9fenderesse, faute qui aurait caus\u00e9 l'accident, et il n'y a aucune preuve de telle faute.\nEt il ne faut pas oublier que la jurisprudence de la cour supr\u00eame, jurisprudence qui para\u00eet ferme et absolument arr\u00eat\u00e9e, exige toujours de la part du demandeur, en pareil cas, la preuve d'une faute de la d\u00e9fenderesse, faute qui aurait produit le dommage.\nEn appel, (Taschereau J.C., Lavergne, Cross, Archambault et Carroll JJ.) le jugement a renvers\u00e9 celui de la cour de revision, non pas parce qu'il y avait faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e en loi, ce qui para\u00eet \u00eatre l'opinion individuelle de M. le juge Archambault et de M. le juge Carroll, mais parce qu'il y avait preuve de faute, ainsi que le juge Gannon l'avait jug\u00e9.\nRemarquons bien que dans la cause de McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[12], le conseil priv\u00e9 n'a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la doctrine de la cour supr\u00eame[13], \u00e9tait trop absolue ou erron\u00e9e, mais qu'elle avait fait une fausse appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve qui fournissait des pr\u00e9somptions de fait suffisantes pour justifier le verdict du jury, confirm\u00e9 par deux cours en faveur du demandeur. Le conseil priv\u00e9 ne dit pas un mot de la pr\u00e9tendue faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e en l'article 1054 C.C.; c'\u00e9tait cependant le moment de le faire si elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e.\nVoil\u00e0 ce que la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec nous enseigne \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9, au moins jusqu'\u00e0 ces derniers jours. L'on nous dit qu'elle ne r\u00e9pond plus \u00e0 la situation du monde industriel. C'est possible. Mais qui doit donner le rem\u00e8de? Est-ce le juge ou le l\u00e9gislateur? Notre code civil commande aux juges de suivre dans l'interpr\u00e9tation de ses articles les lois en force lors de sa promulgation[14]; et pour ma part je ne me laisserai certainement pas guider par les th\u00e9ories de quelques auteurs contemporains qui paraissent domin\u00e9s par des raisons qui n\u00e9cessiteraient un changement de la loi. Nous sommes ici non pas pour faire des lois, encore moins les changer.\nOn cite la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans Price v. Roy[15]. Dans cette cause nous n'avons pas voulu changer l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais ou les lois qui existaient lorsque le code a \u00e9t\u00e9 promulgu\u00e9; nous avons tout simplement r\u00e9tabli une ancienne r\u00e8gle de droit qui, pendant quelques ann\u00e9es, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9e par des juges trop imbus des principes de la loi commune anglaise qui ne donne aucune action dans le cas de n\u00e9gligence commune ou contributoire, principe tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent de l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais et du droit romain. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, et ceci n'est pas sans importance, dans Price v. Roy15, cette cour n'a pas tent\u00e9 de renverser sa propre jurisprudence, comme nous sommes invit\u00e9s \u00e0 le faire dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, bien qu'elle soit consacr\u00e9e par au moins une demi-douzaine de d\u00e9cisions.\nNous voil\u00e0 donc en face de deux jugements rendus par deux cours sur une question de fait, savoir, la faute ou la n\u00e9gligence de la compagnie appelante, tel que d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par le juge Cannon dans le texte de son jugement. Dans ces circonstances, je ne crois pas que j'aurais raison de juger qu'il n'y avait pas faute et de renverser ces deux jugements. Voir Lodge Holes Colliery Co. v. Wednesbury Corporation[16], page 326.\nJe suis donc d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens. Idington J.\u2014Whether the doing so or not rested upon him the respondent having duly shewn to the satisfaction of the learned trial judge that he had followed such instructions as his employers gave him and was otherwise blameless, the questions raised herein are reduced to a narrow compass.\nPassing for the present other alternatives about to be referred to, it seems to me that we must infer upon the general evidence given of the relevant surrounding circumstances, coupled with such a finding that the explosion was the result of a defect in the thing or things in appellant's charge, or the result of faulty methods (by which I mean such as due care had not been taken to avoid fault in respect of), in its use of them or some of them. In this I include, of course, all done by those for whom appellants stand responsible.\nWe have no serious effort on the part of appellants to determine and inform the court of the true cause of the explosion. I, therefore, conclude this suggested inference stands good.\nIf one lawfully passing upon the highway were injured by a building falling for which fall there was no apparent cause except inherent defects, I do not think it would be necessary in an action for damages to determine exactly whether the fall thus obviously resulting from age or ill-construction came about by reason of defect in the nature of the mortar which had been used in its walls or from too great weight of superstructure having been placed thereon by the builders selected by the owner, or otherwise exactly what was the cause thereof.\nAssuming, for argument's sake, the much discussed part of article 1054 C.C. blotted out, how does the proof of liability arising from the use of a machine, perhaps a new or untried machine, causing actionable damage differ in regard to the nature of proof from what is needed in the case of the falling house? The Code deals with each of them in separate articles which, I take it, are, though of different origins, subsidiary to and illustrative of the comprehensive rule that precedes both in article 1053 C.C.\nSurely the good sense and reason embodied in the maxim \"res ipsa loquitur\" may, in either case, be allowed operation and suffice to solve the questions arising when, once general evidence has been given, reducing the question to one of fair inference.\nWith great respect, it seems to me idle to suggest that this oven or furnace or both and all connected therewith were, as between the parties hereto, in charge of the respondent, in the sense claimed herein and so as thus to relieve the appellants.\nIf, on the other hand, it be said the inference above suggested is unwarranted because the work of the respondent was known to be of a dangerous character and explosions were to be anticipated as something not unlikely to happen, I submit that, in such case, there clearly arises the alternative inference that the nature of the respondent's work was known to the appellants, or by due care of the appellants ought to have been known to them, to involve just such risks of explosion, or as the evidence suggests, were of an experimental character in the handling of what were highly dangerous forces likely or liable to produce explosions of a dangerous character, and, therefore, in any such alternative or alternatives, of a like nature, the appellants had clearly neglected the plain duty of giving the necessary instructions and warning and (or) of furnishing such adequate protection as obviously would be necessary in such a case. In any way we can look at the case, unless the learned trial judge's finding in regard to absence of fault in the respondent be set aside, which is not suggested, the conclusion seems irresistible either that the learned trial judge and the court below are absolutely right or, at all events, not so clearly wrong that we are entitled to reverse it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondent against the appellants to recover damages for the injuries suffered by him in consequence of an accident in the works of the appellants, who are manufacturers of calcium carbide at Shawinigan Falls.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for the respondent; this judgment was reversed by the Court of Review[17], unanimously, but restored by the Court of King's Bench[18], (Cross J. dissenting).\nThe Court of King's Bench proceeded upon a view of the effect of art. 1054 C.C., which it will be necessary to examine, as well as upon the view that the injury of which the respondent complains was due to the fault of the appellants in failing in one manner or another to exercise the degree of care which the law requires in the protection of their employees.\nBoth of these views are in controversy on this appeal, and I proceed to discuss the questions thus raised in the order mentioned.\nThe view of art. 1054 C.C., upon which the court below acted, as indicated in the leading judgment (that of Archambault J.), is that the first paragraph of that article embodies a self-sufficient rule of general application\u2014subject only to an exception to be found expressed in the 6th paragraph. Stated in the terms of these two paragraphs, the rule is as follows:\n1054. He is responsible not only for the damage caused by his own fault but also for that caused by the fault of persons under his control and by things which he has under his care; * * * The responsibility attaches in the above cases only when the person subject to it fails to establish that he was unable to prevent the act which caused the damage.\nThis language, however, does not perhaps at first sight convey the full significance which in the opinion of the court below it really bears. The words \"things which he has under his care\" are, in this view, taken to embrace every inanimate thing not an immoveable used or worked for one's behoof, whether by one's self or by others; so that even though the complainant should have within his own hand the actual custody of the thing causing the harm in respect of which redress is sought, and even though he alone should consequently be in a position to give an account of the train of events actually leading to the injury, yet the onus is upon the defendant to bring himself within the exception; and this principle applies of course not only where the relation of master and servant exists, but wherever one person suffers an injury which is \"caused\" by \"a thing\" that another \"has under his care\" in the sense explained. Such is the effect of the extracts from Mons. Josserand, at p. 275, and of the learned judge's own observations in the following passage:\nDans le pr\u00e9sente cause, la fournaise appartenait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e elle \u00e9tait exploit\u00e9e par cette derni\u00e8re qui s'en servait en vue de r\u00e9aliser des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices dans son industrie. C'est elle, par cons\u00e9quent, qui en avait la garde, et c'est elle qui est responsable des dommages qu'elle a caus\u00e9s. Nos annales judiciaires, et celles des autres pays, fourmillent de d\u00e9cisions rendue en mati\u00e8re d'accidents du travail dans lesquels un ouvrier, m\u00e9canicien ou autre, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 ou bless\u00e9 par l'explosion ou par le fonctionnement d'une machine ou d'un m\u00e9canisme, et jamais on n'a song\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que la machine ou la chose se trouvait sous la garde de l'ouvrier et non sous celle de la compagnie ou de la personne qui l'exploitait ou qui s'en servait pour son avantage et pour son profit.\nI shall first give my reasons for thinking that this construction of article 1054 C.C., is not in harmony with the law of delicts and quasi-delicts as it has actually been expounded and applied by the Court of King's Bench and by this court in passing upon appeals from the Province of Quebec.\nIn examining the decisions of the provincial courts it is necessary to keep clearly in view the distinction between decisions based upon a statutory presumption, or presumption arising from some specific legal rule such as that which the court below finds declared in art. 1054 C.C., and decisions based upon inferences or presumptions which can be justified only as inferences of fact legitimately arising out of the facts established by the evidence. Whether in a given case a presumption of the last mentioned character is or is not well founded is not a question of law at all; but merely a question of sound reasoning to be tried by the same tests, whether the tribunal sit to administer the civil law, or to administer the common law; and judicial decisions, in so far as they involve inferences of fact only, although often useful as affording illustrations of judicial methods are not in the strict sense, legal precedents at all. Some misapprehension as to the real bearing of the decisions of the Court of King's Bench has, I think, arisen from not attending sufficiently to this distinction.\nOf the decisions of the Court of King's Bench, I will take three\u2014each separated from the others by a considerable interval of time\u2014and all dealing with the precise point in question here, the question of the burden of proof where an employee claims reparation for loss suffered in consequence of an injury inflicted by an explosion or otherwise through the immediate agency of something used for the benefit of the employer in the business in which the employee was engaged.\nSt. Lawrence Sugar Refining Company v. Campbell[19] in 1885. The grounds of this decision are stated by Dorion C.J., page 295, in these words:\nThere is no responsibility unless there is fault, and fault must be proved. Here, two men were engaged in some work for the company. There is no proof that there was any danger in what they were doing. But an explosion occurred by which the plaintiff was injured, and the other workman killed. There is not a single witness who states how the accident occurred, nor is there anything to shew that the company was in fault, or that the other workman was in fault. It cannot be presumed that the accident occurred through their fault. The respondent's action, therefore, must fail in the absence of any evidence adduced by him to support it.\nIn a subsequent case, Dominion Oil Cloth Company v. Coallier[20], Dorion C.J., at page 269, states the ratio of the decision just cited in these words:\nThe respondent was injured by an explosion, and there was no evidence of the cause of the accident, or of fault on the part of the employers, the judgment was also reversed and the action dismissed.\nIn Mercier v. Morin[21], in 1892, it appeared that the plaintiff had been injured by the collapse of a \"chauss\u00e9e\" on which he was working. The Court of Queen's Bench held that the employers, in the absence of evidence that the accident was due to some fault on their part, were not liable. Boss\u00e9 J., delivering the judgment of the majority of the court (Baby, Boss\u00e9, Blanchet and W\u00fbrt\u00e8le JJ.), said:\nDans ces circonstances, la r\u00e8gle me parait facile \u00e0 appliquer. Elle r\u00e9sulte des articles 1053 et suiv., l'imp\u00e9ritie, la n\u00e9gligence et l'inhabilit\u00e9 de toute personne capable de distinguer le bien du mal, si ce fait, cette imp\u00e9ritie, cette n\u00e9gligence ou cette inhabilit\u00e9 ont caus\u00e9 des dommages, cr\u00e9ant l'obligation de r\u00e9parer des dommages. Tel est notre texte, et, dans l'application de ce principe, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 constan-ment et avec raison jug\u00e9 que le ma\u00eetre est tenu de fournir, aux ouvriers qu'il emploie un local s\u00fbr et machines, engine et outils construits et am\u00e9nag\u00e9s suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art et de la prudence. Ainsi, un cable d\u00e9fectueux, une bouilloire mal am\u00e9nag\u00e9e, des lisses de chemin de fer mal plac\u00e9es, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un vice de construction ou d'installation quelconque, cause du dommage, que le ma\u00eetre connaissait ou aurait d\u00fb conna\u00eetre, entra\u00eenant responsabilit\u00e9. Nos tribunaux en ont fait \u00e0 maintes fois l'application.\nMais lorsqu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il y a eu vice de construction ou d'installation; lorsqu'il y a absence de preuve de faute ou de n\u00e9gligence, notre jurisprudence a toujours d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'y a pas lieu au recours en dommages par l'employ\u00e9 contre le ma\u00eetre.\nPas de preuve de faute ou de n\u00e9gligence, pas de lien de droit et pas d'action.\nEn ce sens, vide Dominion Oil Cloth Co. v. Coallier[22]; St. Lawrence Sugar Refining Co. v. Campbell[23]; Compagnie de Navigation du Richelieu et Ontario v. 8t. Jean[24]; Lavoie v. Drapeau[25].\nIn Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Dionne (in 1908)[26], the precise point before us was formally decided by the court of appeal (Taschereau C.J., Boss\u00e9, Trenholm, Lavergne, Cross JJ.). The plaintiff's husband, an employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, was run down by a shunting locomotive at a point near a place where he had been engaged in shovelling snow for the company. At the trial, before Langelier C.J., the company was held liable, the ground of liability being thus expressed:\nConsidering that on the 18th of February last the said Elz\u00e9ar Doinne had been for several years in the employ of the defendant to work in its yard near its station at Quebec, and that on the day in question he was working at shovelling snow in the said yard under the order and direction of one Ouellette employed by the defendant as foreman of this work; considering that while the said Elz\u00e9ar Dionne was in the said defendant's yard he was killed by a locomotive owned by the defendant and under its care.\nOn appeal this judgment was reversed and the principle upon which the Court of King's Bench proceeded was stated in the formal judgment as follows:\nConsidering that the respondent failed to prove the material allegations of her declaration, and in particular, failed to prove that the death of her husband, Elz\u00e9ar Dionne, which occurred at Quebec on the 18th February, 1907, was due to fault, negligence or imprudence on the part of the appellant or of its servants:\nConsidering that, before defendant from whom damages are demanded by reason of quasi-offence on his part or on the part of his servants, can be held responsible, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish affirmatively not only the existence of the damage claimed, but also the fault, negligence or imprudence on the part of the defendant, and that the fact of the injury alleged having been caused by a thing under the control of the defendant, has not in law of itself the effect of placing upon the defendant the burden of proving that the injury was caused without fault on the part of the defendant or his servants.\nThe decisions in the Province of Quebec relied upon in the judgment of the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the majority in the court below do not, with great respect, appear to me to impugn the principle stated in the cases to which I have just referred. The observations of Andrews J. in Dupont v. Quebec Steamship Co.[27], at page 194 (a decision of the Court of Review), are, it is true, capable of construction supporting the learned judge's views, but it is a well-known principle that such observations must be construed with reference to the facts of the case to which they relate\u2014secundum subjectam materiam; and the facts of that case appear to have afforded ample ground for drawing the inference that the tackle which failed had been negligently set up, or that there had been some lack of inspection, and that, I think, is in substance the process by which the Court of Review reached its conclusion.\nThe decisions referred to by Andrews J. in the course of his opinion (Ross v. Langlois[28], and Corner v. Byrd[29]) lend support to this reading of it. In Boss v. Langlois28 the decision was put expressly upon the ground that the defendants had used defective tackle, without taking the care, before using it, to ascertain its condition. In the judgment of Jett\u00e9 J. (see page 284 of the report), there is the finding that the hook which gave way was of\nbad quality, in a bad state, and insufficient to support without danger, the burden put upon it; and, moreover, that the condition of the hook had not been ascertained before using it for the purpose to which it was applied.\nThat is a virtual finding of negligence; and with that finding the court of appeal agreed. In Corner v. Byrd29, the ground of the decision is stated by Dorion C. J., at page 271, in these words:\nIt was one of those accidents for which the appellant is liable, because it could have been prevented by care on his part.\nTo come to the decisions of this court: In Paquet v. Dufour[30], Girouard J. states the law conformably to the second consid\u00e9rant quoted from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in Dionne v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[31], and to the views expressed in the judgment of Dorion C.J. and Boss\u00e9 J. in the two preceding cases.\nBefore closing, I wish (says the learned judge), to point out a consid\u00e9rant of the trial judge to which I cannot subscribe: \"Consid\u00e9rant que le dite explosion ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par de la dynamite dont le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et dont il avait la garde, il doit \u00eatre tenu responsable des dommages qui en sont r\u00e9sult\u00e9s pour le demandeur, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait prouv\u00e9 qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de l'\u00e9viter.\"\nWe have so often decided in our court that proof of fault, whether by direct evidence or by presumptions, rests upon the plaintiff, that it is not necessary to quote authorities.\nThis passage, I think, with great respect, summarizes with accuracy the effect of a long series of decisions in this court on appeals from the Province of Quebec. I will mention some of them. In Cowans v. Marshall[32], it was shewn that the plaintiff while employed in the defendants' iron-works was injured in consequence of an explosion caused by molten lead coming in contact with oakum in a wet condition. This raised precisely the point in hand, the accident being exactly one of that class to which, if the view under discussion be a sound one, the suggested presumption would apply. It was held, however, that the onus was on the plaintiff to prove negligence, and that onus not having been satisfied the complainant must fail. In The Canada Paint Co. v. Trainor[33], it was shewn that the plaintiff had in some unexplained manner come in contact with the machinery of a printing press at which she was employed in the defendants' establishment, and the defendants were charged with failure to make proper provision for the protection of their employees. The Court of Queen's Bench held that the plaintiff had made out her case by establishing affirmatively such want of care. Here again it is clear that upon the proposed construction of art. 1054 CO., the defendants would be charged with the onus of relieving themselves from the presumption of negligence by shewing that they could not have prevented the accident. This court held, however, (directly negativing the view now advanced) that although the plaintiff had unquestionably been injured by the machine, she had failed to satisfy the burden upon her to shew that the injury was due to some fault of the defendants.\nIn Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns[34], it appeared that the plaintiff was injured by an explosion originating in the pressing machine of the defendants, who were manufacturers of cartridges. This court reversed the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, and held (a ruling quite irreconcilable with the theory under review) that the onus was on the plaintiff to trace the explosion to some fault of the defendants.\nIt is unnecessary to multiply examples; the course of decision has been clear and uniform; but there remains the question of the effect of the decision of the Privy Council, in McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Go.[35], which it appears has been assumed in some of the decisions of the Quebec courts to be inconsistent with the views on this point to which this court has consistently given effect.\nThis court had held in that case that no negligence had been proved\u2014that there was no direct evidence, and nothing upon which a presumption of fact could be founded. It had been further held that assuming negligence, the rule applied by the French courts in such cases requiring certain proof of a causal relation between a fault on the part of the defendants and the injury complained of was sufficient to defeat the plaintiff's claim. In the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Macnaghten it is not suggested that the onus was not upon the plaintiff to shew that the injury was due to some fault of the defendants; on the contrary, the judgment proceeds upon the assumption that it was. It was held, however, that there was sufficient evidence to justify a verdict by the jury that the defendants had been negligent and that this negligence was the cause of the explosion to which the injury was attributable.\nAt the same time the Privy Council negatived the existence as a part of Quebec law of any rule (of general application) of the character indicated above (that the law exacts \"proof of a fault which certainly caused the injury\"); holding it to be sufficient to adduce evidence from which the tribunal may fairly infer both the existence of the fault and the connection between that fault and the injury complained of.\nThere is nothing, therefore, in the decision in that case to cast any doubt upon the principle upon which the Court of King's Bench and this court have hitherto acted.\nI should not be prepared to give my adherence to the view that it is open to this court to accept (as a part of the law of Quebec) a principle the exact reverse of that upon which this mass of high judicial authority is based; but assuming the question raised to be still open for examination it would require very cogent reasons to lead me to hold that all these decisions are erroneous and must be overruled. A careful examination of these reasons adduced in support of this view satisfies me that the great weight of argument lies in the opposite scale.\nThe first step in considering the construction accepted in the court below is to ascertain what is the proper method of interpretation. I do not think it is a proper method to apply one's self to an examination of the language of art. 1054 C.C., in such light only as may be had from an exclusive consideration of the words of the article itself, and the immediate context, disregarding the history of the law on the subject of which it treats. In Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Rway. Co.[36], at page 487, Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, applied to the Civil Code generally the rule enunciated by Lord Herschell in Bank of England v. Vagliano[37], at page 144, the effect, of which is that when the Code contains provisions of doubtful import, resort is to be had to the preexisting law. The previously uniform current of decision of the two Canadian courts of appeal having jurisdiction over the Province of Quebec in the sense opposite to the decision below affords at least some ground for thinking that the construction upon which that decision is based does not yield the single exclusive meaning attributable to the language employed, and prima facie, that in itself would seem in accordance with Lord Watson's canon to be a good reason for not ignoring the pre-existing law.\nA far stronger reason against excluding the preexisting law from consideration is afforded by the terms of the enactments under the authority of which the Code came into force as law which evince very plainly the intention to declare, in arts. 1053, 1054 and 1055, the law as it then stood. There was first an Act of the Province of Canada (20 Vict. ch. 43), authorizing the appointment of commissioners and directing that they should embody in the Code to be framed by them, to be called the Civil Code of Lower Canada, such provisions as they should hold to be then actually in force, giving the authorities on which their views should be based, but stating separately any proposed amendments. Then (the Commissioners having in due course framed their report and laid it before Parliament), there was another Act (29 Vict. ch. 41) declaring a certain roll attested in the manner described in the Act to be the original of the Civil Code reported by the Commissioners as containing the existing law without amendments; directing the Commissioners to incorporate in this roll certain specified amendments eliminating and altering the provisions of it only so far as should be necessary to give effect to these amendments; and providing that the Code so altered should, on proclamation by the Governor, have the force of law.\nIt hardly seems necessary to comment on the effect of this legislation. It very manifestly exhibits the intention of the legislature that the provisions found in the roll referred to were not, excepting in so far as they should be affected by the amendments specified, to effect any substantial alteration in the law then actually in force in Lower Canada. Among the provisions contained in this roll (and untouched by the amendments sanctioned) are arts. 1053, 1054, and 1055 C.C.; and in construing them we have therefore this clear and important guide to the intention of the legislature.\nIt is proper to observe that in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[38], the Privy Council had to consider art. 1056 CO., which does not appear in the report of the Commissioners and to which, therefore, these considerations do not in their full force apply. Furthermore, in the construction of such a statute as the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" which the House of Lords had to consider in Bank of England v. Vagliano[39], one has no such key by which to ascertain whether the legislature in enacting a particular provision intended thereby to change or leave unchanged the existing rules of law upon the topic dealt with; and, consequently, one can only proceed upon the construction of the words themselves. In such a case the pre-existing law is an extraneous thing and only as an extraneous circumstance can be brought into play for the purposes of interpretation; while on the contrary in the case before us the legislature has itself, in effect, declared its purpose of embodying the existing law in the provision to be construed.\nI am not disposed to question that if these articles were framed in language reasonably capable of only one meaning, it is not easy to see how, conformably to the postulate of the constitution touching the supremacy of Parliament, a judicial tribunal could refuse to accept as the law existing when the Code was framed that which in unmistakable terms a competent legislature had declared that law to be; but neither do I doubt that if the state of the law these articles were intended to declare be not itself seriously open to question, and the articles can reasonably be read in such a way as to bring them into conformity with it, we cannot be required to give them a reading (though the words themselves should be capable of that reading also) out of harmony with the ascertained intention of the legislature.\nIt is probably unnecessary to consider at length the state of the common law of Quebec upon this point at the time of the adoption of the Code. It will not be disputed that the passages already quoted from Dorion C.J. and Girouard J. and Boss\u00e9 J. state it correctly. In France there has been a great deal of discussion upon the construction of the corresponding article (1384) of the Code Napol\u00e9on; but all schools of interpretation seem to be agreed in this that under the common law non-contractual liability was based upon delict or quasi-delict, and except in the specific cases provided for in art. 1055 C.C. (1385 C.N.), the burden of proof was upon the complainant.\nMons. Esmein, the eminent authority on the history of French law, in a note, Sirey, 1897, 1, 17-19, states the traditional view thus:\nA. Le patron propri\u00e9taire se pourrait \u00eatre responsable envers ses employ\u00e9s de l'accident survenu qu'autant que celui-ci r\u00e9sulterait de sa faute personnelle ou d'une faute de ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. C'est l'obligation d\u00e9lictuelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle fond\u00e9e sur les art. 1382 et 1383 C. civ. La faute alors doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, et le fardeau de la preuve incombe \u00e0 celui qui r\u00e9clame les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, * * *.\nNotre ancien droit fran\u00e7ais ne connaissait que deux cas dans lesquels le propri\u00e9taire \u00e9tait tenu, par une obligation quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle, de r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par la chose. C'\u00e9taient \"l'action contre celui dont le b\u00e2timent, par sa chute totale ou par portion, a bless\u00e9 quelqu'un,\" et \"l'action contre le ma\u00eetre d'un animal qui a caus\u00e9 quelque dommage.\" (Bourjon, Le Droit commun de la France et la Coutume de Paris, liv. 6, tit. 2, ch. 6 et 7; cf. Domat, Les Lois civiles, tit. 8, sec. 2, et. 3.)\nPothier ne parle ni de l'un ni de l'autre cas dans son Trait\u00e9 des Obligations. Sans doute, on entendait assez largement la chute d'un b\u00e2timent; on donnait l'action lorsque la blessure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la chute d'un entablement, ou d'une seule tuile, mais on n'allait pas plus loin; la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire n'\u00e9tait point \u00e9tendue \u00e0 d'autres hypoth\u00e8ses.\nIndeed, for the greater part of the 19th century, such was the effect which the French tribunals gave to the provisions of the Code Napol\u00e9on dealing with this topic. Mons. Josserand, at pp. 5 and 6 of his monograph \"Responsabilitit\u00e9 du fait des choses inanim\u00e9es,\" says:\nAu contraire, la derni\u00e8re source de responsabilit\u00e9, le fait des choses inanim\u00e9es, a \u00e9t\u00e9 fort n\u00e9glig\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. On reconnaissait bien que nous sommes responsables parfois du dommage caus\u00e9 par les choses dont nous avons la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou la garde; l'article 1384, 1\u00b0, le d\u00e9clare formellement. Mais sans creuser la nature de cette responsabilit\u00e9, sans s'arr\u00eater m\u00eame au texte fondamental qui en consacre le principe, on se contentait de lui appliquer le droit commun en mait\u00e8re de d\u00e9lits; on faisait rentrer la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses dans la th\u00e9orie plus large de la faute Aquilienne, l'article 1384, 1\u00b0, n'\u00e9tant ainsi qu'une application de l'article 1382, le dommage caus\u00e9 par notre chose n'\u00e9tant pas autrement trait\u00e9 que le dommage directement caus\u00e9 par notre personne m\u00eame. C'\u00e9tait le triomphe complet de la faute d\u00e9lictuelle, le r\u00e8gle souverain de l'article 1382 qui commandait ainsi au chapitre II. tout entier. La th\u00e9orie avait donc le m\u00e9rite de l'unit\u00e9 et les cons\u00e9quences en \u00e9taient claires; le victime d'un accident occasionn\u00e9 par une chose inanim\u00e9e ne pouvait obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 que si le propri\u00e9taire avait commis une faute, et seulement \u00e0 la condition d'\u00e9tablir cette faute; actori incumbit probatio.\nPendant trois quarts de si\u00e8cle on se contenta de cette conception.\nThe view of article 1384 C.N., advocated by M. Josser and and Mons. Saleilles\u2014the doctrine of \"le risque professionnel\"\u2014proceeds upon the hypothesis that the common law was altered by the positive enactments of the Code Napol\u00e9on. Josserand, \"Responsa-bilit\u00e9 du fait des choses inanim\u00e9es,\" pp. 90-95.\nSuch having been the state of the common law the question would appear to be concluded; unless indeed it can be maintained, in face of the decisions already cited, that the words of art. 1054 C.C., will not reasonably bear a construction consistent with the principles which ex hypothesi it was intended to embody.\nThat question I proceed to consider, first taking the English version of the article alone. The first paragraph of the article declares that every person\nis responsible not only for the damage caused by his own fault, but also for that caused by the fault of persons under his control and by things which he has under his care.\nThen follow four paragraphs declaring responsibility in the cases of parents, curators, tutors and artisans (for acts of apprentices) respectively: 2. The father, or, after his decease, the mother, is responsible for the damage caused by their minor children;\n3. Tutors are responsible in like manner for their pupils;\n4. Curators or others having the legal custody of insane persons, for the damage done by the latter;\n5. Schoolmasters and artisans, for the damage caused by their pupils or apprentices while under their care.\nAssuming the first paragraph to state, as held in the court below, a rule of law of general application under which one is liable in every case for damages caused by the fault of persons under one's control\u2014 then nobody will be disposed to question that each of these four succeeding paragraphs states a special application of that rule. In other words, paragraphs 2 to 5 declaring the responsibility of parents for their children, and so on, embody particular cases within the general rule.\nComing now to paragraph 6; we have these words\nThe responsibility attaches in the above cases only when the person subject to it fails to establish he was unable to prevent the act which has caused the damage.\nSome difficulties are to be noted here as arising from the construction proposed. First, if this paragraph (the 6th) embodies an exception which attends the rule stated in the first paragraph throughout its whole extent\u2014and which applies, therefore, to cases falling under the rule other than the cases mentioned in paragraphs 2 to 5\u2014why was the exception placed at the end of the 5th paragraph, and not stated at once as an exception to the rule? Secondly, why is the exception made applicable in express terms to the \"above cases\" only, and not stated as an exception to the rule itself? Both position and phraseology seem natural and appropriate, if the exception was to affect the four preceding cases alone; neither is natural or appropriate upon the alternative hypothesis. Again, how shall we read the seventh paragraph? Is that not a \"case\" under the general rule? If so\u2014and it seems the more natural reading to treat it as such\u2014are we to read the sixth paragraph as applying to it?\nBut the last words of the sixth clause seem to create a more serious and, I venture to think, an insurmountable difficulty. Under that clause the person sought to be charged may escape responsibility, in the oases to which it applies, by shewing that he was unable to prevent\u2014not the damage\u2014but \"the act which has caused the damage.\"\nThe effect of these words in the view of the court below is that, prim\u00e0 facie, one's responsibility arises from the circumstance alone that damage occurs through the immediate instrumentality of something which is being used or worked for one's profit; and upon the construction proposed the phrase \"act which caused the damage\" must be read as descriptive of the fact that damage has thus occurred.\nThat is attributing to the words \"act which caused the damage\" a sense quite out of keeping with the true meaning of them; and is to assume on the part of the Commissioners who framed the article and the legislature which adopted it a very imperfect appreciation of the meaning of common English words. It is not necessary to dispute that if no other application for these words could be found one might accept this view rather than reject the words as wholly senseless. But here there is no such excuse. The words in their ordinary sense find their natural application when read as referring to the acts of the persons mentioned in the four paragraphs immediately preceding. Giving them this, their natural and obvious, application a perfectly consistent and intelligible construction is given to all the paragraphs from 2 to 6.\nThe exception should not then be attributed to the first paragraph, unless some reason for doing so is to be found outside the language in which the exception is framed. I think there is no such reason. It may, of course, be suggested that the first paragraph, if taken alone (freed, that is to say, from the operation of the exception declared in the 6th paragraph) would establish a legal rule still more widely at variance with the common law. The doctrine of le risque professionnel mentioned which has the support of many able French commentators (and has possibly at last received the sanction of the Cour de Cassation Dal., 1908, 1, 217), regards the corresponding paragraph of the Code Napol\u00e9on as a positive enactment imposing an absolute liability for all harm caused through the instrumentality of things owned by one and worked. for one's profit irrespective of proof or presumption of fault\u2014a liability which one can only escape by establishing that the true cause of the harm was force majeure or the fault of the victim.\nThis, it may be argued, is the true effect of reading the first paragraph as freed from the exception declared in the 6th; and one must meet the question whether the words of the 1st paragraph are so intractable as to require this construction of them. No difficulty respecting this point would seem, however, to arise unless one lose sight of the office the 1st paragraph is designed to fill. It is sufficiently plain, I think, from what has already been said upon the history of the legislation, that the proper mode of approaching these articles is to regard them as an exposition of one topic in a coordinated system of law already in force\u2014and not at all as a string of detached legal enactments. From this point of view the paragraph in question presents itself not as embodying a self-sufficient and self-operating legal rule, but as one step simply in the progress of the exposition. Thus art. 1053 C.C., explains that fault may consist in positive act or in omission and so on. Arts. 1054 and 1055 C.C., seem designated to deal with the instruments of damage in respect of which one may be answerable. Article 1054 is primarily concerned with one's responsibility for the acts of persons; but the first paragraph is most naturally read, I think, as introductory to the whole subject dealt with in the two articles; and it is seemingly utilized to state the broad general considerations which are the raison d'\u00eatre of the positive legal rules stated in the subsequent paragraphs. One's responsibility may arise (so in effect the expositors proceed in that paragraph) not only from one's personal fault, but from the fault of those persons whom the law regards, for the purpose, as being under one's control, and out of harm caused by things in respect of which the law imposes upon one a duty to take care that they are not the instruments of harm to others. The personal relationships and the classes of things thus referred to are then specifically stated, the first in art. 1054 C.C., and the second in art. 1055 CO. This view is concisely put by Mons. Esmein, S. V. 1897,1,19.\nPar le membre de phrase en question, le l\u00e9gislateur, qui, dans l'art. 1384, ne dispose en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que sur la responsabilit\u00e9 du dommage caus\u00e9 par le fait des personnes, a simplement indiqu\u00e9, par pr\u00e9occupation de sym\u00e9trie, qu'une responsabilit\u00e9 semblable r\u00e9sultait aussi du fait de certaines choses; et le dispositif sur ce second point se trouve dans l'art. 1385. Le membre de phrase discut\u00e9 de l'art. 1384 ne contient point la r\u00e8gle qu'on pr\u00e9tend en tirer; il n'a pas dispos\u00e9 sur ce point, mais simplement annonc\u00e9 la disposition de l'article suivant. And by Fromageot, \"de la Faute,\" at p. 99:\nLe premier alin\u00e9a de l'article 1384 du Code civil n'\u00e9tablit pas en effet, une disposition absolue et particuli\u00e8re se suffisant \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame; il ne fait que poser un intitul\u00e9 des principes qui sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans les alin\u00e9as suivants pour les personnes dont on doit r\u00e9pondre, dans l'article 1385 pour les choses anim\u00e9es et dans l'article 1386 pour les choses inanim\u00e9es.\nAnd of M. Planiol, vol. 3, at page 303:\n917. Origine et sens de cette disposition. Il est facile de montrer pourquoi cette id\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nconc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette place et sous cette forme. Dans le projet primitif, les dispositions des articles 1384, 1385 et 1386 figuraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s telles qu'elles existent actuellement, mais les deux articles 1384 et 1385 n'en faisaient qu'un seul, qui d\u00e9butait par une phrase g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, annon\u00e7ant les dispositions particuli\u00e8res qui en forment les autres alin\u00e9as. La formule de l'alin\u00e9a 1er n'a donc d'autre but que d'\u00e9noncer le principe dont les dispositions suivantes sont les applications. Or, dans le projet de l'an VIII., il est visible que le l\u00e9gislateur a pens\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois aux personnes et aux choses dont quelqu'un a la surveillance et la direction et qui peuvent \u00eatre pour les tiers une source de dangers. La responsabilit\u00e9 est donc fond\u00e9e, \u00e0 raison des choses comme \u00e0 raison des personnes, sur une id\u00e9e de garde, c'est-\u00e0-dire sur une faute personnelle de celui qui s'est mal acquitt\u00e9 de sa t\u00e2che de surveillant. On ne peut faire sortir de ce texte l'id\u00e9e d'une responsabilit\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendante de toute faute.\nCette fin de l'alin\u00e9a 1er de l'article 1384 \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e inapper\u00e7ue pendant pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle; mais vers 1895 on a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 en tirer parti pour \u00e9largir la disposition particuli\u00e8re de Varticle 1386, qui paraissait trop \u00e9troite \u00e0 certains tribunaux. J'estime que c'est \u00e0 tort. Voyez cidessous nos. 927 et suiv.\nSo we are not driven to a construction out of harmony with the declared intention of the legislature. It is proper to add that we need not concern ourselves with the rival interpretations of the Code Napol\u00e9on which during the past twenty years have been so much debated in France. The key to the legislative intention furnished us by the legislature itself is wanting to the interpreters of that instrument; and we are not required to surmise what the result might have been, had we been called upon to construe art. 1054 C.C., so to speak in vacuo\u2014disregarding both the state of the law when the Code came into force and the course of judicial decision since. On the other hand the views respecting the effect of those articles of the Code Napol\u00e9on upon which the provisions of the Quebec Civil Code were founded which had prevailed in France down to the time of the promulgation of the latter Code have, I think, a material bearing upon the construction of those provisions.\nThe view of the first paragraph of art. 1384 Code Napol\u00e9on above indicated, is that which (as Mon. Josser and says in the passage quoted)[40] prevailed in France for three-quarters of a century. It was the view which the French tribunals still applied when, in 1861, the Commissioners reported their draft of the provisions upon the title of \"Obligations\" and, in 1866, when the Code was promulgated. That in the verbal changes made by them in adopting the provisions of the French Code the Commissioners had no suspicion that they were affecting any substantial alteration of the law upon the point in question here is made quite clear by the passage in their report (first report, p. 16) referring to those provisions.\nHere is the passage:\nThe articles of chapter III. \"of offences and quasi-offences\" correspond with the articles of the French Code, except that the wording has been changed to obviate certain objections raised to the latter; and in No. 74.(79) an addition has been made to the enumeration of cases to which the article applies. These are the paragraphs relating to tutors and curators of insane persons.\nExcept upon the inadmissible hypothesis that the distinguished Commissioners were deliberately practising a deception upon the legislature this is not the language of trained lawyers, who, having been instructed to present to the legislature a Code embodying the law then in force, were intentionally introducing a profound modification into the rules of law upon the subject of torts both as they were found in the existing law and as they were then understood to be declared by the instrument the Commissioners were in substance professing to adopt. It is hardly to be supposed that the legislature with this report before it would be keener than the codifiers to detect the change.\nIndeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the assumption involved in the view of the court below is this: that this self-delusion of the Commissioners and the consequent delusion of the legislature respecting the true construction of art. 1054 C.C., were participated in for almost a generation in every quarter of the Province of Quebec; and that the Court of King's Bench, down to the year 1908, and this court, down to this moment, have continued to give decisions in actions of tort arising in that province in ignorance or disregard of the fact, that in the deeply important point of the onus of proof the law was radically altered in 1866; that, in a word, the Commissioners who framed the law, the legislature that passed it and the courts of appeal that, for forty years, have applied it have all shared in this far-reaching misconception of its meaning and effect. That is an assumption which (with great respect) I decline to act upon without some reason more convincing than any yet advanced.\nIn the view expressed above an examination of the 'French text becomes unnecessary. Article 2615 C.C., expressly provides that, where the French and English versions differ, that construction is to be adopted which most nearly accords with the existing law upon the topic dealt with; and, assuming the language of the French version to lend some support to that view of the article, which would appear if adopted to effect little less than a revolution in the law on this subject as in practice administered in this court, the provision just quoted even on that assumption requires us to resort to the law of Quebec as it stood in 1866.\nI now come to the question whether in this view of the law the plaintiff has shewn that the injury of which he complains was due to the fault of the appellants. The relevant facts not in dispute are these; the carbide of calcium is, for the purposes of commerce, produced by the fusion in an electric furnace of carbon and unslaked lime. The appellants use furnaces of two kinds. One in which the constituents of the carbide are reduced to a liquid state, and the liquid carbide itself is run off through one or more openings at stated intervals; another in which the crucible itself containing the fused product is, from time to time as it becomes filled, removed, and another substituted. The first mentioned of these types of furnaces, according to the evidence of the respondent, was known at the appellants' works as la fournaise experimentale; the last mentioned as the \"Willson\" furnace. The ports through which in the first mentioned type the liquid carbide is run, are, except when open for that purpose, sealed with mortar. When the liquid is to be run off the furnace is tapped, that is to say, the plug of mortar is pierced, and the orifice cleaned out. When the run has been completed the opening is sealed again. It was the respondent's duty, with the assistance of another workman, to tap one of these furnaces and to clear the opening; and it was while engaged in this duty that he met with the injury giving rise to this litigation. The practice was that the liquid having been run off and the orifice cleaned, the mortar for plugging it again was placed on the bottom of the opening by the respondent's helpers. Then the respondent proceeded to press it home, employing for that purpose a long poker having a circular iron disc: at its end. On the day of the accident he had just pressed the mortar to the bottom of the orifice, when a loud explosion occurred, accompanied by a discharge through the opening of flaming liquid carbide which burned the respondent severely, destroying his sight.\nThus far, I say the facts are undisputed; and the disputes, so far as concerns the primary facts, are confined to two points. First, it is said that no proper instructions were given to Doucet. Upon this point, there is no finding by the learned trial judge; but there is a finding in favour of the appellants by the Court of Review, and, having regard to the admissions of the respondent, and the positive evidence given by the assistant superintendent of the appellants, it would, I think, be quite impossible to justify the reversal of that finding. Assuming, moreover, some lack of instruction, there is not upon the evidence, I think, the slightest ground for suggesting that the explosion can be attributed to any want of knowledge on the part of the respondent.\nThe other point in controversy is this: The assistant superintendent says that the respondent was \"the boss of the job,\" that he was responsible for feeding, sealing and tapping the furnace, during his shift. The respondent denies that he was ever appointed foreman; but he constantly speaks of his associate as \"mon homme\" and his own account leaves little room for dispute that he assumed charge of the furnace and directed the operations mentioned. Here, again, there is no finding by the trial judge, and it seems clear no adequate reason for disturbing the finding of the Court of Review in the appellants' favour. The question to be determined is whether these facts afford a sufficient foundation for the inference that the injury suffered by the respondent was due to the fault of the appellants.\nThe duty of the appellants under the law of Quebec in respect of the care to be exercised for the protection of their workmen (speaking now apart from any question arising out of the construction of article 1054 C.C.), has in this court been more than once explained. The employer is not to insure the safety of his workmen. He is bound to take all reasonable steps to the end that they shall not, because of any defect or insufficiency in his plant or appliances or because of anything unnecessarily dangerous in his system or methods, be exposed to any avoidable risk or harm; and further, where the employment is hazardous (so that in spite of all practicable precautions accidents likely to cause harm are to be expected) he is bound to take the necessary steps to minimize, so far as may reasonably be possible, the evil effects of such accidents when they do occur. It is only a corollary of this to say that in the last mentioned case\u2014where the employment is dangerous\u2014all protective measures are required (reasonably consistent with the prosecution of the duties of the employment) which the knowledge and the practical experience of a prudent and competent employer would suggest.\nSuch are the measures which in such circumstances are demanded by the requirement of reasonable care on the part of the employer. That is the effect of the passage from Dal. Jur. Gen., 1870, 3, 63, adopted by the Chief Justice in Royal Paper Mills v. Cameron[41], at pages 368 and 369, which I think summarizes the law on this point as it has been enunciated and applied in the decisions of this court.\nI understand the judges below to put the responsibility of the employer in respect of the safety of his employees rather higher than this. Archambault J., for example, quotes with approval a dictum to the effect, that the employer is bound to know when a machine or process is dangerous. I do not think that can be supported.\nThe employer is bound to have the knowledge of a competent person; but he is not to be held to know that which competent persons do not know. To hold otherwise would result in making him liable in a very large number of cases which now fall under the head of \"inevitable accident.\"\nThe question then is, first, whether the discharge of carbide from which the respondent suffered was due to any failure of the duty; and, secondly: Does the evidence shew that the appellants ought at any rate to have anticipated as a possible accident the discharge of carbide from the furnace in such a way as to endanger the safety of their employees? And\u2014if so\u2014 was the injury to the respondent due to the omission of any precaution which prudence and competent skill and experience would have dictated as likely to reduce the chances of such an accident, or to minimize the injurious effects of it, should it occur?\nThe learned trial judge has in general terms found that the mishap was due to the negligence of the appellants. The specific grounds upon which this finding appears to be based are, that, first, the continuous heating of the furnace, and, secondly, the use of mortar for filling the openings mentioned, constituted two unnecessary sources of danger. With great respect, the, first of these grounds be- longs, I think, to the realm of pure conjecture. There is literally no evidence to support or even suggest it. The second, also must be rejected for want of evidence to shew that the appellants should have known (or at least foreseen the possibility) that the use of mortar would be a source of danger.\nThe learned judge based his view apparently upon some rather doubtful evidence to the effect that after the accident the appellants discarded lime as an element in their sealing mixture. Such evidence is, I think, quite irrelevant to the question to be tried, which is whether, before the accident, in the then existing state of experience, the failure of such knowledge or foresight is to be imputed to them for a breach of duty. Conduct pursued in the light of experience derived from the accident itself can hardly be taken as a sufficient basis for a charge of want of care in not taking the same course before the accident occurred. The views which I think have generally prevailed upon this point are summarized by Mr. Justice Gray in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in Columbia and P.S. Railroad Co. v. Hawthorne[42], at pages 207-208, in the following passage:\nThe only States, so far as we are informed, in which subsequent changes are held to be evidence of prior negligence are Pennsylvania and Kansas, the decisions in which are supported by no satisfactory reason. McKee v. Bidwell[43], and cases cited; St. Louis & San Francisco Railway. Co. v. Weaver[44].\nThe true rule and the reasons for it were expressed in Morse y. Minneapolis & St. Louis RIy Co.[45], above cited, in which Mr. Justice Mitchell, delivering the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, after referring to earlier opinions of the same court the other way, said: \"But on mature reflection, we have concluded that evidence of this kind ought not to be admitted under any circumstances, and that the rule heretofore adopted by this court is on principle wrong; not for the reason given by some courts, that the acts of the employees in making such repairs are not admissible against their principals, but upon the broader ground that such acts afford no legitimate basis for construing such an act as an admission of previous neglect of duty. A person may have exercised all the care which the law required, and yet, in the light of his new experience, after an unexpected accident has occurred, and as a measure of extreme caution, he may adopt additional safeguards. The more careful a person is, the more regard he has for the lives of others, the more likely he would be to do so, and it would seem unjust that he could not do so without being liable to have such. acts construed as an admission of prior negligence. We think such a rule puts an unfair interpretation upon human conduct, and virtually holds out an inducement for continued negligence.\"\nThe same rule appears to be well settled in England. In a case in which it was affirmed by the Court of Exchequer, Baron Bramwell said: \"People do not furnish evidence against themselves simply by adopting a new plan in order to prevent the recurrence of the accident. I think that a proposition to the contrary would be barbarous. It would be, as I have often had occasion to tell juries, to hold that, because the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it was foolish before.\" Hart v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[46].\nThe considerations developed in this passage, it will be observed are considerations of general application, the force of which would not appear to be affected by anything peculiar to the system of law prevailing in Quebec.\nThe respondent, it is true, attributes the accident to an excess of water in the mortar; but it is quite clear at the same time that this is simply a guess; Archambault J. expresses and proceeds upon the view that the contact of such an excess of water with the flaming carbide would produce acetylene gas, which is explosive. This view, again, is not based upon evidence; and with great respect, I do not think it competent for any court to arrive at an adjudication imputing fault and consequent liability upon the basis of scientific opinions having no foundation in the evidence upon the record, touching questions respecting the nature and results of chemical processes which, to say the least, are not immediately obvious.\nAssuming, for example (a fact well enough known though not touched upon in the record), that the elements of water and of calcium carbide (when the two substances are brought together at ordinary temperatures) do separate and recombine to form, among other things, acetylene gas, can one affirm that the introduction of water into an electric furnace in full operation could bring about the decomposition of a mass of molten carbide there? Would the water not be converted into steam before it could by any possibility come into contact with the carbide? Will steam and 'molten carbide decompose one another? Such questions must obviously be considered in any rational investigation of the point mentioned, and the record presents literally no materials enabling one to answer them intelligently.\nBut there is another view which must be examined, and that is that there is sufficient ground in the circumstances of this case for affirming that the explosion in question was due to some want of care on the part of the appellants, although the specific point in which they failed in their duty is not made to appear. There are many cases in which the fact alone of an accident occurring is held to be a sufficient foundation for such an inference. Speaking broadly, in England and in the United States, this inference is held to be permissible when the injury has been caused by something wholly within the control of the defendant or of persons for whose actions he was responsible, and the occurrence to which the injury was due was not of such a character as would ordinarily take place in the absence of negligence. Given these conditions, the inference in the absence of explanation is a plain one, but the question whether the inference is, or is not permissible, is in truth, not a question of law at all. Apart from specific rule it is merely a question of right thinking. Although, therefore, the conditions under which the maxim \"res ipsa loquiter\" is normally applied in jurisdictions where the common law prevails, are not present here (in that vis-a-vis, the respondent, the furnace cannot be said to have been wholly within the control of the appellants); still, if the facts in evidence in the present case could be said to justify the conclusion that assuming the absence of negligence on the part of the respondent and his helper (and I think we cannot, on the evidence attribute the accident to any such negligence), such an explosion would not occur except as the result of some negligence in respect either of the construction of the furnace, or of the methods of operation (although we might be entirely in the dark as to the specific thing wrongfully done or omitted) a prim\u00e0 facie case of negligence would clearly be made out. To say that such conditions were present is only another way of saying there was evidence of negligence.\nBut these conditions are not present. The explosion stands, as a single, unexplained, isolated fact. The evidence relating both to the furnace and to the nature of the process is strikingly meagre. The construction of the furnace itself is not really described; and apart from the facts that the carbide is produced by the fusion of lime and coke by means of an electric furnace, and that the liquid carbide is run off in the manner already described, we know nothing whatever of the process. Is it then safe on such a state of the evidence to affirm as the basis of a judicial decision that this single occurrence was anything other than a pure accident? That it would not have taken place without negligence? Or that the possibility of it ought to have been foreseen? After ransacking the evidence for materials to support a reasoned conclusion on these points I find myself still in the region of surmise.\nSome minor contentions remain. It is said that the description of the furnace as \"la fournaise experimentale\" that the use of it was a mere experiment; and that the evidence of the defendants' superintendent contains what was in effect an admission that there was a known risk of such an escape of gas as might cause injury. The experiment indicated by the name \"la fournaise experimentale\" may have been, and it most likely was a trial of the comparative cost of operating the two types of furnaces. The evidence at all events does not point to anything else; and there is literally nothing to indicate that at the time of the accident the furnace was in respect of the safety of operating it in an experimental stage. At that time the \"Will-son\" furnace appears to have been almost, if not altogether, displaced. The descriptive phrase applied to the other type had evidently survived the experiment. There is nothing whatever to shew that one type of furnace had not been as fully tested as the other; and to assume that either of them is in more general use than the other, or that furnaces in which the molten product is drawn off by tapping have not been tried and generally adopted is again to pass entirely beyond the region of legitimate deduction from the facts before us. Then as to the admission of the superintendent. This is the passage in which it is said to be found:\nA.\u2014Well, the proper way was to fill the furnace, and to make the carbide, certain details about these furnaces are not necessary to be given to the men, they are simple, but they were given just the same; I told him to empty or blow the furnace when it was necessary to do so at certain intervals.\nQ.\u2014And did you ever notice that he had not done it according to the instructions received? A.\u2014Mr. Doucet was a good workman, but it is possible that on certain occasions the work has not been done well, it is possible it was so about the feeding of the furnace, but I cannot tell.\nQ.\u2014What did you say to Doucet, besides? A.\u2014I told him how to do the work right as it had to be done.\nQ.\u2014What had to be done for the feeding of the furnace? A.\u2014 Well, if the gas would come out too fast, they must look out and put something in the furnace.\nQ.\u2014Is the operation a dangerous one? A.\u2014No, I did not say it was dangerous.\nQ.\u2014Why did you give these instructions to Doucet then? A.\u2014 Because I was in charge of the furnace.\nQ.\u2014And what did you say besides about the furnace? A.\u2014I told him how to feed the furnace and how to do all the operations he had to perform.\nThis passage has been, I think, misunderstood. The witness is not on the point of danger at all\u2014he is discussing the operation of feeding the furnace; and he says that when the gas escapes freely and in large volume, the workmen whose duty it is to do so, must put in a fresh supply of the materials out of which the carbide is produced. The reason for this is not explained; but one naturally supposes that a too rapid escape of gas (which probably finds its outlet through these materials and the opening by which the furnace is fed), indicates that the supply of material is low and that in consequence some waste of power is taking place. That would seem to be the simple explanation; but the passage as it stands, without elucidation, cannot certainly with justice be regarded as containing an admission or even a suggestion that the process should have been known to be (or was in fact) a dangerous one.\nThe court below has held that a proper regard for the safety of its employees would have suggested to the appellant the use of masks for the protection of their faces. But, why, if there was no reason to anticipate an accident of such a character as frequent or make useful that kind of protection? The fact that after the accident masks were supplied is relied upon; and I have already given my reasons for thinking this circumstance to be immaterial. Moreover, what ground is there for suggesting that any mask having a mesh large enough to leave the employees free to perform their necessary duty would have afforded them any protection against the spurt of liquid from which the respondent unfortunately suffered. This, again, is a question we may guess about, and again by no means intelligently answer from the materials before us.\nFor these reasons, I think, the Court of Review right in holding that the respondent has failed to prove his case\u2014has failed, that is to say, to establish it by direct evidence or by proof of facts which afford sufficient ground for a reasoned inference that the injury from which he unfortunately suffers was due to the appellants' fault.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff lost his sight by an explosion, which occurred while he was performing duties assigned to him by his employers, the defendants, in attending an electric carbide furnace. This furnace had been recently installed and was operated upon a system materially different from that which had obtained in the defendants' establishment in connection with furnaces of another class. It was attended by two sets of men\u2014a day-shift and a night-shift. It was the duty of these men to fill the furnace with coke and lime; to draw off the liquid carbide, when ready, through openings at the base of the furnace; and then to cleanse the orifices and to close them with plugs of mortar preparatory to recharging. This work was done once every hour.\nThe plaintiff and his assistant, who constituted the night-shift, came on duty about 7 o'clock in the evening, and the plaintiff when injured had been at work about twenty minutes. The men of the day-shift had charged the furnace and left a quantity of mortar ready for use. After opening the orifices and allowing the liquid carbide to run off, the plaintiff cleansed them, and the explosion occurred while he was closing one of the orifices with a plug of mortar\u2014which one, or whether the others were all open or all closed, or some open and some closed, does not appear.\nAlthough not directly established by the evidence, there can be little doubt that contact of carbide in the furnace or in one of its orifices with water, or water vapour from the mortar used to close them, caused the explosion.\nThe Court of Review did not dissent from, and the Court of King's Bench expressly affirmed, the finding of the learned trial judge that the explosion cannot be ascribed to any fault or neglect of the plaintiff. This conclusion appears to be well supported by the evidence. The plaintiff had discretion neither as to the work which he was required to do nor as to the manner in which he should carry it out, and he was, when injured, discharging his duties in the manner in which he had been instructed to perform them. The carbide furnace had been left charged by the men of the day-shift. The plaintiff and his assistant, shortly after coming on duty, drew off the liquid carbide and, having cleansed the orifices as instructed, they quite properly proceeded to plug them with mortar prepared for that purpose by the men of the day-shift. These circumstances preclude any imputation of fault or neglect against the plaintiff.\nMoreover, I would note en passant, that, to me, they seem to establish that, as found by the learned trial judge, and the majority of the judges in the Court of King's Bench, the things which caused the explosion, though the plaintiff was actually engaged with them, were not under his control or care, but were under the control and care of the defendants. They all belonged to them and were in use for their immediate purposes and profit. They had the direction and control of the manufacturing operations. The plaintiff was an unskilled workman\u2014a servant acting in conformity to orders. I entertain no doubt that, upon the true construction of art. 1054 C.C., these things were in the control of the defendants.\nI think it quite possible that evidence could have been adduced that it was highly and unnecessarily dangerous to plug the orifices of a carbide furnace with mortar made with water, and that this in itself constituted a defective system for which the defendants should be held responsible; that their chemist should have anticipated the occurrence of an explosion and that they could easily have taken precautions which would have saved the plaintiff from the severe injuries which he sustained. But the record does not contain such evidence, and without it I would hesitate to rest a judgment upon these grounds. If the plaintiff must succeed upon proven, as distinguished from presumed, fault on the part of the defendants, he is charged with the burden of furnishing the proof.\nIn the absence of fault or neglect on the part of the plaintiff, the very fact of the explosion establishes that there must have been some defect in the system, the furnace, the means employed for cleaning out the orifices, the materials used to plug them, or the composition of these materials, because, with conditions entirely proper, such an explosion should not have occurred. What the precise defect was the evidence does not disclose. Whether it was patent or latent, discoverable or non-discoverable, and if discoverable by what degree of care or by what tests, are questions to which the evidence does not afford answers. But that the explosion was due to some defect\u2014to this extent res ipsa loquitur.\nYet, unless patent, or discoverable by reasonable care and diligence, the existence of the defect would not per se constitute negligence of the defendants.\nThe master is not an insurer of the safety of his workmen, or servants, and I am unable to understand the principle upon which some of the Quebec decisions proceed, in which, apparently without invoking the provisions of art. 1054 C.C., the employer has been held liable for injuries due to latent defects. Mignault, Droit Civil, vol. 5, p. 372. In several of the cases cited by this learned author the facts in evidence appear to have justified a finding of negligence on the part of the defendants. But, if by \"latent defects'' we are to understand defects not discoverable by the exercise of reasonable care or skill, I am, with respect, unable to agree that for injuries due to such defects, apart from the provisions of art. 1054 C.C., the employer should be held responsible. Mr. Walton in an interesting article[47], points out that, in the French Cour de Cassation, the liability of the master for injuries to his servants, due to occult faults, was formerly restricted to cases in which the plaintiff could establish a definite vice de construction and was then based upon art. 1384 C.N.\nWhile it seems not improbable that the plaintiff might have procured evidence to shew that the explosion was due to some defect in the defendants' system, or in their plant or its accessories, the existence of which, because discoverable by reasonable care and susceptible of remedy, should be deemed negligence on their part, he has failed to adduce this evidence and the mere occurrence of the explosion does not, I think, warrant the inference that it was caused by such negligence. Without evidence that the defendants should have anticipated danger to their workmen, I am not prepared to hold that they were guilty of fault or negligence because they omitted to warn the plaintiff of the danger to which he was exposed or to furnish him with a mask or spectacles or other means to guard against its consequences.\nUpon this view of the evidence I am unable to perceive the applicability of the decision of the Judicial Committee in McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[48], cited by Carroll J. In that case there was such evidence of defects in machinery and process likely to cause a disastrous explosion, that Lord Macnaghten felt impelled to say:\nThe wonder really is, not that the explosion happened as and when it did, but that things went on so long without an explosion. That these proven defects actually caused the explosion the jury were, in the peculiar circumstances, allowed to infer without direct proof.\nI am, with great respect, of the opinion that the judgment in appeal cannot be supported on the ground that, apart from any presumption of fault, the evidence sufficiently establishes that the explosion which injured the plaintiff was caused by actual fault or negligence on the part of the defendants.\nIt is therefore necessary to deal with the contention of the plaintiff that, under art. 1054 C.C., upon the facts in evidence, there is a presumption of fault on the part of the defendants.\nArts. 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code are as follows:\n1053. Every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\n1054. He is responsible not only for the damage caused by his own fault, but also for that caused by the fault of persons under his control and by things which he has under his care;\nThe father, or, after his decease, the mother, is responsible for the damage caused by their minor children;\nTutors are responsible in like manner for their pupils;\nCurators or others having the legal custody of insane persons, for the damage done by the latter;\nSchoolmasters and artisans, for the damage caused by their pupils or apprentices while under their care;\nThe responsibility attaches in the above cases only when the person subject to it fails to establish that he was unable to prevent the act which has caused the damage.\nMasters and employers are responsible for the damage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work for which they are employed.\nThere is no decision of this court upon the construction and effect of article 1054 C.C. In Paquet v. Dufour[49], Mr. Justice Girouard, at page 334, de- clined to subscribe to the view that where an explosion had been caused by dynamite under the care of the defendant he should be held responsible for the resulting damages unless he should prove that it was impossible for him to have prevented the occurrence. No other member of the court took this position. Although in several cases, not unlike that now under consideration, which have come to this court on appeal from the Province of Quebec, there have been broad statements that in order to succeed the plaintiff must affirmatively prove actionable negligence on the part of the defendant, the claim put forward has invariably been founded upon an allegation of negligence which the plaintiff has failed to establish by the evidence which he adduced, and the court acting upon the view that the judgment should be \"secundum allegata et probata,\" has refused him relief. In none of these cases, so far as I have been able to discover, has the construction or effect of article 1054 C.C., been discussed, and I have found no case except Paquet v. Dufour[50], in which there has been any expression of opinion by a judge of this court upon the construction of this provision of the Code.\nIn several cases in the Quebec courts there are broad statements to the effect that proof of fault on the part of the defendant is essential in order to establish his liability\u00bb Mercier v. Morin[51], is an instance. In most of these cases, however, no express reference is made to article 1054 CC. There are other decisions of the Quebec courts, such as Dupont v. Quebec Steamship Co.[52], cited by Mr. Justice Archambault, in which it has been held that the effect of article 1054 CO., is that, upon proof by the plaintiff that his injuries were caused by things under the care of the defendant, a presumption arises that such injuries are ascribable to the fault of the defendant, and the burden of proof is shifted, with the result that the defendant will be held responsible in damages, unless he shews that he could not (presumably by the exercise of reasonable care and skill) have prevented the occurrence. This was the opinion of the learned trial judge in the present case and of the judges who composed the majority of the Court of King's Bench, and it was not dissented from in the Court of Review.\nIt is manifest that it would be futile to attempt to reconcile this view of the law with the consid\u00e9rant of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Dionne[53], quoted by my brother Duff. But we may not reverse the judgment now in appeal merely because it is not in accord with an earlier opinion of the Court of King's Bench. We must be satisfied that the judgment in the present case is erroneous.\nThe earlier French authorities held the master responsible where a workman had sustained injuries of which the cause was unknown. But at a later period, possibly because they feared that the defendant's responsibility for damages caused by inanimate things in his care would otherwise under the Code Napol\u00e9on be absolute and unqualified, the French courts and authors of repute took the view that it could not have been intended that he should be subjected to such a serious burden without proof of fault or negligence. The contrary view, however, was steadfastly maintained by such able commentators as MM. Marcad\u00e9 and Josserand. More recently the French Cour de Cassation, which apparently evaded the question as long as possible (Dalloz, 1907, 1, 177), seems to have felt itself constrained by the explicit language of art. 1384 C.N., to accede to the view supported by MM. Marcad\u00e9 and Josserand, and, in a very late decision, reported in Dalloz[54], that court appears to have committed itself to the proposition that a plaintiff who proves that he has been injured by an inanimate thing, e.g., machinery, in the care of the defendant, is entitled to recover damages from the latter without adducing evidence of fault on his part; the presumption thus established, says the court, may be met by proof that the injuries of the victim are due entirely to his own fault.\nFrom a still more recent case decided in the fourth Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Paris, I take the following head-note:\nSi l'article 1384, alin\u00e9a 1er, du code civil, en disposant que Ton r\u00e9pond du dommage caus\u00e9 par le fait des choses que Ton a sous sa garde, cr\u00e9e une responsabilit\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur une pr\u00e9somption de faute, cette pr\u00e9somption peut \u00eatre d\u00e9truite par la preuve d'un cas de force majeure ou d'un cas fortuit ou de l'inexistence de toute faute pouvant \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qui la garde de la chose, soit \u00e0 raison de l'\u00e9tat mat\u00e9riel de cette chose, soit \u00e0 raison des conditions de son emploi. Recueil Phily, 1909, p. 926, No. 5039.\nWhile the opinions of the French courts (Cassation and Appeal) are not binding upon this court, they are entitled, particularly when they deal with provisions of the French Code similar to those of the Quebec Civil Code, and of French and not of English origin, to the very greatest respect.\nIt was strongly pressed upon us by counsel for the respondent that the sixth paragraph of article 1054 CO., is applicable not only to the second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs, but also to the first paragraph of the article. The judgment of the Court of King's Bench proceeds upon this view. For the appellant it is contended that the application of the sixth paragraph does not extend to the first paragraph, but is restricted to paragraphs 2 to 5 inclusive.\nFor convenient reference I shall set out here the sixth clause of article 1054 of the Civil Code and also the corresponding clause of the Code Napol\u00e9on.\nThe former reads as follows:\nThe responsibility attaches in the above cases only when the person subject to it fails to establish that he was unable to prevent the act which has caused the damage.\nAnd, in the French version:\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus a lieu seulement lorsque la personne qui y est assujettie ne peut prouver qu'elle n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nThe provision of the Napoleonic Code, article 1384, is as follows:\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus a lieu, \u00e0 moins que les p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, instituteurs et artisans, ne prouvent qu'ils n'ont pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui donne lieu \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9.\nThe restricted application of this clause in the Napoleonic Code admits of no doubt. But the language of the provisions of the Quebec Civil Code does not at all so distinctly define its applicability. That the responsibility under the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., in the case of damage caused by things which the defendant has under his care, if fault or negligence is to be presumed against him, may otherwise be exceedingly onerous because absolute and unqualified, affords a very strong argument in support of the view that the exculpatory clause should be held to apply to it, and the departure from phraseology of the Code Napol\u00e9on in substituting for its precise and unmistakable language the somewhat indefinite phrase \"la responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus\" which is, translated, \"the responsibility in the above cases,\" is quite consistent with and in fact rather indicative of a design to extend the application of this clause to all the cases covered by the article except those of masters and employers. Otherwise, why should not the codifiers of the Quebec Civil Code have adopted the language of the Code Napol\u00e9on merely inserting \"curator and custodian of the insane\" in addition to \"father and mother, schoolmasters and artisans?\"\nPressed by these arguments, I was for spine time of the opinion that the exculpatory clause of art. 1054 C.C., should be held applicable to all cases within the first paragraph of the article except those in which the damage had been caused by the fault of the defendant himself. But upon further consideration I am convinced that this clause does not apply at all to the first paragraph. That it cannot apply to cases of damage caused by the fault of the defendant himself is obvious. That it was not meant to apply to the responsibility of masters and employers for damage caused by their servants and workmen is also clear. Yet if the clause should be held to apply to the cases covered by the first paragraphs of damage \"caused by the fault of persons under his (the defendant's) control,\" would it not apply to the liability of masters and employers for damage caused by their servants and workmen, inasmuch as servants and workmen are persons under the control of their masters and employers? Then when it is sought to apply this clause to cases of damage caused by things under the defendant\u2019s care, the language of the English version, viz., that he was \"unable to prevent the act which has caused the damage,\" presents a very serious difficulty because it is certainly inaccurate to speak of the \"act\" of an inanimate thing. It is true that upon the word \"fait\" of the French version the difficulty may not be so great. But both versions of the Code are of equal authority, and in this instance the original was the English version rather than the French. (McCord's Civil Code, Preface, p. ix.) While I cannot but think the departure at this point from the language of the Napoleonic Code unfortunate, yet notwithstanding the uncertainty to which the words \"la responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus\" are calculated to give rise, I think it reasonably clear that the cases mentioned in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of article 1054 C.C., are given as specific instances of \"damage caused by persons under his (the defendant's) control,\" and that to these cases\u2014\"the above cases\"\u2014the sixth paragraph applies, whereas to the other specified cases of damage caused by persons under the defendant's control, viz., those mentioned in the seventh paragraph, which deals with the responsibility of masters and employers, for damage caused by their servants and workmen, as well as to any other cases within the description \"damage caused by the fault of persons under his (the defendant's) control\" not particularized in the article, the sixth paragraph has no application. It follows that this paragraph affords no assistance in construing the first paragraph of the article, which must now be carefully examined.\nThe codifiers of the Civil Code had before them the Code Napol\u00e9on. In article 1054 C.C., they followed the form of article 1384 C.N. The differences in language cannot be regarded as merely accidental. They were no doubt carefully considered and their significance may not be ignored. Thus we find in the first paragraph the word \"faute\" in the Quebec Civil Code in lieu of the word \"fait\" of the Code Napol\u00e9on. We find that in the case of \"things\" the responsibility under the Code Napol\u00e9on is for damage \"caus\u00e9 par le fait * * * des choses que l'on a sous sa garde\" while under the Civil Code it is for damage \"caus\u00e9 * * * par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde\" Care was taken when substituting the word \"faute\" for \"fait\" that it should not extend to the case of damage caused by things. These differences between the terms of the corresponding paragraphs of the two Codes certainly indicate that the Quebec codifiers intended that evidence of fault of the defendant or of defects in the things themselves should not be a necessary element in the plaintiff's case where damage has been caused to him by things under the care of the defendant.\nBut, according to all authorities, the cardinal rule for interpreting the Code is, that where the language is clear and free from ambiguity, effect must be given to it and it may not be explained away or controlled by referring to other sources. Here the terms of the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., are simple and unequivocal. He (every person capable, etc.) is responsible for damage caused \"by things which he has under his care.\" These words immediately follow an article in which proof of fault as the basis of liability is the dominant idea. That idea is continued in this paragraph as to the acts or omissions of the defendant himself or of persons under his control, and its application to these cases is perhaps emphasized by the use of the word \"faute\" where the Code Napol\u00e9on employs the word \"fait\" But in the case of damage caused by things under the care of the defendant the idea of proof of fault is entirely, and I see no reason for thinking that it was not deliberately, eliminated.\nNo part of article 1054 C.C., is found in brackets. This indicates that the Commissioners did not intend in this article to alter or to amend what they understood to be the existing law of Lower Canada. Under that law, an injured plaintiff was required to adduce positive evidence of fault on the part of the defendant, if he would have the court hold the latter responsible. Because they regard article 1054 C.C., as merely delaratory of the former law, writers and judges have expressed the view that when the plaintiff proves that he has been injured by things under the control of the defendant he must, in addition, adduce positive evidence of fault or negligence on the part of the latter. Mignault, Droit Civil, vol. V., pages 683-4. But the language of the article is explicit, and, in view of the evidence of deliberation in its use afforded by the comparison with the Code Napol\u00e9on, I perceive no sufficient reason for reading into it a qualification which has apparently been designedly omitted. In Trust and Loan Company of Canada v. Gauthier[55], art. 1301 of the Civil Code is dealt with. This article was reported by the codifiers as an embodiment of the existing statute law of Lower Canada as judicially interpreted. DeLorimier Biblioth\u00e8que du C.C., vol. X., page 303. Their Lordships say, at page 101:\nArticle 1301 clearly goes further than the law which prevailed in Lower Canada before the Code was framed; but their Lordships cannot accede to the argument that the language used and deliberately adopted in the Code must be narrowed and held to have no greater effect than the previous law for which it has been substituted.\nI would be better satisfied if I could find that article 1054 C.C., admitted of a construction upon which the exculpatory provision of its sixth paragraph might be extended to the case of damage caused by things in the care of the defendant. I fully realize that without this qualification the responsibility of persons in the position of these defendants may be very onerous, because I find it difficult, owing to the presence of an exculpatory clause restricted in its application to cases within the paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5, to accede to the view expressed by the Paris Court of Appeal that the first paragraph should be read as subject to a very similar qualification. Expressio unius, etc Yet it seems to me that to hold that the defendant is responsible for damage caused by things under his care only when it is proved by the plaintiff that he has been negligent or at fault is to give no effect to the concluding words of the first paragraph of the article, because fault imputable to the defendant must be either that of himself or of persons under his control, and damage caused by such fault is expressly declared actionable by the earlier clauses of the paragraph. Notwithstanding that judges for whose opinions I entertain the very greatest respect have taken a different view of the proper construction of the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., so far as it relates to cases of damage caused by things under the care of the defendant,. I am of opinion that the terms of this paragraph are so clear and unambiguous that it is impossible to refuse to give effect to them merely because the responsibility to which they subject defendants may be unusually onerous.\nBut, inasmuch as the defendants have offered no evidence to shew that the explosion was attributable to fault of the plaintiff, or to vis major, or that it was a case of pure accident, or that it occurred without fault imputable to themselves, it is not in this case necessary to determine whether or not such proof would suffice to relieve a defendant from responsibility. My conclusion is that, at all events, in the absence of such proof, a defendant must, without other evidence of fault or negligence, be held responsible for damages shewn to have been caused by things under his care.\nCases in which injury has been caused by things in the care of the defendant, but in use under statutory authority, form an exception to this general rule.\nThe legislature is supreme, and if it has enacted that a thing is lawful, such a thing cannot be a fault or an actionable wrong.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[56]. In such cases the defendant cannot be presumed to be at fault. Actual fault or negligence on his part must be established by evidence.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McLennan, Howard & Aylmer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Martel & Duplessis.\n[1] Q.R. 18 K.B. 271.\n[2] Q.R. 35 S.C. 385.\n[3] 1905] A.C. 72. 20\n[4] [1905] A.C. 72.\n[5] Art. 1053 et seq., Code Civil de Quebec.\n[6] Note S.

The Crown pleaded a denial of negligence and that the injury did not happen on a public work. The latter defence was not relied on at the trial, but the petition was dismissed on the ground that though sparks from an engine caused the fire, the suppliants had failed to prove that the engine was defective.\nCurrey K.C. and Mott K.C. for the appellants argued that the evidence established that the engine was defective shortly before the fire and that the court below was not justified in its deduction that such defect had been repaired.\nChrysler K.C. and McAlpine K.C. for the respondent. The Crown can only be liable under sub-sec. (c) of sec. 20, \"Exchequer Court Act,\" for \"injury to person or property on a public work.\" Here the property destroyed was on land of the suppliants at some distance from the right of way and not \"on a public work.\" The suppliants, therefore, do not bring their case within the statute and the judgment against them must stand.

The King[4].\nCurrey K.C. and Mott K.C. for the appellants\nChrysler K.C. and McAlpine K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In a long series of decisions this court has held that the phrase \"on a public work\" in sec. 20, sub-sec. (c), of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" must be read, to borrow the language of Mr. Justice Duff in The King v. Lefrancois[5], at p. 436,\nas descriptive of the locality in which the death or injury giving rise to the claim in question occurs,\nand that to succeed the suppliant must come within the strict words of the statute. Taschereau J. in Larose v. The King1. See also Paul v. The King3, and cases there cited. In this case the property destroyed by fire, previous to and at the time of its destruction, was upon the land of the suppliant, some distance from the right of way of the Intercolonial Railway and was not property on a public work. As to the objection that this question was not raised in the court below I refer to McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[6] If questions of law raised here for the first time appear upon the record we cannot refuse to decide them where no evidence could have been brought to affect them had they been taken at the trial. The point was taken by the pleadings if not urged at the argument below.\nGirouard J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought in the Exchequer Court on a claim for damages arising out of the destruction of the property of the suppliants claimed to have been caused by sparks from the smokestack of an Intercolonial Railway engine.\nThe property destroyed was previous to and at the time of its destruction upon the land of the suppliant some distance from the right of way of the railway, and was not property on a public work.\nThe learned judge, Mr. Justice Cassels, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, had not heard the witnesses, who had given their testimony before the late Justice Burbidge.\nThe suppliants were desirous to avoid the expense of a re-hearing, and with the assent of the respondent the case was fully argued before Mr. Justice Cassels on the evidence taken before Mr. Justice Burbidge.\nThe learned judge found as a fair conclusion to be drawn from the evidence that the fire originated from a spark or sparks emitted from the engine, but he was unable to find that it was caused through any defect in the engine for the existence of which and the failure to remedy which the Crown could be held liable for the losses claimed.\nOn this appeal the jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer over the claim in question was challenged and denied by Mr. Chrysler, his contention being that such jurisdiction was limited to claims against the Crown arising out of injuries to the person or property on a public work, and did not extend to injuries happening away from a public work, although caused by the operations of the Crown's officers or servants.\nThe cases in which the question has already come before this court for consideration were all referred to.\nWe are all of the opinion that the point has already been expressly determined by this court, particularly in the case of Paul v. The King[7]. In that case the majority of the court held after the fullest consideration that clause (c) of the 16th section of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" which alone could be invoked as conferring jurisdiction, only did so in the case of claims\narising out of any death or injury to the person or property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties.\nClaims for injuries not within these words of the section and occurring, not on, but away from, a public work, although arising out of operations wheresoever carried on, were held not to be within the jurisdiction conferred by the section.\nWith the policy of Parliament we have nothing to do. Our duty is simply to construe the language used, and if that construction does not fully carry out the intention of Parliament, and if a wider and broader jurisdiction is desired to be given the Exchequer Court, the Act can easily be amended.\nUnder these circumstances we must, without expressing any opinion upon the conclusions of fact reached by the learned judge, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J. concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nDuff and Anglin JJ. agreed in the opinions stated by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

Laidlaw and Georgelaurie (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Crowsnest Southern Railway Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1909: October 5, 6; 1909 November 02.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nRailways\u2014British Columbia Railway Act\u2014Fire on right\u2014of\u2014way\u2014Combustible matter on berm\u2014Origin of fire\u2014Damage to adjoining property\u2014Negligence\u2014Evidence\u2014Practice\u2014New points raised on appeal.\nIn an action against a railway company subject to the British Columbit Railway Act, if there is no evidence that the company had knowledge or notice of the existence of a fire on their right-of-way, not caused by the operation of the railway, the fact that the condition of the right-of-way facilitated the spread of the fire to adjoining property which was destroyed by it does not amount to actionable negligence.\nWhere a matter relied upon to support the action was not urged at the trial nor asserted on an appeal to the provincial court it is too late to put it forward for the first time on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nJudgment appealed from (14 B.C. Rep. 169) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Irving J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe case is stated in the judgments now reported. S. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellants.\nA. H. MacNeill K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The findings of facts having been unanimously agreed upon below should not be lightly disturbed.\nI, therefore, agree that appellants' claim, so far as rested upon the charge that the fire in question was the result of sparks from the respondents' engine or engines, should stand as disposed of by the courts below.\nThere remains, however, the question of respondents' liability for permitting the fire, however it may have arisen, on a part of its right of way covered with fallen timber and dry brush of a very inflammable character, to continue burning and unattended from about half-past seven A.M. to about one P.M., whilst easily extinguishable, and obviously liable to spread as it did on the rising of the slightest breeze, to the neighbouring timbered lands.\nThe law bearing upon this as I conceive it was not correctly presented to the courts below, nor, as far as I can see, was the evidence now relied upon directly called attention to. And, as a result of these omissions, I rather think the question now raised was by the judgments overlooked entirely. Counsel for the respondents very properly and candidly admits the legal question involved was discussed, and, I suspect from his statement, was correctly apprehended by the learned Chief Justice. But through overlooking the evidence now pressed upon our attention the court could not come to any other conclusion than it did. In fact, in giving judgment, the majority seem to have ignored the question entirely; and Mr. Justice Clement, I submit with respect, misapprehended the pleadings in this regard, for paragraphs four and six seem sufficient.\nThis is not a case of a party so deliberately abandoning a claim in appeal that he or it cannot now be heard in respect to it.\nAt common law the liability of a possessor of land for the spreading of fire originating on his land was practically so great as to render him an insurer.\nBy 6 Anne, ch. 31, sec. 6, this was modified and, later, was replaced by 14 Geo. III., ch. 78, sec. 86, which provides as follows:\nNo action, suit or process whatever shall be had, maintained or presented against any person in whose house, chamber, stable, barn or other building, or on whose estate any fire shall * * * accidently begin, nor shall any recompense be made by any such person for any damage suffered thereby; any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThis clearly does not abrogate the entire common law relative to liability for fire once started whether accidentally or otherwise. The owner of land is merely relieved from the inevitable consequences of such an accident. It leaves the avoidable consequences to be dealt with by applying those well-known principles of justice and reason which are represented by the maxim \"sic utere tuo ut alienum non lcedas.\"\nWas it reasonable or just for the respondents to have, to the knowledge of their employees (as the answers of their secretary to interrogatories shew was done), the extinguishable fire in question on their premises from\nearly in the morning of the 7th day of September and at other times in the forenoon of the 7th day of September?\nThe case of Furlong v. Carroll[2], in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson reviews the growth of the law.\nMust the appellants be deprived of their rights because too confident of one cause of action they overlooked accidentally their other cause of action, though that other was on record and supported by evidence but not fully presented or in law correctly presented ? I submit not. I think the appeal and causes of action so far as rested upon the charge that the fire originated from the respondents' engine should be dismissed with costs throughout, and such to include the general costs of the cause save what were incidental to paragraphs four and six of the statement of claim. I think a new trial of the issues arising thereon should be granted and that the costs of the last trial incidental thereto and of the new trial be in the discretion of the learned trial judge.\nDUFF J. concurred with Anglin J.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs' action was brought to recover damages sustained by them through the destruction by fire of a portion of a valuable timber limit. They charged that the fire in question originated on the right-of-way of the defendant railway company and was caused by sparks of fire negligently allowed to escape from an engine. They also charged that the right-of-way was encumbered with combustible material facilitating the spread of the fire; and, finally, that the defendants were negligent in not preventing the spread of the fire and in allowing it to reach the plaintiffs' land.\nAt the trial the attention of all parties was directed to the effort made by the plaintiffs to establish that the fire was caused by sparks or fire which escaped from an engine of the defendant company. The learned trial judge held that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that this was the origin of the fire, although they probably had established that the fire was first seen upon the defendants' right-of\u00adway. The learned judge was of opinion that unless the fire was shewn to have originated from the operation of an engine the condition of the right-of-way did not constitute actionable negligence. No other ground of action appears to have been urged at the trial. Nothing was there said in argument of the allegation now put forward that the defendants through their servants had notice of the existence upon their right-of-way of the fire which eventually spread to the plaintiffs' lands and were guilty of actionable negligence in not extinguishing it. Neither is any such cause of action alluded to in the notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which affirmed the judgment in favour of the defendants.\nIt is quite impossible upon the evidence before us to interfere with the finding that the evidence does not establish that the origin of the fire was the escape of sparks, ashes or fire from a locomotive operated by the defendants.\nThe duty of the defendants to maintain a clear right-of-way is inseparably connected with the opera tion of their railway. There is no such duty imposed upon them as mere landowners and, without proof of knowledge or notice of the existence of a fire, not shewn to have been caused by the operation of their railway, the fact that the condition of their right of way facilitated its spread does not, in my opinion, amount to actionable negligence. Upon both these grounds, therefore, the plaintiffs' appeal is hopeless.\nNor do I think that it would be a wise or proper exercise of discretion on the part of this court to permit the plaintiffs now to bring forward a cause of action which is evidently an afterthought. Upon the condition of the record before us they would certainly not be entitled to judgment upon this allegation of negligence and could, at best, ask that the case should be sent back for a new trial upon proper terms. If this cause of action had been presented to the trial judge, or, even though not there presented, if it had been made a ground of appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the present application to the discretion of this court might have been more favourably entertained. But where the plaintiffs have allowed the trial to come to a close without setting up the cause of action on which they now rely and have not asserted it on their application to the provincial court of appeal, it is too late to ask to be permitted to put it forward in this court.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harvey, McCarter & Macdonald.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Albert Howard MacNeill.\n[1] 14 B.C.

I agree with the reasons of the court of appeal for that judgment, delivered by Mr. Justice Beck, namely, that on the true construction of sub-section 4 of section 3, Title XXXII. of that ordinance declaring any person assessed in respect of any business \"not to be liable to pay a license fee in respect of the same business\" the words \"license fee\" apply clearly to a license issued by the municipal corporation and have no reference to the license issued by the provincial authorities under the \"Liquor License Ordinance.\" The City of Edmonton could not grant nor withhold the license in question in this case, and the language of the section must be held as applicable only to fees on licenses which were within their power to grant.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The \"Liquor License Ordinance\" passed in 1898 having provided that hotelkeepers should be licensed by the government, and that they should each pay an annual fee for the license and that incorporated cities or towns which provided by by-law certain specified means for enforcing the law were to receive an additional fee, the respondent's council passed, in 1900, the necessary by-law and became thereby entitled to receive this additional fee.\nThe appellant seeks to recover fees which he paid thereunder and rests his claim thereto on the ground that he paid, as required by the city's charter, a busi- ness tax which is not payable by those who are licensed by the city to carry on their business.\nIt is to be observed that it was not the city that granted or issued the licenses in question.\nAgain having regard to the scope of each act, I see no incompatibility between the provisions in the \"Liquor License Ordinance\" and this provision in the city charter, especially when the latter in express terms re-affirms the city by-laws of which the above mentioned was one.\nAnd even if the amendment of the by-law, in February, 1908, can be said to have been an act of the city which operated in any way as a licensing by virtue of the charter, that act must be taken to have had priority over the act of the assessor in making, in April, the assessment he made. The license fee was the first paid. If both could not stand, it should be the later imposition and levy that must fall, and this latter is not attacked. I, however, think both quite legal for the reasons assigned, above and in the courts below.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal cannot succeed.\nSub-section 2 of section 46 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance\" of the North-West Territories is in the following terms:\nIncorporated cities or towns (that have appointed an inspector or inspectors under the provisions of section 11 of this ordinance) may by by-law require each licensee to pay towards their municipal revenue such sums as they may determine not exceeding the amount of territorial duty payable on such license. * * *\nThe present action is brought to recover two sums of $400 each paid under protest by the plaintiff pur suant to the requirements of a by-law of the defendant municipality passed under this statutory provision. The appellant claims that the provisions of the special Act or charter of the City of Edmonton are inconsistent with the exercise of this power by that municipality in the case of this plaintiff who has been subjected by the city to a business tax or assessment in respect to his hotel business. In support of this position he principally relies upon a provision of subsection 4 of section 3 of Title XXXII. of the \"Charter of Edmonton\" that\nno person who is assessed in respect of any business * * * shall be liable to pay a license fee in respect of the same business.\nThe City Charter further provides, Title I., section 7:\nAll ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed in so far as they relate to the City of Edmonton; and where any matter or thing is provided for by this ordinance the provisions of any other ordinance in relation thereto shall be deemed to be superseded so far as they relate to the said city.\nThe appellant further argues that in respect to the plaintiff, because of his business assessment, the municipality of Edmonton is deprived of the power conferred on towns and cities by sub-section 2 of section 46 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance.\"\nThe sum of money which a licensee may, under the \"Liquor License Ordinance,\" be required to contribute to the municipal revenue is not a license fee in the sense in which those words are used in sub-section 4 of section 3, Title XXXII. of the \"Charter of Edmonton.\" The license fee under the \"Liquor License Ordinance\" is paid to the provincial government. The money paid to the municipality is not paid for a license to sell liquor.\nThen again by section 2, of title XXII. of its charter, the municipal council of Edmonton is empowered to pass by-laws\nfor the issue (sic.) of licenses and payment of license fees in respect of any business.\nThis provision must be held to refer to licenses which the municipality has power to issue and to fees in respect of such licenses. That it does not extend to liquor licenses, the issue of which is, by the general law of the province, reserved to the provincial executive, is made clear by the proviso appended to section 2 in these words,\nprovided that no such by-law shall be contrary to the general law of the Territories.\nIndeed I think \"the license fee\" mentioned in subsection 4 of section 3 of Title XXXII. of the charter must be a \"license fee\" which might, but for that section, be imposable under section 2 of Title XXII. by the municipality.\nI find nothing in the charter of the City of Edmonton inconsistent with the exercise in this case of the power conferred generally on cities and towns by subsection 2 of section 46 of the liquor license law.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 2 Alta.

Hence, an appellate court is not justified in ordering a new trial on the ground that counsel has been unduly restricted in cross-examination by a question being disallowed which did not, at the time it was put to the witness, have relevancy to the issues.\nIdington J. dissented on the ground that, under the circumstances of the case, counsel was entitled to have the question answered.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in banco, reversing the judgment of Martin J., at the trial, with costs, and ordering a new trial.\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin now reported.\nNewcombe K.C., for the appellant.\nJ. Travers Lewis K.C., for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. agreed in the reasons stated by Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises in an action by a wife against a husband long and widely separated in which he amongst other things pleaded laches in bringing the action, as well as the Statute of Limitations, and in the trial of which much might turn on their respective credibility.\nShe was in America and he in South Africa when the events took place as to his manner of life into which inquiry was being made at the trial.\nMuch necessarily depended on getting from himself that part of his life history or discrediting him entirely in regard thereto.\nHe had been examined for discovery. He is alleged to have admitted one bigamous marriage in South Africa, and in fact to have had improper relations there with another woman, but whether under cover of marriage or not had not been developed in his examination, when the unfortunate difference took place between the learned trial judge and counsel conducting this cross-examination.\nThe fact of one bigamous marriage having been contracted in Cape Town in South Africa was admitted, but exactly where defendant either would not or could not tell. There might be others, as the counsel in fact tells the court, and presumably wishing to identify the marriage he asked if that one then being spoken of by witness was his marriage with Magdalena Mary Snyder. Thereupon the court interrupted and ruled he could not go into that.\nCounsel asserted amongst other things that he desired to be in a position to put the examination for discovery in evidence and be in a position thereby to prove the fact and also effectively contradict the defendant. He was afraid to disclose to the witness just what his purpose was, and offered that discovery examination to the learned judge for perusal. That seems to have been declined. I do not see why this, which is not an unheard of method of assuring the judge of counsel's good faith and real purpose without forcing him to tell the witness and put him on his guard, was declined.\nCounsel also used illustrations indicating his purpose. He also, properly as I think, for quite evident reasons protested he should not be forced in face of such a witness to disclose his full purpose.\nI think he was entitled to have this question answered. It was probably the only means the respondent or her counsel had of identifying and distinguishing this marriage from another he was able by means of the discovery examination or otherwise to prove.\nI do not think counsel ought to be driven in such a case and with such a witness as the record discloses this was to ask the direct question, whether or not this was the only bigamous marriage he had contracted in South Africa. Nor do I think in such a case the court should insist on the literal adoption of any precise way of putting, or words in which it might think best to put a question, and refuse to allow another which counsel might prefer.\nIf, as prior rulings indicate, the fact of a marriage was the proper subject for inquiry at all, I submit with respect every latitude should have been given to counsel in relation to it. Either the ground should not have been entered on at all, or the work done thoroughly. The ruling at this point of the cross-examination I have referred to led to counsel withdrawing. A judgment was then entered for appellant and upon appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia a new trial was ordered and hence this appeal.\nI prefer not to deal with what appears in the course of the cross-examination leading up to this breaking off point beyond saying it indicates the witness to have been one with whom counsel needed a pretty free hand, indeed more so than he was given.\nThe appellate court having merely granted a new trial which bound no one's future rights in the premises, I submit with respect such an appeal to this court is to be regretted.\nIf, as seems quite possible, the appellant had contracted more than one bigamous marriage preceded by all which that implies, he may by untrustworthy evidence have won a judgment he is not entitled to.\nI submit it would be better to dismiss the appeal with costs and let the case be fully tried out.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The parties to this case are a wife and husband whose unfortunate matrimonial difficulties have culminated in proceedings by the wife for divorce.\nIn the present action the wife, as plaintiff, seeks to establish a partnership with her husband and claims from him an accounting. Denying the alleged partnership, the defendant also pleads in answer to the action laches and the Statute of Limitations.\nAfter a refusal of a motion for nonsuit the defendant entered the witness box. In the course of cross-examination he admitted having contracted a bigamous marriage in South Africa, ten months' co-habita- tion and the birth of a child. He also stated that he did not know in what precise place in the City of Cape Town the bigamous ceremony was performed. He was asked the name of the woman with whom the marriage had been contracted. This question the learned trial judge declined to compel him to answer, and, because this ruling was adhered to, the plaintiff's counsel withdrew from the case.\nOn the evidence before him the learned judge held that the plaintiff had failed to establish a partnership with the defendant and dismissed the action. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of British Columbia set aside this judgment and ordered a new trial, on the ground that the trial judge had unduly hampered the plaintiff's counsel in his cross-examination of the defendant; and the defendant was ordered to pay the costs of the former trial and of the appeal.\nThe only question formulated by counsel for the plaintiff to which the trial judge refused to compel an answer by the defendant was that above stated as to the name of the bigamous wife. His refusal was based upon the irrelevancy, immateriality and vexatious character of the question.\nThough counsel for the appellant at first suggested that practically the only restriction upon the right of cross-examination is the sense of professional duty of cross-examining counsel, he ultimately conceded that a trial judge has some discretion to protect a witness against questions which are purely vexatious. It is obvious that were this power denied to a judge presiding in a trial court he would have no control over the conduct of the case, and would be powerless to prevent the grossest abuse of the right of cross-examination. Trials would become interminable and irrele vant matter might be introduced for most improper purposes. That it is necessary that a trial judge should have this discretion is therefore manifest; that he has it in fact is well established. Taylor on Evidence (18 ed.), par. 1460; Best on Evidence (10 ed.), p. 121.\nThe character of this discretion, however, is such that its precise limits are not easily defined and in practice its exercise, though undoubtedly reviewable, must be left largely to the sound judgment and wisdom of the presiding judge who, from his observation of the demeanour of the witness and also of the manner of and the conduct of the case by counsel, has means and opportunities of forming a correct opinion as to the importance and real purpose of questions propounded which are not open to an appellate court.\nCounsel for the appellant sought to uphold his client's right to an answer to the rejected question on the grounds that it was relevant either to the plea of laches or to that of the Statute of Limitations and also to the.issue as to the defendant's credibility. The facts of the bigamous marriage, the ten months' duration of the intercourse, the birth of the child\u2014all these were facts tending to shew a prolonged absence of the defendant in South Africa, and therefore relevant upon the pleas of laches and of the statute. But I find it difficult to conceive how the plaintiff's case on this issue could be advanced or the defence weakened by the disclosure of the name of the defendant's unfortunate victim.\nCounsel ingeniously urged that the purpose of the question put was to identify the particular bigamous marriage then being dealt with, it being the intention of the cross\u2014examiner thereafter to shew that a second bigamous marriage had been contracted by the defendant and thus to establish the probability, if not the certainty, of a still more prolonged absence from British Columbia, excusing the plaintiff's delay in bringing suit. It is obvious that with this object the witness might well have been asked whether in fact he had a second time committed bigamy and, if he admitted that fact; might further have been asked as to the duration of his co-habitation with the second victim. If he denied the fact of the second bigamous marriage and if counsel, desiring to lay a foundation to contradict him upon this point, then sought for that purpose to introduce the names of the persons with whom the alleged bigamous marriages had been contracted in order to fully identify the marriage as to which he sought to put himself in a position to adduce evidence in rebuttal, it may be that the relevancy and propriety of the question' under consideration would be established. But as the evidence stood when the question was put it is, I think, not possible to say that the trial judge erred in treating it as irrelevant and immaterial.\nNo doubt the limits of relevancy must be less tightly drawn upon cross-examination than upon direct examination. The introduction upon cross-examination of the issue of the witness's credibility necessarily enlarges the field. But it does not follow that all barriers are therefore thrown down. That which is clearly irrelevant to this issue or to the issues raised in the pleadings is no more admissible in cross-examination than in examination in chief.\nCounsel sought to maintain the relevancy of the question to the issue of credibility on the ground that it related to matter the proof of which would tend to degrade the witness's character and would therefore affect the judgment upon his credibility. The fact of the bigamous marriage, the duration of the intercourse, and the abandonment of the victim were all facts which might well be deemed relevant for this purpose; but again I find it impossible to conceive how the statement of her name would help in the determination of this issue.\nIn view of the facts that divorce proceedings were pending between the parties, that the admission sought, while apparently of no value for the purposes of this partnership action might be of service in these divorce proceedings, that from all that appeared upon the proceedings and evidence before the trial judge the identity of the woman in question was entirely irrelevant to any issue which he might have to determine, and that from what he had seen of both plaintiff and defendant in the witness box, of the conduct of the case generally by counsel and of the manner in which and the circumstances under which the particular question was put and pressed the learned trial judge had the very best opportunity of judging of its importance and real purpose, it is, I think, quite impossible for an appellate tribunal to say that his discretion was not in this case reasonably and properly exercised in excluding the question.\nThere was nothing in the trial judge's refusal to permit this particular question to be answered at the time when it was put which prevented counsel proceeding with the fullest cross\u2014examination of the witness, and it might well be that that which was quite irrelevant upon the issues as developed by the evidence then before the court might at a later stage of the proceedings have become admissible. At all events nothing occurred which precluded counsel from proceeding with cross-examination as to any other bigamous marriage of the defendant or facts connected therewith and certainly nothing to prevent the fullest cross-examination upon matters directly relevant to the issue of partnership or no partnership. It was not argued that upon the evidence before the learned trial judge his conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to establish a partnership can be successfully attacked.\nFor these reasons I am respectfully of the opinion that the provincial appellate court erred in interfering with the discretion exercised by the learned trial judge, and that its order for a new trial based upon this ground cannot be upheld.\nI would allow the appeal of the defendant with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fell & Gregory.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. A. Aikman.\n",

(1906) c. 55, s. 142.\nOn 6th August, 1904, the holder of rights of homestead and pre-emption in Dominion lands, in Manitoba, which had not then been patented or recommended for patent, assumed to \"incumber, charge and create a lien\" upon the lands as security for the payment of a debt by an instrument executed without the sanction of the Minister of the Interior.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (11 West. L.R. 185) that the instrument was in effect a \"transfer\" and was absolutely null and void under the provisions of the \"Dominion Lands Act.\"\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], Howell C.J. dissenting, affirming the judgment of Mathers J., at the trial, by which the action was dismissed with costs as against the defendant Doig.\nThe defendant McMillan, in August, 1904, ordered from the plaintiffs through his co-defendant, Doig, who was then the agent of the plaintiffs, certain machinery for which he agreed to pay $2,840 in cash, or in lieu thereof to give five promissory notes for a like amount provided that the plaintiffs were willing to give credit. The form of order signed by McMillan required the agent to fill out accurately and have signed by purchaser a property statement indorsed thereon. This statement was filled out and signed by McMillan and alleged that he owned in his own name and right and unincumbered the land in question. This order was sent by Doig to the plaintiffs and, relying in part upon the statements made in the order, the plaintiffs accepted it, sent McMillan the machinery and granted him the credit, taking from him, as security, an instrument in the following form:\u2014\n\"I, John McMillan, * * * being registered as owner of an estate in fee simple in possession subject, however, to such incumbrances, liens and interests as are notified by memorandum underwritten or indorsed hereon, in the land described as follows: (description), and desiring to render the said land available for the purpose of securing to and for the benefit of American-Abell Engine and Thresher Company, Limited, * * * the sum of money hereinafter mentioned, do hereby incumber, charge and create a lien upon the said land for the benefit of the said American-Abell Engine & Thresher Company, Limited, with the sum of $2,850, to be raised and paid at the times and in the manner following, that is to say: (dates of payments set out).\n\"If notes should be given by me to the said company for all or any of the above payments, the said notes shall not be a satisfaction of the said incumbrance, charge and lien, but the same shall continue until the payment in full of the said notes and any renewals thereof.\n\"In witness whereof I have hereunto signed my name this 6th day of August, A.D. 1904.\n\"John McMillan\" (Seal).\n\"Signed in the presence of\n\"Jas. W. Currie.\"\nThe lands described were the homestead of the defendant McMillan and his rights in the land were those of a homesteader who had not received a recommendation for patent, under the \"Dominion Lands Act.\" The sanction of the Minister of the Interior had not then been given to the transaction, and these facts were known to the defendant Doig. Subsequently McMillan secured a recommendation for patent, dated 3rd August, 1905, and the patent was issued to him, dated 23rd September, 1905.\nAfter the issue of the recommendation for patent Doig, who had then ceased to be the plaintiffs' agent, obtained from his co-defendant a conveyance of the quarter-section of land in question in payment of indebtedness from McMillan to himself. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior, by letter dated 2nd June, 1908, waived the forfeiture of the McMillan's homestead under section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act.\"\nThe action was brought to have it declared (inter alia) that the plaintiffs had a charge upon the lands in question as against the defendants. McMillan did not defend the action and judgment has been obtained against him. The plaintiffs' charge was duly registered and the defence set up by Doig was that such charge was void under section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act,\" RS.C. (1906) ch. 55, which is the consolidation of the statute 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 5, amending section 42 of chapter 54, RS.C. (1886).\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Mathers held that the instrument in question was void under the provisions of section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act,\" but did not decide whether or not the instrument was an \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" within the meaning of the Act. He also held that the defendant Doig was not estopped from setting up the invalidity of the instrument. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed, the majority of the judges holding that the instrument was an \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" and was void under the Act. Howell C.J. dissented, taking the view that the instrument was not one of those prohibited by the statute.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants. The judgment appealed from is erroneous in holding (1) that the charge in question is an \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" of a homestead right; (2) that it is an assignment or transfer and thereby void under section 142, and (3) that the defendant, Doig, is not, by reason of his conduct, estopped from setting up, as against the plaintiffs, his conveyance from the defendant McMillan.\nSection 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act\"[2], is in terms identical with that in force during the whole of the transactions in question. The charge in question, being merely equitable, is not an \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" within the meaning of that section. The nearest analogy is found in cases arising out of forfeiture provisions in leases and insurance policies. The giving of an equitable mortgage is not a breach of a covenant by the lessor not to assign or sublet without leave. Doe d. Pitt v. Hogg[3]; Gentle v. Faulkner[4]. Where an insurance policy prohibits a transfer of the property insured an equitable mortgage has been held not to be such a transfer. Sands v. Standard Ins. Co.[5]; Bull v. North British Ins. Co.[6]; Sovereign Fire Ins. Co. of Canada v. Peters[7].\nA strict construction is given to such statutes as the present. In Meek v. Parsons[8], Armour C.J. held that the word \"alienate\" in the \"Free Grant and Homestead Act of Ontario\" did not include an agreement to alienate. In the United States it has been held that a mortgage of a homestead (which did not convey the legal estate) was not an alienation of the land. Stark v. Morgan[9]; 9 Am. & Eng. Ann. Cases, at page 930, where the matter is fully discussed and reference made to all the American cases. A pledge of stock-in-trade bought on credit is not a \"transfer.\" In re Hall[10].\nThe mortgage under the \"Land Titles Act\"[11] was on account of its form considered not to be an assignment or transfer under section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act.\" Consequently Parliament passed section 96 of the \"Land Titles Act,\" declaring that a mortgage executed by a settler should be deemed to be an assignment or transfer prohibited by section 142. The plaintiffs' claim is under a charge and not under a mortgage. It is not an instrument under which the court could foreclose the defendant's interest, but is one in which they could only order sale. The intention of section 142 is that the homesteader should not be permitted to alienate or transfer the absolute title in the property. The charge given is not an assignment or a transfer, nor was it so intended by McMillan, nor was it accepted by the company as such. It really is an undertaking to pay the price of machinery as the same becomes due; he did not assign the land but gave a document under which the court might order the sale of the land and, out of the proceeds, payment of the claim. At the time of the recommendation for patent only a small part of the plaintiffs' claim was due; the remainder of the price became due after the recommendation for patent.\nThe defendant, Doig, is estopped from setting up that the lien is void by reason of the fact that he was the plaintiffs' agent at the time the lien was taken, and he himself took it. The company acted on the representation in selling the machinery, and this being so, it is not open to Doig now to set up that the instrument was void. Doig is not in a position to set up that the instrument is void under the statute.\nThe instrument did not assign or transfer the whole or part of a homestead right. It takes away no such rights. It is not a mortgage conveying the fee. The plaintiffs under this charge could never get in the fee. All such rights are exempted from execution until patent issues, yet the statute does not prohibit the homesteader going into debt and a judgment recovered binds automatically the land as soon as the same is recommended for patent. Harris v. Rankin[12]. As pointed out in this case, at page 132, the object of the Act was and is to obtain bon\u00e0 fide settlers on the public lands and to retain them there. This charge does not defeat that object. We also refer to Edwards v. Dick[13]; Doe d. Bryan v. Bancks[14]; Roberts v. Davey[15]; Davenport v. The Queen[16]; Malins v. Freeman[17].\nBergman for the respondent Doig. The instrument under which the plaintiffs claim is an \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" of homestead right or of a part thereof within the meaning of section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act,\" and absolutely null and void by virtue of the provisions thereof, and the defendant Doig is not estopped from thus setting up that the lien in question is void. The object of all homestead laws is to secure actual settlers and to prevent the public lands from falling into the hands of speculators, or from being homesteaded for the benefit of any person other than the entrant and his family. See Harris v. Rankin[18], per Killam J., at page 132; United States v. Richards[19], per Hunger J., at page 450. That section of the Act must be construed so as to carry out this object and prevent its evasion. See Maxwell on Statutes (4 ed.), p. 171; Philpott v. St. George's Hospital[20], at page 349; Fox v. Bishop of Chester[21].\nThe principle on which conditions against assignment in policies of insurance and leases have been decided can have no application in the construction of the statutory provisions now in question. From the language of Killam J., in Harris v. Rankin18, at page 128, it is clear that the learned judge considered that the creation of a mere charge upon the land came within the prohibition of the statute. See also, per Taylor J., at page 362, in Manitoba Investment Association v. Watkins[22], in respect to a mortgage, and per Tenterdon L.C.J., in Wetherell v. Jones[23], when speaking of a contract forbidden expressly or by implication either by a statute or at common law. The question was also decided in Gathercole v. Smith, in 1881[24], at page 7, by James L.J., and, at pages 9 and 10, by Lush L.J. This view was taken at the passing of the Dominion \"Land Titles Act\"[25], in which the 96th section treats a mere security or charge as an assignment or transfer prohibited by the \"Dominion Lands Act.\" This enactment must be taken as declaratory of the law respecting all Dominion lands. See also Bass v. Buker[26], at page 923; and Edinburgh Water Company v. Hay[27], in 1854, at pages 682 to 687, per Cranworth L.C.\nThe plaintiffs themselves considered their lien within the prohibition and, consequently, applied to the Minister of the Interior for a declaration that the forfeiture of the homestead was waived and that the lien was validated. The reply from the Department, however, had not the effect of validating the lien. In fact, the whole policy of the statute would have been defeated if the lien had been validated; it would have been equivalent to a donation by the Government of the lands affected. In the cases where charges may be permitted under the Act with the sanction of the Minister, his powers are strictly limited; and, in this case the provisions of sections 145 to 148 can have no application.\nEstoppel cannot work against Doig; no reliance was placed upon any act or representation made by him. See 16 Cyc., pp. 734-738, and the cases there cited. No equitable estoppel can arise except from actual contract: 16 Cyc. 741, and cases there cited; rules as to good faith and loyalty do not apply after an agency has been fully terminated: 31 Cyc. 1449, and cases there cited; Nichol v. Martyn[28]; Robertson v. Chapman[29].\nSection 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act\" renders assignments and transfers of homestead rights before recommendation for patent void not only as against the Crown, but as against the homesteader and his assigns. Harris v. Rankin[30]; Cumming v. Cumming[31]; Flannaghan v. Healey[32]; In re Webster and Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[33]; In re Sawyer-Massey Co. and Dennis[34]; Park v. Long[35]; Waterous Engine Works Co. v. Weaver[36]. We also refer to Re Hughes[37], at page 601, which should be read in connection with Gentle v. Faulkner[38], and to the reference made by Gwynne J. to Sovereign Ins. Co. v. Peters[39], at pages 162-163 of the report of The Citizens' Ins. Co. v. Salterio[40].\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nBergman for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal from the Court of Appeal for Manitoba raises the question of the proper construction to be given the 142nd section of the \"Dominion Lands Act\"(1), and specially whether the words of that section are large and broad enough to cover and prohibit the placing of a lien or charge upon his homestead by the homesteader before he has obtained the recommendation of the local agent for his patent.\nThe section in question reads as follows:\nExcept as herein provided unless the Minister otherwise declares every assignment or transfer of homestead or pre-emption right or any part thereof and every agreement to assign or transfer any homestead or pre-emption right or any part thereof after patent obtained, made or entered into before the issue of the patent shall be null and void; and unless the Minister otherwise declares, the person so assigning or transferring or making an agreement to assign or transfer, shall forfeit his homestead and pre-emption right.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Howell dissenting, upheld that of the trial judge and held that the instrument attempting to create a lien or charge upon the homestead came within the prohibitive language of the section and was, therefore, void.\nThe document or instrument creating the charge or lien was given to the appellants by the defendant McMillan as security for the price of a threshing outfit sold him and professed \"to incumber, charge and create a lien upon the said land,\" which land, at the time, was McMillan's homestead, for which he had not then obtained the recommendation of the land agent for \u00e0 patent.\nThe contentions of Mr. Chrysler were, first, that the words of the section were not broad and ample enough to cover the case of such a lien or charge as the one in question here; and, secondly, that, if they were, the language of the section did not make the transfer absolutely void, but voidable at the option of\n(1) R.S.C. (1906) ch. 55. the Crown and only suspended it until the will or decision of the Minister was obtained.\nWith regard to the latter construction, I cannot for a moment accept it. The language used by Parliament seems to me clear beyond any reasonable doubt. Unless the Minister declared that a transfer by the homesteader might or could be made of his homestead within a specified time the transfer should be null and void. All transfers of homestead rights made without the sanction of the Minister before recommendation for patent were, in my opinion, by this section declared null and void, not only as against the Crown, but as against the homesteader. The section was intended as much for the protection of the homesteader and his assigns as for the Crown, and to carry out the policy of settling with bon\u00e0 fide settlers the unoccupied lands of the Crown. Looking to the known character and financial condition of many of those settlers it was thought desirable, for a time at least, during the early days of their settlement and occupation, to protect them, even from themselves and their own acts as well as from the speculators and others to whom they would become an easy prey. Provision is made in a subsequent part of the statute, under \"Charges upon Homesteads for Advances,\" from sections 145 to 158, enabling persons\ndesirous of assisting by advances in money intending settlers to place themselves on homestead lands,\nand of securing such advances, to do so legally and properly. The provisions embrace expenditures for passages and freight, medical attendance, subsistence of the settler and his family, materials for erecting buildings on the homestead, breaking land, providing horses, cattle, house furniture, farm implements and seed grain, etc., etc. They cover everything which Parliament, no doubt properly advised, thought essential for a settler in aid of his establishment upon the homestead and carefully provide for the submission to the settler and to the local agent or homestead inspector appointed by the Minister of a statement of all such expenditure or advances with vouchers in support thereof, before the settler is authorized to make or give a charge or lien for the amount upon his homestead. A further general provision enabling persons to make advances to settlers and take charges or liens therefor upon the homestead is given in sub-section 3 of section 146 of the statute. But in each and all of these cases there are special conditions and provisions limiting and defining the circumstances under which and the amount for which advances may be made and charges taken upon the homestead. The sanction of the Minister must be had in advance. The amount advanced and charged in all must not exceed $600; the rate of interest is limited, the times for re-payment specified and the active supervision and approval of the Minister's agent or inspector assured.\nIn fact, the statute treats the intending settler as a ward of the Minister, who is to protect him from himself and prevent him from incumbering his homestead until he is, at least, entitled to obtain his patent. It is not, of course, pretended that the charge sought to be enforced in this case is one of those contemplated and provided for in the sections of the statute to which I have called attention, and I am of the opinion that the clear unambiguous words of section 142, as well as their clear and manifest object, exclude the limited construction which Mr. Chrysler sought to place upon them.\nIn my judgment the only charge or lien which the settler could place upon his homestead before it was recommended for a patent was one of those specifically provided for under sections 145 to 158, of which the one in question here is not contended to be, and all other attempted charges, included in the prohibitive words of the section against transfers or assignments, are absolutely null and void, unless otherwise declared by the Minister.\nI have not been able, after reading carefully the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of Davenport v. The Queen[41], to see its application to the construction of the clause of the statute in question here. That case is, no doubt, an authority for the general proposition that the courts have construed and will construe clauses of forfeiture in leases declaring, in terms however strong and clear, that they should be void on breach of conditions by the lessees to mean that they are voidable only at the option of the lessors, and the same rule has, no doubt, been applied to other contracts where a party bound by a condition has sought to take advantage of his own breach of it to annul the contract, as in Doe d. Bryan v. Bancks[42], and Roberts v. Davey[43]. But, in \"the case before the Judicial Committee, their lordships simply held the construction of the statute on which they relied because the intention of the legislature to the contrary did not, in their view, so clearly appear as to exclude the usual and equitable rule of construction from applying to the leases there in question. In the case before us there is no lease and no question of its forfeiture, while the intention of Parliament is, to my mind, plain and clearly expressed.\nThen, on the question upon which Mr. Chrysler seemed chiefly to rely, I cannot doubt that what the statute intended to prevent was, as expressed, any transfer or assignment or agreement to transfer or assign as well as anything which would or could have the legal effect of transferring away from the homesteader and giving to another his rights as such or of having the same done by process of law. In other words, the language used was large enough, in the connection in which it was used, to cover indirect as well as direct transfers and so to cover a charge such as this under which a sale of the homesteader's rights could be decreed and transferred from him by a sale of the lands under the decree. The same word which is here used came under the consideration of the Court of Appeal, in England, in the case of Gathercole v. Smith (1881)[44]. At page 7, James L.J. says:\nNow \"transfer\" is one of the widest words that can be used. It appears to me that very word was used by the legislature not only to prevent the incumbent from assigning himself, but for preventing any transfer by operation of law in invitum\u2014not only to prevent a voluntary dealing by an incumbent with an annuity, but to prevent the annuity vesting in a trustee in bankruptcy, or being seized or attached under a garnishee order by an execution creditor, or otherwise transferred.\nAt pages 9 and 10, Lush L.J. says:\nThe word \"transferable,\" I agree with Lord Justice James, is a word of the widest import, and includes every means by which the property may be passed from one person to another. * * * Clearly the words \"shall not be transferable at law or in equity\" do say that he shall not be at liberty to encumber it either directly by assignment or indirectly by suffering a judgment. Applying this language and reasoning to the present case, and I have no difficulty in doing so, the language of section 142 of the Act is sufficiently broad to cover the plaintiff's lien.\nLooking at the subject-matter with which Parliament was dealing, namely, the inchoate right of a homestead settler which right might afterwards ripen into a vested right or interest in the lands, and the object it obviously had in view in limiting the power of the homesteader for a time to incumber his homestead, I have no difficulty in ascribing to the words used \"transfer or assign\" a meaning sufficiently wide to include such a charge as we have now before us.\nOur attention was called to some language used by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in his dissenting opinion in which he argued that the section 96 of the \"Land Titles Act\"[45], shewed that Parliament had felt called upon to give a meaning to the prohibitive words \"transfer or assign\" as used in the 142nd section of the \"Dominion Lands Act,\" and, as he says, \"it seems to me to widen their meaning.\"\nI am not able to agree with the Chief Justice in this. The intention of Parliament, it seems to me, in passing that section 96 of the \"Land Titles Act\" was to make it clear beyond any doubt that in legislating as it did in the 98th section of the Act and declaring that\na mortgage or encumbrance under this Act shall have effect as security, but shall not operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged,\nthere was no intention of interfering with the provisions of the \"Dominion Lands Act\" prohibiting transfers and that, notwithstanding a mortgage was declared not to be a transfer under the \"Land Titles Act,\" it should, nevertheless, remain and be within the prohibitory words of the section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act,\" and deemed and held a transfer working a forfeiture.\nThese sections of the \"Land Titles Act rather, in my opinion, support the view I have expressed of the meaning of section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act.\"\nI am, therefore, of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014If as contended such an instrument as that in question herein can constitute a valid charge or lien it would be a good foundation for a suit to have the land sold wherein judgment might go for sale even before recommendation for patent and the conveyance thereby be completed by virtue of estoppel. Why not?\nIf so, then the statute is easily defeated. Any explanation shewing this impossible must disclose the frailty of the instrument by reason of its being tainted.\nThe mind turns back to the days when fines and recoveries were a common kind of assurance, and estopped in that relation a power in the old land.\nI fear this attempted, perhaps hoped for, restoration of that good old time must fail because it merely promises to bring us an estoppel which is tainted because its work falls within the mischief against which the statute is clearly aimed.\nI need not elaborate further, for my brother judges bring forward that reasoning in which, speaking generally, I agree.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014This appeal raises two questions concerning the construction of section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act\"[46]. The opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba upon both questions accords with the uniform current of decision in that province as well as in the North-West Territories; and, after a careful consideration of the dissenting judgment in the court below and the argument of Mr. Chrysler, I do not think there are sufficient grounds for rejecting the views which have hitherto prevailed.\nThe first question is whether, in the absence of action by the Minister of the Interior, the effect of section 142 is to invalidate for all purposes the instrument by which a homesteader professes to \"encumber, charge and create a lien upon\" his homestead as security for the payment of a debt. The words of the section are as follows:\nExcept as herein provided unless the Minister otherwise declares every assignment or transfer of homestead or pre-emption right or any part thereof and every agreement to assign or transfer any homestead or pre-emption right or any part thereof after patent obtained, made or entered into before the issue of the patent shall be null and void; and unless the Minister otherwise declares the person so assigning or transferring, or making an agreement to assign or transfer, shall forfeit his homestead and pre-emption right, and shall not be permitted to make another homestead entry: Provided that a person whose homestead or homestead and pre-emption have been recommended for patent by the local agent, and who has received from such agent a certificate to that effect, in Form R., countersigned by the Commissioner of Dominion Lands, or, in his absence, by a member of the Dominion Lands Board, may legally dispose of and convey, assign or transfer his right and title therein; and such person shall be considered to have received his certificate upon the date upon which it was so countersigned.\nThe question is: Does an instrument such as that now in question fall within the description\nevery assignment or transfer of homestead or pre-emption right or any part thereof. in the sense in which it is used in this section? These words are, of course, broad enough to extend to such an instrument. The scope of them is sufficiently illustrated in the following passage from the judgment of that great lawyer and master of language, James L.J., in Gathercole v. Smith[47]:\nNow \"transfer\" is one of the widest terms that can be used. It appears to me that very word was used by the legislature not only to prevent the incumbent from assigning himself, but for preventing any transfer by operation of law in invitum\u2014not only to prevent a voluntary dealing by an incumbent with an annuity, but to prevent the annuity vesting in a trustee in bankruptcy, or being seized or attached under a garnishee order, by an execution creditor, or otherwise transferred.\nAnd by this observation from the judgment of Lush L. J., in the same case:\nClearly the words \"shall not be transferable at law or in equity\" do say that he shall not be at liberty to encumber it either directly by assignment or indirectly by suffering a judgment.\nWhat we really have to determine is whether there is any good reason for restricting the prim\u00e0 facie meaning of the words to such an extent as to exclude the instrument in question from the operation of the provision in which they occur.\nThe argument put forward by the appellants proceeds upon the hypothesis that the sole aim of the enactment is to secure permanency of occupation by real settlers through the prevention, on the one hand, of a succession of transfers during the performance of the settlement duties required by the Act, and, on the other, by minimizing (through the prohibition of agreements entered into by settlers before the granting of their patents for the conveyance of their lands afterwards), the possibility of the machinery of the Act being made an instrument for speculation in the public lands. This, there can be no doubt, was one consideration of great importance which influenced the legislature in enacting the legislation. But it was, I think, only one of the objects of the legislature. The cognate legislation to be found in sections 145 to 158 of the \"Dominion Lands Act\" and in the \"Land Titles Act\"[48], affords, I think, demonstrative evidence that the policy of Parliament was to invalidate every kind of assurance by which, save under sanction of the Minister, a homesteader should attempt to encumber his homestead by charging it as security for a debt. By the provisions of the land Act referred to, the Minister is given authority to sanction, antecedently, the creation of such a charge for securing the re-payment of advances to a limited amount for carefully specified purposes. If notwithstanding the provisions of section 142 the homesteader is to be held invested with the general power to constitute such charges upon his homestead, one does not readily see why Parliament should have deemed it necessary to confer upon him the special and carefully limited power which is the subject dealt with in the sections mentioned. Again, in section 96 of the \"Dominion Land Titles Act,\" it is declared that\nnotwithstanding anything contained in this Act, any such mortgage (a mortgage by a settler affecting his homestead), shall be deemed an assignment or transfer prohibited by the \"Dominion Lands Act.\"\nThe word \"mortgage\" here means \"any charge on land created merely for securing a debt or loan,\" (section 2, sub-sec. 5); and the form of mortgage prescribed by the Act does not in any material respect differ from that of the instrument in question on this appeal.\nThese enactments then, the first by implication, the second, by express declaration, disclose a view of the effect of section 142 by the legislature itself and a trend of legislative policy with which the narrower construction proposed by the appellant cannot be reconciled.\nThe other question is: Whether, in the absence of any action by the. Minister, the effect of this section is to nullify absolutely and for all purposes instruments embraced within its purview or only to make such instruments voidable at the instance of the Crown.\nThe enactment, by its express terms, excludes from its operation those cases in which the Minister may and does by his declaration permit the instrument to go into legal effect; but the words of the section, in their more obvious and natural meaning seem to signify that, in the absence of ministerial action, all instruments avoided by the enactments are to be and remain legally inoperative, that is to say, they are to be wholly without legal effect for any purpose whatever. It is true that the word \"void\" is often used in the sense more correctly expressed by the word \"voidable\"; but the last mentioned word does not necessarily mean \"valid until rescinded.\" It is sometimes used to mean \"invalid until validated\u201d; and this latter is, I think, the only sense in which it can be said that an instrument coming within the sweep of section 142 and unauthorized by the Minister can properly be described as \"voidable.\"\nThe course of legislation upon the subject, indeed, appears to shew conclusively that it is only by thus reading the section we can carry into effect the real intention of Parliament in enacting it. The parent enactment (which with an immaterial modification is found in section 42, ch. 54, R.S.C. (1886)) contained an unqualified declaration that any assignment or transfer of a homestead (not having been recommended for a patent) should be null and void. In 1895, by section 5 of chapter 34 of 58 & 59 Vict. (which now appears as section 143 of the consolidation of 1906), it was provided in respect of such instruments executed before the passing of that Act, that they should not be null and void, ipso facto, but the Minister of the Interior was given power to declare any such instrument a nullity, and it was provided that any such declaration should take effect as if enacted in the Act itself, unless the patent should have issued before the date of the declaration. In 1897 (by section 5 of chapter 29 of 60 & 61 Vict.), section 42 of the \"Dominion Lands Act\" (1886), was repealed and a new section (now section 142 of the consolidation above quoted) was substituted for it. The difference in form between these two enactments, the one (section 143) dealing with instruments executed prior to the passing of the Act of 1895, and the other (section 142) relating to instruments of a subsequent date, cannot, I think, properly be disregarded. The legislature has manifestly drawn a sharp distinction between the two classes of documents. Those executed before the passing of the Act of 1895 are to be deemed to have gone into effect unless avoided by the action of the Minister; the latter were never to come into legal operation except as a result of a declaration by the Minister to that effect.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014The defendant McMillan while holder of a homestead section for which he had not yet obtained a patent or \"been recommended for patent by the local agent,\" purported to \"incumber, charge and create a lien upon\" his homestead in favour of the plaintiffs by instrument, dated the 6th of August,\n1904, and registered at Neepawa, on the 6th of December, 1904. The certificate of recommendation for patent to McMillan was issued and countersigned on the 3rd of August, 1905, and a patent was issued in his favour on the 23rd of September,\n1905. On the 19th of September, 1905, McMillan conveyed his homestead property to his co-defendant Doig by instrument of transfer registered at Neepawa on the 25th of September, 1905. Doig had actual notice of the instrument of charge or lien given by McMillan to the plaintiffs. The question for determination is the validity of this charge or lien as against him.\nBy section 2(5) of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 110, a mortgage is defined as \"any charge on land created merely for securing a debt or loan\"; by section 98 of the same Act it is declared that a mortgage \"shall have effect as security, but shall not operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged.\" And, by section 96, any mortgage made by a settler before patent or recommendation for patent is declared to be \"an assignment or transfer prohibited by the 'Dominion Lands Act' \"[49], which, by section 142, provides that\nunless the Minister otherwise declares, every assignment or transfer of homestead or pre-emption right or any part thereof * * * shall be null and void. It was argued that, notwithstanding this explicit provision of the statute, the instrument upon which the plaintiffs claim was not void, but merely voidable, and that it could be avoided only by or at the instance of the Crown. But the policy of the statute appears to be entirely to prevent the settler, during the period of performance of settlement duties, alienating his homestead or any part thereof or interest therein or in his inchoate right thereto, or doing any act which might tend to or be a step towards the bringing about of any such alienation. To hold that the words \"null and void,\" when used in such a statute, should be construed as merely \"voidable\" would, in my opinion, be contrary to the clear policy and intent of the legislation and would tend to defeat\u2014certainly not to advance\u2014its object.\nThe language of section 143 which declares that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any Act relating to Dominion lands, an assignment which would be in contravention of the terms of section 142 shall, if made before the 22nd of July, 1895, be not ipso facto void, but only voidable if the Minister so declares it, makes the construction of section 142, in my opinion, incontrovertibly that which I have stated, when applied to cases not within section 143.\nIt was strongly urged that the provision enabling the Minister to declare valid an assignment which would, otherwise, be null and void, in effect makes every such instrument merely voidable. It does not follow that because the Minister may declare the instrument valid it is prior to such declaration merely voidable; the statute says that it is null and void.\nThere has been, in fact, no declaration by the Minister with regard to the validity or efficacy of the plaintiffs\u2019 charge or lien. Section 142 provides for two things; first, that the prohibited assignment shall be null and void; and secondly, that its execution shall work a forfeiture of the homestead and pre-emption right. As to each, the operation of the statute is dependent upon the Minister not otherwise declaring In the present instance the issue of the patent to McMillan subsequently to his attempted creation of a charge in favour of the plaintiffs and a letter from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, dated the 2nd of June, 1908, which states that any forfeiture of his homestead by reason of the execution of a lien to the plaintiffs has been waived, are relied upon as implying a declaration by the Minister of the validity of the instrument under which the plaintiffs claim. It is plain that the waiver of the forfeiture of the homestead and the validating of the plaintiffs' alleged lien are things essentially different, and that the one by no means involves the other. In the statute these two matters are kept entirely distinct. In my opinion, the contention that the issue of the patent and the writing of the letter above referred to amounted to more than a waiver of the forfeiture of homestead rights incurred by McMillan is not sustainable. There is no evidence of any declaration by the Minister of the validity of the instrument under which the plaintiffs claim, nor is there anything in evidence from which it can be inferred that the Minister ever made such a declaration or intended to do so.\nIn view of the explicit language which I have quoted from the several sections of the \"Land Titles Act\"[50], I think it is quite unnecessary to deal with the somewhat elaborate arguments addressed to us upon the question whether, apart from this legislation, the instrument executed by McMillan in favour of the plaintiffs would be a \"transfer or assignment\" within the meaning of section 142 of the \"Dominion Lands Act.\"\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hudson, Howell, Ormond & Marlatt.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Rothwell, Johnson & Bergman.\n[1] 11 West.

The trial judge found that the accident which caused the death of Newman was due to the common fault and negligence of Newman and of the company's foreman on the works where deceased had been employed, assessed the damages at $ 3,000, and awarded the moiety thereof to the plaintiff, $500 to her personally and $1,000 in her capacity of tutrix to the children. The effect of the judgment appealed from was to confirm the adjudication by the trial judge.\nC. E. White, for the appellants.\nNicol, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action brought on behalf of the widow and children to recover damages resulting from the death of one Newman, who was killed by a loose rock falling on him while at work in a mine owned and operated by the appellants. The trial judge finds as a fact that the foreman of the mine was aware, at the time of the accident, of the danger caused by the presence of this rock in the roof of the stope or drift where Newman had been ordered by him to work, and that he took no steps to protect the workman; and, on appeal, the Court of Review agreed in the conclusion reached on this question of fact by the trial judge. Our attention was not drawn, at the argument here, to any evidence which would justify us in setting aside this concurrent finding of the courts below.\nIt is also found as a fact, both in the first court and on appeal, that Newman had been instructed to carefully observe the state of the roof each morning before commencing his work so as to ascertain if there was any loose rock there and that, on the occasion of the accident, he failed to follow this instruction and by so doing contributed to the accident. The courts below, following the settled jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec (Lamothe, \"Accidents du Travail,\" p. 68), held that as both plaintiff and defendants were shewn to have been in fault the court must apportion the damages; and we see no reason to disturb that decision. Price v. Roy[2].\nIt may be necessary to draw attention to the confusion which seems to exist with respect to the application of the rule now adopted in Quebec in actions of damages against employers where it is found that there is common fault (faute commune). The principle of the French law which, it is said, has been recently adopted in that province, is that where the party who claims compensation for an injury caused by the fault of another has been also guilty of fault, which contributed to the accident he must share the responsibility, and, in that case, the damages are not divided equally as is the rule in the English admiralty courts (Cayzer v. Carron Co.[3], per Lord Blackburn, at page 881), and under the Revised Statutes of Canada (1906), ch. 113, sec. 918; but the plaintiff is awarded only a proportion varying according to the degree in which the respective parties were to blame.

Having sworn that he was owner of real estate to the value of $2,000 (that described in the deed), B. in his newspaper accused him of perjury and he took action against B. for libel. On the trial the deed to H. was produced, and the existence of the contre-lettre proved, but the notary having the custody of both documents refused to produce the latter, claiming privilege on the ground that it was a confidential document. The trial judge maintained this claim, but oral evidence was admitted proving to some extent what the contre-lettre contained. A verdict having been given in favour of H.,\nHeld, that the trial judge erred in ruling that the notary was not obliged to produce the contre-lettre, as it was impossible without its production to determine what, if any, limitations it placed upon the deed, and there should be a new trial.\nB. in his newspaper article also accused H. of having been drunk during the election, and the judge, in charging the jury, said, \"You should consider the case as if the charge of drunkenness had been made against yourselves, your brother or your friend.\"\nHeld, that this was calculated to mislead the jury and was also a reason for granting a new trial.\nIf objection to one or more portions of the judge's charge is not presented until after the jury have rendered their verdict, the losing party cannot demand a new trial as of right, but in such case an appellate court, to prevent a miscarriage of justice, may order a new trial as a matter of discretion.

The charge arose out of an affidavit made by Huard, in order to qualify himself as an alderman of Quebec,\nthat he possessed in the City of Quebec for his own use immovables worth $2,000 at least above his debts and that he had not acquired the said properties through fraud or collusion.\nOn the trial the appellant (defendant) had called into the witness-box a notary with whom he alleged the deed or conveyance to Huard, under which he pretended to qualify, had been deposited together with a certain counter letter executed by Huard to the vendor of the property limiting and qualifying his title and interest in the property conveyed and shewing as contended by appellant that Huard had really no beneficial interest in it, and that it was held by him collusively.\nThe notary produced the deed when called upon to do so, but declined to produce the counter letter on the ground that it was a confidential document deposited with him in his official capacity as notary, and that it was his privilege to decline to produce it.\nThe trial judge sustained his contention and held that the notary was justified in declining to produce the counter letter.\nSubsequently when Huard was examined he said he had no objection to its production, but that he had not then the document to produce.\nThe result of the judge's ruling in favour of the notary's claim of privilege and Huard's statement that while he had no objection to produce it he had not the document in his possession or control was that the document was practically rejected as evidence and was not in evidence before the court or jury.\nWe are of the opinion that in ruling as he did the learned judge erred and that the notary was bound when called upon under his subpoena to have produced the counter letter.\nIt was argued that the fact of the existence of this counter letter and also its substance was in evidence, and that the jury knew practically all that its production would prove.\nI cannot accede for a moment to this argument. The jury did not and could not know, nor did nor could the trial judge know just what limitations this counter letter placed upon the deed to Huard, nor whether it afforded evidence that he did not hold the property for his own use, but did hold it collusively. What effect their production might have had upon the jury we are quite unable to say. Libel actions are peculiarly within their province to decide, and it is quite impossible for us to say that the practical rejection of such evidence did not substantially prejudice the defendant. On this ground therefore there should be a new trial.\nWhile the judge's charge to the jury was not objected to as a whole, objection was taken to a particular part of it in which the judge told the jury that\nthey should consider the case as if the charge of drunkenness had been made against themselves, their brother or their friend.\nI cannot but think that this was an entirely wrong and false doctrine to lay down as to the proper functions of a jury. It was calculated to mislead their minds as to the manner and extent to which they should assess the damages or make their findings.\nIt is possible that if the learned judge's attention had been called to this language and its full meaning at the time, and objection taken to it he would have corrected the apparently misleading direction before the jury had retired or if they had already retired, before they had agreed upon their verdict, but no such objection was taken at the time.\nThis only goes to shew the imperative necessity of Courts of Appeal insisting, when asked to grant new trials as a matter of right, that only objections to particular statements made by the judge in his charge to the jury will be considered or given effect to when it is shewn that objection has been taken to them at a time when their misleading character can be corrected before the jury.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted with costs in this court and in court of appeal, costs of trial court to abide the event.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action for libel in which appellant complains of misdirection of the learned trial judge in rejecting evidence and charging the jury.\nI think the learned judge rightly rejected publications alleged to have provoked, and thereby mitigated, the damages claimed, because the evidence had failed to establish respondent's responsibility therefor.\nUntil such responsibility is shewn it is idle to claim pity or excuse for such a defendant as the appellant was.\nSuch a defence is not, as some seem to have treated it, an answer to the action. It only goes to mitigate damages, and he claiming the damages must be shewn to have provoked or inspired something which the jury might properly consider in assessing damages.\nThe rejection of the evidence of the contre-lettre is now conceded to have been erroneous, but it is maintained that no substantial prejudice has been thereby occasioned.\nThe errors of the learned trial judge's charge are sought to be excused on the same ground.\nWhatever might have been said in that regard as to the part of the charge directing the jury to look upon the accusations in question as if made against themselves, their brother or their friend (grave error as with great respect I submit it was) if it had been, as likely, a slip of the tongue, and standing alone in a charge otherwise unimpeachable, it cannot be entirely overlooked when we find it accompanied by a further charge upon one of the leading features of the case which must be held quite erroneous.\nThe respondent had been elected and to qualify himself as a property holder swore to a qualification which in law he was not entitled to rest upon for any such purpose.\nHe had a friend convey some property to him for the express purpose of qualifying him and gave the friend a contre-lettre whereby he and not the respondent was to get the fruits of the property and become entitled to a return of the property itself.\nThat was a thing the respondent did not venture to repeat or to rest upon when he was re-elected.\nIt may have been he had not, in so swearing, committed perjury. However, that was a question for the jury, but required from the judge the legal definition thereof, and full explanation.\nBut beyond and above all that the jury should have been told the respondent was not in law justified in taking such an oath for such a purpose.\nThe parties were entitled to have it explained to the jury fully, why on the one hand it might not be considered perjury in law, or on the other might have been so held. And when properly so directed the issue should have been left to the jury to draw their own conclusion from the facts.\nThen, if giving him the benefit of any doubt, they should find the charge not proven perhaps (and certainly so if the surrounding facts so warranted it) they should have been further directed to consider whether or not the publication imported, not perjury, but merely false swearing, and that as written it would be so understood by the readers thereof. In the event of such a finding being possible, they should have been told to try the issue so raised.\nEven if this secondary meaning was not open to the jury on the surrounding facts\u2014as to which I say nothing but merely suggest it as a possibility\u2014the true position of the respondent claiming damages in respect of such a charge made in relation to his reprehensible conduct in taking office by means of an unjustifiable oath should have been left to the jury to deal with as they saw fit.\nThey might have concluded on that score that under the circumstances he was not entitled to more than nominal damages, or alternatively might, moved by the presence, in evidence, of envenomed hate, and determined to teach journalists to use properly measured words in describing an enemy, have palliated his offence against society.\nThey were there to appreciate in this regard the true value of the reputation of the respondent.\nIt is impossible to say how much a correct appreciation of the law and excluded fact might have influenced them or how much that want of appreciation thereof may have substantially prejudiced the result, but I am driven to conclude that an accumulation of such grave errors must have produced some substantial injustice.\nDuff J. agreed with Davies J.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appeal in this case should in my opinion be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nFor what was, if untrue, a very gross libel upon the plaintiff charging perjury and drunkenness under most aggravating circumstances a jury condemned the defendant in $800 damages.\nThe defendant complains of the refusal of the learned trial judge to compel the production in evidence of a document which bore materially upon his plea of justification in regard to the charge of perjury. The alleged perjury consisted in taking a false oath of qualification as municipal councillor. The plaintiff had obtained a deed of a property from a friend to enable him to take the oath of qualification. He had given (probably concurrently) a contre-lettre to his friend, who retained possession of the property and collected the rents. The learned judge declined to compel the production of the latter document which was in the hands of a notary who was called as a witness. A claim of privilege asserted by the notary was upheld. Evidence was given of what were alleged to be the contents of the contre-lettre. This evidence, in my opinion, was inadmissible. The ruling that the contre-lettre itself was privileged from production was, I think, erroneous and in its absence it may well be that the defendant's plea of justification upon the charge of perjury was not fairly or fully presented to the jury. The case having gone to the jury upon both charges and damages having been awarded in a lump sum it is impossible to sever them. Neither can we say that their amount would have been the same if the contre-lettre itself had been before the jury.\nThe defendant also complains of serious misdirection by the learned trial judge. As to this, however, he is in the difficulty that no objection to the charge was taken at the trial, although formal objections in writing were filed on the morning following the verdict. As I read former article 473 C.P.Q., although the judge was only required to reduce to writing the portion of his charge to which objection had been taken (making mention of the objection) as soon as conveniently possible, it was intended that he should have the opportunity of doing so immediately (sur-le-champ). Moreover, this article was found under the caption \"proceedings before the jury.\" I therefore think it clear that under it the party objecting was required to state his objections to the trial judge before verdict. Apart from the provisions of this article the manifest impropriety and inconvenience of any other course would seem to render this imperative. Although it repeals article 473, the Quebec statute, 8 Edw. VII. ch. 77, sec. 2, does not, in my opinion, alter the practice in regard to the necessity for taking objections to the charge before verdict. It follows that the appellant cannot, on the ground of misdirection, claim a new trial as of right.\nBut the court may, nevertheless, where the misdirection has been serious and is likely to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice, as a matter of discretion grant a new trial. The court of appeal upon technical grounds held that the charge of the learned judge was not before it. We are not therefore embarrassed by any exercise of discretion by that tribunal. The charge having been procured and placed before the court by the respondent, I think it may properly, as against him, be treated as part of the record, though not taken in shorthand and filed as provided for by the statute of 1908.\nThe principal misdirection to which our attention has been called consists in two statements, (a) that as a matter of law the plaintiff, Huard, was legally qualified; and (b), that, in dealing with the direct charge of drunkenness and the insinuation that the defendant had visited improper places, the jury should treat the case as if these charges had been made against one of themselves, a brother, or a friend.\nIn effect, at all events in the circumstances of this case, the former statement amounted to a withdrawal from the jury of the defendant's plea of justification in answer to the charge of perjury. In my opinion it was quite erroneous and it is not possible to say that it did not result in a miscarriage of justice.\nThe other passage objected to is entirely out of harmony with the ideas which have always obtained as to the manner in which a jury should deal with cases presented for their consideration.\nThe charge read as a whole does not qualify or modify the effect of either of these objectionable statements.\nI think, therefore, that this court should, upon these grounds, in the exercise of its discretion, as well as because of the erroneous ruling in regard to the production of the contre-lettre, direct a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon & Parent.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lavergne & Taschereau.\n",

Rway. Co., agreed that they would cause a moiety of the company's lands to be vested in H. by a valid instrument to be executed by the company at the request of H. and in such form as he might require. During some years the lands were administered by A. and S., but H. never requested nor received any conveyance of his moiety, and the title to the lands, in so far as they had not been disposed of, remained in the company. In an action by the plaintiffs against H. for partition of the lands and to have an order for an interim account by and partial discharge of A. and S. as trustees:\nHeld, that as, at the time of action, the title to the lands was still vested in the railway company which was not a party to the agreement, the order for partition could not be granted, and that, independently of partition or other final determination of their trust, the plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief of an interim accounting and partial discharge as trustees.\nJudgment appealed from (14 B.C. Rep. 157) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Cle- ment J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin now reported.\nArmour K.C., for the appellants.\nLafleur K.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nGIROUARD, DAVIES and IDINGTON JJ. agreed in the reasons stated by Anglin J.\nANGLIN J.\u2014On the short ground that the parties to the agreement on the 11th Feb., 1898, between whom partition is sought, have neither a legal nor an equitable interest in the lands in question, but are merely interested in the performance of certain mutual covenants in respect to such lands, the entire title to which, equitable as well as legal, is outstanding in the Columbia and Western Railway Company, which is not a party to the agreement, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to succeed in their claim for partition.\nThey also claim, apparently as incidental relief, an account in respect of such of these lands as have been taken for the right-of-way of the railway, and of such as have been sold and disposed of. At bar counsel for the plaintiffs pressed that, if denied a decree for partition, the relief of an interim accounting should nevertheless be given the plaintiffs, in order that they may obtain a pro tanto discharge as trustees in respect of the lands so taken and the proceeds in their hands of the lands so disposed of. A very large proportion of the lands covered by the agreement remains vested in the railway company.\nIn the judgments in the provincial appellate court no allusion is made to this claim for an accounting. It was apparently treated as purely incidental to the claim for partition. No authority has been cited by counsel for the appellants either in his factum or at bar in support of the view that, independently of partition or other final determination of any trust which may subsist as to the lands in question or their proceeds, the plaintiffs are, as trustees, entitled to the relief of an interim accounting and to a partial discharge. I have been unable to find any case in which trustees have been granted such relief. It may be that, in a proper case, trustees would be entitled to some such relief in the form of a declaratory order or judgment. This they have not asked; and I should much doubt that to accord it in the circumstances of the present case would be a sound exercise of the discretion conferred on the court to pronounce declaratory judgments.\nIn the Province of Ontario by virtue of special legislation (63 Vict. ch. 17, sec. 18), which has no counterpart in British Columbia, \"a trustee appointed by a deed, will, or other instrument in writing,\" would appear to be entitled to the relief of an interim accounting by proceedings in the Surrogate Court. In the absence of such legislation in British Columbia, my view is that trustees have not the right to obtain such relief.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Davis, Marshall & Macneill.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\n[1] 14 B.C. Rep. 157.\n",

McDougall, son of the respondent, was, with other workmen, employed to deepen the cut along the vein which was already some thirty feet below the surface. The cut was not perpendicular, but ran to the surface at an angle of about 30 degrees. To protect the workmen from stones and earth falling on them there was a scaffolding about half way down made of timbers placed across at intervals and covered with small poles lying close together, and these again covered with earth. A mass of rock having broken away near the surface it crashed through the scaffolding and fell to the bottom whereby the said Duncan R. McDougall was killed. In an action by his father for damages on behalf of himself and his wife a verdict for the plaintiff for $ 1,000 was set aside by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and a new trial ordered[1]. An appeal from this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada was quashed for want of jurisdiction[2]. On the second trial the jury found the company guilty of negligence in not having the overhanging wall protected and a safe place for the workmen to do their work and assessed the damages at $ 1,200. A verdict for the plaintiff for this amount was sustained by the full court being equally divided in opinion.\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellants. The company had employed proper and competent persons to oversee the work in the mine and look after the safety of the workmen. That was a performance of their full duty to the men. Paterson v. Wallace & Co.[3]; McDonald on Master and Servant (2 ed.), p. 298; Beven on Negligence (3 ed.), p. 612.\nThe manager was the only one guilty of negligence if any one was and he was a fellow servant of the deceased. Hall v. Johnson[4].\nDaniel McNeil K.C. for the respondent. The company were themselves negligent in not providing a safe and proper place for the men to work in so that the doctrine of common employment cannot be invoked. Grant v. Acadia Goal Co.[5]; Smith v. Baker & Sons[6]. The findings of the jury were warranted by the evidence and will not be disturbed on appeal. McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[7].\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellants.\nDaniel McNeil K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action under the \"Fatal Injuries Act\" of Nova Scotia, brought by the plaintiff on behalf of himself and his wife to recover damages for the death of their son, a young man who was killed in the defendants' mine while working as one of the defendants' employees.\nThe jury awarded as damages $1,200 and divided it, giving to father and mother $600 each.\nThe death of the employee was caused by a stone or rock of several tons' weight falling out of the hanging wall of the mine upon the deceased workman, just after work had been resumed in the mine after it had remained unworked for some 18 months.\nThe jury found that the negligence of the defendants, which caused the death of their workman, consisted in\nnot having the overhanging wall cased and protected from falling; timbering overhead in trench not sufficiently strong to hold a fall of stone liable to fall from overhanging wall;\nthat\nthe working place was not safe (and that) if the walls had been properly examined the stone which fell would have been noticed as dangerous;\nand lastly,\nthat the unsafe condition of the working was discoverable by a reasonably careful inspection. I agree with the opinion of Chief Justice Townshend and Meagher J., that on these findings plaintiff was entitled to judgment.\nMr. Newcombe on this appeal invoked the doctrine of common employment as a complete answer by the defendant company; he contended that the mine which had laid unworked for some eighteen months had been properly examined before work had been resumed by the superintendent of the mine, Kenty, and the managing director, that the inspection was careful and complete, but that whether it was negligent or not the company having employed competent men were not liable and the evidence did not justify the findings.\nAs to the findings of the jury, I have no difficulty whatever in holding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain them.\nThe inclination of the hanging wall, as stated by Mr. Harrison, the managing director, was about 30 degrees. The workmen were working immediately below this overhanging wall blasting rock, and when the blasting operations were begun and no doubt caused by them, the huge stones fell out of the top part of this wall, crushing through an artificial roof or covering built across the mine or excavation and killed the unfortunate miner, McDougall. The inspection made as described by the superintendent, Kenty, was superficial and fully justified the jury's finding that it' was not a reasonably careful one.Kenty says\nthe wall was cracked along in places, ordinary cracks as you would see in any cut, I couldn't see anything to say it was dangerous. It was grassed over to the edge of the cuts; it was impossible to see without cutting away the surface.\nNo cutting or prying into the surface was done and no testing of the cracks. Mr. Harrison, the managing-director, who accompanied Kenty, gave similar evidence of the examination which, while it may have satisfied them, was not such an examination as the circumstances called for.\nI am not able to accept Mr. Newcombe's contention with respect to the duty owing to the servant by the master in respect of the dangerous condition of the mine when the mine was re-opened and the workmen were put to work on blasting. I have seen no reason to change the opinions I have expressed on this subject in Grant v. Acadia Coal Co.[8]; McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[9], and Canada Woollen Mills v. Traplin[10]. In substance they are that while the master is not necessarily liable for the negligence of the superintendent of his works, he is bound to see that these works are suitable for the operations he carries on at them; and he cannot by leaving their supervision to his superintendent, escape liability, for the duty is one of which he cannot divest himself.\nIn other words, I hold that the right of the master, whether incorporated or not, to invoke the doctrine of common employment as a release from negligence for which he otherwise would be liable cannot be extended to cases arising out of neglect of the masters' primary duty of providing, in the first instance at least, fit and proper places for the workmen to work in, and a fit and proper system and suitable materials under and with which to work. Such a duty cannot be got rid of by delegating it to others.\nThe case of Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[11] was cited in support of the general proposition that a master employing competent servants and supplying proper materials to enable them to carry on the work, was not liable for injuries caused by the negligence of one of his servants to another while they were engaged in their common work.\nBut in giving his careful and elaborate opinion in that case, an opinion which Lord Chancellor Chelmsford said, in the next following case of the same volume, Bartonshill Goal Co. v. McGuire[12], had his entire concurrence, Lord Cranworth was at pains to point out the broad distinction between the exemption of the master from liability arising out of the carelessness or negligence of one fellow servant causing injury to another, and the liability of the master for injuries to his servant arising out of his failure to discharge the duty the law throws upon him of providing a fit and proper place in which his workmen are engaged at work. Whether he has or has not discharged his duty in this regard, will be in all cases a question of fact. Mere proof that he had employed competent persons to do his work is not enough.\nLord Cranworth points out that the two previous decisions of the House of Lords, Paterson v. Wallace & Co.[13], and Brydon v. Stewart[14].\nturned not on the question whether the employers were responsible for injuries occasioned by the carelessness of a fellow workman, but on a principle established by many preceding cases, namely, that when a master employs his servant in a work of danger he is bound to exercise due care in order to have his tackle and machinery in a safe and proper condition so as to protect the servant against unnecessary risks.\nThe question in the former case of Paterson v. Wallace & Co.13 he said\nwas not as to an injury occasioned by the unskilfulness of a fellow workman, but an injury occasioned by the fall of part of the roof.; and in the other case of Brydon v. Stewart[15], the jury had found that\nthe death arose from the pit not being in a safe and sufficient state;\nand Lord Cranworth said, p. 288:\nYour Lordships came to the conclusion that the men had a right to leave their work if they thought fit and that their employers were bound to take all reasonable measures for the purpose of having the shaft in a proper condition so that the men might be brought up safely,\nand so a verdict was directed to be entered for the pursuer.\nDefective places in which to work, defective machinery with which to work, and defective systems of carrying on work, are none of them, I hold, within the exception grafted upon the rule holding an employer liable for the negligence of the men in his employ. That exception as defined by Lord Cairns in his celebrated dictum in Wilson v. Merry[16], does not cover the duties owing by the employer to the employed in these respects, but does cover all risks which the workmen assume when they enter into their master's employment against the wrongful acts or negligences of their fellow servants.\nAs Lord Herschell says at p. 362 of Smith v. Baker & Sons[17]:\nIt is quite clear that the contract between, employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances and to maintain them in a proper condition and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. Whatever the dangers of the employment which the employed undertakes, amongst them is certainly not to be numbered the risk of the employer's negligence and the creation or enhancement of danger thereby engendered.\nMr. Newcombe relied upon the case of Hall v. Johnson[18] as supporting his proposition that an underlooker, whose duty it was to examine the roof and prop it up if dangerous, is a fellow labourer with a workman in the mine and the latter cannot maintain an action against the owner of the mine for injury occasioned by the neglect of the underlooker to prop up the roof, if the owner has not personally interfered or had any knowledge, of the dangerous state of the mine.\nIt cannot, I think, be questioned, that an \"underlooker,\" with such duties as those mentioned, would be held to be a fellow workman with the ordinary workmen in the mine. In that case it appeared that the mine had been worked in the ordinary course for the previous six years, and the Court of Exchequer Chamber held that under these circumstances, the workmen\nundertook to run all the ordinary risks of the service including negligence on the part of a fellow servant,\nand that the case before them was within that undertaking.\nThat case does not involve any question as to the primary duty of the master to provide in the first instance places in and materials with which workmen may safely work or systems under which they may so work, or whether with respect to cases where such duty is not fulfilled, and an accident happens to a workman in consequence, the master can invoke the doctrine of common employment and escape liability by shewing merely that a fellow workman's negligence was the cause of his duty being unfulfilled. My holding is that in such cases he cannot and that he is bound to shew that reasonable and proper skill and diligence were not wanting on his part or on the part of those to whom he delegated the performance of his duty in those regards.\nIn view of the disuse of the mine for a period of 18 months, I deem the position on the resumption of work, as regards the mine-owners' duties to their employees, to be the same as if they were then for the first time placing their men at work in the mine. Their duty to their workmen in this situation was to provide them with a reasonably safe place in which to work. When that duty has been delegated, any negligence of an employee to whom it has been confided must be imputed to the employer whether an individual or a body corporate.\nUnder these circumstances, and holdings, without discussing the other branch of the case as to whether the general manager and director of the company was or was not a fellow workman with the deceased, or was the alter ego of the company for whose negligence they would be liable, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The whole point of this case as appellant's counsel put the matter without abandoning other and minor things, is whether the doctrine of common employment is applicable or not and whether the jury should have been better directed in that regard than they were.\nI do not think appellant can now complain of non-direction after its counsel at the trial prudently and deliberately refrained from taking objection to the charge or submitting a proper question for adoption by the learned trial judge or otherwise insisting on the point in question being finally and definitely brought to his attention with a view to having the jury pass upon it. Moreover, on the facts that bear on the exact point raised there is no dispute.\nThere is most conflicting evidence as to whether or not what the jury has found to have been negligence was so. But there is no dispute that the condition of things pronounced negligent and dangerous was seen and passed upon by three officers of the company of whom one was manager and director, and another general mine superintendent, for the express purpose of either determining or reporting to the Board of Directors (it does not appear which), so that it could decide as to re-opening the mining operations which' had ceased for eighteen months.\nThe condition of the place in and about which the workmen had to work, the nature of that work and the risks created thereby and to be suffered must be taken I think as adopted by the company on their reopening of the mine\u2014as a place and things all known to it to be just what it was\u2014and what was that? Was it not a dangerous place wherein the men were to work and was not the employment of a dangerous character?\nNo proper system was adopted to protect the company's workmen, in life or limb, against these dangers. No adequate protection was supplied by the company and put at the service of those it placed in charge of the work.\nNor was the obvious need either to case the wall or remove the overhanging or other material liable to fall provided for by the company.\nNor, if that might have made a difference, was there assigned to any one (competent or not) the duty of supplying the necessary protection.\nThis is not the case of a work opened by a competent superintendent appointed for that purpose and its work continuously operated and developed by him within his authority both as to the creation of its dangerous qualities and insufficient protection, but is distinct therefrom as if something new.\nWhatever doubt or difficulty might exist in a case such as I have just stated, I fail to see how any can exist here if we have regard to the very cases cited by appellant without going further.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff and Anglin JJ. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

Atwater K.C. and W. H. Butler, for the appellant.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and G. H. Montgomery, for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Idington J.\nGirouard J. concurred in the reasons given by Anglin J.\nIdington J.\u2014The claim of appellant that the words \"actually delivered,\" although of doubtful import in respect to a supply of electric current, must literally be observed and maintained cannot prevail in face of the specifications, forming part of the contract, for a flat rate and a means therein provided for measuring the force and forming one of the factors on which to rest the flat rate.\nThe literal meaning of \"actually delivered\" is inconsistent with a flat rate fixture. In light of the scope of the entire contract and surrounding circumstances to be looked at in such case of ambiguity I find the latter term must be given a meaning. To do so reduces the question to the one possible meaning the word has. Therefore that must prevail.\nIt is no fault of respondents, but the misfortune of the appellants which led to the intermittent cost of service and a loss of time and service, reduced in the results thereof possibly to the unexpected profit of the respondents.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The City of Montreal being about to instal a new pump at its high-level pumping-station, to be worked by an electric motor, invited tenders of proposals for supplying the necessary electric power. The specifications stated that contractors were to supply the power required \"over their own wires and poles\"; that the \"delivery point of the current\" should be inside the \"station building\"; that\nthe power is required for the operation of a 400 h.p. induction motor which is to run a five-million-Imperial-gallon horizontal triplex power pump; the normal operation of the pump would demand a service of 12 hours out of the 24 every day of the year;\nthat the pump was\nto work against an estimated water-pressure of 120 to 126 lbs. per square inch due to the head of water on the upper reservoir and the load on the pump might be taken as constant within such limits;\nthat, whatever the characteristics of the power, the\nvariations in voltage from the value finally agreed upon must not be greater than 2% plus or minus.\nUnder the head of \"terms of payment\" the specifications stated\nthe power is to be sold on a flat rate of so much per year for horsepowers of 12 hours per day; a horse-power under this specification means 746 true Watts as indicated by an integrating or instantaneous Watt-meter of approved type.\nThe respondents' tender was accepted and an agreement accordingly made which provided that the specifications should be read as part of it. The controversy arises upon the construction of this clause of the agreement:\n(3) The present contract has been thus made in consideration of the price or sum of twenty dollars per horse-power per annum for the quantity of said electrical current or power actually delivered under this contract (a horse-power means 746 true Watts), for the supply and service of said electric current daily between the hours of ten p.m. and ten a.m. throughout the year; and for each and every hour outside and in addition to said specified time in consideration of the sum of two dollars per hour or fraction of an hour. It being understood that said two dollars per hour for extra time is based on the supply and consumption of four hundred horse-power, and should the supply be less or more than that amount the said price for extra time shall be decreased or increased accordingly.\nPayments of said price shall be made monthly on the warrant of the Water Committee on the fifteenth day of each month, and on accounts rendered by said company monthly. And it arises in this way. The appellants having been compelled by an injunction to discontinue the use of their pump put forward the contention that, under this clause, they are bound only to pay at the rate specified according to the quantity of current actually converted into mechanical power by their motor. The clause (in specifying a rate of $20 per annum for 12 hours per day for \"each horse-power actually delivered\") means, according to this contention, that the appellant should pay at this rate only for the time the current should actually be in use by them. It is not disputed, as I understand Mr. Atwater, that the quantity of power necessary to work the pump against the load mentioned in the specification would (as the parties understood), with negligible variations, be a constant quantity and that the parties had in contemplation the ascertainment of that quantity once for all in the manner in which it was, in fact, afterwards ascertained; nor is it disputed that the respondents were, under the contract, bound\u2014and only bound-\u2014to maintain in their wire terminating at the \"delivery point,\" so-called, during the normal hours of operation a constant pressure sufficient to enable the appellant, by closing the circuit at that point, to direct an electric current through the motor of sufficient energy to furnish that quantity of power. The sole question is: This service having once been initiated, and the actual strength of the current required having been ascertained\u2014Was the appellant bound, under the terms of the contract, to pay, as for the whole period during which the respondents should maintain the service or only for the time during which the appellant should actually avail itself of it for working the pump? The provisions of the specifications seem to shew \u2014read by themselves, quite obviously and conclusively, I think\u2014that the appellant was to pay for the service furnished by the respondents at a rate to be ascertained once for all, and not according to the measure of the use made of that service. The \"delivery point\" is there stated to be, not the appellant's motor, but a point within the station at which the appellant was to link up their motor with the respondents' wires. The rate of payment for each unit (one horse-power), is stated to be a \"flat rate per annum\" a phrase which, unless it is to be rejected as meaningless altogether, expresses the intention that the rate of payment for each unit (assuming anything to be payable at all), is to be a fixed rate for the whole year and not a rate varying with the time during which the current should actually be put to use by the appellant.\nThe appellant rests its case on the words \"actually delivered\" in the clause quoted. These words do not, once the circumstances are understood, appear to present much difficulty. The clause in question, it is to be observed, is not concerned with the obligation of the respondents under the contract, but solely with the rate at which the appellant was to pay. The rate of payment for each unit having been specified as a fixed annual rate, and the element of time having been thus eliminated, there only remained the determination of the number of units to be paid for.\nThat must, of course, depend upon the number of units actually absorbed in working the pump; and, as this would be a constant quantity to be ascertained once for all, the stipulation that the appellant should pay according to the number of units actually absorbed would, in effect, be the same as a provision that it should pay for the number actually required. The phrase \"actually delivered\" means, I think, nothing more than this. In this view of the words, the clause harmonizes with the provisions of the specification, while, in the view advanced by the appellant, the stipulation that the rate of payment for each unit of power is to be a \"flat rate\" seems to be eliminated.\nI agree with the court below that, in fact, the service was really initiated at the time contended for by the respondents.\nAnglin J.\u2014By the contract before us the plaintiffs agreed to supply to the defendant electrical current or power\nto drive and operate a 400 h.p. induction motor to be used to drive a five-million-gallon horizontal triplex power-pump.\nIn the specifications, which are incorporated with the contract, it is provided that the power shall\nbe sold on a flat rate of so much per year, per horse-power, of twelve hours a day.\nThe contract itself contains a provision that it is\nmade in consideration of the price or sum of twenty dollars per horse-power per annum for the quantity of said electrical current or power actually delivered under this contract (a horse-power means 746 true Watts), for the supply and service of such electric current daily between the hours of ten p.m. and ten a.m. throughout the year; and for each and every hour outside and in addition to said specified time in consideration of the sum of $2 per hour or fraction of an hour\u2014it being understood that said $2 per hour for extra time is based on the supply and consumption of 400 h.p., and should the supply be less or more than that amount the said price for extra time shall be increased or decreased accordingly.\nWe must read the contract and specifications together and construe each in the light of the other; and it is only, if at all, in the event of irreconcilable conflict between them that any term of the specifications may be disregarded.\nThe appellant contends that there is such inconsistency between the \"flat rate\" mentioned in the specifications and the terms of payment described in the passage quoted from the contract itself that we should disregard the former. I do not find such an inconsistency.\nThe one factor entering into the determination of the price to be paid, which was unascertained at the time the contract was made, was the consuming capacity or requirement of the plant which the city proposed to install. Though the motor was to be nominally of 400 h.p., its precise consumption of electric current in operation could be ascertained only when it should be actually working against the pressure of the defendant's pumping plant. It is to meet this situation that the contract provides that the rate of $20 per horse-power per annum shall apply\nto the quantity of said electric current or power actually delivered * * * for the supply and service of said electric current between the hours of ten p.m. and ten a.m., throughout the year.\nThe specifications provide that a horse-power, as defined by the contract, shall\nmean 746 true Watts as indicated by an integrating or instantaneous Watt-meter of approved type.\nActing under this provision the parties did, in fact, by the use of an instantaneous Watt-meter, fix at 365 h.p. the consuming capacity of the defendant's motor when operating their plant. An expert employed by the defendant made the test for this purpose and his report was accepted by the plaintiffs.\nThe provision for a fixed rate of $20 per annum per horse-power makes it clear that it was intended that this price should be payable by the city whether it in fact used (the power placed at its disposal for one hour or for twelve hours, between ten p.m. and ten a.m., or on one day or three hundred and sixty-five days in the year. The further provision that the price is so fixed\nfor the supply and service of said electric current daily between the hours of ten p.m. and ten a.m., throughout the year,\nindicates that, however the actual consumption of current during the twelve hours between ten p.m. and ten a.m., might vary from day to day, it was meant that payment should be made at the rate of $20 per annum for a constant number of horse-power, to be ascertained presumably, having regard to the provision of the specifications, by the use of an instantaneous Watt-meter. The parties would be thus enabled to determine the consuming capacity or requirement of the defendant's plant. This would remain constant while the plant should be in(operation, because the motor would be required to work against a constant water-pressure. In no other way can the provision for payment in this contract be satisfactorily worked out. If it was meant that payment, should be for the actual number of Watts consumed by the defendant, it is inconceivable that the price would have been fixed at $20 per horse-power per annum, or that the contract would have provided, as it does, for the ascertainment of the contractual horse-power by instantaneous measurement, and would not have provided for the measurement by a recording meter of the number of Watts actually used by the defendant.\nReading the contract and specifications as a whole, it is, I think, clear that the words \"for the quantity of said electric current or power actually delivered\" were inserted, merely to provide tor the rature determination of the then unascertained factor, viz., the consuming capacity of the pumping plant which the defendant was about to install. So read there is nothing in the terms of payment as stated in the contract at all in conflict with the \"flat rate\" mentioned in the specifications. On the contrary the two provisions harmonize perfectly.\nTherefore I conclude that the intention of the parties as expressed in their contract was that, from the time at which the contract should become operative, the defendant should, during its term, pay to the plaintiffs $20 per annum for whatever number of horse-power of electric current should be found requisite to drive the motor to be installed in its high-level pumping-station; and that it was further intended that for this purpose the requirement or consuming capacity of the motor in horse-power should be ascertained and determined as it was in this case. The subsequent conduct of the parties, so far as it may be looked to, merely serves to confirm this view of what were the actual intentions in making this contract.\nThen it is said by the appellant that \"current or power\" is \"actually delivered\" only while it is being actually used or taken by the consumer. At other times (so the appellant argues) the electric energy upon the supply wire is not \"current or power\"; neither is it \"delivered.\" But, having regard to the nature of the commodity which is the subject of this contract, to the fact that the taking of the energy supplied depended entirely upon the act and volition of the defendant and to the provision of the specifications that the delivery point of the current will be inside the pumping station and building,\ni.e., at the point to which the plaintiffs were required to carry their wires and at which the switch connecting with the defendant's wires should be placed, I think it reasonably clear that the actual delivery which the contract contemplated was the supplying and conducting by the plaintiffs to a point within the defendant's pumping station building of electrical energy\u2014or, perhaps, expressed more accurately, of electrical pressure\u2014in such manner that the defendant could, by making a connection which was wholly within its own power\u2014that is, by accepting the delivery which the plaintiffs actually tendered\u2014obtain that which the plaintiffs had contracted to furnish. The plaintiffs shew that they did everything which was incumbent upon them towards making a complete delivery of the commodity which they undertook to supply. Treating this agreement as a contract for the sale of a commodity (which I think it is), having regard to the terms of articles 1492 and 1493 C.C., it seems clear that an actual taking of the current by the defendant was not essential to its \"actual delivery\" within the meaning of that phrase in the contract. The delivery contemplated by the contract was, in my opinion, complete when the plaintiffs placed at the disposal of the defendant in its station building such electrical energy or pressure as would, when taken by the defendant, supply the current or power requisite to drive its pumping plant. This the evidence discloses the plaintiffs in fact did, and the courts below have accordingly held them entitled to recover the amount of their claim.\nIf the agreement should be regarded not as a contract of sale, but, as suggested during the argument, rather as an agreement whereby the plaintiffs undertook to perform work for the defendant and to bring about a state of things which would enable them to obtain certain results, it implies a condition that; the defendant, on its part, will do whatever acts may be incumbent on it to enable the plaintiffs to carry out their undertaking and to earn the consideration therefor. This the defendant failed to do, and the damages to which the plaintiffs would be entitled for such breach would, in the circumstances of this case, not differ materially\u2014if indeed they would differ at all\u2014 from the amount of the price to which they would have become entitled had the defendant done what was necessary on its part to permit of the contract being fully carried out during the period in question. But, in my opinion, the agreement is a contract for the sale of a commodity produced and to be supplied by the plaintiffs to the defendant.\nThe use of the terms \"current or power\" to describe electrical energy or pressure supplied but not taken may be technically inaccurate. Yet what the parties intended seems sufficiently clearly expressed; and, that being so, the failure to employ strictly correct words to formulate that intention will not prevent the courts from carrying it into effect.\nThe contract provides that it\nshall continue in force for the term of five years beginning from the first supply of such electrical current.\nIt was contended for the appellant, though not very strenuously, that the contract was not, in fact, operative during the period for which the plaintiffs claim payment because it had merely requested the company to deliver current for experimental purposes. A perusal of the evidence, however, has satisfied me that the company was in fact called upon by the city to begin to supply electrical current under the contract, and that it did in fact so supply such current while the city used it and, thereafter, continued to supply the energy or pressure necessary to produce such current, although its use was discontinued by the city, owing to the issue of an injunction restraining the operation of the city's pumping plant. With the obtaining of this injunction, the plaintiffs had nothing to do, and they cannot be held to be in any way responsible for the consequent interruption in the use by the city of the electrical energy which they held themselves at all times ready to, and did, in fact, deliver.\nFor the reasons which I have stated I am of opinion that the contract has been properly construed, and the obligations of the defendant correctly defined in the provincial courts.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\n-Solicitors for the appellant: Ethier, Archambault,\nLavalee, Damphouse, Jarry & Butler.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n",

Duff J. contra.\nThe \"Railway Act\" empowers the Board to order that, upon lines of railway not yet completed or open for traffic or in course of construction, where they pass through inclosed lands, the railway companies should construct and maintain such fences or take such other steps as may be necessary to prevent cattle and other animals from getting upon the right-of-way. Idington J. contra. APPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada on a question as to the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe Canadian Northern Railway Company, one of the companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, appealed from the order whereby, among other things, it is required that all railway companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Board should, as to all railway lines completed, owned or operated by them where the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed, settled or improved, on or before 1st January, 1911, erect and maintain on each side of the right-of-way fences with swing gates at farm crossings, and that, as to lines not yet completed or opened for traffic or in course of construction where the railway is being constructed through inclosed lands it should be the duty of the railway company at once to construct such fences or take such other steps as would prevent cattle and other animals escaping from such inclosed lands. The question to be decided was, whether or not under section 254 of the \"Railway Act\" or otherwise the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada had jurisdiction to make those provisions of the order.\nIn giving reasons for the making of the order, the Hon. J. P. Mabee, Chief Commissioner, said:\n\"At every sitting of the Board from Winnipeg to Victoria complaints were made against the railway companies in connection with the fencing, or rather the defective and non-fencing of their right-of-way, and that the law regarding cattle-guards was not complied with. Claims innumerable for stock killed, and refusal to make compensation were disclosed. Many cases appeared where stock had been killed upon the track and farmers were afraid to ask for compensation for fear of being involved in endless litigation. \"It would seem, perhaps, that upon the whole the absence of fences along the right-of-way is a more fruitful source of loss to the rancher and farmer than defective cattle-guards, or their absence.\n\"Cases were given where those in charge of the construction of railways entered upon improved and inclosed land, threw down the fences, made no attempt to inclose the right-of-way, allowing stock to get out upon the highways, thus injuring crops, and in some instances these cattle were killed upon distant railway tracks. Whether these wrong-doers were independent contractors or servants or officers of the railways under construction did not appear, but, so far as this Board has power, it is determined that such highhanded and unreasonable conduct shall cease.\n\"The 'Railway Act' is clear upon the questions of fencing and cattle-guards, and the time has arrived when something must be done to compel the observance of its provisions.\n\"Section 254 provides as follows:\" '1. The company shall erect and maintain upon the railway:\n\" '(a) Fences of a minimum height of four feet six inches on each side of the railway;\n\" '(b) Swing gates in such fences at farm-crossings of the minimum height aforesaid, with proper hinges and fastenings, provided that sliding or hurdle gates constructed before February 1, 1904, may be maintained; and\n\" '(c) Cattle-guards on each side of the highway at every highway crossing at rail level with the highway. \" '2. The railway fences at every such highway crossing shall be turned into the respective cattle-guards on each side of the highway.\n\" '3. Such fences, gates, and cattle-guards shall be suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle and other animals from getting on the railway.\n\" '4. Wherever the railway passes through any locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed and either settled or improved, the company shall not be required to erect and maintain such fences, gates, and cattle-guards, unless the Board otherwise orders or directs.'\n\"There has been no order of the Board respecting fencing through uninclosed or unimproved lands, and the practice of the companies, so far as I can learn, has been to leave their right-of-way entirely unfenced, until the adjacent owner or owners had erected side-fences, when such owner or owners would be expected to call upon the company to erect its fences. Cases, however, were presented where the side-fences had been long since erected, but yet the railway fences had not been erected.\n\"We have been furnished with no information by the railway companies of the amounts paid by them for cattle killed upon their lines, or of the number of claims they have disputed, but from the large number of cases that were brought to the attention of the Board, where compensation has not been made, the better opinion perhaps is that the disputed claims vastly exceed those in which settlements have been made, if not, the companies have been paying out very large sums that would have been much better spent in protecting their rights-of-way.\n\"Now the statute defines clearly the kind of fence and cattle-guard that must be provided; the fence must be at least four feet, six inches high, and it and the cattle-guards must be 'suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle and other animals from getting on the railway.'\n\"It is just as incumbent upon the companies to fence against hogs as it is against horses, yet it is not pretended that any attempt has been made to do so, and instances were given where farmers had so many hogs killed that they were compelled to abandon any attempt to raise them.\n\"It seems to be the practice in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, some parts of Alberta and British Columbia to remove the cattle-guards entirely in the winter time. This is done, it was said, to facilitate the operation of the snow ploughs. It was not shewn by any railway expert that this practice is necessary, but it was shewn by many Saskatchewan farmers that it was more important to them to have the cattle-guards in place during winter than any other season, as during the other seasons their cattle were mostly pasturing in the hills in charge of herders. At any rate these cattle-guards have been removed during the winter months without authority and unless a great deal more can be shewn than has yet appeared, the practice must cease. Furthermore, the railway companies must establish and maintain cattle-guards that will prevent cattle and other animals from getting upon the railways. This is the requirement of the law, and I know of no reason why it should not be complied with.\n\"The provisions of clause 4 have been abused, and. this statutory exemption from fencing has been used by the companies to free themselves from making compensation in innumerable cases of meritorious claims. This condition of affairs cannot be permitted to continue; it works great hardship upon the public, and is of little or no benefit to the railway companies. The conditions in the West have greatly changed since this exemption was granted to the companies, and as they are compelled at some stage of the undertaking to erect fences, I am clearly of the opinion that no hardship will be imposed if that stage is made the initial one.\n\"I am aware that in various parts of the country no necessity now exists, and possibly never will, for the erection of fences. The formal order may contain a provision that railway companies, the lines of which have already been constructed, may apply to exempt certain sections of the road from the operation of the order, when, if conditions are shewn that such course will entail no hardship upon the public, the Board may so declare. The like course may be taken where railways are in course of construction, and as to such latter, when application is made to open the road for traffic, the fences, cattle-guards, highway and farm-crossings and gates shall all form part of the work necessary to be completed according to the statute and the Board's regulations, before permission is given to operate the road. I am convinced that this course will, in the end, be less expensive for the railway companies, as the erection of fences, gates, etc., can all be carried on at the time of construction at less cost than later on, to say nothing of saving liability for damage claims for stock killed and law costs in defending, even if successful.\n\"Many complaints were made that in the construction of the railway lines the highway crossings were left in an impassable state, causing endless inconvenience and trouble to the public. I confess I am at a loss to understand such disregard of the rights of others, and such selfish and inconsiderate conduct upon the part of those constructing the railways, or responsible for their construction. If these works are let out to contractors, the railway companies may as well at once understand that they must make some provision in their contracts that will compel their contractors to treat the public with ordinary decency. This Board has no control over the contractors and can deal only with the railway companies. These highway crossings can be constructed at less expense when the grading is being done than later on, after the road is completed; and with respect to roads not yet completed, they will not be opened for traffic until every highway crossing opened for travel is put into the condition called for by the Board's regulations. As to these railways now in operation, all highway crossings, opened for travel, must be put into the condition called for by the regulations within one year from this date.\n\"A draft order embodying the foregoing may be sent to all the companies, and its settlement spoken to by them at the May meeting of the Board at Ottawa.\"\nIt did not appear that there had been any special application made to the Board in respect to any designated locality, nor that the necessity of fencing any defined portion of any particular line of railway had been inquired into and determined by the Board; and the order, by its terms, applied to the whole of the Dominion of Canada and affected all railways subject to the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants. The Board has no power to make a general order such as this, but must deal with each locality as an application is made in respect thereto. Section 25, Cyc. 1534, as to de- finition of locality. See also as to liability to fence generally, Cortese v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[1]; Biddeson v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[2]; Phair v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[3]; Hunt v. Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co.[4]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Carruthers[5].\nFord K.C., Deputy-Attorney-General of Saskatchewan, supported the order.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The provisions of the order complained of as made in excess of the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners are fully set out in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin. The question to be decided on this appeal is whether, under section 254 of the \"Railway Act,\" or otherwise, the Board has jurisdiction to make such provisions. That section (section 254, par. 1) imposes upon all railway companies under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada the general obligation to erect and maintain fences, gates and cattle-guards to be constructed in accordance with certain requirements set out in detail in the section.\nAn exception to the general obligation contained in paragraph 1 is made in sub-section 4 of the same section 254, with respect to\nany locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not enclosed and either settled or improved.\nIn such a locality the company is not subject to the general obligation to erect and maintain fences, gates and cattle-guards unless the Board otherwise orders and directs. In the context \"any locality\" does not include all Canada. The word locality qualified by any conveys the idea of a portion of Canadian territory confined within a limited area. In making the order the Chief Commissioner assumes that power exists in the Railway Board to make a general order applicable to all Canada, irrespective of localities, and he says:\nThe provisions of clause 4 have been abused, and this statutory exemption from fencing has been used by the companies to free themselves from making compensation in innumerable cases of meritorious claims. This condition of affairs cannot be permitted to continue; it works great hardship upon the public, and is of little or no benefit to the railway companies. The conditions in the West have greatly changed since this exemption was granted to the companies, and, as they are compelled at some stage of the undertaking to erect fences, I am clearly of the opinion that no hardship will be imposed if that stage is made the initial one.\nI am aware that in various parts of the country no necessity now exists, and possibly never will, for the erection of fences. The formal order may contain a provision that railway companies, the lines of which have already been constructed, may apply to exempt certain sections of the road from the operation of the order, when, if conditions are shewn that such course will entail no hardship upon the public, the Board may so declare. The like course may be taken where railways are in course of construction, and as to such latter, when application is made to open the road for traffic, the fences and cattle-guards, highway and farm-crossings and gates shall all form part of the work necessary to be complete according to the statute and the Board's regulations, before permission is given to operate the road. I am convinced that this course will, in the end, be less expensive for the railway companies, as the erection of fences, gates, etc., can all be carried on at the time of construction at less cost than later on, to say nothing of saving liability for damage claims for stock killed and law costs in defending, even if successful.\nI am of opinion that the order to fence in any excepted locality must be made in the exercise of a judicial discretion on proper cause shewn, that is to say, the Commission must judicially find as a fact that the company with respect to a particular locality is not entitled to the benefit of the statutory exemption. The intention of Parliament clearly was to except from the general obligation to fence any locality wherein the lands through which the railway passes were \"not enclosed and either settled or improved,\" on the presumption that, in places where such conditions existed, fences, gates and cattle-guards were unnecessary. The Chief Commissioner gives as his reason for making the order that\nas they (the railway companies) are compelled at some stage of the undertaking to erect fences,\npresumably because, at that stage, the adjoining lands will be settled or improved, in the meantime, the companies are not entitled to the benefit of the exception created in their favour by Parliament and this notwithstanding that the Commissioner is aware\nthat in various parts of the country no necessity now exists and possibly never will exist for the erection of fences.\nTo order the erection of fences at a time when the Commissioners admit they are not required and in places where the necessity for them will, in the opinion of the Commissioners, never arise is, in my opinion, ultra vires of the Commission. The Act clearly indicates that each individual case is to be considered before an order is made with respect thereto. To make a general rule obliging the companies to fence and imposing upon them the onus of procuring and giving evidence as to the absence of necessity for fencing in order to get the benefit of the exception created in their favour is to completely alter the policy of the Act.\nAs to lines not yet complete or open for traffic or in course of construction, I am of opinion that the Commissioners have jurisdiction to oblige all railways, where they pass through enclosed lands, to fence or take such other steps as are necessary to prevent cattle or other animals from escaping from the inclosed lands through which the railway passes, whether the railways are being operated by trains or are merely in course of construction.\nI agree, as to this portion of the order, with the conclusion reached by Sir Louis Davies.\nGirouard J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed in every respect, except with regard to fences and cattle-guards on lands on either side of the railway that are not enclosed or either settled or improved, unless in \"any locality\" the Board has ordered otherwise. I am not called upon to express an opinion as to the exact meaning of the words \"any locality\"; whether it refers to a province, a district or any place in any province; it is sufficient for me to say that these words do not mean the whole Dominion. The order of the Board seems to be reasonable and even wise; but it is too general and should be given by the Parliament of Canada, who alone can change the policy expressed in article 254, par. 4, of the \"Railway Act.\" Otherwise I agree with the Board.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed in part and dismissed in part, without costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal challenging the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners to make the General Order No. 7473, providing substantially that all completed railway lines owned or operated by companies should on or before the 1st January, 1911, where the lands on either side of the railway were not enclosed, settled or improved, have erected and maintained\non each side of the right of way fences of a minimum height of 4 ft. 6 inches, with swing gates at farm crossings, etc.;\nand also providing with respect to lines of railway not completed or opened for traffic that where such lines are being constructed through enclosed lands it should be the duty of the company\nto at once construct such fences or take such other steps that will prevent cattle and other animals escaping from such enclosed lands.\nAfter much consideration I have reached the conclusion that such part of the order as requires all railway companies subject to the Board's jurisdiction and owning or operating completed lines running through lands \"which were not enclosed, settled or improved on either side of the railway,\" to \"erect and maintain on each side of the right of way fences of a minimum height of 4 ft. 6 in.,\" is in excess of the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe determination of the question turns upon the proper construction of the 254th section of the \"Railway Act of 1906.\" That section after imposing a duty upon the company to provide for the erection and maintenance generally of fences, swing gates at farm crossings, and cattle-guards at highway level crossings, contained a 4th sub-section, reading as follows:\nWhenever the railway passes through any locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed and either settled or improved, the company shall not be required to erect and maintain such fences, gates and cattle-guards unless the Board otherwise orders or directs.\nThe language of the section is unfortunately somewhat obscure and ambiguous.\nI construe it to have reference to the passage of a railway through a locality in which lands on either side of the railway are not enclosed and not either settled or improved. In such cases, that is in what is popularly known as wilderness or wild or waste or forest or prairie lands unenclosed and not settled or not improved, the duty on the companies' part to fence shall not exist unless and until the Board otherwise orders or directs. It seems to me from the insertion of the words \"any locality\" which govern and control this sub-section, that the intention of Parliament was not to vest a general power in the Board of imposing the duty of fencing these special lands upon the companies irrespective of previous investigation or inquiry with regard to them and the necessity of fencing arising from the existing special conditions such investigation might disclose, but a special power exercisable with regard to any locality the Board might choose to investigate. Parliament no doubt wisely did not define what was intended as a locality. That too was left to the Board. Whether it was ten miles or one hundred miles or more in length was left open. So I should hold that the Board would have jurisdiction to investigate with respect to any area of such lands as the section embraced as to the conditions existing there, and after such investigation make such order as to fences, gates and cattle-guards as in its judgment was necessary and desirable.\nBut it must appear either expressly from the face of the order or from some record of the proceedings of the Board or be otherwise fairly to be inferred from them that the Board was exercising its powers with respect to some defined locality and was not merely making a general order covering all the localities throughout Canada through which all the railways subject to its jurisdiction ran. Such an order would be practically legislation in itself and not an exercise of the definite and limited powers given by Parliament. In my opinion Parliament did not intend to delegate to the Board a power to legislate, but a very broad general and, no doubt, desirable power to impose upon the railway companies duties with respect to fencing in certain designated areas of land called \"localities\" from which duties the statute, until the Board otherwise ordered, exempted them. Parliament obviously intended by limiting the exercise of this power to \"localities\" that it should not be exercised unless and until the Board having examined or enquired into the conditions had determined that these were such as called for the exercise of their powers so far as the \"locality\" inquired into was concerned. It is not pretended that any such necessarily precedent investigation and inquiry as would justify a general power such as the one now being considered had been made. Indeed, the contrary appears to be the fact.\nWith respect to that part of the order relating to lines not completed or opened for traffic or in course of construction where the railway is being constructed through inclosed lands which directs the railway company to\nat once construct such fences or take such other steps that (sic) will prevent cattle and other animals escaping from such enclosed lands,\nI am of the opinion that the Board had jurisdiction to make the order directing immediate construction of fences or alternative steps deemed by them necessary and sufficient. The criticism upon the language of this particular order made by Anglin J. (with whose conclusion. I agree) and who suggests a variation in its language is, I think, sound. If the language of the Act is adhered to and its words at the end of sub-section 3 of section 254, namely, \"from getting on the railway\" literally followed and substituted for those inserted in the order, namely, \"escaping from such inclosed lands,\" I think many difficulties with respect to its enforcement in the future will be avoided.\nIdington J.\u2014I fear this order exceeds the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe \"Railway Act,\" by section 254, prescribes the duty of the railway companies in regard to fencing.\nIn no other part of the Act is the subject dealt with except section 242, sub-section 2, and that part relative to cattle-guards to which I will presently refer.\nSub-section 4 is as follows:\nWhenever the railway passes through any locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed and either settled or improved, the company shall not be required to erect and maintain such fences, gates and cattle-guards unless the Board otherwise orders or directs.\nIt is by this excepting part of the clause, and by that alone, put within the power of the Board to deal with this matter of fencing through\nany locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed and either settled or improved.\nTo appreciate properly the nature and scope of that dealing and of the duties imposed upon the Board and jurisdiction given it by virtue of only these excepting words, for everything turns upon the range of this exception, I have searched through the Act to find if and how such excepting phrases are used elsewhere therein. I have also endeavoured, to find in how far and in what cases and manner a general legislative power or specific power of regulation is given.\nFor by its nature this order must rest upon the legislative powers of the Board which are quite distinct from its judicial and administrative powers.\nTheir legislative power is not confined to the subject-matters indicated in section 30 of the Act, extensive as these are, but in many places is specifically given either expressly or by clear words of implication on and over a great variety of subjects.\nFor example, in the minor matters of practice and procedure in section 51, and of what and how plans are to be filed as is required by sections 164 and 165 and many others, all relevant to the conduct of the business of the Board, legislative power is expressly given, though from the nature of each of such subjects such powers might have been left to repose in necessary implication if any should be so left.\nThen of a more important and more distinctively general legislative character we find section 264 implies by its language a general power to direct certain things relative to equipment of cars and locomotives and enabling by express words the passing of a general regulation suspending from time to time compliance with the provisions of that section.\nWe also find illustrations in section 269 which enables making regulations for working trains; section 284, sub-section 4, which seems to imply making general regulations for traffic accommodation; section 321, as to classification of freight traffic; section 340, as to the limiting of liability or right to contract as to same; section 357, as to publication of tariffs, and section 400, as to increased tolls in a certain class of cases. These are some of many of a like kind covering many spheres of action and mingled as it were in some cases with many express statutory provisions on the like subject-matters.\nIt is this feature of the Act which impresses me.\nWhere Parliament felt it might have failed to cover every emergency it has expressly or by clear implication conferred the legislative power to cover the omissions experience might find needful. What is the proper inference to be drawn if it is not that where the legislative power as in the cases in hand is not clearly given, it is not intended to be exercised ?\nThen we have the numerous exceptions, somewhat slightly varied in language, of the same nature as that covered by the exception under consideration.\nFor example, section 180, sub-section 5, uses the expression \"except by leave of the Board.\" Section 236, \"unless otherwise directed by the Board.\" Section 242, \"unless the Board otherwise directs.\"\nI find in these illustrations two distinct and different methods of dealing with matters relegated to the Board.\nWhere the matter is intended to be dealt with legislatively, Parliament has uniformly found it necessary to say so, and distinctly confers the power. Where it is intended the Board shall act in its judicial or administrative capacity then in many cases we find the\n\"unless the Board otherwise directs\" or its equivalent. Here the expression is that of \"orders or directs\"\neven more clearly, I think, pointing to a specific adjudication.\nThen we have the \"locality\" referred to of which there must be many. It is surely clearly intended that the words \"unless the Board otherwise orders or directs\" at the end of the sentence should be held to relate to the antecedent part of the sentence which the word \"locality\" limits.\nIt seems to have been intended to confine the ordering or directing to each locality as the subject or place in respect of which a hearing is to be had and action is to be taken.\nI do not doubt more than one such might be included in one order.\nThe order made is, I think, clearly of a legislative character.\nIt is a recasting of the scheme of the section. It throws on the railway company the onerous burthen Parliament had relieved it of and then provides for a special application and relief thereupon.\nI am inclined to think it more in accordance with good, practical, common sense, if I may be permitted to say so, than the plan of the Act.\nYet it is distinctly legislative in character, and that where the phrase used is not an apt one to confer such powers, and the sentence, as a whole, does not imply action of that kind, but of a judicial and administrative character relative to a specific case as it arises.\nI cannot assign legislative power to the phrase without leading to possible absurdities or at least inconsistencies when we consider its use elsewhere.\nAnother consideration weighs much with me, and that is this. When a specific Act or thing has been dealt with by the Board, and a question raised of its jurisdiction by appeal here, our decision ends the matter unless appealed to the Privy Council by those concerned. In the case of any excess of jurisdiction relative to some legislative power or assertion of such power where none exists and the jurisdiction is left unattacked or by us improvidently maintained, no one is so concerned as to carry the matter to the ultimate appellate court. Those indirectly so may await some specific accident case in which to raise it and carry the matter as a test then to the Privy Council with very undesirable results if the jurisdiction is not upheld, unless a more extensive meaning is given section 56, sub-section 9, than I assign to it.\nUnless the legislative power is clear it better be made so, or in case of doubt be resolved (as we do in regard to our own) against jurisdiction.\nThe question of power as to fencing in places where construction is in process seems more clearly beyond the Board's jurisdiction than the other.\nThe suggestion that these orders might be rested upon section 30, sub-section (g), is not tenable. The fact that cattle-guards are named and fences omitted is surely enough in itself to dispose of that. Cattle-guards are referred to as well as fences in section 254. But the question of what was the best kind of cattle-guard long agitated those concerned and possibly does yet. It was necessary to give the power to the Board of deciding as to a specific form or device of cattle-guard, and insisting if need be on its adoption by the companies when something found to fill the bill and they might naturally be reluctant to change all their old devices.\nNo such question rose before the mind of any one in regard to fencing. That was doubtless thought to be finally disposed of and to need no more legislation.\nIt seems to me the appeal must be allowed. Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The validity of the second of the impeached provisions depends upon the construction of the 4th sub-section of section 254, read, of course, with such other provisions of the Act as may throw light upon it. The effect of the whole section (254) appears to me to be this: The territory through which any given railway passes is for the purpose of the section conceived as embracing two classes of localities: 1st, those in which the lands on both sides of the railway are neither inclosed and settled nor inclosed and improved; and 2nd, localities in which some of the lands on at least one side of the railway falls within one or other of those categories; and the enactment imposes upon the railway company the duty of maintaining fences, cattle-guards and farm-crossings in the last mentioned class of localities and does not impose that duty in respect of the first mentioned. But this is not the whole of the legislative provision. The positive requirement to fence when the railway passes through a locality of the second class is only the irreducible minimum of this kind of protection for the public which is ordained by the Act. In respect of the first class of localities no such absolute duty is imposed; but the whole question of fencing, etc., in such localities is reserved to be dealt with by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThis view of the section is that upon which the Board of Railway Commissioners appears to have acted, and although (since my learned brothers agree in thinking it erroneous), I must, of course, be wrong, I cannot profess to entertain any real doubt that the Board has correctly interpreted the intention of the legislature.\nThe rival view of sub-section 4, put forward by Mr. Chrysler, is that the Board is empowered to make an order or direction under sub-section 4, touching the subjects there dealt with only when satisfied judicially upon special considerations applicable to a specified locality that the measures provided for by the order are necessary. I shall briefly give my reasons for thinking this construction untenable\u2014and the grounds upon which I think the view of the Board of Railway Commissioners should be supported will appear as I proceed.\nIn any suggested view of the power in question one does not readily see upon what principle the exercise of it can be described as the exercise of a judicial function. Assuming the authority to be confined to the promulgation of orders and directions applicable only to a specified railway and to a defined locality\u2014it is still quite obvious that in determining in a given case whether such an order or direction shall or shall not be given, the Board does not act upon any rule, principle or standard prescribed for it by the statute or by any other authority; it acts only upon such principles and standards as in the exercise of its own judgment it sets up for itself. And that is by no means all. An order of the Board under this enactment assuming it to be a specific order in the sense mentioned, actually alters the law governing the specific case dealt with. The company being, prior to the order, under no duty to fence becomes\u2014solely in consequence of the order itself\u2014subject to an obligation to do so; and the order itself\u2014when published in the manner prescribed\u2014has, by virtue of section 31 the same force as if enacted in the \"Railway Act.\" The order, in a word, does not merely give rise to a legal duty to some individual or determinate body of individuals; but constitutes an enactment on the violation of which the company is subjected to the same consequences as if it were found in the Act itself.\nSuch specific commands (as distinguished from rules or regulations governing all cases falling within a general description), although usually classed by legal writers as administrative are strictly legislative in their character. There may no doubt be cases in which it would be difficult to draw the exact line between functions that are in this sense administrative and functions that are judicial. Still the broad distinction between a function which finds its operation in determining what the law is to be for the future (whether governing one case or governing many cases) and that which is concerned with the application of some existing general rule, principle or standard to a particular case is a very plain and very familiar distinction. It is admirably illustrated in this sentence from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific My. Co.[6], at page 499:\nIt is one thing to inquire whether the rates which have been charged and collected are reasonable\u2014that is a judicial act; but an entirely different thing to prescribe rates which shall be charged in the future\u2014that is a legislative act;\nand it seems not to be at all difficult of application in the case before us.\nSuch being the character of the authority exercise-able is the exercise of it limited in the way contended for; that is to say, must any order under it be confined in its application to a specific railway and to a defined locality? Looking first at the language of the sub-section itself it is at once apparent that regarding only the grammatical sense of the words employed the authority of the Board to \"otherwise order or direct\" is not in any way subject to any such limitation. Is there any ground for implying it? I think there is none; on the contrary there are very cogent reasons against such an implication. On the construction proposed it is obvious that before exercising its authority in any particular case the Board must first determine and define the locality in respect of which the order is to be made. Its jurisdiction ex hypothesi must rest upon the correctness of its own view, that the locality so defined is a locality within the meaning of the section \u2014the notion of \"locality\" having no sort of relevancy except in that sense. Now the most cursory examination of the section will reveal the pitfalls besetting the path of an authority exercising a jurisdiction resting on such a condition. What is a \"locality\" within the meaning of this subsection? What are \"local considerations?\u201d\nAssume, for example, a railway passing through a string of localities, some falling under sub-section 4, while in the others sub-section 1 is applicable; and that the Board considered it desirable that the line should, through all of them, be fenced. The Board has power to enforce sub-section 1 by an order directing fencing in localities to which it applies and to make a similar order in respect of the other localities under sub-section 4. In other words, the Board has power to direct fencing throughout the whole line and has determined it is desirable to do so. According to the construction contended for it is at this point that the difficulties of the Board begin. In order to carry into effect its determination it must, according to that view, first ascertain and define in a series of separate orders the exact limits of the localities in respect of which it is exercising its authority under sub-section 4. Having ex hypothesi as enforcing subsection 1 or as exercising the power given by sub-section 4, the authority to direct fencing throughout the whole line, and having determined to do so, the Board is disabled from exercising at once all its, powers by the promulgation of a single order, but must, as a condition of its jurisdiction, first proceed to segregate the localities falling within sub-section 4\u2014while a mistake in this process of labelling would in any particular case be fatal to the validity of the order.\nIt is obvious that such a construction must in practice give rise to much uncertainty in the application of the enactment and afford a field for much preliminary controversy upon the authority of the Board in particular cases; so much so, indeed, that I fear it will rob the provision of any sort of practical efficacy. I take it to be axiomatic that you must not imply a term in a statutory enactment if it is likely to defeat the purpose of the enactment as disclosed by the words actually used; and on this ground alone the implication suggested is not, I think, admissible.\nIt is further to be observed that the subject of the regulation of structures upon a railway in the aspect of that subject which touches the public safety is dealt with in another section of the Act (section 30 (g)), which confers upon the Board in respect of such structures and for the purpose of protecting the property and persons of the public the broadest powers of general regulation. The language of that provision is certainly extensive enough to embrace the subjects of fencing and cattle-guards, and the subject of cattle-guards is expressly mentioned. No doubt the first sub-section of section 254 does, within the field of its operation, displace the authority conferred by section 30(g), at all events as regards the subject of fencing; but sub-section 4 must, I think, be read with the earlier provision, and reading the two provisions together the most natural construction of the words \"unless the Board otherwise orders or directs\" seems to be that localities to which sub-section 4 applies, or in other words, localities not subject to sub-section 1 are, in respect of the subjects mentioned, reserved to be dealt with by the Board in this exercise of the general powers given by section 30 (g). If that be the true view there can be no doubt that the form of the Board's orders, the circumstances in which they are to be made, and the considerations by which, in making them, the Board is to be governed, are all in the largest manner left to the Board itself to determine.\nAs to the first provision I think that under the Act as it now stands there is, in respect of localities falling within the scope of the first sub-section, an unqualified duty to fence. The provision, it is true, is drawn in such a way as to embrace localities within sub-section 4 as well, but in the view of that sub-section already stated, the provision is not by reason of the generality of its terms open to objection.\nI should, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Canadian Northern Railway appeals against so much of a general order pronounced by the Board of Railway Commissioners, proprio motu, as requires, amongst other things, that (a) All railway companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Board shall as to all railway lines completed, owned or operated by them, where the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed, settled or improved, on or before Jan. 1st, 1911, erect and maintain on each side of the right of way, fences of a minimum height of four feet six inches with swing gates at farm crossings with minimum height aforesaid with proper hinges or fastenings.\nAnd prescribes that\n(b) As to lines not yet completed or opened for traffic or in course of construction * * * where the railway is being constructed through inclosed lands it shall be the duty of a railway company to at once construct such, fences or take such other steps that (sic) will prevent cattle and other animals escaping from such inclosed lands.\nThe order further provides that:\n6. Where it shall be made to appear to the Board that no necessity exists for the fencing or other works hereinbefore directed, the company or companies may apply to the Board for exemption from fencing, and other works, and such exemptions may be made as the Board deems proper.\nSection 254 of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37) reads as follows:\n254. The company shall erect and maintain upon the railway,\u2014\n(a) fences of a minimum height of four feet six inches on each side of the railway;\n(b) swing gates in such fences at farm crossings of the minimum height aforesaid, with proper hinges and fastenings: Provided that sliding or hurdle gates, constructed before the first day of February, one thousand nine hundred and four, may be maintained; and\n(c) cattle-guards on each side of the highway, at every highway crossing at rail level with the railway.\n* * *\n4. Whenever the railway passes through any locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed and either settled or improved, the company shall not be required to erect and maintain such fences, gates and cattle-guards unless the Board otherwise orders or directs.\nThe provisions of the order of the Board as to such portions of railways as pass through lands \"not inclosed, settled or improved,\" the appellants contend are a reversal of the policy of Parliament, as declared by sub-section 4 of section 254 of the \"Railway Act.\" This clause of the statute, they maintain, contemplates that as a general rule a railway company shall not be obliged to fence its right of way through lands not inclosed and not settled or improved, and that the obligation to fence the railway through such lands shall arise only when the Board of Railway Commissioners shall so order and direct in each particular locality.\nI appreciate the difficulty of defining the limits of a \"locality,\" or determining what extent of territory it may embrace. But I am satisfied that an order directing the erection of fences along the lines of all railways which pass through uninclosed lands not settled or improved in any part of Canada is not an order for the erection of such fences in \"any locality\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in sub-section 4 of section 254.\nMr. Ford, in supporting this part of the order, argued that the earlier part of sub-section 4 was merely meant to describe the kind of country in which a railway company is not, without an order of the Board, general or particular, required to erect and maintain fences; and that that sub-section contemplates that the Board may make a general order for the fencing of all railways wherever they pass through uninclosed lands not settled or improved. If the subsection had read\u2014\"wherever the railway passes through lands on either side of the railway not inclosed, etc.\"\u2014this interpretation might be maintained; but it obviously treats the words, \"through any locality,\" as mere surplusage and excludes them from consideration in the construction of the clause. This seems to me contrary to the fundamental canon of construction which requires that in construing a statute effect shall if possible be given to every word. As I read clause 4, it imports that an order requiring fencing shall be pronounced only when the Board is judicially satisfied that in the localities in regard to which such order is made fencing is necessary. To reach such a conclusion judicially presupposes investigation and inquiry as to the localities to be affected by the order, as a result of which the Board is satisfied that necessity for fencing there exists. The recital in the written opinion of the Chief Commissioner of the circumstances which led to the making of this order and the presence in the order itself of paragraph 6 above quoted, satisfy me that the part of the order now under consideration was not pronounced in the proper exercise of the judicial functions of the Board after investigation of the circumstances of all localities in Canada in which railways pass through uninclosed lands, not settled or improved, but that it is rather a declaration by the Board that, after an investigation, admittedly partial, but in its opinion sufficiently extended, it has reached the conclusion that, as to all portions of railways passing through such lands in any part of Canada, the railway companies should, prim\u00e0 facie and generally, be required to fence, and that the burden should be cast upon them of obtaining exemption from this obligation by satisfying the Board that in particular localities no necessity exists for fencing, etc. Such an order is, in my opinion, tantamount to legislation repealing sub-section 4 and substituting for it a provision precisely the reverse in policy, operation and effect. To do this was, I think, notwithstanding the very broad terms in which the sections of the statute conferring and defining its jurisdiction are couched, beyond the power of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nI agree, therefore, with the contention of the appellants, that the Board had not jurisdiction to pronounce this general order requiring that every railway company throughout Canada, wherever its lines pass through uninclosed lands, not settled or improved, shall erect and maintain statutory fences, with swing gates along their right-of-way, unless it shall apply for and obtain exemption from the Board. I think the appeal of the Canadian Northern Railway Company against this portion of the order should be allowed.\nThis part of the order was treated by counsel for the railway company as made under sub-section 4, of section 254. No doubt it was so intended. That sub-section, however, deals with\nany locality in which the lands on either side of the railway are not inclosed and either settled or improved.\nIn drafting the order the words \"and either\" have been, no doubt inadvertently, omitted. Without them the clause of the order under consideration is wider than the exception created by sub-section 4, of section 254, and would cover uninclosed lands though \"settled or improved.\" In such cases any departure from the language of the statute, however unimportant it may appear, is always fraught with danger. If this paragraph of the order could be otherwise supported under sub-section 4, of section 254, it would probably be necessary to remit it to the Board for modification by inserting the words of the statute which have been omitted.\nAs to the other part of the order to which exception is taken, it will be noted that the direction is not necessarily to fence. It is to\nconstruct such fences or take such other steps that will prevent cattle and other animals escaping from such inclosed lands.\nBy section 2, sub-section 21, \"railway\" is defined as including \"property real or personal and works connected therewith.\" Having regard to this definition I see nothing in section 254 which requires the Board to abstain from ordering that fences shall be erected along the right of way before the railway is ready for operation, when, it is admitted, the duty to fence exists and may be enforced. Where the railway passes through inclosed lands, i.e., where the right-of-way of the company\u2014its real property\u2014is carried through inclosed lands, the statute says that \"the company shall erect and maintain upon the railway,\" i.e., upon its real property,\nfences * * *, suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle and other animals from getting on the railway,\ni.e., on such real property.\nBut if, as argued by Mr. Chrysler, the obligation to fence under section 254 arises only when the railway commences operation, the Board, in my opinion, had power, under section 30, clause (g), to pronounce the portion of their order now under discussion. By that section it is provided that\nthe Board may make orders and regulations * * * (g) with respect to the * * * methods, devices, structures and works to be used upon the railway (which includes its real property) so as to provide means for the due protection of property.\nIt was argued that, because fences are dealt with by section 254, and are not specifically mentioned in clause (g) of section 30, it must be taken that it was not intended thereby to empower the Board to order the erection of fences as a method, device, structure or work for the protection of property. The order may be complied with without the erection of fences, if other adequate steps are taken. It directs that the railway company shall \"construct such fences or take such other steps, etc.\" Moreover, section 254 either applies to the right-of-way before the rails are laid, or it does not. If it applies the order in appeal may be supported as an enforcement of its provisions (section 30 (h) and (i)); if it does not so apply, its presence in the statute affords no reason for excluding from the purview of section 30 (g), as something elsewhere specifically provided for, the erection of fences as a means for the due protection of property pending the completion of the railway.\nI think it is clear that either under sub-section 1, of section 254, or under the comprehensive language of clause (g), of section 30, the jurisdiction which they have here exercised is conferred upon the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nIt has been suggested that sub-section 1 does not apply to all localities in which the railway passes through inclosed lands, but only to those in which it passes through lands which are not only inclosed, but also settled or improved. This is said to be the effect upon sub-section 1 of the exception made by sub-section 4.\nIt is, I think, incontrovertible that such portions of every railway as are not within the exception in sub-section 4, are within the first sub-section. To understand the limitations upon the application of sub-section 1, it is, therefore, necessary to ascertain with precision what parts of a railway are within subsection 4. By sub-section 4 are excepted not all localities in which lands are \"not inclosed,\" but only those in which there are lands not inclosed which are also not \"either settled or improved,\" i.e., localities in which there are (a) lands not inclosed and not settled, or (b) lands not inclosed and not improved. Uninclosed lands which are improved or settled, and unimproved or unsettled lands which are inclosed are not within the exception. Therefore, localities in which the lands answer to either of these latter descriptions are within sub-section 1.\nIf they are not, it must be because they are within the exception; and if so, the exception is in reality of all localities in which the lands are not inclosed, whether improved or unimproved, settled or unsettled; and the words, \"and either settled or improved,\" are read out of the exception.\nThe only other possible construction of the exception is to read the word \"not\" as applicable only to \"inclosed,\" which would be equivalent to inserting the word \"are\" after the word \"and,\" so that the phrase would read\u2014\"in which the lands * * * are not inclosed and (are) either settled or improved\"\u2014a palpably wrong construction, because it would exclude from the exception the very localities in which fencing is least of all requisite, viz., those in which the lands are neither inclosed nor settled or improved.\nI, therefore, think that all localities in which the lands on either side of the railway are inclosed, whether they are improved or unimproved, settled or unsettled, are within sub-section 1, because clearly not within the exception; and in addition sub-section 1 covers localities in which such lands, though not inclosed, are either settled or improved. Otherwise either localities in which the lands answer the latter description are unprovided for\u2014which is contrary to the view that the section, as a whole, embraces all parts of all railways\u2014or all localities where lands are not inclosed are within the exception\u2014a construction which, as already pointed out, involves reading out the words \"and either settled or improved.\"\nI have not overlooked the decision of Street J. in Phair v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[7]. Without expressing any opinion as to the correctness of that decision upon the language of the statute as it then was, it suffices to say that Parliament has since altered the phraseology of sub-section 4 and it is not unreasonable to suppose that by the alteration of the phraseology it intended to effect some change in the law. But whether this be so or not, sub-section 4, as it now stands, must be given that construction for which its present form seems to call.\nNo doubt before the railway is under actual construction, although the right-of-way has been fully acquired, the owners, through whose inclosed farms it runs, would be amply protected by and fully satisfied with an order requiring the company to maintain intact the line fences crossing their right-of-way or to take other steps sufficient to prevent cattle \"escaping from such inclosed lands.\" Under clause (g) of section 30, if section 254 is not applicable, such an order might be made. But if section 254 applies\u2014as I think it does\u2014the only order authorized is an order requiring the erection and maintenance of statutory fences, etc., \"to prevent cattle and other animals from getting on the railway.\" That the Board would have jurisdiction to make such an order I think sufficiently clear; its reasonableness would not be for our consideration; but it would scarcely seem necessary before construction is commenced to require the company to fence in order to prevent cattle getting upon its right- of-way, which is then for all practical purposes, still part of the farms through which it runs. Whether as a condition of exempting it from the obligation to fence its right of way before construction, the Board could order that the company should, until actual construction commences, maintain existing farm fences so as to prevent cattle escaping from inclosed lands through which its right-of-way passes may be open to some question; but, having regard to the provisions of subjection 2, of section 30, I incline to think that such an order might be made.\nThe order in question, however, relates only to cases \"where the railway is being constructed.\" It, therefore, would seem inapplicable to cases in which the work of construction has not yet commenced. Where construction is actually proceeding it is in many localities accompanied by dangers to cattle and other animals straying upon the right-of-way quite as great as those incidental to the actual operation of a railway. In such cases not only in my opinion has the Board the power to require the erection of statutory fences to prevent \"cattle or other animals from getting on the railway,\" but it would be entirely reasonable that such an order should be made.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the portion of the order of the Board dealing with inclosed lands, \"where the railway is being constructed,\" has not been successfully attacked, and that as to it the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe order should, however, be varied by substituting for the words \"escaping from such inclosed lands\" the words of the statute\u2014\"from getting on the railway.\" This alteration we cannot make; but the necessary amendment will no doubt be made by the Board itself.\nAppeal allowed in part.\n[1] 7 Can.

Being informed by D. that the mine was badly managed and the property of little value, and that other holders were selling their stock, P. signed an agreement to sell his at par. D. assigned this agreement to a third party. Later P., learning that the stock was selling at a premium and believing that he had made an improvident bargain, entered into negotiations with the holder of his agreement, and a compromise was effected by a portion of P.\u2019s holdings being sold to the assignee at par and the remainder returned to him. It transpired afterwards that D. and the assignor were in collusion to get possession of the stock, and P. brought action against D. for damages.\nHeld, that the compromise having been effected when P. was in ignorance of the real state of affairs, it did not bind him as against D. from whom he could recover as damages, the difference between the par value of his remaining shares and their market value at the date of such compromise.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont.

W.R. 127) restored.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2], which affirmed the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial[3]. The material facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. and Larmonth for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. were of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff for allowing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I so far agree with the reasoning and conclusions of the judgment of the learned trial judge and of Mr. Justice Riddell, that I need not add more than to indicate wherein, I respectfully submit, error exists in the views expressed in the Court of Appeal.\nThese judgments accept, save in one instance, the findings of fact of the learned trial judge, but assuming all that, find the respondent discharged by appellant\u2019s accepting the price agreed for and executing an assignment by him to Beament of the shares in respect of which the damages have been assessed.\nIf that had been done by appellant with a full understanding of all the facts finally disclosed at the trial, it might well be treated either as a release of all damages or waiver of any claim thereto or of further profit in the sale of his shares, and, held, that he could not be damnified by what he assented to.\nThe radical error consists in overlooking, almost if not entirely, the fact that there was no such disclosure when this assignment was executed on the 13th of November and that it was but the formal confirma- tion of what the assignor had already been induced by the fraudulent practices of the appellant to commit himself to.\nHe had been induced by fraud to sign a document enabling the respondent as his trusted agent to sell fifteen thousand shares and to accept, as if they had been sold to some third party, three thousand dollars on account thereof.\nDisturbed by what he had heard after receiving this money as to the prudence of the transaction and its results and doubting what to do he wrote respondent to this effect.\nThe matter was, however, then represented to him by respondent on his expressing this to him, in such a way as to lead him, and as might have led a man exercising reasonable care, to believe that a sale of the whole had been made to some one in Toronto, and that one Beament was going there to see what could be done in the way of rescission as to this and other sales.\nThis Beament was a party to this latter bit of deception, but the appellant was ignorant of that as well as of the relations between Beament and respondent regarding the whole business.\nRelying upon respondent\u2019s good faith as to the scheme for rescission of the whole sale or redemption or rescue, as it were, and wholly ignorant of respondent\u2019s fraud and duplicity and also of the duplicity of Beament, he recognized Beament and the fruits of his mission in the following telegraphic correspondence which took place between them, Beament being in Toronto and appellant in Montreal.\n12.30 p.m., TORONTO, NOV. 10th, 1906.\nErnest Pitt,\nCanadian Railway Accident Insurance Co., Ottawa.\nWithout prejudice will amend contract as follows: Seven thou- sand five hundred shares at par, thirty-five hundred to be released now, and four thousand on payment at par within thirty days.\nT.A.

Beament,\nOttawa.\nGeorge F. Henderson acting for me. See him.\nERNEST PITT.\nAppellant had been induced thus by the fraud not only to agree to sell, but to compromise what up to that time he had no more than supposed possibly an imprudent or improvident sale.\nIn the entire absence of any knowledge of the fraud practised, how could such a compromise, which, in effect, was but a buying back of his shares, have been made in law as any answer to the series of frauds in this case?\nThe Court of Appeal assumes appellant not only absolutely free, but so clearly so on the 13th November that he could without risk repudiate the whole trans- action, including this compromise. If he fully knew what fraud had been practised, of course he was free to repudiate. I will in such a case even assume, not as undoubted law, but for argument\u2019s sake, he was bound to repudiate and refuse to deliver his goods by the delivery of the assignment.\nBut the appellant fell far short of possessing such vantage ground.\nHe was bound in honour, if no honest excuse at hand, to implement his bargain for a compromise with an unknown vendee not the respondent.\nThe law imposes on no man the duty to dishonour himself under pain of sacrificing his legal rights and remedies.\nBut, besides that, this man was bound by law to fulfil the contract he had entered into, as he was led to believe both from what he knew and had been a party to, and what he had been told by respondent had been done on the faith thereof.\nIt seems idle in face of all these considerations to say he was free to repudiate and refuse to carry out the compromise. He had to do that or submit to worse.\nIt seems equally idle to say he absolved by this compromise the respondent, who induced by his fraud the whole thing.\nThis is not the case of a joint tort feasor or of principal and agent wherein one having been deliberately or even improvidently released by the wronged party, that release enures to the benefit of the other. Beament was no party to the original fraud so far as we know.\nNow, is there anything that occurred at Ottawa, when the parties met on the 13th of November, to put appellant in a different position from what I have up to this assumed as the facts found of his being ignorant of the fraud practised?\nOnly two pieces of evidence came into play there and then which are relied upon to weaken this position of appellant.\nOne is the fact that respondent had indorsed a transfer of the written authority on which he acted to the man Beament.\nI fail to see how this, executed two hours before its delivery and thus virtually concurrent with the execution of the compromise assignment can help respondent.\nHe is thereby re-asserting by his acts his story of Beament going to Toronto to redeem these shares. The inference to be drawn from that act alone was that he had succeeded as to part. He was empowered thereby and by the cancellation that followed to mitigate or relieve the situation. He accomplished this and the so-called compromise by the fraudulent concealment of his gross breach of trust. How can he plead fraud for acquittance of fraud?\nHow is the respondent who stipulated for nothing, who was in appearance no party to what was being done, further relieved thereby?\nHe says now, he was Beament\u2019s agent and Beament being released he is. Who said he was Beament\u2019s agent? He never claimed in face of appellant to be anybody\u2019s agent but his.\nIf he had any relations with Beament he chose to conceal them and cannot now set them up to the detriment of the man who trusted him as a friend and agent and knew nothing then of such relationship with another. One other piece of evidence deserves notice and that is the conversation between Beament and appellant which disclosed at this meeting not the full facts, but the incorrect statement by Beament to appellant that he throughout had been the purchaser and no one in Toronto was concerned. The fact was he and respondent had been the purchasers. As the statement also included an express denial that appellant had ever been told Toronto people were concerned and an implied denial of anything leading to such belief when the appellant certainly had been (if his word accepted by the learned trial judge be true) led to believe the reverse of this, why should he accept the statement? It might well have aroused his suspicions, but, beyond that, what significance should he have attached to such a statement, coming from a man who had already failed in candour and helped, by going to Toronto to express his thoughts thence by wire, to keep up the delusion appellant laboured under.\nWas he bound to assume therefrom that respondent was either the agent of Beament or his partner in the deal? Neither was explicitly stated.\nAbove all, was he bound thereby to ignore the fact that respondent was his agent and owed to him a primary duty and to suppose that by his dealings with or through Beament to ameliorate a threatened loss, he was releasing respondent for or in respect of any obligation he was under as trustee for himself?\nI need hardly state that in my view this relationship between the parties hereto was that of principal and agent.\nThat is to my mind clear. We must look to the substance of what men are about and not merely to the form in which they put their authority for the transaction by one of business for another.\nIt is often expedient in business in order to facilitate dealings to arm an agent with the title and give him an appearance of ownership.\nThird parties are protected thereby, but the doing so does not affect the actual relations between the principal and the agent and their mutual obligations.\nI have not adverted to the information, whatever it was, derived from Beament and possessed by appellant\u2019s solicitor or the reservation he was instructed by appellant to make for the simple reason that there is no evidence of either having been communicated by the solicitor to his client or to any one. He was assured, moreover, by the solicitor his assignment and cancellation left him free as regarded the respondent.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and that the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014The facts in this case are fully stated in judgment of the learned trial judge and it is unnecessary to re-state them.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nThe only question in my view of the case which it is necessary to discuss is whether, assuming that, as against Beament, the appellant had a good defence to the demand to have the stock transferred, he has by his settlement with Beament lost his right of action against the respondent. Assuming Beament to have been liable to the appellant as the respondent\u2019s principal in respect of the respondent\u2019s misrepresentations, I am quite satisfied that, having regard to the findings of the learned trial judge, we are not entitled to conclude that the appellant knew this at the time of the settlement with Beament. The settlement, therefore, cannot be treated as involving a composition in respect of such liability and, consequently, no question can arise touching the application of the rule governing the effect of the release of one of several joint tortfeasors. The sole question is whether the damages claimed can be said to arise out of the original misrepresentation.\nThe argument is that the damages, as being the result of the appellant\u2019s own act, are not recoverable. I cannot agree with this. It was the respondent whose misconduct had placed the appellant in the situation in which he must\u2014or at all events might reasonably think he must\u2014engage in litigation with Beament or accept the settlement offered; and he cannot now complain that the appellant did not get the best possible settlement if he did not by his unreasonable conduct increase the damages. If Beament had abandoned his claim in toto the appellant would have suffered no loss; and if it had appeared that the settlement was made with full knowledge that Beament\u2019s demand must fail the appellant might be in the same position; but he was not bound to engage in doubtful litigation with Beament in order to protect the respondent. In the circumstances the loss suffered by the appellant must be regarded as the natural and normal consequence of the situation in which he had been placed by the fraud of the respondent.\nFor these reasons I am unable to agree with the judgment of the court below and would allow the appeal. Appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacCraken, Henderson, McDougall & Green.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Chrysler, Bethune & Larmonth.\n[1] 12 Ont. W.R. 824.\n[2] 11 Ont.

VII. c. 30, ss. 5 and 116\u2014Charter of Toronto Railway Co., s. 17.\nThe Ontario Railway Act of 1906 (6 Edw. VII. ch. 30) is, by sec. 5, made applicable to street railway companies incorporated by the legislature, but, by the same section, if provisions of the general and special Acts are inconsistent, those of the latter shall prevail. By sec. 116 of the general Act, a passenger on a railway train or car who refuses to pay his fare may be ejected by the conductor; and by sec. 17 of the Act incorporating the Toronto Railway Co., a passenger in such case is liable to a fine only.\nHeld, that these two provisions are not inconsistent, and the conductor of a street railway car may lawful eject therefrom a passenger who refuses to pay his fare.\nIn this case the company was held liable for damages, the passenger having been ejected from a car with unnecessary violence.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court by which the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial was maintained.\nThe plaintiff sued for damages alleging that he had been wrongfully thrown from a car of the defendant company with such violence that he was laid up for several weeks and permanently injured. A verdict in his favour for $2,500 damages was maintained in the Ontario courts, and the company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking for a verdict in their favour or a new trial.\nThe main point urged on this appeal was that there was no statutory authority for the conductor to eject a passenger for non-payment of fare, and the company was not responsible for his act in doing so without authority, because, while the \u201cOntario Railway Act of 1906\u201d provides for such expulsion, the special Act incorporating the company makes provision for a fine only in such case, and such special Act overrides the provision in the general Act.\nNesbitt E.G. and D.L. McCarthy K.C., for the appellants. At common law a passenger could not be put off a train for non-payment of fare. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Beaver[1]. The \u201cOntario Railway Act of 1906\u201d authorizes it, but the special Act incorporating the defendant company makes a different provision, and the latter must prevail.\nEvidence of what was said by passengers on the car was improperly admitted. Wright v. Doe d. Tatham[2]. See also Gilbert v. The King[3]; Garner v. Township of Stamford[4]; Beard v. London General Omnibus Co.[5]\nYoung and T.H. Lennox, for the respondent, cited Loughead v. Collingwood Shipbuilding Co.[6], and argued that even if the evidence of what was said by passengers on the car should not have been admitted, there was enough without it to support the verdict referring to Tait v. Beggs[7], and Rule 785 of the \u201cOntario Judicature Act Rules.\u201d THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014As put in the appellants\u2019 factum, the chief bone of contention between the parties is whether or not, as a matter of law, the respondent can hold the appellant corporation liable for the act of its servant, the superintendent, in putting the plaintiff off the car.\nThe answer to that question depends upon whether the 116th section of the \u201cOntario Railway Act of 1906,\u201d giving conductors and train servants of the company powers to expel without unnecessary violence passengers who refuse to pay their fares, is or is not inconsistent with section 17 of the special Act of the company which subjected passengers refusing to pay fares or leave the cars to a fine of not more than ten dollars and not to expulsion.\nAfter a good deal of consideration I have reached the conclusion that these sections can well stand together, are not necessarily inconsistent, and may be construed as complementary one to the other.\nHaving reached this conclusion adverse to the appellants I cannot, in the conflicting state of the evidence, under the findings of the jury do otherwise than confirm the judgment below and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Having due regard to the purpose and scope of the respective Acts, I fail to find any inconsistency between section 17 of the appellants\u2019 Act of incorporation and section 116 of the \u201cOntario Railway Act, 1906.\u201d Hence, both being in force at the time of the happenings out of which this action arose, the appellant and its properly authorized servants had that authority denied by it in maintaining this appeal. It, therefore, fails.\nI cannot attach importance to the other objections taken, and especially so in the absence of objections at the trial to lay a foundation for them in the courts appealed to.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014There seem to be two possible views of the effect of section 5 of the \u201cRailway Act of Ontario\u201d where you have a provision in that Act and a provision in a prior special Act dealing with the same subject-matter in diverse ways. One possible view is that in such cases the provision in the general Act is to be wholly discarded from consideration; the other is that both provisions are to be read as applicable to the undertaking governed by the special Act so far as they can stand together, and only where there is repugnancy between the two provisions and then only to the extent of such repugnancy the general Act is to be inoperative.\nI think the latter is the correct view. The question in the present case is whether section 116(1) of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d can in all respects stand with section 17 of the appellant\u2019s special Act, or whether that part of the first named enactment which authorizes the servants of the company to expel from its cars a passenger who refuses to pay his fare is necessarily displaced by the provision in the special Act dealing with the same subject. It may, of course, be argued that the special Act treats such a passenger as a trespasser and that the grant of the special remedy there provided negatives the existence of the remedy with which the common law would arm the company as against any person who, without a right to be there, should persist in remaining on its cars\u2014in short, that resort to expulsion is prohibited. This appears, however, a strained and artificial reading of the section. The true account of the matter seems rather to be that the legislature has not in the special Act declared the passenger refusing to pay his fare and refusing to leave a trespasser for all purposes, but in such circumstances has given the company one remedy and has not given another. If this be the correct view of the section there is clearly no repugnancy and nothing to prevent the operation of both sections.\nOn the other points argued I agree with the judgment of Magee J., and there is no occasion to add anything to what he has said.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendants appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed their appeal from the judgment of a Divisional Court, upholding a verdict for the plaintiff for $2,500.\nThe action was brought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff, as he alleges, either through his having been unwarrantably ejected from a street car by a divisional superintendent of the defendant company, or because of undue violence in his removal, if the removal itself was justifiable. To this claim, under a plea of \u201cnot guilty by statute,\u201d the defendants make several answers:\n(a) They deny that the plaintiff was in fact ejected by their superintendent and say that he fell from the car in lunging forward to strike that official;\n(b) They assert that if the plaintiff was, as he alleges, ejected merely for refusal to pay fare, the company had no power to forcibly expel a passenger for this cause and, therefore, is not liable for the illegal act of its official, which it did not and could not authorize;\n(c) They say that if the company has the right to eject a passenger who refuses to pay fare the superintendent was not charged with the execution of any such duty and that they are, therefore, not answerable;\n(d) They assert that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct upon the car had been such that he had become a nuisance and that his removal was, upon this ground, justified;\n(e) They deny that any undue or unnecessary violence was used in removing the plaintiff, and say that, if he was in fact ejected, his injuries are attributable to his own violent and improper resistance.\nUpon this statement it is apparent that there were several issues of fact and law presented, and it is to be regretted that the learned trial judge did not, instead of taking a general verdict, submit to the jury a series of questions, each covering one of the issues of fact to be determined. It would have then been comparatively easy to ascertain what view of the facts was taken by the jury and upon what findings they based their verdict.\nThat the plaintiff was, in fact, seriously injured is not disputed and, in this court, the verdict has not been attacked as excessive.\nUpon the issue whether the plaintiff fell from the car because he lost his balance while striking at the superintendent or whether he was pulled or thrown from the car by the latter there was direct conflict of testimony. This question was explicitly put to the jury in the learned judge\u2019s charge and the verdict necessarily implies a finding upon it in the plaintiff\u2019s favour which, upon the evidence, cannot be disturbed. It would certainly have been more satisfactory had the question whether there was or was not excessive force used in removing the plaintiff been presented to the jury as a distinct issue. They were not explicitly told that, if conditions existed which in fact and in law warranted the plaintiff\u2019s removal, a verdict against the company would be justified only if they should find that there had been improper violence on the part of the superintendent and that this was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\nBut the conflict in testimony as to what took place immediately before the plaintiff was thrown to the ground is very pointed\u2014so much so that the learned trial judge was impelled to say,\nthere has been false swearing in this case, been testimony given that is not true, and not true to the knowledge of those persons who have given it.\nThe plaintiff had sworn that he was pushed or pulled violently to the ground by the superintendent; the superintendent had denied that the plaintiff had been pushed or pulled at all. The learned judge told the jury that\nif what the plaintiff says is true, then this act was something that Argue (the superintendent) ought not to have done in the exercise of his duty, and it was an abuse of the plaintiff pushing him violently in that way and, in my opinion, if that is the true story, the defendants are liable in this action.\nAgain he said:\nTechnically, Mr. Argue admitted that he was guilty of an assault upon this plaintiff; he caught him by the coat, and, unless he can justify that that would be an assault so far as the mere technical offence is concerned, because an assault is defined as an attempt to do corporal injury to another coupled with present ability, or any act or gesture from which an intention to commit a battery may be implied is an assault if the person is near enough to strike. While that is technically an assault, that is not what this action was brought for. If he had simply taken him by the coat or simply pulled him down, it would not be an action such as this, or to the same extent at all events in damages. The serious assault that is complained of is what the plaintiff and his witness say, and that is what is denied, and so we are to deal with the case on its merits, without dealing with it merely as a matter of law as to what may be an assault or not.\nAnd again:\nWas this assault committed by the defendants in the way described by the plaintiff and his witness, or was it as described by the officers and men on the part of defendants? If the latter, there is no liability; if in the way described by the plaintiff, then you may find a verdict for the plaintiff, if you believe the evidence.\nAnd again:\nHe (the plaintiff) says * * * \u201cyou (the superintendent) then got up on the car and you gave me a violent push, and it is from that violent push you gave me that my injuries have resulted.\nAlthough these passages in the charge are unfortunately somewhat closely connected with discussion of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged misconduct, and of the question whether it amounted to a cause justifying his removal, and also with the issue as to whether he was, in fact, removed by the superintendent or whether he fell from the car because he lost his balance in an effort to strike the superintendent, looking at the charge as a whole it is not possible to say that the attention of the jury was not directed to the question whether there had been excessive violence in removing the plaintiff.\nThe conditions which would have justified the removal of the plaintiff (as the case was presented to the jury), might be either refusal to pay fare or misconduct of the plaintiff such that he had become a nuisance. His misconduct might be aggravated by his refusal to pay fare and the manner of such refusal.\nDid the plaintiff refuse to pay his fare? The officials of the company say that he did emphatically refuse. He says that he merely declined to pay until the car should become less crowded, when he might more conveniently reach his pocket. The fare was payable upon his entering the car. That the superintendent was justified in treating the plaintiff as a person who had refused to pay his fare is, I think, upon the evidence incontrovertible. His declining to pay when called upon was, in my opinion, in law a refusal to pay. The learned trial judge in effect told the jury that, although the demand for payment of fare may, in the circumstances, have been rash, the plaintiff, according to his own story, did \u201crefuse point blank to pay\u201d his fare. It cannot be assumed that the jury found against this direction.\nOn the issue of misconduct the evidence is contradictory. The plaintiff says he was sober and inoffensive; the defendants\u2019 witnesses say he was intoxicated, abusive and profane. This issue was fairly presented to the jury. The difficulty is to know how they found upon it. Does their verdict mean that the plaintiff was not a nuisance, and that his removal on this ground would have been unjustifiable; or have they merely found that although he had been such a nuisance as warranted his removal, there was an undue use of force and violence in expelling him; or have they found in the plaintiff\u2019s favour upon both these questions?\nIf the element of non-payment of fare were eliminated it would not be very material to know upon what ground the jury proceeded, because the verdict for the plaintiff would necessarily imply that the jury had found for him, if not upon both questions, upon one or the other; and either finding would suffice to support the verdict. But, upon a direction that refusal to pay fare would justify removal from the car and a direction or finding that such refusal had been shewn, a finding in the plaintiff\u2019s favour on the issue as to misconduct would not suffice to sustain the verdict. In that view of the case a finding that there was excessive force in removing him would be indispensable.\nAfter careful consideration I have reached the conclusion that the verdict, in the light of the charge read as a whole, involved a finding that the superintendent used unnecessary and excessive force in expelling the plaintiff from the car and that this was the cause of his injuries. The learned judge in effect directed the jury that, as a matter of law, the defendant company had the right to expel for refusal to pay fare; his presentation of the case appears to proceed upon this view; he told them, at least impliedly, that the real issue for them to determine was whether the removal being otherwise justifiable it was or was not accompanied by undue violence.\nBut the defendant company maintains that it has no power to expel a passenger for mere refusal to pay fare. The Act of incorporation of the company (55 Vict. ch. 99 (Ont.)), which also ratifies their contract with the city, provides, in section 17, as follows:\nThe fare of each passenger shall be due and payable on entering the car or other conveyance of the company, and any passenger refusing to pay the fare demanded by the conductor or driver, and refusing to quit the car or other conveyance when requested so to do shall be liable to a fine of not more than ten dollars besides costs. And the same shall be recoverable before any justice of the peace.\nThe contract itself does not contain this provision.\nIn 1906, the Legislature of Ontario passed a general railway Act (6 Edw. VII. ch. 30). This Act expressly defines the field of its application. By section 3, it is provided that it shall apply when so expressed to street railways within the legislative authority of the Legislature of Ontario * * * and shall be incorporated and construed as one Act with the special Act, subject as herein provided.\nSection 5 reads as follows:\nIf in any special Act heretofore passed by the Legislature it is enacted that any provision of the \u201cRailway Act of Ontario,\u201d or of the \u201cElectric Railway Act,\u201d or of the \u201cStreet Railway Act\u201d in force at the time of the passing of such special Act is excepted from incorporation therewith, or if the application of any such provision is, by such special Act, extended, limited or qualified, the corresponding provision of this Act shall be taken to be excepted, extended, limited or qualified in like manner; and, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act or the special Act, this Act shall apply to every railway company incorporated under a special Act or any public Act of this province and the sections expressly made applicable \u2018 shall apply to every street railway company so incorporated; but, where the provisions of the special Act and the provisions of this Act are inconsistent, the special Act shall be taken to override the provisions of this Act, so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act.\nSection 116 of the \u201cRailway Act of 1906\u201d is as follows:\n116 (1). The fare and toll shall be due and payable by every passenger on entering the car or other conveyance, and every passenger who refuses to pay may, by the conductor of the train and the train servants of the company, be expelled from and put off the car with his baggage at any usual stopping place, or near any dwelling house, as the conductor elects, the conductor first stopping the train and using no unnecessary force.\n(2) This section shall apply to street railways.\nCounsel for the plaintiff maintained that this provision of the general \u201cRailway Act\u201d applies to the Toronto Street Railway. Mr. McCarthy contended that, because section 116 of the general Act deals with a subject already dealt with in the company\u2019s special Act, and also because it is, as he said, inconsistent with section 17 of the special Act, it does not apply to his clients.\nNo doubt, as a general rule, where a particular matter is dealt with by a special Act, the application of the provisions of a general Act dealing with the same matter is excluded. Maxwell on Statutes (3 ed.), pp. 242-3. But this rule does not apply where it appears on the face of the general Act that\nthe attention of the legislature has been turned to the earlier special Act, and that it intended to embrace the special cases within the general Act. Maxwell on Statutes (3 ed.), p. 250.\nIt is quite apparent that, when enacting the \u201cRailway Act of 1906,\u201d the legislature had in mind the fact that a number of the railways to be affected had special Acts. It is also apparent that it was intended that, although certain subjects had been dealt with by such special Acts, the provisions of the general Act dealing with the same subjects should apply to the companies governed by such special Acts, unless and except in so far as the provisions of the general Act are inconsistent with those of the special Acts, in which case \u201cthe special Act shall be taken to override the provisions\u201d of the general Act, but only \u201cso far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act.\u201d\nIt is not enough to exclude the application of the general Act that it deals somewhat differently with the same subject-matter. It is not \u201cinconsistent\u201d unless the two provisions cannot stand together.\nIt is obvious to inquire: Where is the inconsistency if both may stand together and both operate without either interfering with the other. Tabernacle Permanent Building Society v. Knight[8], at p. 302, per Halsbury L.C.\nI think the test is whether you can read the provisions of the later Act into the earlier without any conflict between the two. (Ibid., per Lord Herschell, at p. 306.)\nAs put by Fry L.J., in the same case[9]:\nSection 24 provides that the Act shall apply to every arbitration under any Act passed before the commencement of this Act, \u201cas if the arbitration were pursuant to a submission, except in so far as this Act is inconsistent with the Act regulating the arbitration, or with any rules or procedure authorized or recognized by that Act.\u201d Now, what is the meaning of \u201cinconsistent with the Act regulating the arbitration?\u201d Section 19 creates, no doubt, an obligation to state a case when directed by the court or a judge, and, of course, in one sense, the presence of the obligation to state a case is inconsistent with the absence of such obligation. Therefore, it may be argued that, where under a previous Act there was no obligation to state a case, while under a later Act such an obligation is created, there is an inconsistency between the Acts. But that is not, in my view, the real meaning of the \u201cinconsistency\u201d referred to in section 24. I think there must be an inconsistency of this kind, viz., that the obligation to state a special case would be so at variance with the machinery and with the mode of procedure indicated by the previous Act, that, if that obligation were added, the machinery of the previous Act would not work.\nSo here the existence of the right of expulsion is in a sense inconsistent with the absence of such a right; but the existence of the right of expulsion as an additional remedy is not so at variance with the other remedy conferred by the special Act that the existence of this added right would prevent resort being had to the other remedy. To quote Lord Watson:\nIn my opinion the object of the legislature was to add to the remedies,\nand, I may add, to supplement what might, in the case of a passenger refusing to give his name, or of his giving a false name, be found a totally inadequate remedy, by providing another which would be always available and efficacious.\nUnless the existence of the right conferred by the general Act would render it impracticable to carry out the provision of the special Act there is not, in my opinion, such an inconsistency as is referred to in section 5 of the general \u201cRailway Act of Ontario.\u201d\nHaving regard to the pointed and explicit provisions of sections 3 and 5 of that Act, the case in the English courts to which I have referred\u2014although it deals not with a special Act and a general Act, but with two general Acts, one of which is of less general application than the other\u2014is, I think, clearly in point and an authority against the contention that section 116 of the general \u201cRailway Act of 1906\u201d is inconsistent with section 17 of the defendants\u2019 special Act in the sense in which the word \u201cinconsistent\u201d is used in section 5 of the general railway Act.\nThe wording of section 116 is similar to that of the corresponding section of the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d from which it was, no doubt, taken. Its provisions as to the passenger\u2019s baggage and that he must be put off at a regular stopping place or near a dwelling house seem somewhat incongruous when the section is applied to street railways in cities and towns. But the Act applies to suburban and interurban railways as well; and, subject to the question of inconsistency, the application of this section to all street railways is concluded by its second sub-section.\nIt follows that at the time when the plaintiff was put off the company\u2019s car it had the right to expel him as a passenger who had refused to pay fare.\nBut, if it had not that right, its right to expel for misconduct amounting to a nuisance was not questioned at bar. Although no particular authority was referred to as conferring this right, its existence seems essential to the operation of a railway, and was not challenged by Mr. McCarthy. It was stated by divisional superintendent Argue, in his evidence, that the rules of a company authorize a conductor or motorman to put a passenger off if he is a nuisance. This evidence appears to have been accepted by both parties as a correct statement of the effect of the rules which were not themselves in evidence. It is this right which the superintendent says he, in fact, exercised. I think that in these circumstances, notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he was removed merely for refusal to pay fare, the defendants should not now be heard to say that he was not put off in the exercise of the power which they admittedly had to expel for misconduct. The superintendent says that he believed he had not the power to put the plaintiff off for refusal to pay fare and that he would not have put him off had he not been misconducting himself. Elsewhere he says he would not have put him off as a nuisance had he paid his fare. Upon this evidence it may well be that the superintendent regarded the plaintiff\u2019s manner of refusal to pay merely as part of or an aggravation of his misconduct; and it may be that it was so in fact. But, in the view which I take that the defendant company, under the \u201cRailway Act of 1906,\u201d had the right to expel a passenger for mere refusal to pay fare, it is unnecessary to pursue this question further. Excessive violence, which, as I have stated, I think the jury must be taken to have found, suffices to support the verdict whether the plaintiff was put off as a nuisance or for refusal to pay fare.\nThen it is said in the appellants\u2019 factum, quoting the language of Osler J.A., in Coll v. Toronto Railway Co.[10], at page 61, that a divisional superintendent is not an official who has\nauthority to remove passengers or others and, therefore, his act in pushing the plaintiff off the car was not of a class of acts entrusted to his discretion to perform and so not an act done in the excessive or erroneous execution of a lawful authority. The conductor has the right to expel whether for non-payment of fare or misconduct amounting to a nuisance. The divisional superintendent was his superior officer to whom the conductor referred his difficulty with the plaintiff. I agree with Magee J. that there was in these facts enough to raise a presumption that it was within the scope of the superintendent\u2019s authority to remove the plaintiff from the car and also to warrant the jury\nin assuming that what he did was at the request of the conductor who had brought him and stood by.\nThis distinguishes the present case from Coll v. The Toronto Railway Co.10 That the superintendent\u2019s purpose was to serve his employers, the defendants, is, upon the evidence, indisputable. The act being one which the company itself could legally do, it cannot escape responsibility therefor.\nI also agree that it is extremely improbable that the result of the trial was affected by the admission of evidence of exclamations or statements of passengers made in the presence of the superintendent and during or immediately following the occurrence in which the plaintiff was injured. No objection was taken at the trial to the allusion by the learned trial judge to this evidence in his charge. It is, I think, too late to raise such an objection upon an appeal; and it is not at all clear, assuming the inadmissibility of the evidence, that any substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned within the meaning of the Ontario Consolidated Rule, No. 785. I am by no means satisfied that the evidence complained of was not in fact admissible as part of the res gest\u0153. See Chamberlayne\u2019s Best on Evidence (1908), pp. 448\u20119; Taylor on Evi- dence (10 ed.), 583; Phipson on Evidence (3 ed.), pp. 47-8. But this question it is unnecessary to determine.\nThe defendants have come here largely on points not taken at the trial. The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal for Ontario have, I think, correctly found them not entitled to a new trial as a matter of right. Those courts had power to direct a new trial as a matter of discretion. If they were not asked to exercise that power, or if, having been asked, they refused, this court should not, in my opinion, now exercise any discretion which it may have to interfere.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lennox & Lennox.\n[1] 22 Can.

VII. ch. 24) the Government agreed to implement its guarantee, in such manner as might be agreed upon, so as to make the proceeds of said bonds a sum equal to 75% of such cost of construction.\nHeld, that this second contract only imposed upon the Government the liability of guaranteeing bonds, the proceeds of which would produce a defined amount and not that of supplying, in cash or its equivalent, any deficiency there might be between the proceeds of the bonds and' the said 75 %.\nSPECIAL CASE referred by the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration.\nBy 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71 a contract between the Government of Canada and representatives of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. (which was incorporated in the same session) was confirmed and printed as a schedule to the Act. Section 28 of said contract is as follows:\n\"28. For the purpose of aiding the company in the construction of the Western Division, the Government shall guarantee payment of the principal and interest of an issue of bonds to be made by the company for a principal amount equal to seventy-five per centum of the cost of construction of the said division, as defined and ascertained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph eighteen hereof; but such principal amount shall not, in any case, exceed thirteen thousand dollars per mile of the mileage of the prairie section, nor thirty thousand dollars per mile of the mileage of the mountain section, although seventy-five per centum of such cost of construction may have exceeded the said respective sums per mile.\"\nIn the following year a further contract was entered into confirmed by 4 Edw. VII. ch. 24, and printed as a schedule thereto. By section 5 of such contract it is provided that\n\"Notwithstanding anything in the said contract mentioned above contained, the Government may and shall, preserving always the proportions in the said contract provided as between the prairie and mountain sections of the Western division, implement for the purposes and subject otherwise to the provisions of the said contract, its guarantee of the bonds of the company to be issued for the cost of construction of the said Western division, in such manner as may be agreed upon, so as to make the proceeds of the said bonds so to be guaranteed a sum equal to seventy-five (75) per centum of the cost of construction of the Western division ascertained as provided in the said contract, but not exceeding in respect of the prairie section, thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000) per mile.\"\nThe contracting parties not being able to agree on the manner in which the Government was to implement its guarantee of bonds under this second contract the questions were submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada for an opinion thereon in the following manner:\n\"Certified copy of a report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 22nd November, 1909.\n\"On a memorandum dated 5th November, 1909, from the Minister of Justice, submitting\u2014with reference to the agreement of 29th July, 1903, set forth in the schedule to the \"National Transcontinental Rail-way Act\" (3 Edw.

VII. ch. 71, schedule), but not exceeding in respect of the prairie section thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000) per mile,' and differences having arisen as to the true interpretation of the fifth clause of the said agreement of 18th February, 1904, it has been agreed between Your Excellency's Government and the company that the questions thus arising between the Government and the company may be conveniently determined by means of a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exercise of the powers vested in Your Excellency in Council under the 'Supreme Court Act,' subject to appeal.\n\"The Minister having regard to the facts hereinbefore stated, therefore, recommends that the following questions be referred by Your Excellency in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of section 60 of the 'Supreme Court Act,' viz:\n\"(a) Is the Government, in the absence of an agreement between the Government and the company as to the manner of the implementing, liable, upon the true construction of the said fifth clause of the agreement of 18th February, 1904, to implement its guaranty of the bonds of the company so issued or to be issued for the cost of construction of the said Western division and guaranteed or to be guaranteed by the Government pursuant to the said agreement of 29th July, 1903, as amended by the agreement of 18th February, 1904, so as to make the proceeds of the said bonds so guaranteed or to be guaranteed 'a sum equal to seventy-five per cent. of the cost of construction of the Western division ascertained as provided in the said contract, but not exceeding in respect of the prairie section thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000) per mile?'\n\"(b) Would the obligation of the Government under the said fifth clause of the agreement of 18th February, 1904, be satisfied by the guaranteeing of additional bonds of the company to be issued for the cost of construction of the said Western division to an amount which will realize upon sale a sum of money sufficient to make the said proceeds so equivalent?\u201d(c) Would the obligation of the Government under the said fifth clause be satisfied by the guaranteeing of the bonds of the company to be issued for the cost of construction of the said Western division, in such manner as may be agreed upon, to such an amount as will produce a sum sufficient to make the proceeds of all the bonds of the company issued or to be issued for the cost of construction of the said Western division and guaranteed or to be guaranteed by the Government, including such additional bonds as may be guaranteed for the purpose of discharging any obligation of the Government arising under the said fifth clause, a sum equivalent as aforesaid?\n\"(d) Is the Government bound upon the true construction of the said fifth clause of the agreement of 18th February, 1904, to provide and pay to the company a sum of money which, when added to the proceeds of the bonds of the company issued or to be issued for the cost of construction of the said Western division, and guaranteed by the Government pursuant to the authority of the said agreement of 29th July, 1903, as amended by the said agreement of 18th February, 1904, will aggregate a sum equal to seventy-five per centum of the cost of construction of the Western division ascertained as provided in the said agreement of 29th July, 1903, but not exceeding in respect of the prairie section thirteen thousand dollars (|13,000) per mile?\n\"(e) If so, will the Government be entitled as guarantor to call upon the company, as being primarily liable to pay for the construction of the said Western division, for reimbursement in respect of such sum of money so provided and paid, and will such sum fall within or be covered by the security provided for by paragraph 35 (a) of the agreement of 29th July, 1903 (3 Edw. VII. ch. 71, schedule)? \"(f) Is it competent to the Government and the company to agree that the implementing for the purpose of the said fifth clause shall be by way of guarantee by the Government of additional bonds of the company, and if it be so agreed, would the obligation of the Government be satisfied by the guaranteeing of such additional bonds as may be agreed upon between the Government and the company?\n\"(g) Does the said fifth clause of the agreement of 18th February, 1904, upon its true construction, require the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, for the purpose of enabling the Government to carry out the implementing of its guaranty of the bonds referred to in said clause, to undertake any further obligation by way of an additional issue of bonds otherwise; or is it intended that the Government shall without any further obligation being imposed upon the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, implement its guaranty of the bonds referred to in the said clause so as to make the proceeds of the said bonds so to be guaranteed a sum equal to seventy-five per centum of the cost of construction of the Western division, ascertained as provided in the agreement of 29th July, 1903, but not exceeding in respect of the prairie section thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000) a mile?\n\"The Committee submit the same for approval.\"\n\"RODOLPHE BOUDREAU,\"\n\"Clerk of the Privy Council.\"\nShepley K.C., for the Government of Canada.\nLafleur K.C. and Biggar K.C., for the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nThe court answered the questions submitted as follows: Question\n(a).\nAnswer\nNo.\n\"\n(b).\n\"\nYes.\n\"\n(c).\n\"\nYes.\n\"\n(d).\n\"\nNo.\n\"\n(e).\nThe answers to the previous questions make it unnecessary to give any answer to this question.\n\"\n(f).\nAnswer\nYes.\n\"\n(g).\n\"\nYes to first part; no to second.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would qualify the answer to the first part of question \"g\" by adding thereto these words: \"If the company desires to take advantage of the provisions of the agreement of 1904 as to the implementing of the Government guarantee;\"\nThe following reasons were given for the categorical answers to said questions.\nThe Court.\u2014It is desirable, perhaps necessary, that a few words should be added to the categorical answers given by the court to the series of questions put to it upon the true construction of the contracts made between His Majesty and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway of 29th July, 1903, and 18th February, 1904, respectively.\nThe keynote to the answers to these questions is to be found in the determination whether or not the additional liability assumed by the Government under the 5th clause of the amended agreement of 1904 remained a secondary liability by way of guarantee of bonds to be issued by the G. T. Pacific Railway Company sufficient in character and amount to realize 75% of the cost of construction of the Western division ascertained as provided in said contract, but not exceeding in respect of the prairie section $13,000 per mile, or whether such additional liability was of a primary character and obliged the Government to make up in cash or its equivalent outside of the guaranteed bonds any deficiency that might arise between the proceeds of the bonds and the 75% of the cost of the railway.\nWe had no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the extended liability the Government agreed to assume by the agreement of 1904 was a secondary liability only and not a primary one. The result of such a holding was, of course, that the only liability of the Government was to guarantee bonds of the company the proceeds of which would produce a defined amount.\nBut it was evident that much would depend upon the character of the bonds which the parties to the contract should eventually agree upon issuing.\nThe time for payment and the rate of interest they should bear would largely govern and determine the proceeds they would realize.\nThese and other details of the form and character of the bonds were left to mutual agreement, and such an agreement must under the terms of the contract be come to before the Government obligation became exigible.\nThese remarks will explain the answers to some of the questions which without them might be held to be ambiguous.\nMr. Justice Idington desires to add to the foregoing, in which all the members of the court agree, the following paragraph for himself:\nWhilst agreeing in the proposition of the judgment of the court that the obligation of the Crown was that of guarantor, and he proceeds on such assumption, he does not understand the Crown limited absolutely to the device of bonds to make good something which is of necessity to be the subject-matter of future agreement and conceivably may be more advantageous for both parties than that, but in any case subject to the usual constitutional limitations.\n",

Rep. 183) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], reversing, in part, the judgment of Martin J., at the trial.\nThe circumstances of the case, so far as they are material to the issues on the present appeal, are stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff, now reported.\nJ. Travers Lewis K.C. and Smellie, for the appellant.\nS. S. Taylor K.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Idington. DAVIES J. agreed with Duff J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014If we try to find and understand what the parties concerned in these apparently ambiguous writings submitted for our interpretation were about when signing same that apparent ambiguity will disappear and any need for worrying over a multitude of irrelevant points of law submitted to us will also disappear.\nSmith, when he mortgaged his interest, never intended to prejudice or jeopardize respondents' interests, or rights, or reasonable expectations, nor did appellant seek to acquire more than Smith within these limits desired to give him.\nConfessedly one-third of the whole property in question was an inaccurate definition of Smith's interest. Appellant's counsel claims it was, roughly speaking, one-third. I agree the share of Smith might, at the then stage in the manifold process of handling which the property had to go through, with approximate correctness be referred to as one-third; but clearly that would not have been mathematically correct, and, when we read further and look into the whole scope of the documents, we find it expressly defined as only \"all the interest of the mortgagor,\" Smith, that was being dealt with.\nWhen he called it one-third thus limited, or anything less than the whole, his language told any one trying to understand his meaning that he owned no more than what has been adjudged him and, through him, the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014There are two questions. The material facts bearing on the first are these. Smith being the lessee of the \"Payne Mine,\" mill and appurtenances, at Sandon, B.C., under terms entitling him to work the mine, but prohibiting sub-letting, entered into an arrangement with the respondent for working one of the levels, the terms of which (although the whole of them are not expressly stated) may be inferred with sufficient certainty from the facts in evidence. After Forrest had commenced work under this arrangement a document was signed, but on its face it is plain that it does not state the whole of the bargain. From this document, however, and the other evidence, it is quite clear that the respondent was, during the currency of the arrangement, to mine the fifth level and to have the ore reduced at the concentrator; that Smith was then to ship the ore to the smelter, and that the proceeds (which were to be payable to Smith) were to be distributed in the shares mentioned by the trial judge, Smith being beneficially entitled to five per cent, of the net returns. Forrest was to pay all expenses and to be responsible for all damage caused by his operations under the agreement.\nThe question is whether, under this agreement, the respondent acquired any interest legal or equitable in the ore mined under it. It seems very clear that from the time the ore should be broken down until the concentrates should be delivered to Smith for shipment to the smelter\u2014while, that is to say, the respondent was handling it as required by the terms of the contract\u2014the ore was to be in the possession and under the control of the respondent; so much would be necessary to enable him to perform his agreement. It is also undisputed that the effect of the agreement was to vest in the respondent the right to have the concentrates shipped to the smelter and to have a specific share of the proceeds paid out to him. If the parties had agreed that the respondent should ship the concentrates in his own name and receive the proceeds himself, nobody could doubt that he must have been regarded in equity as having a specific interest in the concentrates themselves lying in the cars at the smelter or at the mill; or in the ore in his possession in the tramway or in the workings which he was both entitled and bound to have reduced to concentrates. Can it then make the slightest difference that the duty of shipping the concentrates is imposed upon the appellant and that the shipments were to be made in his name and the proceeds paid to him? It can make no difference because the appellant's custody of the concentrates as of the proceeds is merely that of a trustee for the purpose of carrying out the stipulation of the agreement.\nIt is not necessary to hold that the parties became, at law, tenants in common of the ore, and I am inclined to think they were not; but it is quite clear, I think, that, apart from the legal possession the respondent acquired under the agreement an equitable interest in the ore, which (with the performance of his obligations under the agreement) ripened into the beneficial ownership of an undivided share equivalent to seventy-eight per cent, of it. In truth, the substance of the transaction was that the respondent was to mine the fifth level for his own benefit, paying the appellant a royalty equivalent to five per cent, of the net smelter returns, together with royalties payable to the owner and to the Crown. The stipulation that these returns were to be made to Smith himself was probably inserted to satisfy the provisions of his lease, and ought not to be regarded as affecting the substan tial nature of the bargain. When it is possible to do so, a court of justice ought to attribute to the ordinary transactions of business such a legal character as will effectuate, and not such as will frustrate, the real intentions of the parties to them.\nThe next question is whether the appellant's bill of sale is to prevail over respondent's interest. The appellant'contends that it does and puts his contention on two grounds. First, that the agreement between Smith and the respondent being an unregistered bill of sale must be postponed to the appellant's registered bill of sale, and secondly, that the appellant, a purchaser for value without notice, having the legal estate, is entitled to priority over the respondent who has only an equitable interest.\nAs to the second ground, the defence is not pleaded and was not, I think, really set up at the trial; but at all events I agree with Clement J., that not only has the appellant not satisfied the onus upon him to prove the defence of purchase for value without notice, but that the evidence clearly shews he had constructive notice of the arrangement between Smith and the respondent.\nAs to the first, it seems disputable on several grounds; but it will not be necessary to refer to more than one objection which I think is conclusive.\nThe \"Bills of Sale Act\" of British Columbia was, as originally enacted in 1873, (in all respects material here), a transcript of the English \"Bills of Sale Act\" of 1854. The latter Act was, by a Divisional Court in Brantom v. Griffits[2], held not to apply to any assurance of goods which at the time of the execution of the assurance should not be in such a state as to be \"capable of complete transfer by delivery.\" This view was based upon the definition of \"personal chattels\" contained in the Act. Whether this view of these words\u2014having regard to an expression of opinion to the opposite effect, not required for the decision of the case, by Lord Chelmsford in Holroyd v. Marshall[3]\u2014 is that which one would take if construing for the first time the provision in which they are contained, we need not, I think, consider. The British Columbia Act of 1873 was re-enacted in consolidations of 1888, 1897 and 1905, and the definition of \"personal chattels\" has throughout remained unchanged in any material particular; nor is there any change in any other provision of the Act which affects the application of this decision. The second section of the Act of 1905, which at first sight might appear to have some bearing upon the point, really has none; it is indeed a reproduction of the third section of the English Act of 1878, which was said by Lord Macnaghten in Thomas v. Kelly[4], at page 519, not to apply to assignments of \"future or after-acquired chattels.\" There is further the opinion of Lord Macnaghten on the last mentioned case, at pages 518 and 519, that the construction adopted in Brantom v. Griffits[5] ought to be regarded as having been accepted by Parliament in passing the Act of 1878.\nSuch being the course of judicial opinion and the legislative action, I think we must assume that the view expressed in Brantom v. Griffits(3) has been adopted by the Legislature of British Columbia, and hold that the agreement in question relating to ore to be mined in the future, is not within the class of assurances contemplated by the legislature in passing the \"Bills of Sale Act.\"\nANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Duff I am of the opinion that the document under which the respondent claims was not a bill of sale requiring registration under the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act\" in order to render it valid or to preserve its priority. I also agree that the interest acquired by the respondent under that document in the ore in question was such that he could not be deprived of it by a subsequent transfer, sale or mortgage of such ore, though by formal instrument duly registered, to a person affected with notice of his interest. That the appellant had notice of that interest, if not actual at least constructive, the evidence sufficiently establishes.\nI am therefore of opinion that the defendant's appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Robert Wetmore Hanington.\nSolicitor for the respondents: S.

VII. c. 62, ss. 6 and 27.\nAn action by a ratepayer of the City of Montreal to compel the members of the finance committee of the city council to reimburse the city for moneys which it was alleged they authorized to be illegally expended and asking for their disqualification under section 338 of the \"City Charter\" is not a proceeding in quo warranto under the provisions of articles 987 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nBy section 334 of the charter (3 Edw. VII. ch. 62, sec. 27) the city council of Montreal must at the end of each year appropriate the revenues of the city for the services during the coming year, including a reserve of five per cent, of the total revenues, three per cent, of which is to provide for unforeseen expenses. By section 42 of the charter, as amended by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 62, sec. 6, the finance committee of the council must consider all recommendations involving the expenditure of money, unless an appropriation has been already voted for the purpose. An item of unforeseen expenditure came before the council and was passed and sent to the finance committee, which directed the city treasurer to pay the amount, and it was paid accordingly.\nHeld, the Chief Justice and Girouard J. contra, that the reserve of the two per cent. for unforeseen expenses was not an appropriation of the amount so directed to be paid. Held, also, the Chief Justice and Girouard J. dissenting, that under the provisions of the charter it is essential that every recommendation for the payment of money, where there has been no previous appropriation for the payment to be made, must receive the consideration of the finance committee and be sanctioned or rejected by that committee before being finally acted upon by the council. That any such payment made without this formality, even when made bon\u00e2 fide and though, in fact, sanctioned by the finance committee after it had been finally dealt with by the council, and though the city suffered no prejudice in consequence of such payment, is an illegal expenditure and involves the consequences provided in such cases by the 338th section of the \"City Charter.\"\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, and restoring the judgment of Charbonneau J., at the trial in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the petitioner's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe nature of the action and the questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nOn the appeal coming on for hearing,\nAtwater K.C. for the respondents moved to quash the appeal on the grounds that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to entertain appeals in cases, such as the present, where the proceedings taken were in the nature of quo warranto and involved merely the liability to a fine of $400, under the statute; that the case could not be ruled by the demand for the reimbursement of $3,800 to the city as the City of Montreal was not a party in the cause, and that there was misjoinder by the petitioner of separate causes of action in seeking this pecuniary condemnation. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant opposed the motion on the grounds that the proceeding taken was authorized by section 338 of the \"City Charter\"; that the amount now in controversy exceeded $2,000, and that, in any event, the Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to review an improper exercise of jurisdiction by the Court of King's Bench if any such had taken place in that court by the decision complained of. Alternatively it was asked that the City of Montreal should be now added as a party to the cause on the present appeal.\nThe Court reserved consideration of the question as to its jurisdiction and directed that, in the meantime, the hearing on the merits of the appeal should proceed.\nLafleur K.C. and C. Rodier were heard for the appellant.\nAtwater K.C. and Ethier K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014By the judgment of the Court of Review which, on this appeal, we are asked to restore, the seven defendants, that is to say, the entire finance committee of the Montreal City Council, are deprived of their offices, condemned jointly and severally to pay a sum of $3,809.40 and disqualified for re-election as aldermen for a period of two years from the date of that judgment, 17th April, 1909. (The statute says the disqualification is to run from the date of the occurrences complained of, i.e., May, 1908.) The judges of the three provincial courts, nine in number, all agree that, by the irregularities which have resulted in such serious consequences to them, the defendants derived neither benefit, profit nor advantage; that no corrupt, fraudulent or indirect motive can be attributed to them, nor is it alleged that any injustice has been caused or wrong done, nor that any result different from what has occurred would have followed a literal compliance with the statute, even if we adopt the construction put upon it by the appellant. From this conclusion I understand that this court does not dissent. The majority here, however, are of opinion that the unanimous judgment of the provincial court of appeal must be reversed and the majority judgment of the Court of Review, which reversed the trial judge, must be restored. With great respect, however, it is impossible for me to concur.\nIt is important to extract from the record the substance of the charge made against the defendants and to set down with some minuteness, in the order of their occurrence, each step in the proceedings of the council and committee out of which this action arose. To do so may enable us more clearly to understand in what respect, if at all, the defendants have departed from the regulations made for their guidance in the City Charter, by-laws and rules of council, and to appreciate the legal consequences which result from the infringement of these regulations, if they have been infringed.\nIn substance, the plaintiff alleges that in May and July, 1908, the defendants, as members of the finance committee of the Montreal City Council, authorized an expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal of that committee and in consequence incurred the pecuniary liability and are subject to the disqualifications enacted by section 338 of the municipal charter, which reads as follows:\nEvery member of the council who authorizes either verbally, by writing, by his vote, or tacitly, any expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal of the council or any committee, shall be held personally liable therefor, and shall thereby become disqualified as a member of the council and shall also be \"disqualified for re-election as alderman for a period of two years thereafter.\nThe alleged illegal expenditure was made under the following circumstances:\nOn the 18th of May, 1908, a letter was submitted to the Montreal City Council from the \"Comit\u00e9 Dupleix\" of Paris, inviting the mayor to represent the city at certain f\u00eates to be held in France to commemorate the tercentenary of the founding of Quebec by Champlain, and a resolution was forthwith adopted unanimously accepting the invitation and instructing the finance committee to place at the mayor's disposal the necessary funds to cover his travelling expenses. On the 20th of May a formal acceptance of the invitation was sent to the secretary of the \"Comit\u00e9 Dupleix.\" On the 26th, Mr. Pelletier, city comptroller and auditor, was requested by the mayor to place $1,500 at his disposal for travelling expenses. On the 29th of May the comptroller put the mayor's letter before the finance committee and it was resolved to instruct the city treasurer to comply with the request and to advance the sum of f 1,500. On May 30th, the city treasurer certified the account as true and correct, recommended that it should be paid and the payment was subsequently approved of by the finance committee in the following terms:\nThe payment of the above amount is approved, but subject to the certificate of the city comptroller that there are sufficient available funds voted by council for said purpose. On the same day the comptroller issued his warrant for the payment of this sum of f 1,500. This war- rant is not in the record, but I gather from the evidence and the by-laws that the comptroller's warrant is the authority on which the city treasurer paid out the money. The latter can certify all accounts but he cannot pay them until they are approved of by the comptroller who must also countersign the treasurer's cheque. When the mayor and his secretary subsequently returned from France, the accounts for the balance of their travelling expenses were fyled with the comptroller on July 16th. On the 20th of July, the accounts were submitted to the finance committee and it was resolved\nthat said accounts be approved of and that the city comptroller be instructed to pay the same.\nOn the next day, July 21st, the accounts were certified by the treasurer and approved of by the four members of the finance committee subject, as in the first instance, to the certificate of the comptroller that there were sufficient available funds voted by council for the purpose and on the same day the comptroller issued his warrant and the treasurer's cheque followed, as in the case of the previous payment. There is some confusion as to the dates on which the comptroller signed the vouchers given by the treasurer and conditionally approved of by the finance committee; but it appears on the face of the documents that the authority to pay, which is the sole foundation of these proceedings, was in each instance given by the members of the finance committee on the same day that the comptroller's warrant issued and, assuming that there is no evidence as to which was done first, the maxim \"omnia presumuntur rite esse acta\" applies. There is no proof that I have been able to find that the defendants Robinson and Guay were present at either meeting of the finance committee, but as this objection has not been taken here I am content to mention it; in my view of the case it is not material.\nThe question for consideration is: Did the members of the finance committee, in these circumstances, authorize an expenditure of money exceeding the amount legally placed at the disposal of the council or committee within the meaning of section 338 of the charter?\nIt appears on the face of the documents that the authority to pay was given by the finance committee when, the accounts having been referred to the city treasurer, that official approved of them and recommended their payment. In addition, that authority was clearly and expressly given subject to the certificate of the comptroller that there were sufficient available funds voted by council for the purpose. In other words, the accounts being audited, the expenditure was authorized on the condition that the certificate of the proper official was produced to establish that there were funds available and at the disposal of the city for the purpose. In terms the authority to pay is given subject to the condition prescribed in section 336 of the City Charter which reads:\nNo resolution of the council or of any committee, authorizing the expenditure of any moneys shall be adopted, or have any effect, until a certificate of the comptroller is produced, establishing that there are funds available and at the disposal of the city for the service and purposes for which such expenditure is proposed, in accordance with the provisions of this charter.\nIt was for the comptroller to say if there were funds available and at the disposal of the city out of which the travelling expenses could be taken. If there were no such funds, the condition upon which the comptroller was authorized by the finance committee to issue his warrant failed; and if such funds were available how can it be said that the finance committee authorized an expenditure of money exceeding the amount legally placed at the disposal of the council?\nIt was suggested here, and to some extent the judgment of the Court of Review proceeds on that suggestion, that the defendants came within the disqualifying section when they acquiesced, as members of the city council, in the resolution passed on the 18th of May, 1908, requesting the finance committee to provide for the mayor's travelling expenses. The argument, as I understand it, is that this resolution involving, as it did, an expenditure of a portion of the city's revenue should not have been adopted until it had been previously submitted to and sanctioned by the finance committee (rule of council 124 and section 42 of the charter) and the omission to comply with this condition precedent, although subsequently and before it became operative the resolution was submitted to and approved of by the finance committee entailed the disqualification of the whole council under section 338. This resolution is an instruction to the finance committee to indicate the fund; but it is not an authority to the proper official to pay out of a fund not legally placed at the disposal of the council, which is the mischief prohibited by section 338. By the resolution the invitation is accepted and the finance committee is instructed to place at the disposal of the mayor an amount sufficient to cover his travelling expenses, the necessary implication being that those expenses are to be taken out of such funds as are legally available for the purpose. I am of opinion that the omission to comply with rule 124 at most makes the resolution inoperative until the certificate is produced (section 336). Finally this, in any event, would be an objection founded upon form or upon the omission of a formality which is provided for by section 308 of the charter. I am further of opinion that section 42 of the charter is not applicable in the circumstances because the reserve fund against which the expenditure for travelling expenses was chargeable was then appropriated and at the disposal of the council for these reasons. In the month of December, each year, the council is under obligation to appropriate (\"mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9\" is the French term) the sums at its disposal out of the revenues of the city and to provide, among other things, for a reserve of five per cent. (sec. 334, sub-sec. (d)). The preparation of this annual estimate of expenditure is one of the functions of the finance committee and, when adopted by council, the estimate becomes the civic budget for the ensuing year. In the budget prepared by the finance committee for 1908 and adopted by council is included the reserve of five per cent, which was set aside to the extent of three per cent, to provide for unforeseen expenses, such as the cost of representations and delegations, not an unusual item in a civic budget, as may be seen upon reference to section 596 of the \"Ontario Municipal Act.\" Briefly in my view the revenues at the disposal of the council for 1908 were appropriated in December, 1907, by the joint action of the finance committee and of the council and the reserve fund was included in and formed part of the civic budget and was at the disposal of the council for the reception and entertainment of distinguished guests and for travelling expenses as fully and effectually as any other item in it. If in this I am not mistaken the council could by virtue of section 334(6) authorize the payment of the mayor's travelling expenses and charge them against that fund without further reference to the finance committee, except in so far as the rule of council 124 was applicable. When the reserve fund was included in the annual estimate prepared by the finance committee, that fund was appropriated as fully and effectually in so far as the functions devolving upon the committee under section 42 are concerned as any other item of the civic budget and were it not for rule 124, I would say that with respect to that fund the finance committee was functus, but assuming that they had a duty to perform they did perform it substantially, as I have already attempted to shew.\nI come now to the consideration of section 338. I repeat what I have already said; there is no suggestion of personal wrong-doing and there was no diversion of funds. No result followed the action of the council or of the finance committee, except that which was desired. All checks and safeguards provided by the charter for the protection of the civic exchequer were observed; there was unanimous action on the part of the council; the certificate of the comptroller that funds were available for the purpose and the sanction and approval of the finance committee were given. Everything that the statute required on the most strict construction was complied with, although conceivably in one aspect of the case, in some respects, out of the statutory order.\nI quite agree that the object of the legislature was to check careless, unbusinesslike management of the public money; but\nit is a general rule of law that a penal statute ought to be construed strictly so as not to extent its provisions to any case which is not within both the spirit and letter of the enactment. This rule applies with a greater degree of force where the Act imposes a severe punishment or affects the liberty of the subject than where it imposes merely a pecuniary penalty.\nEncyclopaedia of Laws of England, vo. \"Penalty,\" p. 30.\nIn terms section 338 imposes very severe penalties on any member of the council who authorizes an expenditure in excess of the appropriations. Should we hold that to authorize the expenditure of a sum of money out of a fund amply sufficient, certified by the proper official to be at the disposal of the council for a purpose authorized by the statute comes within the spirit and the letter of the prohibition contained in this enactment? Let me here again draw attention to the form in which the authority to pay was given by the finance committee:\nThe payment of the above amount is approved but subject to the certificate of the city comptroller that there are sufficient available funds voted by council for said purpose.\nIf all the requisite formalities are complied with, even out of the regular order, before the money actually leaves the municipal exchequer, is the spirit of the Act violated? I read this section, which certainly is not free from ambiguity, to mean that when the annual appropriations have been made and placed at the disposal of the council and of the different committees, no obligation is to be contracted which would involve the credit of the city for any sum in excess of such appropriation, the legislature having in section 334 provided that in making the annual appropriations the council shall maintain the equilibrium between the revenues and expenses so that future ratepayers should not be charged with present expenditures and to prevent that mischief the statute makes the members who authorize the excess of expenditure personally liable therefor. But if a fund is available for a specific purpose and that in an attempt to legitimately apply it to that purpose an informality in the procedure laid down by the rules of the council and by the statutes chiefly for the guidance of the officials occurs, can it be said that the severe penalties enacted by this section are incurred? I cannot believe that such consequences were ever contemplated where no bad faith, negligence, carelessness or indirect motive is imputed and where the object of the council was carried out. If for an error in procedure, personal liability and disqualification are to be incurred, no honest man of substance would venture to assume the enormous risk involved in taking a share in the administration of the municipal government of a large city like Montreal.\nThe words\nany expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal of the council or of any committee\nin section 338, read in conjunction with section 336, must mean that what is prohibited is the expenditure by the council or by the committee of any sum in excess of the amount at the disposal of the council or committee, not that if the money is legally available for a specific purpose and that some formality is required to apply it to that purpose the omission of the formality involves the penalty. The result of such a construction, as shewn by this case, would be to make the members of the council insurers not only of the honesty and efficiency but of the infallibility of the municipal officials. Of the fourteen judges who have heard this case, nine say that the necessary formalities have been complied with and five that the proceedings were irregular; and, as a result, seven men, admitted to be of the most trustworthy, are disqualified for a period of two years and condemned to pay a large sum. Are these gentlemen presumed to be endowed with that grace of infallibility which evidently has been denied the courts of this country?\nIt is the internal sense (says Plowden) that makes the law; the letter of the law is the body and the sense and reason of the law is the soul.\nApplying that rule to the construction of the charter and in view of the admitted facts, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nGirouard J. (dissident).\u2014Lorsque cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant nous, j'\u00e9tais sous l'impression qu'il s'agissait d'un bref de quo warranto purement et simplement aux termes du code de proc\u00e9dure civile et que par cons\u00e9quent nous n'avions pas de juridiction, ni la cour d'appel non plus. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu et relu l'article 338 de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (62 Vict. ch. 58) je me suis convaincu qu'il s'agissait d'une action sp\u00e9ciale parfaitement ind\u00e9pendante du quo warranto, dans laquelle il y a appel non seulement \u00e0 la cour d'appel, mais aussi \u00e0 cette cour. Cet article se lit comme suit:\nTout membre du conseil de ville qui autorise, soit verbalement, par \u00e9crit, par son vote ou tacitement, une d\u00e9pense d'argent exc\u00e9dant le montant pr\u00e9alablement vot\u00e9 et l\u00e9galement mis \u00e0 la disposition du conseil ou d'une commission, en est tenu personnellement responsable et est, par le fait m\u00eame, d\u00e9chu de son droit de si\u00e9ger comme membre du conseil, et ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9\u00e9lu \u00e0 la charge d'\u00e9chevin pendant une p\u00e9riode de deux ans \u00e0 partir de ce moment. Le texte de cet article est bien diff\u00e9rent de ceux du code de proc\u00e9dure, articles 987 \u00e0 991. Ces articles d\u00e9finissent se que c'est que le quo warranto. Il a pour but principal d'emp\u00eacher l'usurpation ou la d\u00e9tention ill\u00e9gale d'une charge, franchise ou pr\u00e9rogative publique et l'article 990 ajoute que, si la requ\u00eate est fond\u00e9e, le jugement ordonne que le d\u00e9fendeur soit d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et exclus de la charge et peut en outre le condamner \u00e0 une amende n'exc\u00e9dant pas $400, payable \u00e0 la couronne. Comme l'on voit, il n'est aucunement question dans cet article d'un jugement ordonnant au d\u00e9fendeur de rembourser des deniers ill\u00e9galement obtenus pendant l'exercice de sa charge; en fait d'argent, tout ce que le demandeur peut r\u00e9clamer, c'est la condamnation \u00e0 l'amende de quatre cents piastres.\nL'article 338 de la charte de Montr\u00e9al, cit\u00e9 plus haut, est bien diff\u00e9rent. Il a pour objet principal la condamnation d'une d\u00e9pense ill\u00e9gale d'argent; et la d\u00e9qualification ou d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de si\u00e9ger ou de se faire r\u00e9\u00e9lire n'est que la cons\u00e9quence \"par le fait m\u00eame,\" dit l'article, de cette d\u00e9pense. C'est ce que la cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 et je crois qu'elle avait raison. L'application pour casser l'appel faute de juridiction doit donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nAu m\u00e9rite, j'abonde dans le sens de l'honorable juge Archambault parlant pour toute la cour \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9. Qu'il y a\u00eet eu quelque irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 ou informalit\u00e9 dans la proc\u00e9dure suivie par le conseil de ville, cela est \u00e9vident; mais ces d\u00e9fauts sont tol\u00e9r\u00e9s par la charte, \u00e0 moins d'injustice r\u00e9elle ou de nullit\u00e9 expresse (art. 308). O\u00f9 est l'injustice ici? Il est impossible de la trouver. Les \u00e9ehevins soit du conseil de ville ou du comit\u00e9 des finances ont agi avec la meilleure foi du monde. Ceci n'est pas contest\u00e9; il n'y a pas eu de d\u00e9tournement de fonds ou d'exc\u00e8s d'appropriation. Toute l'erreur consiste en ce qu'ils ont agi non pas dans l'ordre indiqu\u00e9 par la charte mais \u00e0 l'inverse commen\u00e7ant au lieu de finir par le conseil de ville. Tous les corps dirigeants ayant droit d'\u00eatre consult\u00e9s, de se prononcer et de d\u00e9cider ont approuv\u00e9 la d\u00e9pense en question. Le montant payable avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement vot\u00e9 et \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement mis \u00e0 la disposition du conseil et de la commission des finances, vu que la charte pr\u00e9voit qu'une pareille d\u00e9pense doit \u00eatre prise \u00e0 m\u00eame le fonds d\u00e9 r\u00e9serve qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vot\u00e9 au mois de d\u00e9cembre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent; 3 Edw. VII. ch. 62, art. 27; 7 Edw. VII. ch. 63, art. 12. Et puis quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9. Comment peut-on soutenir en face de l'article 308 que les informalit\u00e9s que l'on reproche aux \u00e9chevins entra\u00eenent la nullit\u00e9 ? Aucun des articles cit\u00e9s, pas m\u00eame l'article 42 tel qu'amend\u00e9 par 3 Edw. VII. ch. 2, art. 6, ne d\u00e9cr\u00e8te la nullit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure qui y est indiqu\u00e9e. L'article 308 se lit comme suit:\nNulle objection ne peut \u00eatre admise sur une action, poursuite ou proc\u00e9dure concernant des mati\u00e8res municipales, \u00e0 moins qu'une injustice r\u00e9elle ne doive r\u00e9sulter de celles dont l'omission rend nuls, d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions de cette charte, les proc\u00e9dures ou autres actes municipaux qui doivent en \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9s.\nIl faut bien remarquer que notre mode de proc\u00e9der m\u00eame devant les cours de justice n'est pas toujours prescrit \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9; que cette nullit\u00e9, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, n'existe pas \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit prononc\u00e9e. C.P.C. art. 175.\nS'il faut en croire le jugement de la cour, les \u00e9chevins se trouvent \u00e0 garantir la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures du conseil et des commissions. Ils sont, pour ainsi dire, les assureurs de l'infaillibilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale du greffier de la cit\u00e9 et m\u00eame de ses avocats. Est-il possible d'imaginer que le l\u00e9gislateur ait song\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une semblable position. Elle est non seulement peu enviable, mais elle est m\u00eame intol\u00e9rable et impossible.\nAujourd'hui il s'agit de quatre ou cinq mille piastres, demain il s'agira peut-\u00eatre d'un demi-million ou d'un million. Comment supposer pour un instant que les \u00e9chevins qui, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ne sont pas m\u00eame des avocats vont mieux r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s l\u00e9gales que les juges? Nous en avons un exemple frappant dans cette cause. Neuf juges de Qu\u00e9bec se sont prononc\u00e9s et sept en faveur des \u00e9chevins qui cependant perdent leur cause parce que devant cette cour ils ont une simple majorit\u00e9 contre eux, trois contre deux. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il sera bien difficile, sinon impossible, de trouver d\u00e9s candidats d\u00e9sirables \u00e0 la position d'\u00e9chevin de la ville de Montr\u00e9al. La position sera pire qu'aujourd'hui, car elle devra \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 des gens sans valeur ni responsabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 des aventuriers et des brasseurs d'affaires.\nJe n'ai pas l'intention d'entrer dans les d\u00e9tails assez nombreux de cette cause. Ceux qui d\u00e9sireraient les conna\u00eetre n'ont qu'\u00e0 parcourir le jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 et lucide de M. le juge Archambault. Il les comprend tous. Je me contenterai de citer la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle le savant juge est arriv\u00e9:\nSomme toute la pr\u00e9sente cause se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 peu de chose.\nTout le monde admet que le conseil avait le droit d'envoyer une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 Paris et d'en payer les frais \u00e0 m\u00eame le fonds de r\u00e9serve.\nIl est aussi admis que la balance disponible du fonds de r\u00e9serve \u00e9tait plus que suffisante pour payer cette d\u00e9pense.\nLa r\u00e9solution du conseil n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d'une recommendation de la commission des finances; mais quel int\u00e9r\u00eat l'intim\u00e9 peut-il avoir \u00e0 s'en plaindre, lorsque c'est la commission des finances qui a elle-m\u00eame autoris\u00e9 le paiement de la d\u00e9pense?\nCette r\u00e9solution n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e d'un certificat du contr\u00f4leur; mais ce certificat a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 plus tard, et a ainsi donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution en la validant. La r\u00e9solution n'a pas fix\u00e9 le montant de la d\u00e9pense; mais les membres de la commission des finances n'ont pas exc\u00e9d\u00e9 le montant de la partie disponible du fonds de r\u00e9serve affect\u00e9e \u00e0 ce genre de d\u00e9pense.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le conseil avait le droit d'ordonner cette d\u00e9pense. Il y avait des fonds disponibles pour la payer. Et la d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 m\u00eame ces fonds.\nLa proc\u00e9dure ordinaire et plus r\u00e9guli\u00e8re n'a peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie. Mais il n'en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 aucune injustice, ni aucune atteinte \u00e0 l'esprit de la charte, qui veut que les fonds publics soient appliqu\u00e9s aux fins pour lesquelles ils sont vers\u00e9s dans de tr\u00e9sor municipal, et dans les limites \u00e9tablies par le conseil lui-m\u00eame lorsqu'il autorise une d\u00e9pense.\nJe suis donc d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nIdington J.\u2014The City Charter of Montreal by section 338 provided as follows:\nEvery member of the council who authorizes either verbally, by writing, by his vote, or tacitly, any expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal of the council or any committee, shall be held personally liable therefor, and shall thereby become disqualified as a member of the council, and shall also be disqualified for re-election as alderman for a, period of two years thereafter.\nThis action is taken thereupon, as the conclusions of the statement of claim in the form of a petition shew, for the twofold purpose of having it declared that respondents being aldermen of the city have forfeited their seats and for two years the right to be elected as such, and to recover moneys they had unlawfully and in breach of the foregoing section 338 authorized to be paid.\nThe question raised at the threshold in respect of our jurisdiction to hear the appeal is unique in its character.\nWe have a matter in controversy between the parties as to an amount exceeding our jurisdictional limit of two thousand dollars.\nCan any one join in the same action a claim for over two thousand dollars ($2,000) no matter how founded, and something else over which we have no jurisdiction and thus give us jurisdiction in the latter matter, or in the converse case begin and prosecute a quo warranto proceeding and join to it a claim for over two thousand dollars ($2,000) and thus force an appeal here.\nI incline to think not, and yet we are to give in any case, if we reverse the judgment which the court below has pronounced, the judgment and award the process or other proceedings which the court should have given or awarded.\nOne curious thing is the court below has no more power to hear appeal in a case of quo warranto than we, and yet it has heard this case in appeal and come to the decision that the case is not well founded.\nMust we not first solve the question of the right of the court of appeal to interfere?\nMy solution is that if the case is to be held as one of quo warranto, then it is quite too clear for argument the court below had no jurisdiction, and its judgment ought for that reason to be reversed.\nBut as the question of whether the proceeding is one of quo warranto or not, despite the order therefor, is one of procedure, with regard to which we, according to the practice of this court, never exercise jurisdiction unless in a case, not this, wherein appears a violation of the principles of natural justice; and as the court of appeal has treated it as if not a case of quo warranto, I assume, for the present, that court did rightly in so treating the matter, and must, therefore, proceed to such merits as the case may have.\nThis section 338 quoted must be read in light of sections 42 and 336 of the charter. Section 42 is as follows, as replaced by Edw. VII ch. 62, art. 6, in 1903:\nThe functions of the finance committee shall be: The preparation of the annual estimates of expenditure; the consideration of all recommendations involving the expenditure of money, and the awarding of all contracts, subject to the ratification by the council, for works, material and supplies, unless an appropriation has been already voted.\nNo recommendation for such purposes shall be adopted by the council unless the same shall have been previously submitted to and sanctioned by the finance committee; provided, however, that, upon the refusal of the finance committee to sanction an appropriation asked for by any committee, the council may, by a vote of the absolute majority of all its members, order such appropriation to be voted. No member of any other permanent committee can be a member of the finance committee.\nThe plan outlined is clearly and expressly that in the finance committee and therein alone can lawfully be formulated any authorization involving the expenditure of money.\nI will not say that the council or any one else might not discuss such matters, and in that limited sense submit the propriety of the proper authority being moved in the matter to a consideration thereof. But one thing the council must not do without the committee's consent or refusal, and that is to recommend in the sense of authorizing an expenditure of money.\nThey have no such power unless an appropriation has been voted. Indeed, neither council nor committee can alone do so effectively.\nThe appropriation, which in the words of the statute has already been voted, must have had the recommendation of the committee first or its refusal to make such a recommendation.\nEither thing once done the council is free to act by a vote (if necessary of an absolute majority of all its members), but not otherwise or until then. The finance committee in any representative body usually comprises the ablest men of experience available therein.\nIn this instance the control of the city's business was thus practically, and I think intentionally, handed over to the majority of the finance committee dealing with any matter.\nBut they cannot be autocratic for the council by an absolute majority can overrule them.\nThe plan, whether stumbled on, or the fruit of much thought, is an admirable one but for one thing, and that is, that it imposes the painful duty of thinking. It is essentially the plan of controllerships.\nIn this latter case men understand by seeing the physical severance and act accordingly.\nThere is another section, that is 336, which reads as follows:\nNo resolution of the council or of any committee, authorizing the expenditure of any moneys shall be adopted, or have any effect, until a certificate of the comptroller is produced, establishing that there are funds available and at the disposal of the city for the service and purposes for which such expenditure is proposed, in accordance with the provisions of this charter.\nThe whole law necessary to a determination of this issue is contained in these three sections, but has been obscured by side issues arising from a consideration of rules of procedure, statutory, and otherwise. So far as statutory they emphasize if possible the need for the observance of these sections of the charter and so far as otherwise can have no effect.\nLet us see the thing the respondents did which is complained of.\nOn 18th May, 1908, the council on motion of one of respondents adopted the following resolution: Soumise et lue, une communication du comit\u00e9 Dupleix, Paris, invitant le maire \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion du tricentenaire de la fondation de Qu\u00e9bec par Champlain. Sur motion de M. l'echevin L. A. Lapointe, appuy\u00e9 par l'echevin Yates, il est r\u00e9solu: Que la dite invitation soit accept\u00e9e, que son honneur le maire accompagn\u00e9 de son secr\u00e9taire, soit pri\u00e9 de repr\u00e9senter la ville en cette circonstance et que la commission des finances re\u00e7oive instruction de mettre \u00e0 la disposition de son honneur le maire, le montant n\u00e9cessaire pour couvrir ses frais de d\u00e9placement.\nOn the 29th May, 1908, the finance committee responded to this appeal by the following:\nSubmitted and read a communication from His Worship the Mayor, asking that a sum of $1,500 be placed at his disposal foi-travelling expenses on the occasion of his trip to Europe to represent the city at the tercentenary celebration of the foundation of Quebec.\nResolved, to instruct the city treasurer to comply with the mayor's request and to advance him the said sum of $1,500.\nThe respondents were parties to this.\nThe money was paid and the mayor and others travelled.\nSomething unpleasant occurred in the course of the accounting for the expenses.\nWe have nothing to do with that and all else which followed except that by the like illegal methods as outlined above connected with the same matter the respondents permitted and procured to be taken out of the treasury, without observing the prescribed statutory rules, sums in the aggregate which the Court of Review has found.\nWhat appears on the face of these transactions so far as material, is that the respondents, within the words of the section first quoted, authorized an expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted, and thereby legally placed at the disposal of the council or committee. I cannot fritter away the force of the section by assuming it inoperative unless there had been a previously voted sum appropriated to the same purpose, or by adopting the statutory directions as to appropriations as a voting thereof, and thus a compliance with what is prescribed.\nI repeat that section 42 constitutes the consideration of all recommendations, involving and authorizing the expenditure of money; first the duty of the committee and then of the council. Section 336 imposed also the respective duties of the committee seeing the certificate therein called for sent forward with its recommendation to the council and of the council refraining from voting till that certificate was received; for until then the recommendation was invalid.\nWith great respect I think the five per cent. or reserve fund specially set apart by sub-section (d) of section 334, as amended by 3 Edw. VII.. ch. 62, was in law exactly in the same position as all the other funds of the municipality and required the provisions of section 42 to be observed in respect thereof. The statute did not place this reserve at the disposal of the council any more than other funds. Indeed, it was as to two per cent. a provision against loss merely. Although possibly, in harmony with the statute, the budget scheme might have included that in its frame, yet in no such sense as involved in the said duty laid down in section 42 can it be said to have been voted as an appropriation.\nWhen were any of these moneys placed at the disposal of the council or any committee?\nWhat had the finance committee ever done as required by section 42 to place any such moneys at anybody's disposal in any way to justify what was done? Until the finance committee passed upon the matter and set aside for this purpose the necessary-money forming part of this statutory reserve nothing could be legally done with it. It fell under section 42 just as other moneys were put.\nTo say it was available for the committee and council by proper methods is one thing. To apply or fail to apply those methods is entirely another thing.\nThe failure of duty upon which the foundation for the attack on respondents rests is entirely that in respect of proper legal methods they failed to observe their obligations in that regard which were as plainly written as language could make it if attentively read.\nI think the appeal must be allowed and judgment go for the amounts awarded by the Court of Review. The penalties claimed cannot be awarded herein.\nThe section sued upon does not give any right of action in the nature of a quo warranto or anything leading to like results. The action is founded on the right of a rate-payer not questioned here to invoke such a statutory provision.\nIn light of what the court of appeal holds, however, in what I repeat is a mere matter of procedure, I do not see my way to vacating that declaratory part of the judgment.\nWith great deference, but for that, I would rather have held the parties to an action for money as one independent in every way of anything in the nature of quo warranto.\nThe one is not dependent on the other, though the same facts and laws may and indeed must produce in one case a judgment for money, and in the other a vacant seat. Duff J.\u2014This appeal raises first a question of procedure, which in one view of it involves the question of the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the appeal.\nThe action in which the appellant was plaintiff was in form of proceeding in quo warranto, and calling upon the respondents to shew cause why they should not be declared to be disqualified to sit as members of the municipal council of the City of Montreal, under article 338 of the City Charter, and asking also that under the provisions of that article they should be directed to repay to the city certain sums voted by them to defray the expenses of a delegation to Paris to take part in a celebration on the occasion of the tercentenary of the founding of Quebec. The Court of King's Bench has held that the action, though in form quo warranto, was in substance a special action under article 338. The respondents dispute this view and contend that the proceeding was in substance quo warranto, and that it was incompetent to the plaintiffs to include with the claims for relief appropriated to such proceeding a claim for the repayment of the moneys mentioned; they further contend that treating the action as a proceeding in quo warranto simply an appeal does not lie to this court. As to this contention it is sufficient to say that the view of the court of appeal is concurred in by the members of this court specially qualified to form an opinion upon a question of law of procedure in the Province of Quebec, and I see no adequate reason for disagreeing with that view.\nThe question of substance raised by the appeal turns upon the construction of certain articles of the Charter of Montreal, and it arises in this way: On the 1st of May, 1908, the council on receiving communication of a letter addressed to the mayor inviting him to represent the City of Montreal on the occasion mentioned, passed the following resolution:\nResolved: That said invitation be accepted, that His Worship the Mayor accompanied by his secretary be requested to represent the city on this occasion, and that the finance committee be instructed to place at the disposal of His Worship the mayor the necessary amount to cover his travelling expenses.\nSubsequently the finance committee the members of which (the respondents) were the defendants in the action authorized the city treasurer at the request of the mayor to pay him to him the sum of $1,992.40 in liquidation of the expenses, the payment of which the council by this resolution professed to authorize.\nThe ground upon which the appellants rest their claim to have this sum refunded by the respondents, is that the resolution of the council was for various reasons inoperative to confer upon the finance committee any authority to authorize the payment of money out of the city treasury; and that the respondents having directed the disbursement mentioned without authority are compellable to restore the fund thus withdrawn under the provisions of article 338. The articles requiring consideration are 42, 334 and 338. It will be convenient to set them out in extenso now.\nArticle 42, as amended by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 2, art. 6, reads as follows:\nThe functions of the finance committee shall be: The preparation of the annual estimates of expenditure, the consideration of all recommendations involving the expenditure of money, and the awarding of all contracts, subject to ratification by the council, for works, materials and supplies unless an appropriation has been already voted.\nNo recommendation for such purpose shall be adopted by the council unless the same shall have been previously submitted to and sanctioned by the finance committee, provided, however, that upon the refusal of the finance committee to sanction an appropriation asked for by any committee, the council may, by a vote of the absolute majority of all its members, order such an appropriation to be made.\"\nArticle 334. As replaced by 3 Edw. VII. eh. 62, article 27, [1903]:\nIn the month of December of each year, the council shall appropriate the sums at its disposal out of the revenues of the city for the needs of the various civic departments for the ensuing fiscal year.\nIn so doing, the council shall maintain the equilibrium between the revenues and expenses and provide for:\n(a) The cost of the collection of the civic revenue;\n(b) The interest upon the civic debt and sinking fund which may be established;\n(c) The school tax;\n(d) A reserve of five per cent.\u2014two per cent. being to cover all possible loss in the collection of taxes and three per cent, for unforeseen expenses, such as those relating to judgments, official receptions, epidemics, inundations, fortuitous events and damages caused by irresistible force;\n(e) Other established charges upon the civic revenue, including the deficit from any previous year;\n(f) Repairs, maintenance, salaries and expenses for general administration.\n334(a). Added by 63 Vict. ch. 49, art. 10, [1900]:\nThe reserve fund may also be employed to pay claims for damages arising from offences or quasi offences.\n334(6). Added by 7 Edw. VII. ch. 63, article 12, [1907]:\nThe city may charge against the reserve fund the costs of representation and of delegations authorized by the council as well as the sums required for the settlement of claims and for the removal of snow and ice from the sidewalks.\nArticle 338:\nEvery member of the council who authorizes either verbally, by writing, by his vote, or tacitly, any expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal of the council or any committee, shall be held personally liable therefor, and shall thereby become disqualified as a member of the council, and shall also be disqualified for re-election as alderman for a period of two years thereafter. Added by 8 Edw. VII. ch. 85, art. 22, [1908]:\nNevertheless the said liabilities and disqualifications enacted in this article shall not exist if the council of the city has subsequently acknowledged and ratified the said expenditure of money as being valid and lawful. This provision shall have effect for the past only.\nInvalidity is imputed to the resolution of the council on various grounds; but in my view of the case it is necessary to consider only one of them, which is this \u2014article 42 prohibits the adoption by the council of any proposal for the expenditure of money which has not been previously submitted to the finance committee, except in those cases in which an appropriation has already been voted. It is argued, and after the most careful consideration of the provisions of the statute I think the argument has not been answered, that in this case there was no appropriation within the meaning of this article of the sum disbursed or, indeed, of any sum for the purpose to which it was devoted and that the proposal was never submitted to the finance committee in the sense of article 42.\nThe first point for consideration is whether at the time of the passing of the resolution of the 18th of May there had been an appropriation within the meaning of article 42 of the sum in question. The point turns largely on the construction of article 334. It is argued with a good deal of force and plausibility that the city is expressly authorized by article 334(b) to charge expenses of this character against the reserve fund provided for by article 334, and that by the terms of the last mentioned article the reserve fund thereby directed to be provided is treated as a sum appropriated for all or any of the various purposes to which the statute authorizes the council to apply it. The statute does, no doubt, expressly authorize the city to charge such expenses as these against the reserve fund; but I am unable to follow the argument through to its conclusion. I do not think the reserve fund (created by the statute rather than by the council) can be treated as a sum appropriated in the sense indicated. The article 334, it is observable, requires the council in the December of each year to appropriate the sums at its disposal out of the revenue of the city for the needs of the various civic departments, for the ensuing fiscal year. It then goes on to direct that in thus providing for the disbursements of the revenues the city council shall make provision for certain permanent charges upon the city revenue\u2014the cost of collection, interest upon debt and sinking fund, school tax, deficit from any previous year, \"other established charges upon the revenue,\" maintenance, salaries and expenses for general administration. It is perfectly clear that in each one of these cases it is intended that the council should set apart sums, specific and ascertained, and that it should at the same time declare the purposes (with more or less precision as the circumstances may admit) to which these sums are to be applied.\nIt is perfectly clear, too, that the duty of preparing and considering the estimates upon which the appropriations are based devolves under article 42 upon the finance committee. The reserve fund stands necessarily in a different category. It is obviously intended to be what its name imports, viz.: a fund that shall be available for expenditures the municipality may be called upon to make during the course of the year, but which cannot at the time fixed for making the appropriations be ascertained with any accuracy or certainty. It is in a word a provision for contingencies. Does it follow that the whole of this fund is to be treated as a sum appropriated within the meaning of article 42? So to describe it seems to me to involve some disregard of the meaning of the words as well as the substance of the operation. The direction to provide for a reserve fund seems rather to aim at imposing a limit upon the annual appropriations in relation to the amount available for expenditures\u2014a requirement to allow a margin which shall leave a fund that can be appropriated to meet unforeseen demands which may arise during the course of the year, rather than what is commonly understood to be an \"appropriation.\" If this be the correct view it follows that there was no appropriation for the purposes to which the sum in question was applied. It follows too, I think, that the direction to the treasury to disburse the sum in question given by the finance committee was\nan expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal\nof that committee, because although the reserve fund was at the disposal of the council, who could disburse it on compliance with article 42, their attempt to disburse it was inoperative for want of compliance with that article. The respondents are consequently accountable for the sum so paid out by the committee without authority.\nI have not overlooked the view expressed by Archambault J. upon the construction of article 42. If I have correctly apprehended the learned judge's view it is that the article applies only to \"recommendations\" made by committees of the council and not to proposals initiated in the council itself. I quite agree that if that is on its true construction the meaning of the article there is an end of the matter so far as this point is concerned; but I can see no valid reason for thus limiting the scope of the word \"recommendation.\" I do not know why it should not be held to embrace any proposal made by the mayor or by any other member of the council involving any expenditure of money. I think the true construction is that which council itself has adopted in Rule 124, which requires that \"any resolution, motion or report\" involving the disbursement of any part of the revenues of the city shall first be submitted to the finance committee.\nThere remains to consider the contention that the omission to submit this proposal to the finance committee should in the circumstances be regarded as a mere irregularity not affecting the validity of the transactions impugned. It is argued that in point of fact the proposal was passed upon both by the council and by the finance committee, and that in the circumstance that the council passed upon the proposal first and the committee afterwards there is involved no substantial departure from the requirements of the charter. I do not think that is a very satisfactory way of treating the express requirements of a legislative enactment such as this\u2014designed as it is to provide machinery for securing the due administration of the funds of a municipal corporation. I do not, of course, profess to know the exact degree of importance which the legislature attached to the prohibition found in article 42. One cannot, however, lose sight of this; the legislature has entrusted not only the preparation of estimates, but the examination of all proposed expenditures to a special committee, and I am unable to say that they may not have considered it of real importance that the municipal council in dealing as a council with the funds entrusted to its care should, before passing and as a condition of the power to pass upon any proposal involving the expenditure of money not already appropriated, submit that proposal to this committee for examination. It is not very much to the purpose to say that the council might eventually override the committee. The function of examining and advising is one function, the function of vetoing is another, and the fact that the legislature has not seen fit to endow the committee with the latter is not a ground upon which a court of law can legitimately treat the first named function as a matter of form merely. It does not, moreover, help the matter to say that the expenditure was in fact passed by the finance committee. If my view of article 42 be correct what the law requires is that the proposal, having been examined by the finance committee in the exercise of the responsibility cast upon them by article 42 shall then, and only then, be ripe for the action of the council. Obviously it is a vastly different procedure for the council first to put its imprimatur upon the proposal and then to instruct the finance committee to carry its decision into effect; and that in substance is what the respondents are called upon to uphold.\nIt is only bare justice to the respondents to say that no imputation involving any personal reflection upon them was seriously advanced, and in such circumstances there is a natural and justifiable regret that in the absence of malus animus they should suffer the penalties which will be the result of their proceedings; on the other hand it is a paramount consideration that the safeguards with which the legislature has surrounded the administration of the public funds should not be trifled with, and with very great respect I think one could not accede to the views advanced in behalf of the respondents without giving a start to the frittering away of the important provisions of section 42.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment should be against the respondents for the restoration of the moneys disbursed with the costs of the action.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of this case and the contentions of the parties sufficiently appear in the judgments rendered in the provincial courts.\nThe judgment of the Court of King's Bench, reversing that of the Court of Review, and dismissing the action of the appellant, is impugned upon the grounds that the Court of King's Bench entertained the respondents' appeal without jurisdiction, and that upon the merits the judgment of the Court of Review, which had reversed that of the court of first instance, should not have been disturbed.\nThe action of the appellant was not, in my opinion, primarily or principally in the nature of a proceeding in quo warranto. He primarily and principally sought to compel the reimbursement by the respondents, the seven members of the finance committee of the municipal council, to the City of Montreal, of the sum of $3,809.40, the expenditure of which he claims they illegally authorized; and, incidently, to have them disqualified. He also sought to have them subjected to a money penalty. His action was brought to enforce against the defendants the special remedies and penalties provided by article 338 of the charter of the City of Montreal in case of such misconduct in office as he charges against the defendants. He has added, improperly, I think, a claim that the defendants be condemned to pay a sum not exceeding $400 each to the Crown, by way of penalty.\nI agree in the view that the provision which excludes the right of appeal in ordinary cases of quo warranto beyond the Court of Review, does not apply to this case; and that the Court of King's Bench therefore had the jurisdiction which it assumed to exercise.\nArticle 338 of the Montreal charter is as follows:\n338. Every member of the council who authorizes either verbally, by writing, by his vote, or tacitly, an expenditure of money exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal of the council or any committee, shall be held personally liable therefor, and shall thereby become disqualified as a member of the council, and shall also be disqualified for re-election as alderman for a period of two years thereafter.\nDid the defendants authorize \"an expenditure exceeding the amount previously voted and legally placed at the disposal\" of the finance committee?\nThe expenditure in question was made out of \"the reserve fund\"[1]. This fund is by the annual budget placed under the control of the council itself. It could only be placed at the disposal of the finance committee by a legal and sufficient act of the council. The resolution of the council upon which the finance committee acted was passed without any previous recommendation of that committee, contrary to the provisions of article 42 of the city charter, and without any certificate of the comptroller having been first obtained, in violation of the requirements of article 336. The resolution did not designate any fund out of which the expenditure should be made, nor did it specify either the amount or the maximum amount to be expended. By article 334(6) the council is empowered to provide out of the reserve fund for the expense of representation and of delegations.\nBy article 42 the council is forbidden to pass any resolution for expenditure without a prior recommendation of the finance committee, unless the latter body has refused to recommend, and such refusal has been overruled by a majority of all the members of the council. Rule 124 of the council is to the same effect. Under article 336 the passage of any such resolution without production of the comptroller's certificate shewing that there are funds available therefor, is prohibited, and it is provided that a resolution so passed shall not \"have any effect.\"\nFor the respondents it is asserted that the non-observance of these provisions of the charter was a mere informality or irregularity which would not prevent the resolution of council operating to legally authorize the finance committee to draw upon the reserve fund\u2014 that the committee therefore drew upon a fund \"legally placed at its disposal.\"\nI am unable to take this view. \u00cf cannot understand how a resolution of council, which is by the charter expressly declared not to have any effect, can operate to legally place the reserve fund pro tanto at the disposal of a committee. The comptroller's certificate required by article 338 was never obtained. Two other certificates, which the rules required should be attached to the warrants for payment were secured, but not until some time after the moneys had been actually paid over by the city treasurer. Neither of these was the certificate required by article 336. The absence of the preliminary recommendation of the finance committee prescribed by article 42 is excused on two grounds: (a) that the reserve fund was under the direct control of the council itself; and (b) that the finance committee subsequently assented to the expenditure.\nAs to the former, I think it clear that the council could not have legally authorized the expenditure by any other committee of part of the reserve fund with out the preliminary recommendation of the finance committee prescribed by article 42. As to the latter, it by no means follows that the finance committee in carrying out the order of the council to make the expenditure directed, exercised in regard to it any such duty or power as that conferred on it by article 42\u2014 a power or duty which the article contemplates shall be exercised before and not after the authorization of the expenditure by the council. In directing the payment pursuant to the resolution of council the committee may well have deemed itself to be discharging a purely ministerial duty.\nI am of the opinion that the members of the finance committee by their votes authorized an expenditure of money which was, for both of the above reasons, not '\"legally placed at their disposal.\"\nThe omission to indicate the fund out of which the expenditure should be made was, in view of article 334 (b), probably only an irregularity. The omission to fix the sum or the maximum sum to be expended, although a more serious defect, would probably not suffice to nullify the resolution.\nI do not pause to consider the allegation that there was improper expenditure by the mayor's secretary. Upon the argument I was not convinced that this was established, and further consideration of the evidence has not satisfied me that a finding against the defendants upon this ground would be warranted.\nHaving regard to the good faith of the respondents which has not been seriously questioned, and to the facts that no real injustice has been done the city; that the finance committee, if asked, would probably have recommended the expenditure; and that the comptroller could certainly have given the certificate called for by article 336, 1 regret to find myself obliged to reach a conclusion which must entail such grave consequences to the respondents. But it is of the utmost importance that all the safeguards which the legislature has ordained for the protection of the ratepayers of Montreal, in matters of civic expenditure should be maintained intact. For this reason, no doubt, severe consequences are attached by article 338 to certain breaches of duty in this connection, regardless of whether they are or are not intentional. While regretting that, in the circumstances of this case, the respondents must suffer, being satisfied that what they have done falls within the purview of article 338, I know of no power or right in this court to exempt them from its provisions.\nWith the greatest respect for the Court of King's Bench, and also for those of my colleagues with whom I find myself unable to agree, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Review restored with costs throughout to be paid by the respondents to the appellant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charlemagne Rodier.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Ethier & Co.\n[1] Art. 334(d).\n",

The jury found that the company was at fault for laxity in the enforcement of its regulations made to secure the safety of employees and that the plaintiff had contributed to the accident which occasioned the injuries sustained by him by disobedience to the orders given to him in pursuance of those regulations. The jury estimated the damages to the plaintiff at $3,500, made a deduction of $2,000 therefrom on account of the fault which they attributed to him and returned a verdict against the company for $1,500. Upon this verdict judgment was entered against the company by the trial judge and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review. The principal grounds urged by the company on their appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada were that the jury had been misdirected by the trial judge and that the findings and verdict were against the weight of evidence.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the parties, on the appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada directed that a new trial should be had between the parties, that there should be no costs allowed on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and that the costs in the courts below should follow the event of the new trial.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nT.
