Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners by leave of the Board on a question of law and by leave of Mr. Justice Duff on a question of jurisdiction.\nOn July 22nd, 1909, the Railway Board granted an application from the Ontario Department of Agriculture for an order directing the Grand Trunk Railway Co. to provide station accommodation for traffic at a place in the County of Lincoln, where the Department owns and conducts an experimental fruit farm. The railway company on August 7th obtained leave from the Board to appeal from said order to the Supreme Court of Canada, and on October 13th the Board made an order extending the time generally for an application to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal on a question of jurisdiction, and on October 28th such time was extended to November 10th, and leave to appeal was granted by Mr. Justice Duff on November 5th.\nThe question of law on which the appeal was taken by leave of the Board was stated as follows in the application for such leave.\nThat the decision is wrong as a matter of law in holding that the railway company must provide and construct a station which requires the acquirement by the railway company of additional lands which they have no immediate power to take.\nThe question of jurisdiction was whether or not the Board had power under the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" to make such order.\nBy the order of Mr. Justice Duff the question of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear the appeal on the ground that the leave of the judge was not asked for within sixty days from the date of the order of the Board was left open and was discussed in connection with the argument on the merits of the appeal.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants. The Board has no power to compel a railway company, whose line is completed and already provided with stations, to erect a new station at any point, and especially so when it would require the company to acquire additional land when its powers of expropriation are exhausted. See Hastings Town Council v. South Eastern Railway Co.[1]; Harris v. London & North Western Railway Co.[2].\nLancaster K.C. for the respondents. Leave to appeal on a question of jurisdiction cannot be granted after the expiration of sixty days from the date of the order.\nOn the merits see Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law, 635-8; Maxwell on Statutes (4 ed.), p. 78; Winnipeg Jobbers and Shippers Association v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. et al.[3].\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nLancaster K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The majority are of opinion that this court is competent to hear this appeal. As to the order complained of, I am of opinion that the Board has authority to order the company to establish a station at the place indicated. Section 151 of the \"Railway Act\" empowers the company (sub-sec. g) to construct, erect and maintain all necessary stations for the accommodation and use of the traffic and business of the railway; (sub-sec. p), from time to time to alter, repair or discontinue any station and substitute another in its stead. When the line is located and the location is approved of by the Minister of Railways the company must prepare (section 158) a plan to shew, among other things (c) \"the station grounds.\" This plan is made subject to the approval of the Board (section 159), which may require any further information they may deem expedient (section 166), and this would include detailed plans of the station to be erected so as to enable the Commission to decide if they are sufficient for the accommodation and business of the railway, and the company shall not commence the work of construction until these plans have been submitted to and approved of by the Board (section 168). Section 258, par. 1, provides that every station shall be so erected and maintained as to provide suitable and sufficient accommodation and facilities for traffic, and par. 2, that the location of every station shall be approved of by the Board before the company proceeds to erect it.\nFrom all this it appears that every station with respect to its location, plan of construction and maintenance is completely under the control and subject to the approval of the Board. Section 15, 1, sub-sec. (p), empowers the company to alter, repair or discontinue a station and to substitute one station for another; but by section 167 all such changes and alterations must be approved of by the Board (\"railway\" includes stations, section 2, sub-sec. 21), with which lies the duty to require that all stations are so located, erected and maintained as to provide good and sufficient accommodation and facilities for traffic.\nThe argument pressed upon us by the appellant was that all this pre-supposes action by the company and in the absence of such action the Board is without jurisdiction. It necessarily follows, therefore, in that view that however great may be the necessity which exists in any particular locality for additional station accommodation to satisfy the requirements of the traffic that the road is intended to serve and which it may have helped to create, the Board is without power to give relief. When under construction the Board has absolute power to fix the location of all stations so as to meet the expected requirements of the community to be served, but when the necessities of traffic are made apparent, by the operation of the railway, the Board is powerless to interfere. Such a conclusion is absolutely inconsistent with the purpose and object of the Act.\nI am of opinion that the jurisdiction conferred by section 28 is wide enough to meet this case. That section, par. 1, and sub-sec. 2, gives the Board full jurisdiction of its own motion to order and require any company to do anything which such company is or may be required or authorized to do under this Act, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Act. The company could not locate or build a station, or alter, substitute or discontinue an existing station without the approval of the Board. From this it necessarily follows, in my opinion, that if nothing con be done by the company with respect to the location, erection or substitution of one station for another without the authority of the Board, the Board may order what it alone can authorize.\nIn addition, sub-section 3, of section 258, gives the Board absolute power to direct stations to be erected on certain provincial railways subsidized by the Dominion Government from which I infer that this power would not be conferred with respect to those railways if it does not exist as to all others. Why should the Board have with respect to this very limited number of roads, which come by exception under its jurisdiction, a power which they have not in connection with those roads which are completely and absolutely under their control from the time the line is located? The best explanation I can find of this ambiguous sub-section is that it is intended to meet the case of railways which are not otherwise under the Board's jurisdiction and to which sections 151, 158, 159, 166 and 167, do not apply. To say that all railways subsidized after July, 1900, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Board absolutely as to the erection and maintenance of stations and that, as to others, the Board is without jurisdiction to do more than to approve of those that in the opinion of the company are necessary does seem to be singularly unreasonable.\nAs to the power to expropriate, which was the chief question discussed before the Commissioners, if the power of the Board to order the erection of a station is admitted, section 178 is quite wide enough to cover this objection. As to the English cases, it must be borne in mind that the powers conferred upon the Canadian Board extend to a greater number of subjects than are brought within the jurisdiction of English and American Boards.\nIf it be true that the action of the company in the exercise of its powers with respect to stations may be controlled by the Board, but that no power or authority is reserved to or conferred by section 26 upon the Board by which it is enabled to compel the company to act, then I would say that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Sir Louis Davies. A station is necessarily incidental to the conveyance of goods and of passengers, and the Board has undoubtedly the power to order the company to give adequate facilities for both.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014I believe the appeal is properly before this court and, moreover, that the Board had jurisdiction to pass the order appealed from under sections 28, 258, 284 and 317, of the Dominion Railway Act.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal raises the substantial and important question whether the Board of Railway Commissioners has jurisdiction and power to order a company having a completed and running railway to provide and establish new stopping places and stations along its line of railway so as to afford adequate and suitable accommodation from time to time for increased traffic upon the road.\nA preliminary question was raised as to our jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the ground that it is an appeal upon a question of law and that the necessary leave to bring it had not been obtained from the Board within the prescribed time or within any legal extension of that time. The facts were that on the 7th of August, 1909, the Board of Railway Commissioners granted the appellants leave to appeal to this court from the order of the Board complained of, and that, on the 13th of October, 1909, the appeal allowed not having been brought, an extension of time was granted by the Board after hearing the parties. This extension was in general terms merely extending the time without saying for how long, but, on the 28th of October, a further extension was granted up to the 10th of November, 1909.\nOn the 5th of November, Mr. Justice Duff granted leave to appeal from the order of the Board on the ground of alleged want of jurisdiction, subject to terms and conditions, one of which was that his right to make the order when he did should remain open for disposition on the hearing of the appeal. I have reached the conclusion that there being no limitation in the \"Railway Act\" upon the power of a judge of this court to grant an order allowing an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Com missioners on the ground of want of jurisdiction, and no rule of this court limiting the exercise of such power, it remains untrammelled, so far as time is concerned, unless there is something in the rules and practice applicable to appeals from the Exchequer Court, which must be held to limit it. These rules are, under sub-section 7, of section 56, of the \"Railway Act\" (3 Edw. VII. ch. 58), made applicable to appeals such as this until special rules are made with respect to such appeals. I have not been able to find any limitation of time upon the power of a judge of this court to grant an appeal upon a question of jurisdiction, apart from the question whether there has been a legal extension of time by the Board of Railway Commissioners as would support an appeal from their order on a question of law. I am of opinion that the whole question being litigated is properly before us under the order of Mr. Justice Duff on the question of want of jurisdiction in the Board and that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\nOn the merits of the appeal I have reached the conclusion that the Board of Railway Commissioners had power to make the order complained of. By subsection 31, of section 2, of the \"Railway Act,\" \"traffic\" is defined to mean \"the traffic of passengers, goods and rolling stock.\" By sub-section 1, of section 284, it is enacted that:\nThe company shall, according to its powers:\n(a) Furnish, at the place of starting, and at the junction of the railway with other railways, and at all stopping places established for such purpose, adequate and suitable accommodation for the receiving and loading of all traffic offered for carriage upon the railway ;\n(b) Furnish adequate and suitable accommodation for the carrying, unloading and delivering of all such traffic;\n(c) Without delay, and with due care and diligence, receive, carry and deliver all such traffic; and\n(d) Furnish and use all proper appliances, accommodation and means necessary for receiving, loading, carrying, unloading and delivering such traffic.\nThe other sub-sections go on to make further provisions as to what \"adequate and suitable accommodation\" shall include and confer special powers on the Board to make orders respecting the same, and for the construction and carrying out of specific works or acquiring of property necessary under the circumstances.\nBut the controlling words upon the meaning to be given which the construction of the entire section rests are to be found in sub-section (a) above quoted:\nThe company shall * * * furnish, at the place of starting, and at the junction of the railway with other railways, and at all stopping places established for such purpose, etc.\nHere are three distinct places dealt with, first, starting places, secondly, junctions with other railways, and, thirdly, stopping places established for the purposes of receiving, loading, unloading and forwarding traffic. The question arises on the threshold of the argument: Do these places refer only to those which existed at the moment the railway was completed and running? By way of testing it I asked Mr. Chrysler, during the argument, whether he would contend that \"the junction of the railway with other railways\" was confined to junctions which existed at the time of the completion of the railway. He did not desire to commit himself on that point contenting himself with strenuously contending that \"stopping places established for such purpose\" of giving adequate and suitable accommodation for traffic purposes applied exclusively to such \"stopping places\" as. had been sanctioned and approved of when the railway plans were submitted to and approved of by the Board, and did not confer a power upon the Board of establishing such stopping places from time to time along the railway as increasing or changing trade and railway traffic might call for. Such additional stopping places for stations he submitted were left to the control and determination of the railway company itself. I confess the language of the statute is somewhat ambiguous. To sustain his argument I think the learned counsel would have to insert after the words \"established for such purpose\" in the third line of the subsection the words \"when the railway was completed,\" and to sustain my conclusion I have to insert the words \"from time to time.\"\nA fair and not an unreasonable test as to whether the section should be read with respect to such conditions only as existed when the plans of the road were approved and the road fully completed is to attempt to apply such a construction to the second of the three places dealt with, namely, at \"the junction of the railway with other railways.\" Such junctions are constantly being made under the orders of the Board under conditions fair to both railways and the protection of the public. It would be a narrow construction indeed which would limit the \"junctions\" mentioned in this section, and as to which the Board could exercise its powers of ordering a stopping place to be established and a station built to those only which existed at the time the railway was completed. No such construction would, in my judgment, be sound. The law must be interpreted as always speaking, and when it vests in the Board power to make the necessary orders to ensure \"adequate and suitable accommodation\" for the traffic on the road at the junctions of the railway with other railways it evidently means such junctions as are from time to time with the approval and sanction of the Board permitted. If the conclusion is once reached that the section refers as well to junctions existing on the completion of the road as to those subsequently established, then it would seem to follow, in the absence of clear and definite language shewing a contrary intention with regard to stations, that the same rule of construction was applicable to the language \"all stopping places established for such purpose.\" The section would, in this construction, carry out what one would suppose, looking at the main purpose and object of the Act, must have been the intention of Parliament. As the Chief Justice suggested, during the argument, the Act was an effort to combine private ownership with public control. But Mr. Chrysler suggested that the right of expropriation on the part of the company ceased with the completion of their road and that a construction would not be put upon the section involving a right on the part of the Board to make an order establishing a station upon a particular spot by a railway incompetent for want of statutory powers of expropriation to carry it out. The special conditions made in this order for the furnishing by the company of the lands necessary for the purposes of the station ordered might not, of course, necessitate the exercise of any compulsory powers. But that accident or fact cannot, of course, determine the jurisdiction of the Board. I find, however, in the 178th section the fullest powers given the railway companies for the compulsory taking of lands required by them, at any point, for (inter alia),\nthe construction or taking of any works or measures ordered by the Board, etc.\nI see no ground for limiting the construction of this section to such requirements as the railway company may, of its own motion, deem necessary, and excluding such as the Board may order against the company's wish. I think it fairly includes the latter. Looking, therefore, at the \"Railway Act\" as a remedial measure, establishing a public board of commissioners with powers to be used for the public protection in providing against abuses and preventible dangers and ensuring, amongst other things, adequate and suitable accommodation for the reception, delivery and forwarding of traffic, and construing section 284 with that knowledge, I can only conclude either that it does vest in the Board the authority claimed and exercised by it in this case of establishing a stopping-place within the meaning of those words in sub-section (a), or that there has been a casus omissus and one of the most necessary powers to ensure adequate and suitable traffic requirements overlooked. My construction of the language of the section saves me from accepting the latter conclusion.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014I regret to be driven to the conclusion that the Board has not jurisdiction to make the order in question.\nSection 284 of the \"Railway Act\" relied upon does not, to my mind, furnish such power as claimed.\nThe language of the first group of sub-sections of that section evidently pre-supposes established stopping-places, and proceeds accordingly to direct and render it possible for the Board further to direct the necessary details for executing its purposes.\nIt does not, except in sub-section 5, empower the establishment of new stopping-places.\nSub-section 5 expressly provides power for the Board to fix, under the circumstances therein specified, new stopping-places in such limited cases.\nIf there existed already anywhere the power to direct new stopping-places, that sub-section was quite unnecessary.\nIts existence seems to exclude any reasonable ground for attributing to any part of the whole section, or elsewhere in the Act, any general power to create new stopping-places.\nIt is urged that orders of a like kind have been made and obeyed as of course. I cannot see any force in that. It simply means the company so directed comprehended the importance of a public demand of which the official notice was thus given.\nRailway managers know these orders of the Board are not made for amusement and that it is an unwise thing, as mere business expediency, needlessly to antagonize the public.\nOf course, cases arise when such expediency may be overborne by other considerations.\nAs to the right to hear this appeal, I think the Board has, acting within its power, very properly, so placed the matter that there is no doubt of our jurisdiction to answer the question submitted.\nThe second part of Mr. Biggar's application, as adopted by the Board, is but a reason or ground of objection and does not necessarily cover the essence thereof.\n[Page 570.]\nI submit we should not be astute to find a means of evading answers to the submissions of the Board. The sooner any defect in jurisdiction is declared, the better so, that Parliament may act, if it find it expedient to do so.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether the Board of Railway Commissioners has authority to order a railway company having a railway in operation to establish a stopping-place where none exists.\nIn discussing the question it will be convenient to consider first the provisions of the Act which expressly deal with the establishment. of the sites of stations and stopping-places generally. By sub-section (g) of section 151 which defines the general powers of the company, the company is empowered itself to\nconstruct, erect and maintain all necessary and convenient * * * stations, depots, * * * and other structures necessary for the accommodation and use of the traffic and business of the railway;\nand by sub-section (p) from\ntime to time discontinue such works or any other of them * * * and substitute others in their stead.\nBy section 158, sub-sec. 2, it is provided that the plan of the railway, which by that section the company is directed to make, shall shew amongst other things the names of terminal points, and \"the station grounds\"; and by section 159\nsuch plan, profile, and book of reference shall be submitted to the Board which if satisfied therewith may sanction the same.\nBy section 258, sub-sec. 2, it is enacted, that\nbefore the company proceeds to erect any station upon its railway the location of such station shall be approved by the Board.\nThese are the only provisions of the Act which deal generally in express words with the assignment of sites for stations and stopping-places, and the result appears to be that all such sites are to be shewn upon the plan of the railway filed pursuant to section 158, and that no station other than those whose sites are exhibited upon this plan shall be subsequently established until the Board shall have approved the proposed site of it.\nThere is nothing in any of these provisions investing the Board with authority to compel the company against its will to establish any station or stopping-place at any site other than the sites shewn upon this plan or afterwards selected by the company with the approval of the Board under section 158(2). These I have said are the provisions which deal with the sites of stations and stopping-places generally. There is one other provision providing for a special case; and that is sub-section 5 of section 284. That sub-section is as follows:\u2014\nWhere a company's railway crosses or joins or approaches, in the opinion of the Board, sufficiently near to any other railway, upon which passengers or mails are transported, whether the last-mentioned railway is within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada or not, the Board may order the company so to regulate the running of its trains carrying passengers or mails, and the places and times of stopping them, as to afford reasonable opportunity for the transfer of passengers and mails between its railway and such other railway, and may order the company to furnish reasonable facilities and accommodation for such purpose.\nThese being all the provisions of the Act dealing expressly with the establishment of such sites, it is at once observable that while no general power is expressly conferred upon the Board to establish a site against the will of the company, there is such a power conferred in the specific case provided for in the enactment last quoted. If these were all the provisions of the Act having a bearing upon the question the result would I think be very clear. We should then have before us simply one of those cases in which a power is conferred to be exercised in a specific case, and there is no provision conferring a more general power. As a general rule when authority is given by statute to some person or body to do something in a specified case and no power is expressly given to do that thing generally it may be taken that any such general power has been withheld; for the simple reason that if the general power existed the grant of the special power would be superfluous.\nThe provisions to which I have referred are not, however, those upon which the respondent mainly relies in support of its contention. It invokes chiefly section 284, sub-sees, (a), (b), (c), (d), 2, 3, and 6, and section 317. Sub-sections (a), (b), (c), (d) of section 284, are as follows:\u2014\n284. The company shall, according to its powers,\u2014 (a) furnish, at the place of starting, and at the junction of the railway with other railways, and at, all stopping-places established for such purpose, adequate and suitable accommodation for the receiving and loading of all traffic offered for carriage upon the railway;\n(b) furnish adequate and suitable accommodation for the carrying, unloading and delivering of all such traffic;\n(c) without delay, and with due care and diligence, receive, carry and deliver all such traffic; and\n(d) furnish and use all proper appliances, accommodation and means necessary for receiving, loading, carrying, unloading and delivering such traffic.\nSub-section 6 of the same section provides that for the purposes of the section the Board may order \"that specific works be constructed or carried out,\" and by sub-section 3 it is enacted that \"if in any case such accommodation\" (i.e., the accommodation mentioned in sub-sections (a), (b), (c), (d)), \"is not in the opinion of the Board furnished by the company the Board may order the company to furnish the same.\" I am not able to find in any of these provisions any grant of authority to make such an order as that under appeal. The subject matters dealt with in these provisions are the facilities and accommodation to be furnished by the railway in the reception, loading, carrying and delivering of traffic. The application of these provisions necessarily presupposes in each case traffic in the course of transit or offered, for carriage or at the end of transit between a terminus a quo and a terminus ad quem. These provisions of the Act invest the Board with the supervision of the accommodation and facilities furnished by the company for the handling of such traffic; that is to say the reception and loading of traffic at places established for that purpose, the transport of it to places established for the delivery of it, and the delivery of it when it reaches its destination. Sub-section (a) which deals with reception and loading is confined in its application expressly to the place of starting, to the junction of the railway with other railways and to establish stopping-places. I do not think subsections (b), (c) and (d) have as regards stopping-places any wider application. Sub-section 2 applies only to junctions with private sidings or private branch railways; and sub-sec. 4 is in its operation expressly confined \"to the places aforesaid\" which would seem to include only the places mentioned in sub-section (a) and sub-section 2. In a word, with the single exception of sub-section 5 already dealt with, no part of section 284 appears to be directed to the establishment of stopping-places, but only to the facilities and accommodation to be afforded at such stopping-places, at the termini of the railway, and at its junction either with other railways generally or with private sidings or private railways.\nIt remains to deal with section 317, and a like remark applies to that section. The subject of it is the provision of proper facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of traffic, but it presupposes, I think, traffic offered for carriage from one point at which the railway is bound to receive traffic to another point at which the railway is bound to deliver it or in transit between such points or at its destination ready for unloading or delivery. In these two sections (284 and 317), moreover, the legislature had in contemplation these subjects of accommodation and facilities. The subject of the establishment of stopping-places is specifically dealt with, as I have already pointed out, in other sections of the Act. It would, I think, involve some departure from sound principles of construction to treat the general language used in these two sections (assuming it to be broad enough to embrace the subject of the establishment of stopping-places) as applicable to a subject which has been specifically dealt with elsewhere, and which the legislature had not immediately in view in framing these provisions.\nOne further point requires notice.\nIt was strongly pressed upon us by Mr. Lancaster in his able argument that the scheme of regulation provided for by the Railway Act is the embodiment of a policy to apply public regulation to railways privately owned and that no such scheme could be beneficial or effective which did not involve the grant to the regulating authority of the power to dictate the establishment from time to time of stopping-places for the reception and discharge of traffic. I think there is some danger in giving effect to considerations of this kind. A court of justice has no means of ascertaining the views of policy upon which legislation is based except through the interpretation of the language which the legislature had used, and indeed we are not concerned with the ultimate motives which have induced the legislature to pass the enactment to be construed, but only with the meaning of the legislative provisions themselves by which the legislature has seen fit to give legal effect to its views. \"Intention of the legislature,\" said Lord Watson, in Salomon v. Salomon[4], at page 38,\nis a common but very slippery phrase, which, popularly understood, may signify anything from intention embodied in positive enactment to speculative opinion as to what the legislature probably would have meant, although there has been an omission to enact it. In a court of law or equity, what the legislature intended to be done or not to be done can only be legitimately ascertained from that which it has chosen to enact, either in express words or by reasonable and necessary implication.\nThe appeal should in my opinion be allowed. There should be no costs.\nSince the above was written a new point not raised in the argument has been suggested based upon section 28, sub-sec. 1, and section 26, sub-sec. 2 of the Act. It is said that the effect of these two sections is that whatever the Board may authorize a company to do under the Act, that the Board may require a company to do. It is then argued that since, under sub-section 2 of section 258 and under section 167, the Board is authorized to approve the establishment of new stations, by the combined operation of these different provisions the Board acquires authority to direct the company in invitum to establish a new stopping-place and station. I am disposed to think that this construction of section 26, sub-section 2 is altogether too broad. The authority conferred upon the Board to require the company to do something it may authorize would seem to be intended to be exercised as ancillary only to the power to authorize. However that may be it seems to me there are two further answers to the argument:\u2014First, such general enactments as section 26, sub-section 2 when found in statutes containing a great variety of provisions relating to diverse subjects cannot be applied mechanically in every case in which the words read literally might appear to justify such application. They must be read with the other parts of the Act; and subject to the implied condition that they are only applicable where neither by express words nor by necessary implication arising out of the subject matter or the context a contrary intention is made to appear. Where the provisions relating to a specific subject matter in themselves shew that the legislature did not intend the power to authorize to include the power to require \u2014then according to well-established rules of construction the specific provision must prevail over the general. The foregoing discussion of the provisions relating to stations and facilities sufficiently indicates the grounds of my view that this subject of the establishment of stations has been dealt with in such a way as to exclude the application of any such rule as that said to be found in section 26, sub-sec. 2.\nAgain, giving to the words of section 26, sub-sec. 2, the wider signification, they could only be held to empower the Board to require something to be done (merely on the ground that the Board has power to approve such a thing) in circumstances in which approval by the Board is authorized. Sub-section 1 of sec. 28 does not help us in the least. That is only a section dealing with procedure; the substantial conditions of the jurisdiction of the Board to empower or authorize any given thing cannot be affected by it. Now sub-section 2 of section 258 involves not merely an application by the railway company which is a mere matter of procedure, but behind and giving rise to it a determination by the company to erect a station on its railway. The initiative of the company in that substantial sense is the essence of the whole provision. That condition is wanting here. So the condition of the operation of sec. 167 is that some alteration shall be required by the company to be made; that is the substantial condition on which the Board's jurisdiction rests. The application of section 28, sub-secs. 1 and 2, to these provisions in the sense proposed seems to me for these reasons not to be permissible.\nAnglin. J.\u2014I am of opinion that the sixty-day limitation imposed by section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" does not apply to appeals from the Board of Railway Commissioners under section 56 of the \"Railway Act.\" Sections 36 et seq. of the \"Supreme Court Act\" confer rights of appeal from provincial courts. To these appeals section 69 applies. A right of appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners is, in certain cases, conferred by the \"Railway Act,\" which imposes the condition that in cases where the appeal is upon a question of jurisdiction the leave of a judge of this court shall first be had, and, in cases where the appeal is on a question of law, the leave of the Board shall be obtained. I see no reason for holding that section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" applies to these appeals so as to add another condition. Sub-section 7, of section 56, of the \"Railway Act\"\u2014which makes applicable to appeals from the Board of Railway Commissioners the rules and practice applicable to appeals from the Exchequer Court\u2014tends to confirm this view.\nIf section 82 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" applies, the Board probably had jurisdiction to make the order pronounced by it, extending the time for appealing. If section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" were applicable, in so far as this appeal involves a question of law, the Board would probably have the like power under section 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" But I find nothing to warrant the view that an appeal will not lie under sub-section 2, of section 56, of the \"Railway Act,\" unless the leave of a judge of this court be obtained and the appeal brought within sixty days from the date of the judgment appealed from. The preliminary objection, therefore, in my opinion, fails. By sub-section 2, of section 258, of the \"Railway Act,\" it is provided that\nbefore the company proceeds to erect any station upon its railway, the location of such station shall be approved of by the Board.\nThere is nothing to confine the application of this sub-section to railways projected or in course of construction; nothing to exclude from it railways already in operation.\nBy section 167, it is provided that\nif any deviation, change or alteration is required by the company to be made in the railway or any portion thereof as already constructed, * * * a plan, etc., shall be submitted for the approval of the Board.\nAnd, upon approval and deposit of such plan, etc., the company is authorized to make such deviation, change or alteration. By section 2(21), \"railway\" is declared to include \"stations.\" The establishment of a new station or stopping-place is a change or alteration in the railway.\nIt is reasonably plain from these provisions that the Board has jurisdiction to authorize the construction by the company of stations at new or additional stopping-places upon its lines already constructed and that, without such authorization, the company cannot lawfully establish a new station.\nThese provisions, however, seem to contemplate authorization on the application of the railway company.\nBut, by section 28(1), the Board is empowered to determine \"of its own motion,\" any matter or thing which it may determine upon application, and it is, when so acting, given \"the same powers as upon any application.\"\nIt may, therefore, of its own motion authorize the construction by the company of stations at new or additional stopping-places.\nThen, by section 26(2), it is provided that\nthe Board may order and require any company or person to do forthwith, and within or at any specified time, and in any manner prescribed by the Board, so far as is not inconsistent with this Act, any act, matter or thing which such company or person is or may be required or authorized to do under this Act.\nBeing empowered to authorize the company to erect stations at new or additional points and being clothed by the sub-section last quoted with authority to order and require the company to do that which it may be authorized to do, it would seem to follow that the Board has jurisdiction to order and require the erection of a station at a new and additional stopping-place upon a railway already constructed.\nThese provisions suffice, in my opinion, to support the order in appeal. Reference may also be made to sections 158 (2c) and 159.\nSections 177 and 178 confer powers of expropriation quite sufficient to enable the company to carry out any order of the Board such as that in appeal. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H. Biggar.\nSolicitor for the respondents: E. A. Lancaster.\n[1] 3 Ry. & Can.

[1897] c. 208.\nBy sec. 41 of the \u201cOntario Street Railway Act\u201d (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 208), no municipal council shall grant to a street railway company any privilege thereunder for a longer period than twenty years, and at the expiration of a franchise so granted, or earlier if so agreed upon, it may, on giving six months\u2019 previous notice to the company, assume the ownership of the railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof on payment of the value of the same to be determined by arbitration.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (19 Ont. L.R. 57), that the proper mode of estimating the value of the \u201crailway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof,\u201d was not by capitalizing its net permanent revenue and taking that as the value, but by estimating what it was worth as a railway in use and capable of being operated, excluding compensation for loss of franchise.\nHeld, also, that in view of the provisions in the \u201cStreet Railway Act\u201d authorizing the municipality to assume ownership of a street railway operating in two or more municipalities the company in this case whose railway was taken over by the Town of Berlin was not entitled to compensation for loss of its franchise in the municipality of Waterloo.\nOn the expiration of its franchise the company executed an agreement extending for two months the time for assumption of ownership by the municipality, but did not relinquish possession until six months more had elapsed. During the extended time an Act was passed by the legislature reciting all the circumstances, ratifying and confirming the agreement for extension and authorizing the municipality to take possession on payment of the award subject to any variation in the amount by the court.\nHeld, that though this Act did not expressly provide for taking possession on the same footing as if it had been done immediately on the expiration of the franchise its effect was, not to confer on the municipality a new right of expropriation in respect of an extended franchise, but merely to extend the time for assumption of ownership under the original conditions.\nThe rights of the company to compensation are defined by statute, and there is no provision for an allowance of ten per cent. over and above the actual value of the property.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton, who affirmed the award of arbitrators appointed to determine the value of the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway, the ownership of which had been assumed by the Town of Berlin on termination of the company\u2019s franchise.\nUnder the provisions of the \u201cOntario Street Railway Act\u201d the Town of Berlin assumed ownership of the Berlin & Waterloo Street Railway when its twenty-year franchise expired. The arbitrators appointed to determine the value of the railway stated in their award that\n\u201cWe find, award, adjudge and determine the value of the railway of the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway Company, Limited, and of all the real and personal property in connection with the working thereof to be the sum of seventy-five thousand two hundred dollars ($75,200.00), which sum is the actual present value of the railway and of the real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, not taking into account or in any way dealing with the bonded debt of the company, which is a charge upon the property of the company and which bonded debt was stated to us to be thirty thousand dollars.\n\u201cWe further find, award and determine that the said railway and the said real and personal property so valued by us consist of and include the railway and all the real and personal property specified or mentioned in the schedule marked \u201cA\u201d hereto annexed, and that the above mentioned sum so found by us is the value of the said railway and property free and clear and fully and completely discharged of and from all mortgages, debentures, bonds, debts, liens, incumbrances, claims and demands whatsoever, either at law or in equity of every nature and kind whatsoever.\n\u201cIn arriving at the above value we have valued the railway as being a railway in use and capable of being used and operated as a street railway and have not allowed anything for the value of any privilege or franchise whatsoever, either in the Town of Berlin or in the Town of Waterloo.\n\u201cIt was argued before us on behalf of the Street Railway Company that the mode and principle of valuation should be to ascertain the amount of the present net earning power of the railway and to capitalize this amount so as to reach the correct value of the railway and the real and personal property in connection therewith. We have not been able to assent to that contention and have not reached our valuation as above in any way on that basis, but have considered only the actual present value.\n\u201cIt was argued on behalf of the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway Company that if our valuation was upon actual present value, we should add to the amount found by us as such present value, ten per cent. of that value as for compulsory taking. We have not been able to accede to this contention and have not added anything on that account.\u201d\nThis award was affirmed on appeal therefrom by Mr. Justice Britton, but on further appeal it was sent back to the arbitrators by the Court of Appeal, which held the true principle of determining the value of the company\u2019s property to be by capitalizating its net permanent revenue and taking that as the value. The municipality then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe franchise of the company expired in September, 1906, and by agreement between the company and the municipality the time for the latter to assume ownership was extended to November 1st, but possession was not given up until May, 1907. In April, 1907, the legislature of Ontario passed an Act reciting all the circumstances, confirming the agreement for extension and authorizing the town council to take possession on paying the amount of the award subject to variation thereof on appeal.\nShepley K.C. and Drayton K.C. for the appellants. The franchise cannot be regarded in determining the value of the railway. See Stockton and Middlesborough Water Board v. Kirkleatham Local Board[2]; Toronto Street Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[3]; Edinburgh Street Tramways Co. v. Lord Provost of Edinburgh[4].\nBicknell K.C. and McPherson K.C. for the respondents, cited London County Council v. London Street Tramways Co.[5]; Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[6]; Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Co.[7]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario, to which I can find very little that is useful to add.\nIt is impossible for me to distinguish this case from The Toronto Street Railway Co. v. The City of Toronto[8]. The statute and by-laws under which the company respondent operated its railway in the Towns of Berlin and Waterloo practically constitute an agreement which is in terms identical with that made between Easton and the City of Toronto. In that case the precise point on which the Court of Appeal proceeds was negatived as appears by the reasons for appeal, paragraph 14 of which reads as follows:\nIn any case whether the franchise, as such, is property to be valued under the 18th resolution or not, the proper method of arriving at the value of the \u201crailway\u201d was and is to capitalize its earning power, and, as the learned arbitrators have admittedly not proceeded upon that basis, the matter should be referred back with proper directions upon the subject.\nThe respondent obtained its franchise and privileges in and upon the streets of Berlin and Waterloo subject to the right of the appellant to assume the ownership of the railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof on payment of the value to be determined by arbitration. This is, therefore, not a case of compulsory taking to fix the amount of compensation to which the respondents are entitled not only for their railway, but for the undertaking, which would include the charter, in- corporation and charter rights. This is an arbitration under an agreement to ascertain, at the expiry of the twenty years period for which the municipal franchise was granted, and when the right to use the streets had lapsed, the value not of the undertaking, but of the properties enumerated in the agreement as a railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, or, in other words, this is an arbitration to fix the value of that part of the undertaking in which the respondents had, at that time, an interest, the property of the line without any privileges of user.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES and IDINGTON JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Anglin J.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of the Chief Justice of Ontario and with the reasons upon which it is based. I would allow the appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With great respect for the opinion of the learned judges who constituted the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nAll questions as to the right of the Town of Berlin to give the statutory notice, under section 41 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, ch. 208, and to acquire the railway of the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway Company, as to the sufficiency of such notice and as to the validity and efficacy of the arbitration had and award made are concluded in favour of the municipality by the statute 7 Edw. VII. ch. 58, subject only to any variation on appeal in the amount allowed by the arbitrators.\nThe Town of Berlin is in possession of the railway and the company does not now dispute the right of the municipality to retain and operate it. The sole question presented for determination upon this appeal is whether, on a proper construction of sections 41 and 42 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario (1897), ch. 208,\nthe value of the railway and of all real and personal property connected with the working thereof\nis limited to its value as\na railway in use and capable of being used and operated as a street railway\u2014\nwhich the arbitrators have allowed\u2014or should be deemed to include, as part of the property to be valued and paid for, the privilege or franchise of operating the railway or any part thereof as a privilege or franchise in perpetuity, or for a further term of definite or indefinite duration; whether the amount to be paid by the municipality is only the present value of the tangible or corporeal property of the company taken as a whole and available for immediate use, or includes, in addition, compensation for the loss or deprivation of a profitable franchise or privilege terminated by the act of the municipality.\nMr. Justice Britton, affirming the finding of the arbitrators, held that the former is the correct view of the extent of the company\u2019s right to compensation. The Chief Justice of Ontario, dissenting in the Court of Appeal, took the same view. The majority of the judges in that court, however, reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton, held that the company is entitled to be paid a sum equal to a capitalization of its income, everything abnormal in such income being eliminated.\nI shall first deal with the question as if the present case were admittedly governed by section 41 (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 208), alone, i.e., as if the entire railway had consisted of a line or lines within the corporate limits of the Town of Berlin and all proper steps had been taken and an award and payment of the amount thereby fixed had been duly made in time to permit of the assumption of the railway by the municipality immediately upon the expiry of the twenty years\u2019 term mentioned in section 41.\nThat the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway Company had a privilege of which their enjoyment was limited to a term of twenty years,\nat the expiry of which the privilege or franchise of the railway company ceased,\nis, I think, incontrovertible upon the authority of Toronto Street Railway Co. v. The City of Toronto[9].\nIt is obvious that an amount based upon capitalization of revenue or profits earned by the company during some period preceding the expiry of the twenty years\u2019 term would include an allowance or compensation for loss of franchise, because such earnings or profits are attributable not merely to the capital invested in the physical constituents or corporeal property of the company, but also to the exercise of the privilege of operation. Without a railway system the franchise would not be profit-earning; without a privilege to operate the railway system would not be revenue-producing. What proportion of the earnings or profits should be treated as the legitimate return from the capital invested in corporeal property\u2014rails, ties, rolling stock, etc.\u2014and what proportion should be ascribed to the exercise of the franchise, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine. Unless, therefore, the terms\nthe railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof\ninclude the franchise or privilege to operate, notwithstanding its terminable character, the value of the former cannot be ascertained by a capitalization of the revenue or profits of the company during any period short or long.\nThe construction of the statute as to the subject-matter of the valuation to be made cannot, I venture to think, be dependent, as suggested by Garrow J.A., upon whether the company\u2019s undertaking has been carried on at a loss or whether it has been productive of profit. Neither are we concerned whether, upon what may otherwise be found to be the proper interpretation of the statutory contract, the municipality will\ngain at the end of the twenty years at the expense of the company.\nAs pointed out by Lord Adam, in the passage from his judgment in the Edinburgh Tramways Case, in 1894[10], at page 698, quoted by Moss C.J.O., when the company accepted its franchise from the municipality under the statute 48 Vict. ch. 16, secs. 18 and 19, it took it, not as a right which would belong to it in perpetuity, but as a privilege, the enjoyment of which by it should be terminable; it took it subject to the contingency of the municipality exercising the power to terminate its rights; it took, therefore, with the full knowledge that except in so far as the statute may have otherwise provided, all its profits from its undertaking and investment must be made out of its earnings during the period for which the statute permitted that the privilege of operating should be committed to it, and, that, upon the extinction of its rights in the franchise, its right to compensation would be merely that which its statutory contract with the municipality confers. As tersely put by Garrow J.A.,\nEach has, had, or is entitled to have, simply what was bargained for.\nWhether the privilege of operation held by the company ceased to exist, or whether it continued in existence but was by the statute transferred to the municipality is an academic rather than a practical or material question. If transferred to the municipality, it was so by the operation of the statute. It ceased to belong to or to be exercisable by the company; it was no longer available to it for its benefit or profit. It was, after the statutory notice and upon the expiry of the twenty years, in no sense property of the company. Of the privilege to operate the company had been rather a lessee or a licensee than an owner. Its rights therein were temporary. Upon their termination the municipality became again seized in possession of its reversionary interest. To quote the language of Lord Shand, in the Edinburgh Tramways Case[11], at p. 487:\nIt is true that the local authority by the purchase acquires a more extensive right\u2014a right of a permanent nature. This might follow, as it appears to me, because of the direct right of property, or other direct interest, which the local authority has in the streets, and be- cause, having once acquired the undertaking, the local authority is under no obligation thereafter to sell it, as the promoters were. The permanent right thus acquired is not, however, conferred by the promoters, or acquired from them, but is conferred by the special provision of the statute.\nMoreover, the company originally acquired its franchise for nothing\u2014probably because of the temporary and terminable character of the rights which it received. If it was then intended that it should obtain a right to be compensated on the taking over of the railway upon the same footing as if it had been granted a franchise in perpetuity, it may well be that the municipality would have secured from the company a substantial consideration for the grant of such a franchise. There do not, therefore, appear to be any peculiarly equitable considerations which should affect in favour of the company the construction of the statutory contract between it and the municipality. The question is simply: For what has the legislature required that the municipality should pay on assuming the ownership of the railway?\nThat of which the statute says that the municipality shall pay the value is\nthe railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof,\nwhich it is authorized to assume. The company\u2019s privilege of operating being no longer available to it or exercisable by it, I am unable to see how it can be regarded as still subsisting as something for which the company is to be paid as part of its railway and property assumed by the municipality. The company\u2019s right of property in the railway, upon the expiry of the twenty years of enjoyment of the privilege of operation, appears to be what Lord Watson, in the Edinburgh Tramways Case11, at page 469, describes as property which does not carry with it the privilege of future user, but is such\nthat others than the owner selling may either possess or be in a position to acquire such privilege.\nAll interest of the company in the franchise having ceased to exist, it cannot be part of the \u201crailway\u201d or of the \u201cproperty\u201d which the municipality acquires from it.\nAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Britton, in sections 42 and 45 the assumption of the railway by the municipality is referred to as a purchase. In a purchase that for which payment is made is what the vendor is able to sell\u2014what the purchaser acquires from him. The franchise or right to operate the lines after they have been taken over, both within its own corporate limits and in those of the adjacent municipality, the town acquires, not from the company, but from the legislature under the statute. I cannot understand a purchase from the company of a right or privilege which \u201cwas not theirs to sell.\u201d Edinburgh Tramways Case[12], per Lord Watson, at page 473.\nThe word \u201crailway\u201d is defined in the interpretation section of chapter 208 as including a \u201ctramway.\u201d In no provision of the statute, other than sections 41 and 42, is it employed in a sense which could comprise the franchise or privilege of operation. In every instance it is used as descriptive merely of the physical structure owned by the company, which, according to Lord Watson, is its \u201cprimary and natural meaning\u201d (1), at p. 471. In section 41 it is used not as the equivalent of the undertaking of the company, which would include all its property, but as descriptive of one part of that undertaking, for the value of which, with that of other parts\u2014\u201call real and personal property\u201d\u2014payment is to be made. Having regard to the words \u201cin connection with the working thereof,\u201d which immediately follow them, the words \u201call real and personal property\u201d seem descriptive of \u201cphysical objects.\u201d Kingston Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Corporation of Kingston[13].\nIn view of these considerations the statutory description of the subject-matter to be valued, of which the ownership is to be assumed by the municipality, appears to be apt to define precisely what has been valued by the arbitrators in the present case, but inapt to cover, in addition, a franchise or privilege of operation.\nThe tenor of the authorities to which I have referred, although they deal with statutory and contractual provisions not identical with those now under consideration, is consistent only with this view.\nIf, therefore, the railway of the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway Company had been wholly within the corporate limits of the Town of Berlin and all necessary proceedings had been regularly and promptly taken under section 41 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, ch. 208, in my opinion the arbitrators would have been justified in excluding from their valuation any allowance in respect to the franchise or privilege to operate.\nBut much stress was laid by counsel for the respondents upon the fact that the railway in question lies not in a single municipality, but in at least two municipalities. It was pointed out that as a result of the taking over of this railway the Town of Berlin has acquired not merely a right to operate a street railway upon its own streets and within its own corporate limits, but also a right to operate such a railway in the Town of Waterloo, with \u201call the powers and authority theretofore enjoyed by the company.\u201d (Section 42.) This right, it is said, the Town of Berlin could not otherwise have acquired, and for this privilege or franchise counsel for the company argue that it is entitled to receive compensation.\nSection 42 of the statute (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 208), which provides for the case of a company\nwhose line or lines is or are situated in two or more municipalities,\ngives to one of such municipalities (ascertained by the statute)\nthe right to exercise the power of purchase herein conferred.\nThis right of purchase is that created by the next preceding section, and is the same right with the same incidents as is conferred on a municipality in regard to a railway which does not extend beyond its territorial limits. In such a case it is for\nthe railway and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof\nthat the company is to be paid. What these terms, in my opinion, mean, as used in section 41, I have endeavoured to state. Under section 42 quoad the company the railway is to be dealt with under the provisions of section 41; quoad the other municipalities interested, provision is made by sections 43 and 44 for the protection of their rights and the making of such terms in regard to the operation of the railway by the municipality assuming ownership as will ensure to such other municipalities due compensation for the value of the franchise or privilege to be exercised within their limits. Whatever the rights of the company may have been within any of the municipalities into which its lines extend those rights were all acquired subject to the provisions of the statute, including those of section 41, which are made applicable by section 42. They were taken with the knowledge and upon the contractual basis that their enjoyment by the company might be terminated by the exercise by one of the municipalities of the powers conferred by sections 41 and 42. The policy of the Act appears to be that the company shall be entitled to compensation for the same subject-matter whether the railway taken over operates in a single municipality or in several municipalities. In neither case, in my opinion, is it entitled to be paid for a franchise or privilege of operation, the term of its right to the enjoyment of which has expired. In each case whatever rights in the nature of a franchise or privilege to operate the purchasing municipality becomes entitled to exercise are conferred upon it not by the company, but by the statute. It is not the policy of the statute in the one case that the municipality should be obliged to buy back the right to use its own streets, nor in the other that it should have to pay the company for that part of the franchise which the statute confers upon it, but permits it to exercise only for the benefit of and as quasi-trustee for the other municipalities interested. In other words, in both cases alike the company is to be paid only for that which it really held as its own property and which the assuming municipality in fact acquires from it.\nIt was very strongly argued by Mr. Bicknell that because the Town of Berlin failed to exercise its right of assuming the railway immediately upon the expiration of the twenty years\u2019 period, a franchise for a further period of five years became vested in the company under sub-section 2, of section 41.\nBy an agreement of the parties providing for the appointment of arbitrators, etc., the time for assuming the ownership of the railway was extended from the 8th of September, 1906, to the 1st of November, 1906. The railway was not in fact taken over until May, 1907, when the company relinquished possession on receiving the sum awarded by the arbitrators.\nOn the 20th of April, 1907, the legislature of Ontario, in an Act which recites the circumstances in Which the railway came into existence, the steps taken by the municipality towards acquiring it, the agreement for the appointment of arbitrators and the award made on the 29th of December, 1906, expressly authorized the town, upon payment of the amount of the said award, to take over and enter into possession of the railway, etc., and ratified and confirmed the agreement and award,\nsubject, however, to such variation in the amount of the award as may be made on appeal.\nBecause this Act does not in express terms provide that the municipality may assume possession of the railway on the same footing as if it had in fact paid for and had assumed possession of it immediately upon the expiration of the twenty years\u2019 period, the respondents maintain that they are entitled to an award on the basis of their being compulsorily deprived of a franchise which they allege they had become entitled to enjoy for a further term of five years. Such, they argue, is, upon its proper construction, the effect of the statute of 1907.\nWhile this Act is by no means clear or free from ambiguity, read as a whole, and having regard to the recital of the proceedings, the affirmance of the award and the express limitation, on the question of amount, of the right to vary it upon appeal, it is, I think, clear that the legislature intended not to confer upon the town a new right of expropriation in respect of an extended franchise, but merely to further extend for a reasonable period (no date being stated), the time for taking over the railway upon the expiry of the twenty years\u2019 franchise, as the parties themselves had already extended it by the very agreement which the statute confirms. Having before it this agreement, which provides for the holding of an arbitration under section 41 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, ch. 208, and for its completion after the expiry of the twenty years\u2019 term, and an award which on its face was a valuation of\nthe railway and of all real and personal property used in connection therewith\nas of the date to which the expiry of the twenty years\u2019 period had been extended under the agreement of the parties, which incorporated the provisions of the \u201cOntario Arbitration Act\u201d\u2014an award which explicitly proceeds upon the basis that the franchise and privilege of operation of the company had been determined and that no allowance should be made in respect thereof, and expressly so states\u2014the legislature ratified and confirmed both the agreement and the award and authorized the town upon payment to the company of the sum awarded to take over and enter into possession of the railway, subject only to such varia- tion of the amount of the award as may be made upon appeal.\nIt is to me inconceivable that we should have had a statute in any such form if the legislature had intended to confer upon the municipality a new right of expropriation in respect of an extended franchise, such as the company now contends had become vested in it. The company had by its own agreement already waived payment for and assumption of the railway on the very day on which the twenty years\u2019 term expired and had thereby waived its right, if the agreement were carried out, to claim any extension of franchise under the statute. Circumstances having arisen which rendered legislation necessary\u2014the failure of the arbitrators to make an award before the 1st of November, the date fixed by the agreement for taking over the road, and the existence of a bonded debt on the railway for which provision had to be made\u2014the legislature, ratifying all that had been done, merely further extended the time for the actual payment of the amount of the award and the taking over of the road.\nHaving reached the conclusion that, apart entirely from the provisions of the Act of 1907, the arbitrators properly construed section 41 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, ch. 208, in excluding from their valuation everything in respect of franchise or privilege to operate, it is unnecessary to consider whether that statute of 1907 does not, by confining the right of appeal from the award to the amount awarded, entirely preclude the view that it is open to the present respondents to maintain upon appeal that the arbitrators should have included in their valuation such additional subject-matters as the right or franchise to operate, which they had explicitly excluded from their award. I express no opinion upon this question. As to the claim made that the arbitrators should have allowed ten per cent. above the actual value of the property acquired from the company as compensation for its being compulsorily taken, it suffices to say that the statute defines the rights of the company and does not provide for such an allowance.\nFor these reasons I would allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Ontario Court of Appeal, and would restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Scellen & Weir.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McPherson & Co.\n[1] 19 Ont.

L.R. 85) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant company.\nThe City of Toronto leased certain water lots to the Toronto Grape Sugar Co. for a term of twenty-one years, from July 1st, 1881, and covenanted that should the lessees at the expiration of the term, desire a renewal and give notice thereof to the lessors, the latter would renew for a like term or pay for improvements. This lease afterwards became vested in one Gooderham, who, in 1889, with the assent of the city in writing, sold a part of the leasehold premises to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., and the remainder was assigned with the like assent to the appellants in 1902, who shortly after gave notice to the city that they desired a further lease of the lots less the portion taken by the railway company and remained in possession for some time after the lease expired without notice that their request would be denied.\nIn June, 1902, the railway company gave notice to the appellants of their intention to expropriate another strip of the leased lands and took the necessary steps to accomplish their purpose. The action in this case was to settle the question of the appellants\u2019 right to compensation for the loss of a renewal of the lease for the portion of the land so taken.\nThe trial judge held that they were entitled to the renewal and, consequently, to the compensation claimed. His judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal and the defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nShepley K.C. and A.A. Miller for the appellants. The appellants were clearly entitled to a renewal unless barred by the severance. But a severance of the term does not prevent a reversioner from enforcing covenants in the lease: Piggott v. Middlesex County Council[2]; Winter\u2019s Case[3]; and the same principle applies here. Armour K.C. and MacMurchy K.C. for the respondent. To entitle the appellants to compensation they must have something which they could convey. In re Morgan and London & North Western Railway Co.[4]; The Queen v. Poulter[5]; here they had nothing as the right to renewal cannot be severed: Finch v. Underwood[6]; Cook v. Jones[7]; Barge v. Schick[8]. Even if it could they have no absolute right to renewal, as the city may elect to pay for improvements.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of what rights an assignee under an assignment by the lessee of a part of the demised premises comprised in a renewal lease acquired under and by virtue of the right of renewal, can have to further renewal, in the absence of any express provision in his favour therefor or anything from which an implication may be drawn conferring any such right upon such an assignee of a part.\nThe City of Toronto demised to the Toronto Grape Sugar Company certain lands for a term of twenty-one years from the 1st July, 1881.\nThe lease contained, besides the usual covenants to be found in such a lease, the following: The said lessors covenant with the said lessees for quiet enjoyment, and also that if at the expiration of the term hereby granted or of any future term of twenty-one years the said lessees, their successors or assigns shall be desirous of taking a new lease of the premises hereby granted for a further term of twenty-one years, having conformed to all the terms and conditions herein mentioned and set forth, and having given to the council of the said corporation thirty days\u2019 notice in writing of such desire, the said lessors will, at the costs and charges of the said lessees, their successors or assigns as aforesaid, grant such new lease for the further term of twenty-one years from the determination of the present or existing lease at such a rental per foot per annum as the said premises shall then be worth, irrespective of any improvements made by the said lessees, their successors or assigns, such value to be determined as hereinafter provided for determining the value of the lessees\u2019 improvements. Provided, that if the said lessors do not see fit to renew this or any future lease the said lessees, their successors or assigns, shall receive from the said lessors such reasonable sum as the buildings and permanent improvements made and erected by the said lessees shall then be worth, such value to be determined by three arbitrators nominated in writing for that purpose as follows:\u2014\nand then sets forth the method of constituting an authority to determine such questions as contemplated herein and the principles upon which such constituted authority should proceed and the means for enforcing its determination.\nThe assignees of this lease assigned, first, a part of the land so demised and the demise with right of renewal as to the part so assigned to one party and later assigned the rest of the land so demised, and the demise thereof with right of renewal to another party under whom the appellants claim.\nDid the appellants acquire thereby any legal or equitable right to a renewal of the lease, confined to and in respect of this part alone of the lands in the original lease?\nThey only acquired such rights as the above quoted covenant for renewal gave him.\nIt seems impossible to so read such a covenant, which by its express words refers only to the whole, as to make it applicable only to a part thereof. How can we (when we go beyond these words and try to find some implication therein or in the rest of the contract making it or them relative to a part only), apply distributively all the conditions and incidents to be dealt with in relation to the whole, as if in any way relevant to a diversity of notices to be given, by divers persons, and of rents to be reserved, to say nothing of covenants to be entered into, and last, but not least, the right of distress? The simple method and principles to determine the conditional rights relative to the whole and the alternatives of refusal and payments for buildings thereon seem unfitted and inapplicable to the complex case of parts and possibly numerous parts.\nI can find no shadow of warrant for claiming a right of renewal to the assignee of a part.\nThat should end the appellants\u2019 claims as far as I am concerned, but for what they urge is to be drawn from the terms of the consents which were given by the respondents to these assignments.\nThere was the usual proviso in the lease for its forfeiture on the event of assignment or sub\u2011letting without the leave of the landlord.\nThe consent to the first is as follows:\nThe corporation of the City of Toronto in accordance with an order of the Committee on Property of the said corporation made on the 13th day of April, A.D. 1893, being Minute No. 149 and pursuant to By-law No. 2445, hereby consents to the annexed lease and agreement dated the 5th day of February, A.D. 1889, but such consent shall not be considered or construed to be a waiver of the covenant in the original lease of the within described leasehold premises from the said corporation to the Toronto Grape Sugar Company not to assign and shall not extend or be construed to extend beyond the permission to execute the annexed indenture, nor shall it be taken to sanction the removal of any improvements of any kind now or that may hereafter be placed upon the said premises. The second is somewhat more lengthy, but in my view no more effective for the appellants\u2019 purpose than this.\nBesides, the first instrument which this one relates to lends itself by its express language as to a renewal much more readily than does that of the second one to aid the argument submitted on this appeal.\nIt is said that as these instruments profess to assign the right of renewal therefore we must hold these consents thereto respectively as of a contractual nature extending the original obligation of the respondent and distributing its benefits.\nSuch, though not the language of the forcible argument addressed to us, must be taken in light of what I have said to be what it means or nothing.\nWe must always have regard to the business the parties had in hand. Obviously all that ever was intended was to avert a possible forfeiture.\nSeeing the far-reaching results of holding otherwise, and the radical changes in the original contract to be thereby implied, I cannot find any such implication as reasonably within the contemplation of the parties to this consent.\nMoreover, the possibility existed of the severance being got over by later assignments uniting the right to renewal in one person as a lessee who might claim the benefits of the right to claim a renewal of the term as a whole.\nIndeed, having regard to the general powers of a municipal corporation, though no point was made of that, I suspect a by-law giving express authority to so modify the contract would likely be necessary.\nIn the view I have taken altogether apart from this last suggestion, I do not think it necessary to follow the matter in the many subsidiary conditions under and in relation to which the right is set up.\nThere is no foundation in law therefor, however hard or possibly unjust in light of what an ordinary business man might reasonably have expected.\nNor can I find any solid basis for the argument sought to be drawn from the alleged compulsory nature of the transfer to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. I concur in the reasons given by my brother Idington.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The material facts are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell.\nI agree in his view that the rights of the parties\nare to be determined as of the 21st September, 1903, as provided by statute 51 Vict. ch. 59, sec. 145, and now by R.S.C. [1906] ch. 37, sec. 192(2).\nThis, the learned judge says, was \u201cadmitted, and indeed the common case before me.\u201d The subsequent transactions between the city and the railway company, and between the city and the defendants, have no bearing upon the question presented for adjudication, which is whether the defendants had or had not, on the 21st September, 1903, an interest in the lands expropriated by the railway company for which they are entitled to compensation. If the defendants then had a right to a renewal of the lease, which had expired on the 30th June, 1902, and were in a position to claim that this right should be enforced against their lessors in an action for specific performance, they had, in my opinion, an interest in respect of which they are entitled to compensation from the expropriating railway company.\nOn the authority of Ward v. City of Toronto[9]\u2014which, I may be permitted to say with respect, was, in my opinion, well decided upon the ground stated by Moss J.A.[10], and by Meredith C.J.9, at p. 733, concurred in by Osler J.A.10\u2014I am of the opinion that, had there been no prior severance of the term, the defendants would have been, on the 21st September, 1903, absolutely entitled to a renewal of their lease from the City of Toronto. They had given notice of their desire for renewal more than thirty days before the expiry of their lease. They had, in the meantime, remained in possession of the leasehold premises, and had not received any notice from the municipal corporation that it had elected against renewal, and would pay for improvements. This election the city would, I think, have been bound to make and to notify to its lessees before the expiry of their lease, or, at all events, within a reasonable time thereafter. If, as seems not improbable, the defendants remained in possession under the provisions of their expired lease10, at p. 228, per Maclennan J., two gales of rent had accrued due since its expiry. It seems to me impossible that, had there been no severance, the city, on the 21st September, 1903, could still have retained its right to elect against its covenant to renew. Unless the city had exercised its right of election against its covenant within the time allowed under the terms of the lease that covenant would have become absolute and the right of the defendants to renewal might have been specifically enforced.\nThe only refusal of the city was a refusal to renew as demanded by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in respect of another part of the leasehold premises acquired by it some years before. With the consequences of the severance of the term then effected I shall presently deal. But, if there had been no such severance, or if, notwithstanding such severance, the original lessees had, in respect of the portion of the lands not alienated, a several right of renewal which passed to the defendants as assignees, it is impossible to treat the refusal to grant a renewal to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as in any sense a refusal to grant a renewal to the defendants.\nI am, therefore, with respect, of the opinion that the judgment in appeal cannot be supported on the ground on which I understand it to have been put by Mr. Justice Garrow.\nBut the judgment must, I think, be supported because of the severance of their term by the original lessees in 1889. They then agreed to sell part of their leasehold premises to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and this agreement was carried out by an assignment of lease in January, 1902.\nBy the agreement of 1889 the vendors agreed to sell all their right, title and interest in the lands to be conveyed \u201cincluding all right of renewal of the lease in respect of such lands.\u201d For the defendants it is contended that when the city consented to the execution of this agreement\u2014as it did by writing under seal indorsed on the document\u2014it thereby assented to an apportionment of the covenant for renewal. It was not argued that a covenant for renewal is apportionable by a lessee without the consent of his lessor; and, although it has been held that the assignee of part of leasehold premises may, without joining his co-assignees, recover damages from a mesne landlord for breach of a covenant to apply for and do his utmost to procure a renewal of the head lease[11], it by no means follows that a covenant on the part of the lessor to renew would confer upon an assignee of part of the leasehold premises a like right as against the lessor\u2014still less a right to maintain an action for specific performance of the covenant.\nAt a later date (February, 1902) the original lessees sold and assigned the residue of their leasehold rights to the defendants, including\nall right of renewal or payment for buildings or improvements in place of renewal.\nTo the execution of this assignment the lessors also assented, and it is contended that they thus recognized the covenant for renewal as still subsisting, and also again agreed to its apportionment.\nThe primary purpose of procuring the consent of the lessors to each of the assignments made by the original lessees was to avoid committing a breach of the lessees\u2019 covenant not to assign or sublet without leave. But I have no doubt that, assuming that the effect of the severance would otherwise have been to entirely relieve the lessors from their covenant to renew, they effectively waived their right to take that position, because some right of renewal was unquestionably recognized by them as still subsisting, when, in February, 1902, they assented to the assign- ment to Brown, which expressly purported to give to him rights under the covenant for renewal in the lease.\nIt does not, however, follow that there was an assent by the city to an apportionment of its covenant such that, as a result of each assignment, the assignee became entitled by way of renewal to a separate lease of the part of the leasehold premises thereby transferred.\nThe transfer to each of the assignees was merely of the lessees\u2019 right of renewal in respect of the part of the lands conveyed. That right was not for renewal as to these lands separately, but only as part of the entire leasehold premises. The landlords\u2019 covenant was merely to give one renewal of the lease of the whole. Had the original lessees remained the owners of the entire leasehold premises no one would suggest that they could ask for separate renewal leases of the two parcels into which they divided the property.\nUnder the covenant to renew the tenant can only ask for such a lease as the landlord covenanted to grant.\nFinch v. Underwood[12], per Mellish L.J., at p. 316. It is difficult to understand how he can by any act of his vest any other right in his assignees. The lessors\u2019 burden might be much increased by the granting of such separate leases; their rights and remedies would be materially diminished.\nIt is quite consistent with the terms of the consents actually given that the only right of renewal on the part of the assignees to which the lessors assented was, in the first case, a right to be exercised by the lessees and their assignee jointly, and in the second, a right to be exercised jointly by the two assignees, to take a single new lease of the entire premises at a single rental for the whole of which both should in each case become liable. There is nothing in the documents to warrant a construction which would carry the obligation of the lessors or the rights of the lessees or their assigns further. It would require the substitution of a new and a different covenant on the part of the lessors to support the contention of the defendants, and the burden is upon them to establish that such a covenant was in fact entered into. This they have, in my opinion, not done.\nAlthough notice demanding a renewal was given by the defendants in respect of the part of the leasehold premises assigned to them and a similar notice by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in respect of the part held by it, there was no notice given on behalf of both or either of the assignees demanding a single renewal of lease of the entire premises. In the view I have taken of the proper construction and effect of the document in evidence, no notice was given to the lessors which complied with the condition attached to the covenant for renewal. This covenant, therefore, never became operative and for this reason neither of the lessees\u2019 assignees became entitled to renewal.\nMr. Shepley urged that because the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company was in a position to expropriate the interest of the original lessees in the leasehold lands which they agreed to sell to the company in 1889, the transfer of that interest to the company should be regarded as made under compulsion of law. The railway company could not have expropriated the lessees\u2019 interest alone. Their only right by this method was to acquire the fee. They certainly could not have obtained in expropriation proceedings any such agreement as they actually secured from the lessees. I, therefore, think it impossible that the transaction between the lessees and the railway company should be treated as the equivalent of a compulsory acquisition by the latter of these leasehold lands.\nBut if, notwithstanding these objections, the severance effected in 1889 may be treated as involuntary, I cannot see how that fact would justify the imposition upon the lessors of a covenant for renewal other than and different from that which they had made. This case is, I think, distinguishable from Piggott v. Middlesex County Council[13], relied on by Mr. Shepley. It was there held that an involuntary severance of a reversion did not destroy the condition of re-entry. The saving of a condition such as that of re-entry differs materially from the imposition of a new and different obligation such as the renewal in parcels of a lease which the lessor had agreed to renew only in entirety.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Donald & Miller.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Angus MacMurchy.\n[1] 18 Ont.

Several city streets abutted on the north side of the \"Esplanade,\" and the general public passed along the prolongations of these streets, with vehicles and on foot, for the purpose of access to the harbour. In 1892, an agreement was entered into between the city and the two railway companies respecting the removal of the sites of terminal stations, the erection of overhead traffic bridges and the closing or deviation of some of these streets. This agreement was ratified by statutes of the Dominion and provincial legislatures, the Dominion Act (56 Vict. ch. 48), providing that the works mentioned in the agreement should be works for the general advantage of Canada. To remove doubts respecting the right of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to the use of portions of the bed of the harbour on which they had laid their tracks across the prolongations of the streets mentioned, a grant was made to that company by the Dominion Government of the \"use for railway purposes\" on and over the filled-in areas included within the lines formed by the production of the sides of the streets. At a later date the Dominion Government granted these areas to the city in trust to be used as public highways, subject to an agreement respecting the railways, known as the \"Old Windmill Line Agreement,\" and excepting therefrom strips of land 66 feet in width between the southerly ends of the areas and the harbour, reserved as and for \"an allowance for a public highway.\" In June, 1909, the Board of Railway Commissioners, on application by the city, made an order directing that the railway companies should elevate their tracks on and adjoining the \"Esplanade\" and construct a viaduct there. Held, Girouard and Duff, JJ. dissenting, that the Board had jurisdiction to make -such order; that the street prolongations mentioned were highways within the meaning of the \"Railway Act\"; that the Act of Parliament validating the agreement made in 1892 was not a \"special Act\" within the meaning of \"The Railway Act\" and did not alter the character of the agreement as a private contract affecting only the parties thereto, and that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, having acquired only a limited right or easement in the filled-in land, had not such a title thereto as would deprive the public of the right to pass over the same as a means of communication between the streets and the harbour.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by leave of the Board on a question of law and on a question of jurisdiction by leave of Mr. Justice Duff.\nThe material facts on which the order of the Board was based are sufficiently set out in the above head-note. The order, omitting the portion respecting damages and costs was as follows:\u2014\n\"In the matter of the application of the City of Toronto, hereinafter called the \"city,\" for an order directing the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter called the \"railway companies,\" to carry York Street and certain other streets in the said city under the tracks of the said railway companies.\n\"Upon hearing the evidence, and counsel for the city, the railway companies, the Toronto Board of Trade and a number of land-owners in the said city\u2014\n\"It is ordered and directed:\u2014\n\"1. That the railway companies, within two years from the date of this order, construct a four-track viaduct from a point west of John Street to a point at or near Berkeley Street, with three tracks on either side of such viaduct east of Church Street, at the present grade of the Esplanade, with all necessary crossovers and as shewn on a plan filed by the Grand Trunk Railway Company on April 27th, 1909, except where changes as hereinafter set forth are necessary, and except that Bay and Yonge Streets shall each have a total width of eighty feet between abutments under the viaduct, and that from the point of junction of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Grand Trunk elevated tracks at or near Berkeley Street to Scott Street, the centre line of the viaduct shall be located on the southerly boundary of the Esplanade, except at the curve in the tracks in the vicinity of West Market Street.\n\"2. That the Canadian Pacific Railway Company elevate two tracks from the point at or near Berkeley Street where the said tracks will connect with the tracks on the viaduct referred to in paragraph 1, to Queen Street, providing a clear headway of fourteen feet over the following streets, Parliament, Trinity and Cherry, and a clear headway of ten feet over Vine and Front Streets; and that the railway companies construct a bridge to carry the highway at Eastern Avenue over the railway tracks with a clear headway of twenty-two feet six inches over the base of the rail; the openings at Front and Vine Streets to be each thirty feet between abutments and at Parliament, Trinity and Cherry Streets to be each a width of sixty-six feet between abutments.\n\"3. That the Grand Trunk Railway Company, within two years from the date of this order, elevate two tracks from the point at or near Berkeley Street where the said tracks will connect with the tracks on the said viaduct, to Logan Avenue, providing a clear headway of fourteen feet over the following streets, Parliament, Cherry, Eastern Avenue and Queen Street, and ten feet over Trinity Street.\n\"4. That the railway companies, within two years from the date of this order, construct bridges to carry the highways at John Street and Spadina Avenue over the tracks on the said viaduct or the extension of the said tracks westerly, with a clear headway over the base of the rail of twenty-two feet six inches.\n\"5. That the Canadian Pacific Railway Company be permitted to construct and maintain two tracks at grade, one on either side of its elevated tracks, that on the north side commencing at or near Queen Street and crossing the intervening streets between Queen and Parliament Streets, and that on the south side commencing at or near the Don Esplanade, crossing intervening streets and passing under the Grand Trunk Railway Company's elevated tracks referred to in paragraph 3, between Parliament and Berkeley Streets, with a clear headway of seventeen feet and an opening of the width of seventeen feet, measured at right angles to the track.\n\"6. That the Grand Trunk Railway Company be permitted to construct and maintain a track, at grade, at or near Berkeley Street, under the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, referred to in paragraph 2, with a clear headway over the base of the rail of seventeen feet. The width of the opening under the said tracks to be seventeen feet, measured at right angles to the track.\n\"7. That concurrently with the completion of the works ordered in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, and as soon as the railway companies can operate their trains thereon, the railway companies shall alter and arrange their yards and sidings so that no tracks on ground level shall cross Bay Street, Yonge Street or Church Street, in the said city.\n\"8. That after the completion of the work ordered in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, and as soon as the railway companies can run their trains thereon, no locomotive or car be moved on tracks at ground level between Church Street and Parliament Street during the months of May, June, July, August and September, except between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.; Provided, however, that cars containing fruit or other perishable merchandise may be moved across streets within the said limits at any time when a flagman on foot precedes the train (engine, car or cars) to warn persons on such streets that a train is approaching.\n\"9. That the city shall, within one year from the date of this order lay out, complete and dedicate a new street south of the viaduct, from the easterly limit of Church Street produced to the westerly limit of Berkeley Street produced, which shall have a width of at least forty-seven and one-half feet, and acquire the lands necessary therefor, and pass all necessary by-laws for that purpose; and shall grade the said street; the share of the cost of such work as between the railway companies to be reserved for further consideration, along with the questions covered by paragraph 14 hereof.\n\"10.

(dissenting).\u2014We have been treated to an interesting though rather long history of certain lands and water lots in front of the city of Toronto, for many years known as the Esplanade, going as far back as old Muddy York in 1818. As I understand the case, I do not think it is at all necessary, for the purposes of this appeal, to go so far back. It cannot be denied that from 1855 and after, the Grand Trunk Railway Company had been authorized to use, and did in fact use, certain parts of the Esplanade for the purposes of their railway, and that likewise in 1888 the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., in right of the Quebec and Ontario Railway Co., held water-lots to the south of the Esplanade which they filled in, and where they put their tracks, yards and sheds and have used them ever since, subject to certain subsequent alterations. The location and operation of these railways were made not only with the consent of the corporation of the City of Toronto, but also with the express approbation of the competent legislatures. If the present Railway Commission had not been created with most extensive, and even legislative powers, I would feel inclined to apply the rule held by the Privy Council in the case of the Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[1], but I believe that now that decision cannot have any application.\nHere the applicant is not the Attorney-General claiming a jus publicum over certain railways, but the Railway Commission first ex proprio motu, and later on, on the special application of the City of Toronto, has taken cognizance of the situation and has ordered certain works to be done for the \"protection, safety and convenience of the public,\" crossing over certain railways. Extraordinary powers, far exceeding any existing in the Railway Acts of any other country, are given to the Railway Board, and it might be possible that the Board had jurisdiction to issue the order given to build a viaduct and other works specified in the Order No. 7,200, dated 9th June, 1909, unless prohibited by some statute from so doing.\nThe reasons advanced by the Commissioners for giving this order may be unreasonable, and the work to be done even absurd; this court has nothing to do with any such possibilities, and unless it can be shewn that the Board has no jurisdiction or acted contrary to the Railway Act, this court cannot interfere, for the Board can do almost anything in relation to railways, except when prohibited by Parliament. As we held in a recent case, In re Canadian Northern Railway Co.[2], the Board cannot change the \"Railway Act\" of the Parliament of Canada; and I have arrived at the conclusion that, in this instance, they have violated that Act, because the subject matter of the order given by them has already been provided for by the parties and the legislatures interested, not exactly in the same manner and by the same kind of works, that is a viaduct, but by other works which had been found satisfactory to all intents and purposes and must stand until otherwise ordered by Parliament.\nThere is no doubt that the two railway companies all along, from the very first day they obtained possession of their lands in front of the City of Toronto for the purposes of their railways, knew that the cross streets abutting on the Esplanade might one day be prolonged to the water's edge, so as to afford public access to the front lots and to the bay or lake, in a convenient and safe manner, due regard being given to the growth of a progressive commercial city. All the plans and documents produced shew the possible prolongation of these cross streets. The two railway companies soon realized the situation and finally came to an arrangement with the City of Toronto to secure this end. On the 26th July, 1892, they came to an agreement called the Esplanade or Tripartite Agreement, which was confirmed by the Ontario Legislature, 55 Vict. ch. 90, and also by the Parliament of Canada, 56 Vict. ch. 48. Expensive works were executed, for instance overhead traffic bridges with approaches for vehicles and foot passengers, the closing of certain streets, the deviation of others, the acquisition, abandonment and exchange of lands, the raising and removal of tracks, including the erection of a vast Union Station, etc. The construction of these heavy works involved the expenditure of large sums of money amounting to several millions, the Union Station alone having cost the railways $1,370,000, and was approved of by the Parliament of Canada by Vict. ch. 48. It must be observed with reference to the opinion of the learned chairman of the Board that this agreement entirely excluded forever the proposition of a viaduct. I find in his opinion a fair recapitulation of these works, comprehensive enough to give some idea of their magnitude. He says:\u2014\nOn July 26th, 1892, the city, the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the latter representing also the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway Company, the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company and all its other leased lines, entered into what is called the \"Esplanade Tri-partite Agreement\" in which appear most elaborate provisions relating to the rights of the railway companies upon the Esplanade and for the construction of the Union Station. I deal with only a few of its provisions: Par. 4 provided for the erection of private overhead bridges, (5) The city agreed to prevent the public crossing the tracks on the Esplanade between Yonge and York Streets, except at Bay Street, and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. waived its contention that it was not liable to contribute to the cost of making or protecting level crossings at Church, Yonge and Bay Streets. (7) Provided for the construction of the York Street bridge and declared it to be a public highway. (9) Provided for deviating York Street, closing a portion of it and the Esplanade. (10) The Grand Trunk agreed to construct the John Street bridge. (11) Provision was made for closing Esplanade from York Street to Brock Street and portions of Simcoe, Peter, and John Streets. (15) The railway companies agreed to pay $15,000.00 to the city for conveyance of the portions of streets agreed to be closed. (17) The city consented to the Grand Trunk Railway Co. obtaining a patent from the Crown of the prolongation of Peter Street and the companies consented to the city obtaining a patent of the prolongation of Simcoe and York Streets, all to the Old Windmill Line.\nIt is alleged that the Dominion statute, 56 Vict. ch. 48, merely recognized the capacity of the parties to enter into such an agreement. The Dominion statute could not give capacity to the City of Toronto. This was done by the Ontario statute. The Dominion statute was necessary to make the scheme agreed to permanent and final until otherwise provided for by Parliament.\nSection 1 enacts that\nall works done or to be done in order to give effect to the agreement hereinafter mentioned, as well as those affected by it, are hereby declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada.\nThey cannot, therefore, be considered as private works of railway companies. They are to all intents and purposes federal works remaining under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, under section 92, par. 10, of the British North America Act.\nSome authorities have been quoted by the Railway Board to the effect that although an agreement between the parties be ratified by an Act of the Legislature, it still remains a private contract. See City of Kingston v. Kingston, Portsmouth and Cataraqui Electric Railway Co.[3], at page 468. But this Ontario case is not a parallel one, for it was a mere ratification of an agreement without any such clause as is found in section 1 of 56 Vict. ch. 48, and therefore has no application.\nSome reference has also been made by counsel to a decision of the Ontario High Court, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, with respect to the Yonge Street bridge. This decision may affect some other branches of the case, which I do not intend to deal with, but has no bearing upon the point under consideration. It is not even mentioned in their judgments[4]. It is only fair to add that the Railway Board does not refer to this decision.\nThe Railway Commission now proposes to destroy all those works and provide a new scheme still more elaborated and \"enormously expensive,\" observes the chairman, even before ascertaining the financial aspect of the enterprise, for the purpose of giving protection, safety and convenience to the public; involving also the erection of a new Union Station. Can they do so, or is it necessary to apply to the Parliament of Canada? That is the whole question. Section 3 of the Railway Act says in express terms that:\nWhere the provisions of this Act or of any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, relate to the same subject matter, the provisions of the special Act shall, in so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act, be taken to override the provisions of this Act.\nThen section 2, par. 28, says:\n\"Special Act\" means any Act under which the company has authority to construct or operate a railway, or which is enacted with special reference to such railway.\nThe Railway Board considers \"that the fair meaning of the words with special reference to such railway is with respect to the construction or operation of the railway\"; but this is not what the statute says. The interpretation given by the Board has reference only to one part of sub-section 28, and says nothing of the enactment \"with special reference to such railway.\" I cannot understand, moreover, how there can be any doubt that 56 Vict. ch. 48 is an Act having special reference to the railways on the Esplanade. But even if we were to take the interpretation given by the Board, it seems to me that all the works executed under the Tripartite Agreement are works dealing with the construction and operation of the railway. I finally submit that the Railway Board has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, which has been fully dealt with and settled by that Special Act of the Parliament of Canada, and that the Dominion Parliament can alone deal with it again. The Railway Board seem to be conscious of the difficulty they are labouring under, for the chairman remarks in his opinion that \"both the agreement and the clauses of the General Act deal with public protection, safety and convenience,\" and therefore with the same subject matter.\nIt is finally contended that on the 19th of May, 1909, and before the order in council in question in this case was settled, the above legislation was swept away by section 8 of 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32. The decision upon the point in dispute was pronounced long before it was passed, although the formal order was not settled until after. I cannot see how this amendment to the Railway Act can have that effect. I do not see how it can have any application, as that amendment is not a mere matter of procedure, but a matter of jurisdiction affecting vested rights. It would be iniquitous to apply such a statute to a case like the present one without an express enactment to that effect. Williams v. Irvine[5]. See also decisions quoted in Am. & Eng, Encycl. of Law, vo. \"Statutes,\" page 693, notes (2 ed.).\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, with costs against the City of Toronto.\nDavies, J.\u2014This is an appeal upon questions of jurisdiction and law from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners directing the elevation of certain railway tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, in the City of Toronto.\nThe proceedings began by an application on the part of the two railway companies for the Board's approval of plans for a new Union Station at Toronto, which involved necessarily what the elevation of the station should be as well as those of the railway tracks that entered it.\nThe Board during the hearing of the application and thinking the occasion opportune to consider the elevation of these tracks for the protection, safety and convenience of the public directed the city to make the necessary application and the city did so.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board to make the order it did is challenged upon two grounds; one that there was no highway within the meaning of the 238th section of the Railway Act, upon or along or across which the Canadian Pacific Railway was constructed which was admittedly necessary to give jurisdiction; the other that the matter in dispute and disposed of by the order related to the same subject matter as that dealt with by a special Act of Parliament, and by section 3 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1906, in such case\nthe provisions of the special Act shall in so far as it is necessary to give effect to such special Act, be taken to override the provisions of this Act.\nAs stated by the Chief Commissioner in his opinion when granting the order in question:\nThe one broad question for determination is whether this separation of grade shall be accomplished by the city streets being carried over the lines of railway tracks or whether the latter should be carried over the streets. The special Act invoked as ousting the jurisdiction of the Board was one passed in 1893, declaring (1) all works to be done or in pursuance of the agreement therein mentioned to be works for the general advantage of Canada; (2) an agreement dated 26th May, 1892, made between the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the City of Toronto \"to be in force and binding upon the parties thereto\"; and (3) that each of the parties might do what was necessary to carry out its undertaking under that agreement.\nThe Act did not profess to embody the agreement or to make it part of the statute. Its first provision was necessary as the Union Station provided for was for the use and benefit of two Dominion railways, and as there might be doubts whether the railways or the city had the power to bind themselves in the several respects they did the agreement was declared to be binding upon the parties to it each of whom was authorized to carry out its undertaking as specified in the agreement.\nSubstantially the agreement provided for the erection of a new Union Station in the City of Toronto for the necessary opening, deviation and closing of certain specified streets, consequent upon its erection, for the construction of York Street bridge, and for the prevention of the public crossing over the tracks of the railways on the Esplanade between Yonge and York Streets. Incidentally no doubt these provisions had in view and did not ignore the public safety, but their object and purpose was to enable the Union Station to be erected and provide for access to it by the railway tracks and the public.\nBy no reasonable construction of language can this Act be called a special Act dealing with the \"safety, protection and convenience of the public\" as those words are used in the amended section 238 of the Railway Act.\nThe agreement sanctioned by Parliament was a private agreement made between the railways and the city in which no doubt some public interests were considered, but which mainly concerned the interests of the respective parties. Like many other agreements it may have to be interfered with or perhaps overridden either in whole or in part by the Board while exercising their important functions and duties, and as in the case before us where they find it necessary to order anything to be done for the public safety or protection to the prejudice or damage of a corporation or company they take care to consider that fact in awarding the proportion of cost which such interested party must bear in the works ordered.\nI have not any doubt that this Act is not such a one as could oust the jurisdiction of the Commissioners under section 238 of the Railway Act.\nThe main contention, however, of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was that there was no \"highway\" upon, along or across which its line of track was constructed which alone could give the Board jurisdiction.\nOn this question we had prolonged arguments in which the historical aspects of the case as well as the legal ones were thoroughly examined.\nI do not think it necessary to go back further than the date when and the authority under which the \"Don Branch\" was constructed.\nThat branch railway adjoins on the south the Esplanade along the southern portion of which the tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway are laid. By common consent that Esplanade is a highway and all the streets leading to it from the city are highways, and at the time the Don branch was authorized to be constructed the waters of the harbour washed against the southern side of the Esplanade.\nNo one disputes the right of the public to reach th\u00e9 waters of the lake or harbour along these streets and across this Esplanade, and no question of jurisdiction could be raised by the Grand Trunk Railway Co. if the proposed work related to its road alone.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[6], was invoked in support of the proposition that the construction of the Don branch of the Ontario and Quebec Railway, by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. as the lessee of that railway effectually and legally obstructed and put an end to any rights of passage previously and at the time existing across the lands or waters on and over which such branch was built.\nFor my part I am quite unable to see how the decision in that case applies to the one we have now before us. In the British Columbia case above cited the Judicial Committee held that the special Act authorizing the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway authorized the taking by the railway company of all Crown lands provincial as well as Dominion necessary for the undertaking; that a proper construction of sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act authorized the Dominion Parliament to dispose of provincial Crown lands for the purposes of this Interprovincial railway; that the Dominion Government had issued a Crown grant to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. under section 18(a) of their incorporating Act including all the foreshore in question at the street ends; that apart from this the foreshore in question being found as a fact to be a part of the harbour of Vancouver was clearly subject to Dominion legislation; that section 18 of the Canadian Pacific Railway Act gave the necessary authority to the company to take the foreshore there in dispute for the purposes of the railway; that the company had properly exercised the powers so given to them and appropriated the foreshore; and that such appropriation of necessity included the right to obstruct any rights of passage previously existing across that foreshore.\nIn the case before us there is no exercise of any power or right arising under the Canadian Pacific Railway Act, nor is there any analogous or similar Dominion legislation to that authorizing the construction of this \"Don branch.\" No grant has been made to the Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. or to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., its lessee, of any part of the lands ; the sole right or authority which the company has or had to construct its line in the place it has constructed it along and adjoining the south side of the Esplanade and in front of the streets leading from the city to the harbour is to be found in (1) the order in council of the 25th January, 1887; (2) 51 Vict. ch. 53, confirming the said order in council; (3) the order in council 23rd March, 1893, for a grant to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company of an easement \"for railway purposes over the extensions of the streets from Berkeley to Bay streets\"; and (4) the grant to the company following and in pursuance of that order in council.\nThe question is: Did these orders in council, this statute and this grant give or convey to the Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. or to its lessee, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., anything more than a bare easement or right to construct its branch line on the location specified and defined in the orders in council and the grant and subject to the limitations expressed in those documents and without prejudice to the public rights of communication with the waters of the harbour?\nThe contention of the appellants is that they got a title to the exclusive occupation of the spaces which formed the prolongations of the several streets and had a good title thereto in fee simple or if not that at least an exclusive license of occupation under which they had spent large sums of money and which could neither be derogated from nor revoked by the Crown.\nI am quite unable to accept this contention. The first order in council of January, 1887, did nothing more and professed to do nothing more than sanction the building of a branch line of the Ontario and Quebec Railway, called the \"Don branch,\" under six miles in length, pursuant to the provisions of the 18th subsection of sec. 7 of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879; and approve of the maps and plans submitted shewing the location of the line, and fixing the time for construction as the 30th November, 1887.\nIn May following, 1888, the statute 51 Vict. ch. 53, was passed which amongst other enactments declared that the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company\nmight at any time within three years from the passing of the Act construct and complete the branch of its line referred to in the said order in council of 25th January, 1887.\nThis Act gave no new nor further power or authority for the construction of the branch than that given by the order in council. It merely extended the time within which the work had to be completed.\nSub-section 7 of the General Railway Act of 1879, under which the governor in council alone had power to sanction the building of the branch line, prescribes the conditions which must exist before the sanction sought for is given, and amongst them is the deposit in the County Registry office of the maps and plans indicating the location of the line, which plans the governor in council must approve of before the company could exercise its powers of expropriation.\nTurning to plan No. 7, which was filed in the Registry office and submitted to and approved of by the governor in council in 'the above order which plan is signed by the president of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., by the Deputy-Minister of Railways and Canals and certified by the Registrar as having been deposited in the Registry Office it appears that the several streets from Berkeley Street to York Street, twelve or thirteen in number, are clearly and distinctly shewn as prolongations of the streets opening on and upon Esplanade Street out into the harbour as far as the Windmill Line.\nThe proposed line, sanction for the building of which was thus sought, necessarily crossed each of these streets or prolongations of streets which at that time of course were south of the Esplanade covered with water. All that appeared in the map or plan therefore which the governor in council was asked to approve was certain streets, sanction for the crossing of which was sought and obtained.\nIt would be a singular construction to place upon such a sanction that it operated to shut up and close the street, and enabled the railway company after expropriating the lands of the private owners and building its roadbed, absolutely to shut out the public from access to the harbour from the city and vice vers\u00e0.\nIn my judgment this order in council and statutory extension of time with the implied confirmation contended for gave the company no power whatever to enter and construct their railway on these Crown lands which formed part of the harbour and were designated as streets on the plan.\nIt merely gave the sanction required by the then general Railway Act to the construction of the branch and so enabled the company to take steps to purchase or expropriate the lands necessary for the purpose or so far as they were Crown lands to obtain a right to cross them on such terms as the Crown chose to impose, or a deed or conveyance of the lands if the Crown chose to give it.\nWithout however taking any such steps as far as these intervening spaces called streets on the plan were concerned, and without any other authority than the order in council and the statute referred to, the company entered and built their road and operated it till 1893, when the discovery of their utter want of title was made.\nNow what are the facts proved with respect to these intervening spaces in the harbour called streets as they abutted on the Esplanade at the time before and when the Don branch was built. Evidence was given and not contradicted that so far as eight or nine of them were concerned the city had constructed, wooden slips, as they were called, at their junction with the Esplanade, which slips had been used by the public for years with horses and carts or wagons as ways or communications with the harbour for the purpose of getting lake water and selling the same to the citizens of Toronto. The watermen drove their horses and carts across the Esplanade and down these slips, procured the water they required and crossed back again. The public in other ways used these slips or wooden ways built upon stone and secured by piles driven in the bed of the lake for the ordinary purposes of leaving the city to go upon the lake or getting to the city from the lake.\nThere is not a scintilla of evidence that such right of way or passage was ever called in question by anyone.\nThe introduction into the city of water by means of pipes of course put an end to the necessity for continuing this manner of using these ways to obtain water, so that when the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. built in 1888 the Don branch abutting upon the Esplanade and running across these prolongations of streets while the foundations and remains of the slips were there and were covered up by the railway filling the special user of them as a means of procuring water had ceased.\nSo far as the crossing at the foot of Yonge Street is concerned the question whether it had been prolonged beyond the Esplanade and constituted a public way or crossing was tried some years ago before the High Court of Ontario at great length with the result that the Court found in favour of the public right and the finding of Mr. Justice Anglin, the trial judge, supported by elaborate and convincing reasoning was on appeal confirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe leading opinion of that court delivered by Chief Justice Moss leaves no doubt upon my mind that the evidence in that case fully justified the findings. There is no doubt that no such ample evidence was or could be procured with respect to the user of the ways or communications from the other streets to the harbour. Such a public and continuous user as was shewn always to have existed at Yonge Street after the Esplanade was constructed, did not, of course, exist at the ends of the other streets, but as I have stated evidence of some user though perhaps slight was given.\nPausing for a moment at this point in the chronological statement of the facts let us see what was the legal situation in the year 1888 when the Don branch was built.\nThe public right of access to and from the streets to and from the waters of the harbour had not been denied or prevented.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Co. simply filled up the harbour, level with the Esplanade, opposite to the ends of the streets and filled in with planks between the rails of their railway, thus giving the public the same right of access as they previously had and practically and de facto if not de jure extending the highways or streets and Esplanade to the extent of the width of their embankment on the prolongation.\nThat condition continued until the year 1893 without any attempt being made to exclude the public from the user of the Don branch as a street or highway in so far as it was prolonged into the harbour opposite to the streets leading to and on the Esplanade from the city.\nDiscovery had then been made that the branch had been constructed across the Crown property in these prolongations of streets without authority. Application was made, by the Canadian Pacific Railway officials, to obtain that authority and the order in council of March, 1893, was, on report from the Minister of Railways, granted.\nThis order in council sets out the existence of the application by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to have been for a\ngrant of the right to construct, maintain and use for railway purposes two or more railway tracks and appurtenances and the roadbeds therefor on and over eleven parcels of land, etc.\nThen follow the descriptions of these parcels severally as the prolongations of the respective streets leading to and across the Esplanade.\nThe order in council recites the representations of the company on which they sought to have the order granted to have been that these lands were \"held by the Government in the interests of Canada\u201d and\nunder the impression that the order in council of 25th January, 1887, and the Don Act, 51 Vict. ch. 53, gave the company the right to do so, it some time ago constructed tracks over the said lands and had been using them for railway purposes but, having been advised that this right was not complete unless the approval given by the order in council be followed by a formal grant, it now prayed that its right to use the said tracks be confirmed by such a grant.\nThe order in council further recited that\nthe company further points out that the giving of this easement will not interfere with the Crown granting to the City of Toronto or to any other party a full title to the said parcels of land subject only to the use for railway purposes above mentioned.\nThe order in council therefore recommended\nthat there be granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., its successors and assigns in perpetuity, the right to construct, maintain and use for railway purposes two or more railway tracks and appurtenances and the roadbeds therefor on and over the said eleven parcels of land, etc.\nThe grant followed in the same terms as the order in council recommended and was dated 10th June, 1903. Next in order came the Crown grant from the Dominion Government to the City of Toronto of these eleven parcels of land being the eleven street prolongations from the Esplanade southward to Lake Street, which was reserved for a highway. This grant was dated 28th November, 1894, and was given to the corporation\nin trust that the corporation, its successors and assigns should use each of the said parcels as and for a public highway either in the shape of a water-slip as portion of Toronto Harbour or as a street, or as partly one and partly as the other as to the corporation should seem meet, subject always to the terms and conditions in respect of the same embodied in the agreement dated 15th March, 1888, between the corporation, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and certain riparian owners known as \"The Windmill Line Agreement.\"\nThis \"Windmill Line Agreement\" to the terms and conditions of which this grant was thns made subject does not, for the purposes we are discussing, in my judgment, affect the result.\nThe legal result which followed these several orders in council and grants was to vest the title of the soil in all these prolongations of the streets beyond the Esplanade and between it and Lake Street, in the corporation of the City of Toronto in trust to use them as public highways as expressed in the grant with a right to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to use for railway purposes two or more railway tracks and the roadbeds therefor across the parts of these prolongations of streets immediately adjoining on the south the Esplanade.\nIt gave the company this easement and nothing more. Subject to that easement the land became the city's in trust for public streets or slips or both as the corporation should decide.\nThe legal result was that the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks and roadbed which up to this time had been a de facto street or highway, subject to the railway easement, became on and afterwards one de jure, just as the adjoining tracks and road bed of the Grand Trunk Railway on the Esplanade were parts of a public highway subject to a similar easement.\nThe public right of access to the waters of the harbour had been, so far as the Crown could do so, secured and placed beyond doubt and the Crown's title in these extensions of the streets transferred to the city in trust for the public as highways or streets or slips. Under the statutory powers given the Crown with respect to the beds or soil of public harbours there can be no doubt as to the validity of this grant to the city or as to its effect as vesting the fee in the soil in the city corporation.\nSuppose that at any time the city had determined to execute this trust and fill up any one of these street extensions or prolongations with earth from the Canadian Pacific Railway roadbed to Lake Street and had sent down their horses drawing carts filled with clay for the purpose, is it conceivable that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. could have prevented them crossing their roadbed from the Esplanade in order to carry out the purpose of the corporation in so fulfilling its public trust?\nThe only right the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. had was one to an easement for railway use and subject to that, in my opinion, the right of the city to have its carts cross the railway from the embankment to fill and construct the street prolongations was incontestable.\nSuppose again the city had completed its purpose and carried out its trust with regard to any one or more of these street prolongations south of the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to the extent of say one hundred yards or more of the distance towards Lake Street would not there be alike a de jure and a de facto crossing there, a road, a street, a way which the public could use of right which the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. beyond their right of user of their own tracks for railway purposes could not interfere with? Now for a moment let us look at the Railway Act and the nature or kind of highway which must exist to give the Board of Railway Commissioners jurisdiction under the 238th section.\nThe word \"highway\" is used in the section and is defined in sub-section 11 of sec. 2 of the Railway Act as including \"any public road, street, lane or other public way or communication.\" If the public right of access between the city and the harbour by way of the streets and the Esplanade is not a public \"road, street or lane\" it is in my judgment a \"public way or communication.\" These latter words, I would humbly submit, are peculiarly apt to describe the public right of access I am speaking of and which the Board of Commissioners on ample evidence found to exist.\nIf I am wrong in that even then I hold that the various orders in council and grants following them, vesting in the company and the city the several rights and titles in these street extensions I have before referred to coupled with the de facto filling in of these streets for the full breadth of the Don branch roadbed extended the streets, at any rate to the extent of that filling in, as far as the waters of the harbour and thus gave jurisdiction to the Board. There was originally a de jure \"way or communication\" which ripened on the filling in into a de facto public road or street the legal title to which was vested in the city in trust for the public as a street but subject to the railway easement.\nWith regard to the minor but important questions as to the legal exercise by the Board of their jurisdictional powers, I am satisfied to rest my judgment upon the reasoning of Anglin J., with which I concur. The appeal therefore should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised is whether or not the Board of Railway Commissioners had jurisdiction to make the order complained of.\nThe order rests on section 238 of the Railway Act as it stood as amended by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, section 5, of which the first sub-section, and that most material herein, is as follows:\u2014\nWhere a railway is already constructed upon, along or across any highway, the Board may, upon its own motion, or upon complaint or application, by or on behalf of the Crown, or any municipal or other corporation, or any person aggrieved, order the company to submit to the Board within a specified time, a plan and profile of such portion of the railway, and may cause inspection of such portion, and may inquire into and determine all matters and things in respect of such portion, and the crossing, if any, and may make such order as to the protection, safety and convenience of the public as it deems expedient, or may order that the railway be carried over, under or along the highway, or that the highway be carried over, under or along the railway, or that the railway or highway be temporarily or permanently diverted, and that such other work be executed, watchmen or other persons employed, or measures taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction in the opinion of the Board arising or likely to arise in respect of such portion or crossing, if any, or any other crossing directly or indirectly affected.\nThe material facts are in a narrow compass. The City of Toronto fronts upon the navigable water of Lake Ontario. There is a street of the city now known as Front Street running parallel with the lake shore.\nBetween that and the lake there was formed at an early date a parallel street known as Esplanade Street, one hundred feet wide.\nThe relation of the construction of this to the work of constructing the Grand Trunk Railway and the relation of the city corporation and the Grand Trunk Railway Company, which involved several agreements between them in regard to said works, though all gone into very fully at the trial and in argument before us, need not now, so far as I see, concern us.\nIndeed their consideration has to my mind tended to obscure the real issues now to be disposed of. Some comprehensive knowledge of their results have, however, to be borne in mind and especially so the construction of the Esplanade and its character as a street whereon all men may go as of right.\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company did not appear in this appeal and, so far as it is directly concerned, may be considered out of the question.\nThe admitted facts are that this Esplanade was so constructed that the south side thereof formed after its construction the north boundary of the lake and that the Grand Trunk Railway was built upon and along the southerly fifty-two feet of the Esplanade in the late fifties.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Co. as lessees of another railway company known as the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company which had constructed its road from the east and entered Toronto on the north side thereof some two miles from the lake desired an entrance to the lake front and applied to the Governor in Council then having the powers given by the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, for sanction to the building of a branch line called the \"Don Branch\" under six miles in length.\nThe application as appears from the face of the order made thereupon was under the provisions of the 18th sub-section of section 7 of said Act\nThat sanction was given in the following words:\u2014\nThe Minister considering it desirable that the company should be permitted to build this branch, recommends that due sanction be given therefor, and that the maps and plans submitted, shewing the location of the line from a point on the main line of the Ontario and Quebec Railway, on lot 12, in the 3rd concession from the bay, in the township of York, to a point on the Esplanade in the City of Toronto, near York Street, be approved, and further, that the time for the construction of the said branch be fixed as on or before the 30th of November, 1887.\nIt is most important to understand exactly the nature of this concession for upon the correct interpretation thereof turns the rights of the parties who have appeared before us.\nThis sub-section 18 indicates its purposes and prohibits work until as provided a company applying under it shall have given the notices specified and prior thereto shall\nhave deposited in the Registry Office of any city, county, or part of a county, in which the line or any part thereof is to be constructed, the maps and plans indicating the location of the line, and until the company shall have submitted the same to, and such maps and plans shall have been approved by the Governor in Council, after the expiration of the notice.\nA sub-section (b) of this sub-section, gives for the purposes thereof to every\nsuch company the powers given them with respect to their main line, by the Act incorporating the company.\nThe power of expropriation in such Acts was exercised by the company in respect of the lands of private owners but nothing was done to acquire title to the lands of the Crown crossed by this projected railway.\nThe Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. before proceeding to build obtained from Parliament an Act extending time and confirming said order in council but, beyond the extension of time, this Act (which also dealt with other matters) added nothing to the order and neither by express terms nor impliedly, when we have regard to its purview and the frame of some of its reservations, in any way affected the rights of the Crown.\nThe appellants or its lessor proceeded to build this branch line without acquiring from the Crown the lands necessary for its construction and in doing so crossed some eleven parcels of land covered by the waters of the harbour and belonging to the Crown; without a shadow of title to do so, save possibly that implied in the general right to cross highways. But were these even highways to be crossed?\nSome years later in 1893, the solicitor of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, having discovered the oversight, made an application to the Minister of the Interior for a grant to that\ncompany, its successors and assigns in perpetuity, of the right to construct, maintain and use for railway purposes two or more railway tracks and appurtenances, and the roadbeds therefor, on and over eleven parcels of land in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, containing in the aggregate fifty-six hundredths of an acre, more or less, and being bounded respectively\n\u2014as therein appears.\nThis was conceded by an order in council of 23rd February, 1893, which shews it was assented to by the Ministers of Marine and Fisheries and of Public Works as well as by the Minister of the Interior. As. to whether that was or not a proper compliance with section 19 of ch. 39, of the Revised Statutes of Canada, I pass no opinion.\nThat section amongst other things provided,\nAnd any portion of the shore or bed of any public harbour vested in Her Majesty, as represented by the Government of Canada, not required for public purposes, may, on the joint recommendation of the Ministers of Public Works and of Marine and Fisheries, be sold or leased under the authority aforesaid.\nIt seems these eleven parcels formed part of the bed of Toronto Harbour on Lake Ontario and lay next along the southerly side of the above mentioned Esplanade.\nIn the order in council there appears this express statement:\u2014\nThat the company further points out that the giving of this easement will not interfere with the Crown granting to the City of Toronto or to any other party a full title to the said parcels of land, subject only to the use for railway purposes above mentioned; a use which the Government and the city officials, and all other parties interested, have for several years understood that the company had or was to have.\nOn the 10th June, 1893, a patent was issued to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for said parcels of land in consideration of a dollar, granting\nits successors and assigns (so far as we have power to grant the same) the right to construct, maintain, and use for railway purposes two or more railway tracks and appurtenances and the roadbeds therefor, as part of the Ontario and Quebec railway on and over eleven parcels of land situate in the City of Toronto.\nIt is to be observed that this transaction can hardly be called a sale; that the necessary concurrence of Ministers named in the statute was, if had, rather informally so; that in its terms a doubt is carried on the face of the instrument as to its legality; that the grant is not to the company building or owning but to its lessees; and that it ends by an express declaration that if no right to grant existed, it is accepted with such risks by the company.\nThe respondent, apparently wishing to escape from what was implied in this transaction, sought in argument herein to discard this order in council and this grant, and claimed boldly that the original order in council permitting the branch line to be constructed had the effect of granting to the company named therein the fee in these lands of the Crown crossed by the construction of the branch.\nNo such contention can be properly maintained.\nThe Crown lands are just as sacred as any other lands and are not disposed of in that way or impliedly disposed of at all.\nIt never was the intention of the Minister of Railways and Canals or within the scope of any such order to grant lands of any kind, but only to grant the power and capacity to take and hold the necessary lands when the title thereto had been got from the Crown or others concerned as owners.\nAnd when we find that these very lands can only be disposed of in the way specified in the statute already referred to the contention seems futile.\nSupport was, faintly I must say, sought in the case of Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[7], or something therein. The Crown had made a grant there. Hence as well for that reason as the nature of the whole case and all it originated in or rested upon it had no resemblance to this case.\nThen again the very maps or plans filed in the Registry Office, and thereby submitted to found the application for the original order in council had plainly set forth thereon these lands as parts respectively of Yonge Street and a large number of other streets of the city, as if they extended a considerable distance to the south of the lands in question. I think these plans were intended to represent the continuation of such of these streets as such from the south side of the Esplanade, though necessarily obscured on the plan by the shading of the lines representing the intended location of the tracks of the projected branch line crossing same.\nWhat appeared in this application was no more than the crossing of any other street or public highway.\nInstead of an apparent grant of land springing from the order resting on such a plan there is apparently involved the mere concession of a right to cross as over a supposed highway or highways so far as these lands were concerned. We are not informed whether anything else was placed before the Ministers to displace such clear inferences of fact and intention.\nWhat is claimed to have resulted in law is the grant of the fee simple in said lands; in other words, is the right to put a fence thereon across a mile of the front of Toronto preventing men from going on and over these numerous tracts of space where undoubtedly before they had a clear right to go and had so gone for years. Such is the right claimed or nothing.\nWhen we consider that a legislative concession of such a character as that must be clear before the public rights can be so invaded or such supposed to have been an intent of these so legislating, and we do not find it clearly so expressed the claim fails. At least all the surrounding circumstances attendant upon the execution or constitution of such a document under which the creation of such an alleged grant with such consequences as claimed is involved ought to be demonstrative of such intention before we can fairly attribute such a purpose to those responsible therefor\u2014instead of being as I submit they are of the reverse character.\nIf the Governor in Council is to be supposed aware, despite the appearances of the plan, that these street extensions were covered by the waters of the lake then he and his council might as well be supposed aware also of the schemes of the city recognized by the prior grant, fifty years before, of the Crown to the city of the lands on either side thereof which clearly contemplated a possible filling up of these spaces and the constructing of streets to serve the uses of such grant and those made thereunder.\nThe scheme involved in that early grant to the city might look either to the reclamation of that part of the lake from the waters thereof and the construction of suitable buildings thereupon; or to the construction of wharves and such like over the water.\nBut having regard to the width of the spaces left ungranted the former would seem the more probable.\nIn either case it evidently was a reservation of ways of access to the lands or wharves, and consistent in either case with a means of passage by the public by land or water to that beyond, whatever it might be or might become; either lake, or land, or water, on either side.\nAll this makes clear, to my mind, that the power of the railway company to prohibit the passage across its tracks as implied in the theory of a grant in fee of the roadbed, never was in the mind of any human being.\nI have not overlooked the provisions of sub-section 3 of section 7 of the Railway Act of 1879, prohibiting and enabling, nor can I overlook the constitutional limitations, conditions and methods by which such enabling consents might have been got. They were not got and must not be presumed to have been got by virtue of something else than such express consent to fulfil a present definite purpose as the statute implies; a different thing entirely from the wavering thing given for an entirely different purpose by the order in council relied on, and which might become determinate in two years or changed as need be.\nThe city on the 28th of November, 1894, obtained a grant, for what such grant was worth, from the Crown of these parcels of land forming extensions of streets including the lands up to the south side of the Esplanade being several of those crossings now in question.\nWharves and industrial establishments have been erected south of this railway branch, and the several means of access thereto furnished over many of these lands so granted, have daily been used for years by thousands as of right. So long as the water covered them they were highways of a kind, and the merely filling in, under and by virtue of or without such authority as here found, did not end the right of travel over them.\nNothing has ever transpired to prevent the use of such means of access. It obviously was the purpose of every one that they should be so used. Works of accommodation\u2014not very expensive, it is true\u2014have been added and kept in repair by the city for no other purpose than to promote this use as of right.\nIt seems idle to put forward the reservation of individual proprietors in arranging with the railway company for, and in respect of the making of their grants of right of way, as in any way limiting this paramount right of travel.\nWhat the Board had to consider was not alone the technical definition of a highway given by the Ontario Legislature or its predecessor, but the use as of right of a means of communication set forth as follows:\u2014\n\"highway\" includes any public road, street, lane, or other public way or communication.\nThis right every one of the public had, by means first of the streets joining the Esplanade on the north, thence across that a public highway, and thence into the lake itself a highway.\nAn additional strip of some feet in width was granted the railway company in 1904, which in express language so reserves the right that its very terms forbid any question of this right of crossing, and is in itself a recognition thereof. Its acceptance with such condition by the appellant implied an acknowledgment of respondent's claims herein.\nBesides all these things it is to be observed that the Board's findings of fact as such are conclusive, and in this case the findings of Mr. Justice Anglin are expressly accepted by the Board without distinction of law from fact.\nDoes that under section 54 of the Railway Act imply an acceptance of the prim\u00e0 facie case, and if so with what results so far as we are concerned?\nI have, for the foregoing manifold reasons, no doubt of this being a crossing such as referred to in the above section 238 of the Railway Act, and the consequent jurisdiction over it by the Board.\nIs there anything else to consider? It is said the power is excepted by virtue of what flows from an agreement known as the tripartite agreement entered into between the city, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., and Grand Trunk Railway Co., on the 26th July, 1892, long before the Board was constituted with its extensive powers.\nThe appellant, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, submits, that inasmuch as the said agreement provided for the elimination in the future from the results of the local operation of the railway many elements of danger then and still existent, including the same as those sought to be relieved against by the order of the Board, and as the scheme of the said agreement had for its chief purpose such elimination of danger, it must, when ratified, as it was by Act of Parliament, be taken that a special Act, relative to the same subject matter as that dealt with by the Board, existed within the meaning of sec. 3 of the Railway Act, and being so related to the same subject matter of street crossings overrides the provisions of the Railway Act in this regard.\nIf the validity of the argument will not stand on such assumption, of identity, of elements of danger, and the chief purpose of the agreement, giving added strength (not, in fact, therein), then all weaker positions must inevitably fall.\nI desire the utmost supposition of the case to be the test.\nAs the Chief Commissioner points out a private agreement ratified by Act of Parliament remained but a private contract.\nIt furnished and furnishes no security to the general public. It supplied no method but the will of the contracting parties for carrying out such provisions as it contained.\nIt does not seem when we have regard to the nature of public rights, wrongs and remedies, as at all legislation that deals with them.\nAll it does is to validate corporate Acts and covenants, which might, but for it, have been of no binding effect, as between the parties. It is the private right alone that is dealt with. No one could be indicted for breach of anything therein provided as if in the way of imposing the discharge of a public duty.\nA few words might have changed all this, but they are not in this private Act.\nIt is not necessary to go further than to point out that Parliament, eleven years later, constituted a Board for the express purpose of securing to the public their enjoyment not only of all such safeguards as legislative ingenuity had been able to devise, but helpless to execute, for the protection, safety and convenience of the public; because public opinion and the private contract system and legislative sanctions had all broken down, and an executive power was needed to effectuate the purpose of so many endeavours of the kind in question.\nThree years later section 238 seems to have been transformed from an inefficient sort of thing to what evidently was meant to be a most drastic sort of legislation intended, as the terms of the 3rd sub-section thereof indicates, if need be, to override such objections as now set up.\nI have no doubt, in the absence of the most express legislation, by clear language or implication in a special Act dealing with the very thing, that sec. 238, even as it stood in its early form, was intended to have been acted upon by the Board notwithstanding any such arrangements of a contractual nature as relied on now to take the case out of the Act. If the tripartite agreement had, in its every provision, not been a mere private contract, but an Act of Parliament, I doubt if it would, in the language of section 3, have overridden the plain provision of section 238, so far as operative at all, as originally enacted.\nAs it now stands it is radically different from all that the provisions of the tripartite agreement expresses or implies. I therefore cannot see any grounds for finding such provisions to be \"like\" and relative \"to the same subject matter.\"\nSome forcible remarks, well addressed elsewhere, no doubt, on the injustice of thus in effect sweeping aside the realization of that which was expected from this agreement, were put before us.\nHowever rich the field furnished by the history of the relations of these corporations with each other may be in food for thought on the part of the ethical philosopher in quest thereof, in an inquiry as to the uses and development of a corporate conscience, our present sphere of duty in the premises does not lead us to enter therein.\nThe next question is: Has the jurisdiction thus founded been exercised in such a way as to fall within the powers conferred by the section?\nThe most formidable objection made is that the section contemplated the elevation of the whole railway or the whole highway within the meaning given those respective words in the interpretation clauses of the Act, and not merely a part of either.\nIt has I confess caused me far more difficulty than any other in this case to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the construction of this section.\nThe solution of what should be done has, if the Board has the power, been properly made. It ameliorates what indeed seems a strong measure. I do not think, if we can help it, a construction (however much it may suit appellant's present purposes) that would on the one hand needlessly invade the rights of property or on the other render the statute nugatory, should be adopted.\nMoreover the order seems to me to provide for what in a correct sense is substantially the elevation of the railway.\nA complete railway is to be elevated. A subsidiary part of its serving tracks, which may be used for mere siding accommodations is permitted under regulations as other\nmeasures taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the dangers of obstruction in the opinion of the Board arising or likely to arise in respect of such portion of the crossing, if any, or any other crossing directly or indirectly affected.\nThese words seem to indicate the contemplation of just such a case as that found here, and to detract from the force of the argument that the whole railway is to be elevated.\nIndeed it comes to the question of whether two of the several means specified or indicated disjunctively as they are in the section can be coupled or not in the same order. For example can the employment of watchmen not be directed in the case of a diversion of track or highway, which in its diverted path might yet need some such additional safeguard?\nIf it had been a case of doubt to be only solved by increasing the burthen upon the railway companies I should have been more loath in face of doubt of that kind to pronounce in favour of jurisdiction. But when the probable consequence is the alternative of an order to elevate every track on the whole of these roads, no matter whether merely used for siding accommodation or otherwise, in order to comply with the alleged literal meaning of the words used I pause to see if it is possible to find another meaning in the section which may be more consistent with the rule of construction in section 15 of the Interpretation Act, which directs every Act to be deemed remedial and accordingly to\nreceive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nSection 48 of the Railway Act also seems comprehensive enough to be, and may be, applicable.\nIt seems to follow from these several considerations that the jurisdiction of the Board has in this regard not been exceeded.\nThe other objections as to York Street bridge, and the closing of the streets indicated, I do not think have much weight. They are covered by the necessities of exercising the jurisdiction and the express provision for the diverting of highways, if we apply the section above partly quoted. I also am inclined, though doubting, to think section 31, sub-sec. (6) of the Interpretation Act may also be relied upon.\nThe Yonge Street order of the Privy Council does not seem at all to interfere, seeing the Board has the power to rescind the order.\nThis order, if effective, is a substitutionary rescission of it.\nNo point was made of the appellant, as lessee, not being liable or at all events without its lessor being joined.\nI think this appeal must be dismissed with costs: Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014This in an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners raising the question of the jurisdiction of the Board to entertain an application by the municipality of Toronto respecting the lines of the Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway running along and adjacent to the Esplanade, a street running east and west in that city, and for an order directing the construction of a viaduct and the placing of the railway tracks upon it.\nThe order was made in professed exercise of the powers of the Board under sections 237 and 238 of the Railway Act. Admittedly a condition of the jurisdiction of the Board is that both these railways had been constructed \"upon, along, or across\" one or more highways. The Chief Commissioner, in upholding the jurisdiction of the Board, appears to have proceeded upon two grounds:\u2014First, that both these railways were constructed \"along\" a highway, the Esplanade; secondly, that they are both constructed upon or across a number of streets running admittedly to the northerly limit of the Esplanade, and, according to the contention of the respondent and the decision of the Chief Commissioner, proceeding further and crossing both railways.\nAs it has never been disputed that the line of the Ontario and Quebec Railway in question lies to the south of the Esplanade, the highway referred to by the Chief Commissioner, we must take it, I think, that the Chief Commissioner has acted upon the view that this line, running as it does alongside the Esplanade in the locality in question, is for that reason a railway constructed \"along\" a highway within the meaning of section 238. I do not think this construction can be supported. When one looks at the history of these sections, it seems clear that this is not the sense in which prior to the Act of 1903 the word \"along\" was used in the legislation out of which sections 235 to 243 developed. The first sentence of section 15 of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879, is as follows:\u2014\nThe railway shall not be carried along an existing highway, but merely across the same in the line of the railway, unless leave has been obtained from the proper municipality or local authority therefor.\n\"Along\" in this sentence seems to be used to express longitudinal direction in contradistinction to \"across,\" and to mark the case in which the railway is to be constructed upon the highway in a direction corresponding generally to that of the highway rather than in the general direction of the railway line itself; and the other parts of the section hardly permit any other view of the meaning of the word. The same phraseology is used in the same sense in section 183 of the Consolidated Act of 1888. The Act of 1903, with which, in substance, the present Act in this particular corresponds, provided that whether the railway was to be carried \"across or along or upon\" a highway the leave of the Railway Commissioners must first be obtained. The addition of the word \"upon\" can hardly be held to alter the meaning of the other words. I am not much concerned to dispute that upon this construction there is some superfluity. A distinguished judge once said that Parliament is seldom parsimonious of language, and the following passage from Lord Selborne in Hough v. Windus[8], seems appropriate here:\u2014 I cannot admit that there is any such presumption against fullness or even superfluity of expression, in statutes or other written instruments, as to amount to a rule of interpretation controlling what might otherwise be their proper construction. No doubt, when the words admit of it, that interpretation which makes them more officious with respect to the clear and ascertained policy of the statute, or purpose of the instrument, is (in general) to be preferred to that which makes them less so.\n* * * * * * * * *\nAnd I adhere to an opinion expressed by myself in the House of Lords more than ten years ago in Giles v. Melsom[9], which, unless I am much deceived, I have also heard in substance expressed by great masters of the law, that \"nothing can be more mischievous, than the attempt to wrest words from their proper and legal meaning, only because they are superfluous.\"\nAt the time that part of the line the Ontario and Quebec Railway, which is now in question (a part, that is to say, of the Don branch of that railway) was authorized, the Esplanade\u2014upon the southerly part of which the line of the Grand Trunk Railway was constructed\u2014was, as I have said, a highway running east and west. A number of streets running north and south admittedly came to the northerly limit of the Esplanade. South of the Esplanade between Berkeley Street to the east and York Street, which was the westerly limit of the branch in question, and extending as far southward as a line known as the old windmill line, the bed of the harbour had been granted or leased to individuals \u2014with the exception of a series of strips enclosed by lines formed by the production south of the boundaries of the streets already mentioned running north and south to or across the Esplanade. The intervening spaces between these strips were at the southerly front of the Esplanade occupied by wharves and other structures. That the strips of harbour bed mentioned were at that time still vested in the Crown in the right of the Dominion, nobody disputes. That Toronto harbour or bay was then a navigable water subject to the public right of navigation, or that these strips or street prolongations, as I shall call them, were part of the harbour in this sense, that the bed and the waters of the harbour there were subject to the public right of navigation, can hardly be called in question. Not only is there no evidence except of the most equivocal kind suggesting any intention on the part of the Crown to devote these strips to highway as distinguished from harbour purposes, but nobody suggests that there was any statutory authority by which the Crown could merely by a declaration of intention convert a part of the harbour of Toronto into something that was not a part of that harbour. The effect of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1886), ch. 39, section 11, I will discuss when I come to the grant of 1894, upon which the respondents rely.\nI do not understand the learned trial judge in the Yonge Street Bridge Case[10] ( upon which the learned Chief Commissioner relies) to dispute that the prolongation of Yonge Street was at the time the authority was obtained for the building of the Don branch a public navigable water part of the harbour of Toronto. Nor do I understand from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that he disagrees with that view. With respect to some of the other prolongations there is another point to consider. There is some evidence to the effect that at some time prior to the construction of the Don branch there were at the southern face of the Esplanade on these prolongations, structures called \"slips,\" consisting of an apron of wood resting at the upper end on the Esplanade, and at the lower end, upon a crib. It is said that these slips were used as landing places for limited purposes, but more generally as conveniences for filling water-carts with water which was peddled about the streets of Toronto. There is nothing to shew by what authority these slips were put there. There is nothing to shew the date when they disappeared. The fair inference from all the evidence is, I think, that they had all completely disappeared in 1887 with the exception of the remains of one at Bay Street. The evidence (at all events) is altogether too vague and too meagre to support any finding that in any of these prolongations what was formerly the bed of the harbour was not still the bed of the harbour in 1887. There is no finding by the Board or the Chief Commissioner inconsistent with this view.\nWhen then the Don branch was constructed by placing solid structures adjoining the Esplanade across these street prolongations was it constructed \"upon, along or across\" a highway within the meaning of section 238 of the Railway Act? The view most strongly pressed upon us was that the word \"highway\" by the interpretation clause is defined as including \"any public road, street, lane, or other public way, or communication\"; and it is argued that the word as it appears in sections 237 and 238 must be read as convertible with (as a mere symbol standing for) the whole of this definition.\nWith great respect I think so to apply the definition is to misapprehend the office of this interpretation clause. Meux v. Jacobs[11], per Lord Selborne; Dech\u00e8ne v. City of Montreal[12] at p. 645; The Queen v. The Justices of Cambridgeshire[13]. In the Act of 1879, under which the Don branch was authorized as well as in all the consolidations of the Railway Act down to that of 1906, the meanings assigned by the interpretation clauses to the words there defined are assigned subject to the usual condition that there shall be nothing in the subject or context repugnant to such a construction. It is quite clear that the highways referred to in section 238 are highways of the same class as those referred to in section 237 and that, again, those dealt with in the latter section are the same things as are dealt with in section 235. The whole group of sections beginning with section 235 and ending with section 243, and headed \"Highway Crossings,\" is designed to deal with highways of the same class obviously. If one examine these provisions (the most cursory examination is sufficient), there are the strongest indications, I think, that in them the legislature was not dealing with navigable waters or the beds of navigable waters; and this becomes perfectly plain when we look at the group of sections beginning with section 230 and ending with section 234, headed \"Navigable Waters,\" and compare that with the group in which sections 237 and 238 occur.\nThe enactments in the second group are exactly appropriate to highways on land; those in the first group exactly appropriate to the subject with which they profess to deal. The difference between the two groups of sections is perhaps even more marked if we look at the Act of 1879, and at the Consolidated Act of 1888. In section 15, which is the provision of 1879 dealing with highway crossings, the authority to which the railway company must resort, where leave is required, is the \"proper municipal authority,\" an authority which as such (except in rare cases) could have nothing whatever to do with navigable waters. Again the group of sections in that Act dealing with navigable waters, sections 66 to 68, refer the railway company as we should have expected to the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, where authority is required to put its works on the bed of any such water. Nobody can doubt that when the company proposed to construct its works in these prolongations the authority to which application must be made (after the consent of the Governor in Council under section 7, sub-sec. 3 had been obtained), was not the municipal authority, but the authority named in section 68 (the Railway Committee), and that section 15 could not possibly apply to such a situation.\nThese prolongations were not then in themselves highways within the meaning of section 238, and in crossing them the railway company was not by reason of that circumstance alone constructing a railway \"upon or across\" a series of highways. But'the argument is put in another way. It is said that there was a public right of access to the waters of the bay from the Esplanade and vice versa, which was interfered with, and that the parts of the harbour occupied by the railway, being subject to this right, were \"highways\" (using that word in the sense of \"public way or communition\") distinct both from the Esplanade and the harbour itself. With every respect, I am unable to follow this argument. There was a public right of passage, up and down, let us say, Yonge Street, to the Esplanade, and then across the Esplanade (whether Yonge Street crossed the Esplanade seems to me to be immaterial) and to and from its southern boundary. There was a public right to use for navigation and all purposes reasonably incidental thereto that part of the harbour which came up to the Esplanade opposite to or at the end of Yonge Street. The public had a right to be on the highway for highway purposes, and they had a right to go from the highway south for any purpose reasonably connected with navigation. They had a right to go from the harbour on to the highway. But these rights were rights which arose solely from the circumstance that the southern line of the Esplanade here merely marked the contiguity of a land highway and a public harbour. If the Esplanade had ceased to be a public highway, and had become private property, the public right to cross it to get to the harbour would have ceased to exist, not because the rights of the public appertaining to the harbour had in any way been impaired, but because the land highway had ceased to go down to the harbour. And so, if the public rights of navigation should, in respect of the prolongation of Yonge Street, be extinguished, and that prolongation become private property, the right of the public to get to the harbour from the southern face of the Esplanade through this prolongation would cease to exist, not because any public right in respect of the highway had been affected, but because that particular locality had ceased to be part of the harbour. Let us suppose, for example, that the Don branch should have crossed the Yonge Street prolongations some distance south of the Esplanade, would anybody have suggested that the crossing there was a highway crossing within sections 237 or 238?\nIt seems to me, therefore, to be clearly impossible to maintain that at the time they were made, these crossings were highway-crossings. They were, for the purpose of applying the statute, crossings of navigable waters. It seems to me to be equally clear (assuming the railway to have been lawfully constructed across these street prolongations), that the public rights of navigation there and the rights ancillary thereto were extinguished by the construction of these crossings. They were extinguished because as such it became upon the construction of the railway physically impossible any longer to exercise them. Once the spaces became filled up, it became obviously impossible that the public should use them in the way they were used before, and in the only way which the public had a right to use them before. Corporation of Yarmouth v. Simmons[14], at pages 524 and 526.\nWhen it is argued that the public right to get to the waters of the harbour was not extinguished, but was reserved by implication, I suppose what is really meant is that for the rights formerly lawfully exercisable by the public in the place occupied by the railway, there was substituted some other right. That substituted right is said to be a right of passage across the tracks of the railway and, therefore, the part of the railway subject to that right is said to be a land highway\u2014a highway within the meaning of sections 237 and 238. Whether such land highways over the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway were ever substituted for the rights extinguished by the construction of the railway is perhaps the principal question raised on this branch of the argument. The contention that such highways came into existence is based upon several grounds: First, it is said that public right of passage across the railway\u2014it is not put precisely in this way, but in effect, I think, I am putting the contention fairly\u2014was one of the terms implied, at all events, if not expressed, in the consent under which these parts of the harbour were occupied by the railway. Then it is said that under the authority of a certain agreement dated 1892, called the Tripartite Agreement, ratified by Parliament and by the Legislature of Ontario, certain highways were constructed across the railway. The first, I think, is the main ground upon which the decision in the Yonge Street Bridge Case[15] proceeded, both at the trial and in the Court of Appeal, which decision, as I have said, is accepted and acted upon by the Chief Commissioner, and if I do not mistake the views of the majority of this court, I think it is the principal ground upon which they also proceed.\nThe first point to consider is whether the company in occupying the parts of the harbour in question with its works, was acting legally in accordance with the terms of the authority conferred by the Railway Act of 1879, which admittedly governed it. The principal provisions applicable are section 7, sub-sec. 3, and section 68. As to section 68, it has never been suggested that the approval of the Railway Committee was not obtained, and we may assume that the course of the company in that respect was regular. It is argued, however, that the consent required by section 7, sub-sec. 3, by reason both of the fact that the lands occupied were Crown lands, and that they constituted part of the bed or beach of a lake, was not procured until some time after the railway was constructed, and was then procured upon such terms as to constitute the public right of passage contended for. Before discussing the documents, which are said to shew the necessary consent under section 7, sub-sec. 3, it will be convenient to look a little at the terms of that section. It is to be observed that the enactment prescribes no particular form of words or of instrument in which the consent is to be embodied, and the force of this circumstance is emphasized by the provisions of sub-section 4, which expressly provides that in certain cases the license and consent are to be under the hand and seal of the Governor. Any instrument, and any form of words sufficient to evidence the consent of the Governor in Council, in fact, would, I think, be sufficient under sub-section 3. The documents relied upon are an order in council of the 25th of January, 1887, and an Act of the Dominion Parliament of 22nd of May, 1888. By the order in council sanction is given for the building of the Don branch, and the maps and plans shewing the location of the line are approved. By the Act the company is authorized at any time within three years from the passing of the Act to construct and complete the branch referred to in the order in council, which is set forth in the schedule to the Act. It is not disputed that the branch was constructed in accordance with the maps and plans that were before the governor in council and, one must presume, before Parliament. We must assume as I have already said, that the approval of the Railway Committee under section 68 was obtained. I am not able to convince myself that in these circumstances the consent of the governor in council under section 7, sub-sec. 3, has not been sufficiently established. It is idle, it seems to me, to suggest (at all events, the onus is upon those who do suggest it), that this order in council was passed and this statute was enacted in ignorance of the fact that the Don branch was being constructed along the water front of Toronto south of and adjoining the Esplanade; and, in part, in spaces which were parts of the harbour. The map produced shews, as plainly as anything could shew to any one having the slightest knowledge of the locality, that such was the case. I am not able to follow the suggestion that this statute and order in council amounted to nothing more than a consent to a street crossing. It must be observed that the function of the Governor in Council under section 18 was confined in its operation to branch lines. The approval of the location and the maps and plans of the main line was not required under the Act of 1879, or the Act of 1888. Even under the Railway Act as it stands to-day, it is only the approval of the general location that is required. In the case of branch lines (which could not exceed six miles in length), the whole responsibility was thrown upon the governor in council. In such circumstances the suggestion referred to is not one to which, I think, much weight should be attached.\nBut the order in council contains much more than an approval of plans; it expressly sanctions the building of the line according to the plans, that is to say, in the places actually afterwards occupied by the railway, and the statute confirms that sanction.\nI am not concerned at present to consider the precise interest in these lands which passed to the railway company on the construction of their works under the authority thus conferred. For the present the question is, was the railway lawfully there? If a sufficient consent was obtained within the meaning of subsection 3, then the railway was lawfully there. If such a consent was not obtained it was not lawfully there, and the railway company were trespassers as against the Crown and (assuming the public to have been actually prejudiced thereby in the exercise of the right of navigation, or any right ancillary thereto), the works in the localities under discussion were a public nuisance. I do not think the respondent pressed its point quite so far as to say that the company was acting wholly without authority in constructing its works in these places, but I am not able myself to find any middle ground; either there was a consent within the statute or there was not. Without such consent there was an absence of statutory authority for the occupation of any Crown lands or of any part of Toronto Harbour.\nIf my view be correct that the consent required is sufficiently evidenced by the order in council and the statute, then I must say I cannot find, at this point, anything to shew the creation or reservation of any public right of passage across these parcels of land. It cannot surely be said (in every case in which railway works should be placed on the bed or shore of a navigable water under the authority of sub-sec. 3), that for the public right of navigation thereby interfered with, there would be substituted, ipso jure, a public right of passage over such works. I do not, for the moment, consider the question whether the Governor in Council would have power to reserve such a right as one of the terms of consent. It is sufficient for the present to say that there is no evidence whatever down to the time I am speaking of, to shew that any such term was imposed. It is convenient to observe at this point, however, that the consent under the sub-section mentioned and the statutory authority flowing from the consent is to occupy the area to which it relates for railway purposes. Prim\u00e0 facie, at all events, that appears to me to involve the exclusion of any such general right of passage as was here contended for. Attorney-General of British Columbia v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[16], at page 212.\nI do not suppose that the sufficiency of the statute or order in council for the purpose suggested would have been impeached at this date, had it not been for some transactions between the railway company and the Dominion Government, six years later, in 1893. In that year an application was made by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under the provisions of section 19, ch. 39 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, for a formal grant of the parts of the prolongations now in question; and under the authority of that statute a grant was made to the Canadian Pacific Railway of\nthe right to construct, maintain, and use for railway purposes two or more railway tracks and appurtenances and the roadbeds therefor, as part of the Ontario and Quebec railway and over eleven parcels of land situated in the city of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, in our Dominion of Canada, containing in the aggregate fifty-six one-hundredths of an acre, more or less, and, being bounded respectively as follows, that is to say.\nAssuming there had been no previous consent under the Railway Act, that, of course, was in itself a sufficient consent. But it is said that this consent was given upon terms involving the reservation of a public right of passage across the railway. This contention is based upon the terms of the company's application in part, and in part upon the order in council under which the grant was made. I do not think, myself, that the terms of the company's application (except to the extent to which they are incorporated expressly or impliedly in the order in council or the grant), are relevant upon the question whether in point of fact such a term was imposed by the Governor in Council. They are not referred to in the grant; the parts of the order in council which refer to them and which respondent relies upon as evidencing the constitution of such rights of passage are as follows:\u2014\nThe Minister further states that the company represents that these lands are held by the Government in the interests of Canada, and under the impression that the order of His Excellency the Governor-General in council, dated 25th January, 1887, and the Dominion Act, 51 Vict. ch. 53, gave the company the right to do so, it some time ago constructed tracks over the said lands, and has been using them for railway purposes; but having been advised that this right is not complete unless the approval embodied in the said order in council be followed by a formal grant, it now prays that its right to use the said tracks be confirmed by such a grant.\nThat the company further points out that the giving of this easement will not interfere with the Crown granting to the city of Toronto or to any other party a full title to the said parcels of land, subject only to the use for railway purposes above mentioned; a use \u00abwhich the Government and the city officials, and all other parties interested, have for several years understood that the company had or was to have.\nThese paragraphs do not appear to me to impose any terms upon the railway company. They record an admission by the company which, taken at the highest against it, may be said to embody an understanding upon which the grant issued\u2014that the grant should not prevent the vesting of a \"full title\" to the parcels in question in the municipality of Toronto subject to the use of them for railway purposes. I do not profess to understand the meaning of the words \"full title,\" but whatever they may mean there is surely nothing here which, upon any fair construction of the words, can be held to impose the condition that the right of the railway to use these parcels for railway purposes should be subject to the right of the public to use them as a highway. The vesting of a title to the parcels subject to the railway company's interest in them is a vastly different thing from that. If it be asked, what other purpose could such a grant to the municipality serve, the answer is, that for the moment I am dealing with the question whether public rights of passage were created by this transaction through the imposition of terms by the Governor in Council; what the parties may have had in view for the future is another thing.\nHere the respondents at the threshold of their contention are confronted with an important question touching the extent of the powers of the governor in council concerning the creation of highways over a railway line with or without the consent of the company or of the municipality or of both. If, as Mr. Armour contended, the works had already been sufficiently sanctioned, and the Governor in Council were then functus officio, in respect of terms, and if no term establishing public rights of way had been imposed, then we have upon this contention to consider the bald question, whether the railway and the Governor in Council in such circumstances had any legal authority to create highways over these parcels. I think they could not do so. The Consolidated Railway Act of 1888 was in force at the time of this transaction. That Act contains special provisions which, in my opinion, were intended to be exhaustive with respect to the creation of public rights of way over a railway. I think that such rights of way could not be created except by the authority of the Railway Committee acting (at the time in question) under the powers conferred by section 11 or section 14 of the Railway Act: Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Guthrie[17]; Town of High River v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[18]. The Railway Committee of the Privy Council did not derive its powers in any way from the Governor in Council as a whole; it was a statutory body with a purely statutory mandate, and the statutory duties assigned to it were clearly not exerciseable in the first instance by the larger body; and it is not suggested that in this transaction there was any action of the Railway Committee. Assuming on the other hand the Governor in Council with respect to terms were not functus officio, I do not think the section of the Act authorizing that body to impose terms where Crown land or the bed of a navigable water was to be occupied can fairly be held to authorize the doing of something, such as the creation of a highway, where there were special provisions of the Act providing machinery through which alone that thing could, in general, be done. It is not, in a word, to be taken as vesting in the Governor in Council in the cases to which it applied a general dispensing power in respect of the provisions of the Railway Act. Doubtless the company might be compelled to submit to an undertaking not to oppose an application to the Railway Committee or to pay the cost of the construction of the crossing if a highway should be ordered by that body or even to make an application to the Railway Committee for such an order. But none of these things was done here. Nor is the position strengthened at all, in my opinion, by the subsequent grant to the municipality of these parcels in 1894. It is perfectly true that the grant is expressed to be made to the grantee in trust to use the subjects of it for the purposes of highways; but it is also made subject to the terms of the Windmill Line Agreement, and by the provisions of that agreement the prolongation of the streets could not, without the consent of the riparian owners, be filled up for a period of ten years nor until the space described as Lake Street in that agreement should have been filled in and converted into a highway under the terms of it; nor at all after the expiration of fifteen years. The suggestion that this grant in itself amounted to a dedication of those parts of the harbour corresponding to the prolongations of the streets is one with which I wholly disagree; section 19, ch. 39, under which it purports to be made, authorizes the Governor in Council to sell or lease parts of the beds of harbours, but nothing in that enactment professes to authorize the construction of any work, in the subjects of grants made under it, which would be an interference with the public right of navigation. Hundreds of grants have been made since Confederation under this statute, and many before Confederation under similar statutes in all parts of Canada; but it has never been supposed that such grants per se conferred any authority to interfere with the public right of navigation; where any structure having such effect is to be erected \u2014except under the authority of some such statute as the Railway Act\u2014resort is to be had to the machinery provided by the Act relating to Works in Navigable Waters, which, at the time in question, was ch. 92, E.S.C. (1886), an Act in pari materi\u00e0 with section 19, ch. 39, and, for the purposes of construction, to be read with that enactment. Moreover the enactment (sec. 19, ch. 39) provides that no grant under the authority of it should be held to justify any interference with riparian rights; the municipality was therefore both by the statute and the grant thrown back upon the Windmill Line Agreement for its authority to fill up these prolongations. The grant was made doubtless with a view to enable the city in accordance with the provisions of that agreement, and in compliance with the Dominion statute relating to Works in Navigable Waters to convert these strips of harbour into streets when the proper time should arrive. When that should occur it was doubtless contemplated by all parties that crossings over the parcels in question should be provided; but that they should be provided through the machinery furnished by the Railway Act for that purpose.\nIt is argued also that in some way the railway company is estopped (by reason of its application, and of the terms of the grant to the company and of the grant to the municipality just referred to) from disputing the existence of these highways. I do not think that can be supported. The statutory grant received by the railway company is not a record; The Queen v. Hughes[19]; and (since the Crown could, under the common law, convey by matter of record only) could not of itself have the effect of a common law conveyance in working an estoppel as against the grantee. General Finance, Mortgage and Discount Co. v. Liberator Permanent Benefit Building Soc.[20]. It is possible\u2014although I think it very doubtful\u2014that the circumstances afford a ground for an equitable estoppel against the railway company respecting the extent of its interest in the parcels comprised in its grant. But I can find nothing in them to support any estoppel on the subject of public rights of passage. There is, however, a complete answer to this contention, if I am right in. the view that highways could only be established over these parcels by means of the machinery provided by the Railway Act. It is quite too clear for argument that no act of the company, however effective to create an estoppel in other cases, could take effect by way of estoppel in establishing a highway where none existed, and when the statutory prerequisites for the creation of one had not been complied with ; the company could not, in a word, by resorting to the expedient of creating an estoppel, add to its own statutory powers. Great North-West Central Railway Co. v. Charlebois[21].\nI come now to the consideration of the agreement of 1892, and the statutes confirming it. There are two statutes, one (provincial), 55 Vict. ch. 90, giving the municipality authority to execute the agreement; and one (Dominion), 56 Vict. ch. 90, declaring the works to be for the general advantage of Canada, enacting (sec. 2) that the agreement shall be \"in force and binding on the parties thereto,\" and (sec. 3), empowering the parties to do all things necessary to carry its provisions into effect. There are two rival views of the nature of this latter statute. The respondent argues that it is merely a statute authorizing an agreement inter partes which, notwithstanding the statutory authorization, still remains a private agreement. The appellants contend that it is a special Act within the meaning of the Railway Act creating a scheme with a view to providing accommodation for the two railways, and establishing means for the protection and for the convenience of the public in relation to those parts of the railways of the appellants, which are specially dealt with in the order appealed from, and that according to the terms of section 3 of the Railway Act the provisions of this special statute must displace sections 237 and 238 of that Act. I do not think that, on its construction of it, there is anything in the text of the agreement itself that materially supports the contentions of the respondent, but it is argued that the plan annexed to it shews crossings to be protected at Bay Street, Yonge Street and Church Street, and that section 5 of the agreement (taken with this plan) constitutes a binding admission that there were such crossings there at the time the agreement was entered into. Section 5 is as follows:\u2014\nThe city hereby agrees to extinguish, at its own expense, all the present rights (if any) of the public and of property owners to cross the railway track on the Esplanade, between Yonge Street and the point where York Street, as deviated, connects with Esplanade Street, except at Bay Street, and in consideration thereof each of the companies agrees to give up, without compensation, any right of crossing the said railway tracks between Yonge and York Streets, except at Bay Street, and for such consideration the Grand Trunk further agrees to waive its contention that it is not liable to contribute to the cost of making or protecting level crossings at Church Street, Yonge Street and Bay Street, and the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific, without prejudice to their rights in any other transaction, agree to pay each one-half of the cost and maintenance of such by gates and watchmen at the latter crossing, such protection to be subject to the approval of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council of Canada, or to be made in such a way as it may direct.\nLooking at the plan one sees that the so-called crossings at Yonge Street and Church Street are obviously contemplated crossings, having no existence in fact at the date of the agreement. As to Bay Street, I do not understand it to be disputed that south of the Esplanade that street was not filled in. The parties doubtless did anticipate that the Windmill Line Agreement of 1888 would be carried out, and that the street prolongations south of the Esplanade would eventually be filled in under the terms of that agreement, and the stipulations contained in article 5 of the agreement were, no doubt, entered into in that view. The article, therefore, cannot fairly be read \"as \"containing any admission touching the existing state of affairs. Furthermore the railway companies never received the consideration mentioned, and it is doubtful whether the undertakings on the part of the companies have ever yet become operative. But there is an answer based upon broader grounds than these. If the agreement is to be treated merely as a private agreement, then any implied admissions can only be taken as admissions inter partes and cannot be effective to found jurisdiction any more than an agreement between the parties that the Board should have jurisdiction. The article itself provides that the undertaking of the Canadian Pacific Railway shall be without prejudice to its rights in any other transaction; and it would seem to be a violation of principle to use such an admission so guarded in a private agreement as an instrument for furthering a proceeding intended to destroy the situation which it was the object of the agreement to set up and maintain.\nIt may be argued that as by the third section of the ratifying Act, 56 Vict. ch. 48, each of the parties to the agreement is empowered to do whatever may on its part be necessary to carry out and give effect to its undertakings as embodied in the agreement, that the railway companies were authorized by this Act to permit the municipality to lay out highways across their respective railways at the place mentioned, and that in so far, at all events, as this was acted on such highways were validly constituted. This argument, I think, overlooks article 21 of the agreement, which provides that the Railway Act and the Municipal Act, so far as applicable to anything in the agreement, shall, except where otherwise provided, form part of the agreement as if expressly set out in it. Assuming article 5 then to be rightly read as containing an undertaking on behalf of the companies to agree to the constitution of highways across their tracks (which was merely a private undertaking), it is quite clear that the formalities of the Railway Act and of the Municipal Act were not intended to be dispensed with. The authority given by section 3 of the Act is an authority to act in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. That clearly imports, 1 think, except where inconsistent with the terms of the agreement, those parts of the Railway Act and of the Municipal Act which relate to the subjects dealt with. I have not been able to satisfy myself that there is any evidence from which one can properly conclude that any public way was, in fact, laid out either at Yonge Street or at Church Street. With regard to Bay Street the evidence is hardly more satisfactory. It was not suggested that in respect to any one of these streets the sanction of the Railway Committee or of the Board of Railway Commissioners had been obtained to laying it out across the railways.\nThere is, of course, York Street bridge, the construction of which the agreement did authorize; but assuming the municipality to have established highway crossings at Bay Street and York Street, I do not think that would afford a sufficient ground for supporting the order in question. Having regard to the reasons given by the Chief Commissioner in support of the jurisdiction of the Board, I think it is perfectly idle to suggest that the Railway Board in directing the putting up of the structure in question did so primarily with the design of protecting the crossings at these two streets alone. The Board has not exercised its powers with any such view; it has acted upon the assumption that it has power to deal with a series of crossings extending from Parliament Street to Spadina Avenue.\nI think, however, that the view of the agreement of 1892 and the ratifying statutes expressed by my brother Girouard is the sounder view.\n\"Special Act\" is defined by section 2, sub-sec. 28, of the Railway Act. I am not able to agree with the view of the learned Chief Commissioner that the effect of that definition is to limit the application of the term to statutes relating to the construction or the operation of a railway. That view seems to me to ignore the words, \"which is enacted with special reference to such railway.\" The Act ratifying the tripartite agreement is clearly a statute enacted with reference to the Grand Trunk and Ontario and Quebec Railways, and I think section 3 of the Railway Act applies to it, and consequently that the provisions of the special Act, in so far as it is necessary to give effect to them, must be taken to override the general provisions of the Railway Act. I postpone for the moment the Act of 1909 relied upon by Mr. Dewart. I was impressed at the argument with the view that the Act in question does nothing more than ratify an agreement between private parties which, notwithstanding the Act, would be enforceable only as between the parties to it themselves, and that such a statute could not be said to be within the contemplation of Parliament when passing section 3 of the Railway Act. On further consideration I have come to the conclusion that this view of the Act of 1893 is founded upon some misconception of the character of the legislation and of the agreement thereby ratified. One of the parties to the agreement was the municipality of Toronto. That municipality was invested with authority over the public streets in the municipality; and in all the negotiations, agreements and legislation respecting the Esplanade and the situation of the railway companies there, the municipality had acted and had been treated as representing the inhabitants not only as regards public safety in the localities through which the railways passed, but as regards the convenience of industrial and other establishments with respect to shipping facilities. The agreement of 1892 provided for the recasting of the existing railway arrangements. There was to be a new Union Station. There was to be a change in the site of the station and yards of the Canadian Pacific Railway. There were to be facilities by which the Grand Trunk Railway was to have access to the waters of the harbour through the prolongation of two of the streets west of York Street. The site provided for the Canadian Pacific Railway was situated west of the western terminus of the Don branch, between the Union Station to the north and the harbour to the south. Traffic across the railways of all kinds was provided for by two bridges, one at York Street and one at John Street. The cost of maintaining level crossings at Bay Street, at Yonge Street, and at Church Street was provided for. The agreement, as framed, involved as its central and governing features, provisions for direct access, from the railway yards to the railway lines on the same level, direct access to the harbour by the railway companies from their yards and overhead bridges or protected level crossings for the purpose of carrying the highway traffic across the railways from the north to south and vice vers\u00e0. I have already pointed out that the application of the Railway Act to the works in contemplation is provided for by article 21 of the agreement, where it is said that, except as otherwise provided in the agreement, the Railway Act shall form part of it so far as applicable to anything therein contained. What is the effect of this article? Surely when Parliament declared that this article should be valid, and that these works might be carried out according to the provisions of the agreement there was necessarily involved in this that, except as otherwise provided in the agreement, the Railway Act and all the sanctions of the Railway Act should, so far as applicable, govern everything to be done under the agreement and the operation of the works when completed. On the other hand, in so far as the agreement did otherwise provide, the statutory authority was an authority to carry out the scheme and operate the works when finished according to the terms of such special provisions. Reading article 21 and section 3 together then, we must, I think, look to this agreement for the provisions of the law governing those subjects with respect to which the agreement makes specific provision.\nWhat then has this agreement to say with regard to the subject matters dealt with in the order appealed from? In express terms it provides for the maintenance of level crossings at Church, Yonge and Bay Streets. In express terms it provides for highway bridges at York and John Streets. If I am right in my view as to the character of the Act, there cannot be any question that the jurisdiction of the Railway Committee was excluded to this extent, that they were to have no power to make an order inconsistent with these provisions. Since, moreover, as I have pointed out, the purpose of the scheme obviously was in part to maintain the railway yards and the railway tracks on the same level, it is very clear that the order made is incompatible with it.\nOne is asked, however: Is it to be supposed that the legislature intended these provisions to fix for all time the situation of the railways on the water front? The answer, I think, is that the two railways concerned, and the municipality as representing the interests mentioned, having reached an arrangement satisfactory to themselves the Legislature was quite content to give effect to that arrangement in the expectation that for many years, at all events, it would not be necessary to disturb it. Nor do I think there is much force in the observation that only one or other of the parties to it could, while it remained executory, compel the others to carry out the undertakings embodied in it. We need not suppose the legislature to have been very tenderly concerned with respect to the interests of the railway companies. And as for the undertakings of these companies the cardinal fact is that the other party was the municipality which, in the very special sense I have mentioned, was treated as the guardian of the interests of the inhabitants in respect of the matters dealt with.\nWith respect to the level crossings indeed, and the protection to be afforded there, that subject was committed by paragraph 5 to the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, and in most of the provisions of the agreement in unrespect of the carrying out of which disputes might reasonably be anticipated some method for the speedy and authoritative settlement of them was provided for. In case of dispute, for example, in regard to the York Street bridge, the arbiters were to be the Railway Committee. In respect of bridges, crossings, and approaches over the Grand Trunk Railway Co.'s tracks on the Esplanade disputes were to be submitted to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, with a right of appeal to either party; and plans and specifications for the bridge at John Street were to be prepared by the city engineer of the City of Toronto, an engineer to be named by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and, in the event of disagreement, by an umpire to be named by the Chief Justice of Ontario.\nThe contention of the respondent seems to me to lead to this conclusion\u2014that these provisions which the legislature had declared to be binding upon the parties and which the legislature had authorized the parties to carry into effect might, next day, be completely nullified by the action of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council acting under sections 187 and 188 of the then' existing Railway Act. With great respect, I cannot accept that view.\nIt is said, however, that the application of sections 237 and 238 to the works in question is made clear by an Act of 1909 amending section 241, sub-sec. 2 of the Railway Act. The Act is 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, section 8, and is in the following words:\u2014\n241. Every structure by which any railway is carried over or under any highway, or by which any highway is carried over or under any railway, shall be so constructed, and, at all times, be so maintained, as to afford safe and adequate facilities for all traffic passing over, under, or through such structure.\n2. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, or in any other Act, the provisions of sections 236 to 241, both inclusive, of this Act shall apply to all corporations, persons, companies and railways, other that Government railways, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt will have been observed that my view with respect to the character and effect of the agreement of 1892 and the ratifying statutes does not necessarily depend upon the application of section 3 of the Railway Act, but may be rested upon the circumstance that the agreement in itself plainly declared the intention that the provisions of the Railway Act should be applicable only to the extent to which it was not otherwise provided in the agreement, that is to say, that the provisions of the Railway Act were not to be applied in such a way as to alter fundamentally the character of the settlement embodied in the agreement. I do not think that the Act of 1909 displaces these provisions of the agreement relating to the application of the Railway Act. It is one thing to say that the sections mentioned shall apply to the Grand Trunk Railway, and to the Ontario and Quebec Railway generally; it is another thing to say that the Act of 1909 shall be held to abrogate the terms of this statutory settlement\u2014a settlement entered into and sanctioned by the two legislatures with a view of providing for the special needs of a particular locality as touching not only the railways concerned but touching also the interests of the public as regards safety and as regards the accommodation of shippers on the railways and as regards the convenience of access to and from the harbour and passage across the railways. To some of the subject matters falling within the scope of the scheme, the Railway Act would, in the absence of such special legislation, have applied. To many others the Railway Act could have no possible application. It appears to me to be contrary to principle to hold that subsequent legislation dealing generally with highway crossings over railways should (without any special manifestation on the part of the legislature that it should so operate) be applied to the specific crossings provided for by this legislative scheme in such a way as to abrogate the provisions relating to them, and furthermore to make it impossible to carry the scheme into effect as a whole, and in many respects to render fruitless the costly outlays made on the faith of the legislative sanction given to it. Esquimault Water Works Co. v. City of Victoria[22]. I do not suggest that the provisions of the Railway Act referred to in the Act of 1909 are not to have any application whatever to the locality in question. It is not necessary to go further than this\u2014that the provisions of the legislative arrangement of 1892, so far as they extend to the subjects dealt with in those sections, are to be regarded as paramount. The two following passages appear to me to be apposite. The first is from the judgment of Mr. Justice Willes in Thorpe v. Adams[23], at page 138:\u2014\nThe good sense of the law as laid down by my lord is quite obvious, because if a bill had been brought into Parliament to repeal a local Act, it would never have been allowed to pass into law without notice to the parties whose interests were affected by it, and opportunity being given to them to be heard in opposition to it, if necessary; whereas a general provision in a public Act is discussed with reference to general policy, and without any reference to private rights, with which there is no intention on the part of the legislature to interfere.\nAnd the second from Lord Hobhouse, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Barker v. Edger[24], at page 754:\u2014\nThe general maxim is generalia specialibus non derogant. When the legislature has given its attention to a separate subject, and made provision for it, the presumption is that a subsequent general enactment is not intended to interfere with the special provision unless it manifests that intention very clearly. Each enactment must be construed in that respect according to its own subject-matter and its own terms. This case is a peculiarly strong one for the application of the general maxim. The legislature found an area of land comparatively small in extent to be the subject of intricate disputes in which both Europeans and natives took part. Some of those questions fell within the scope of the Native Land Court and others did not. It was for the benefit of all parties that a single tribunal should adjudicate on the whole group of questions. Therefore, as Williams J. has stated, a new authority was given to the Native Land Court as regards both land and matters of account. It would require a very clear expression of the mind of the legislature before we should impute to it the intention of destroying the foundation of the work which it had initiated some four years before, and to which the court has ever since been assiduously addressing itself.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons given by me at length in the Yonge Street Bridge Case[25], and approved of by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[26], I am of opinion that this appeal, in so far as it rests upon an allegation that the appellant company's tracks along the water front of the City of Toronto do not cross any highway, cannot be maintained. That Yonge Street exists as a highway crossed by these tracks was demonstrated in that case; that some ten other highways are likewise crossed by such tracks was shewn before the Railway Board in this case.\nThe evidence of actual user, prior to the construction of the Don branch, of the portions of such highways actually crossed by it was, it is true, \"somewhat scanty, but it is perhaps as good as could reasonably be expected with respect to a time so far back.\" Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[27], at page 209. But the appellants, as grantees from the Crown of limited railway rights in the nature of quasi-easements, are estopped as against the respondents, privies of the Crown, and its grantees of the lands in question for highway purposes subject to such railway rights, from denying the existence of these highways. This part of the respondent's case is overwhelmingly established.\nThat over these other streets, as over Yonge Street, in respect to which I need not reiterate my views, the appellants had merely rights for the purposes of their railway in the nature of quasi-easements, similar to those which they enjoy at other highway crossings, is clearly shewn in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington.\nThat these streets existed as highways within the definition of that term in section 2 (k) of the Railway Act, and that as such they were crossed by the appellants' railway when the order now in appeal was pronounced, in my opinion does not admit of doubt. Moreover, the Railway Board very properly assumed that it was clothed with jurisdiction to determine this question. Williams v. Adams[28].\nThe Board had authority to abrogate the Yonge Street bridge order of the former Railway Committee of the Privy Council (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 37, section 32 (2)). The order in appeal, inasmuch as it is inconsistent with the Yonge Street bridge order, is tantamount to an express rescission of the earlier order. The fact that the Yonge Street bridge order, made by the late Railway Committee, has not been in terms rescinded, therefore affords no objection to the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order now in appeal.\nThe provisions of the order in respect to the closing and removal of the York Street bridge may be supported as the rescission of an order of the Railway Committee, and also as a substantive order of the Board for the diversion of a highway.\nThe provisions directing the elimination of some tracks now in use, the elevation of \"through\" tracks, while allowing some sidings to be maintained on the level subject to restrictions as to their use, and the cutting off of direct access from the east to the appellants' freight yards involve considerations of two kinds\u2014of policy and of jurisdiction. With considerations of the former class we are not concerned; the discretion of the Board is absolute, and its judgment final. I find nothing in any of these provisions which transcends the jurisdiction of the Board under section 238 of the Railway Act, as re-enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, section 5, to\nmake such an order as to the protection, safety and convenience of the public as it deems expedient * * * and (to order) that such other works be executed * * * or measures taken, as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction, etc.\nI am also of the opinion that there is no \"special Act,\" within the meaning of that term, as used in section 3, of the Railway Act, applicable, which should be taken to override the provisions of section 238. The subject matter of that section\u2014public safety and convenience\u2014is not only not the same as any of those dealt with in the so-called special Acts relied on, it is also paramount to them in its importance. Moreover, I am not at all satisfied that a statute which validates and confirms a private agreement between corporations renders stipulations in that agreement equivalent to provisions of a \"special Act\" so that they would, by virtue of section 3 of the Railway Act, override statutory provisions obviously intended to be of universal application such as are contained in section 238. City of Kingston v. Kingston , Portsmonth and Cataraqui Electric Ry. Co.[29].\nBut any possible doubt arising out of the so-called \"special Acts\" affecting the appellant company, would appear to be concluded by section 241(2) of the Railway Act, as re-enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, section 8. Although the decision of the Board was announced in December, 1908, the order in appeal was not settled until, and it bears date, the 7th June, 1909; this Act was assented to on the 19th May, 1909. It provides that:\u2014\nNotwithstanding anything in this Act, or in any other Act, the provisions of sections 236 to 241, both inclusive, of this Act shall apply to all corporations, persons, companies and railways, other than government railways, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nAlthough the Grand Trunk Railway Company has not appealed from the order of the Board, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company claims the benefit of any objections to its validity which would have been open to the former company. The Grand Trunk tracks are admittedly constructed along and upon a public highway. It is, therefore, within the very terms of section 238. The company is required by the order to elevate some of these tracks. This is a permanent diversion of the railway. Diversion may, I take it, be perpendicular as well as horizontal. The order may also be viewed as requiring that \"the railway be carried over * * * the highway.\" In either aspect it is within the purview of section 238. That the order involves the erection of a structure which will in effect obstruct and destroy part of a highway seems to be an objection which should not be open either to the Grand Trunk Railway Company or to these appellants. For highway purposes, excepting the right of crossing the tracks, the part of the Esplanade upon which it is proposed that the viaduct shall be constructed has now no real value. It is for all practical purposes a railway right of way. Vehicles cannot be driven along it and they cross it only at street crossings. For the traffic of carriages and pedestrians easterly and westerly abundant provision is made by the remaining 48 feet of the Esplanade lying north of the Grand Trunk tracks and used as a public street. The crossing rights are provided for by the openings or passages to be made through the viaduct embankment as the order of the Board directs.\nNeither in the fact that the order requires the elevation of the tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the laying of which on the Esplanade was authorized by pre-confederation legislation, nor in the fact that it involves the erection of a permanent embankment upon what is undoubtedly part of a highway subject to railway rights, do I find anything which exceeds the jurisdiction of the Board. By section 6 of the Railway Act the Grand Trunk Railway Company is explicitly declared to be subject to the provisions of the Dominion Railway Act, and provisions of its ante-confederation special Acts inconsistent with the provisions of the Railway Act are excluded and abrogated.\nProvision is not made for the carriage of all the crossing highways through openings or passages in the proposed embankment. Whether the railway companies are entitled to raise this objection is, at least, questionable. The highways not so provided for are in effect diverted so that the traffic upon them will cross the railways at other openings or passages to be provided for parallel and adjacent streets. There is express jurisdiction for the diversion of highways, and, given the jurisdictional fact of a highway crossing or crossed by a railway, the Board is the sole and final judge of when and how this power shall be exercised.\nFinally counsel for the appellants object that while they are obliged to elevate their tracks along the water front, they are also required at other points, viz., at Eastern Avenue, and at Spadina Avenue, to carry their tracks under the highways, overhead bridges being directed for the accommodation of vehicular and passenger traffic. With the policy of the order in these particulars we are not concerned. The statute expressly authorizes the Board to order that at any particular crossing the railway shall be carried over or under the highway, and the highway over or under the railway. I see no reason why, if deemed advisable, the Board may not make one provision for one crossing and another provision for another crossing; no reason why it may not embody in one order provisions which it could certainly make in several orders.\nTo express an opinion upon the merits of the proposed viaduct as a solution of the difficulty caused by the location of railways along the water front of the City of Toronto would be impertinent to the questions before this court. Whatever view should be entertained as to the advisability of the erection of such a structure, the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners to order it, in my opinion, is unquestionable.\nThe appeal fails upon every point and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Grand Trunk Railway Co., appellants: W.

[1906] c. 139, s. 48.\nBy a municipal by-law an industrial company was given exemption from taxation for a term of years. P., a ratepayer of the municipality, applied for a writ of mandamus to compel the council to assess the company for school rates, which, he claimed, were not included in the exemption. The decision to grant the writ was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (20 Ont. L.R. 246). On motion for special leave to appeal from the latter judgment.\nHeld, that the case was not one of public interest, and did not raise important questions of law. It did not, therefore, fall within the principles laid down in Lake Erie & Detroit River Railway Co. v. Marsh (35 Can. S.C.R. 197), for granting such leave.\nMOTION for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the order of Mr. Justice MacMahon that a writ of mandamus issue to compel the City of Stratford to assess the appellant company for school rates.\nThe City of Stratford by a by-law of the city council exempted the appellant company from taxation for municipal purposes during a specified term of years. The plaintiff, Pringle, acting on behalf of all the ratepayers of the city, applied for a writ of mandamus to compel the council to assess the company for school rates and an order for the writ to issue was made by Mr. Justice MacMahon and confirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nTwo questions were raised in the case, and both decided against the company. First, whether or not the remedy by mandamus was open to the plaintiff. Secondly, whether or not the exemption from taxation covered school rates.\nChrysler K.C. for the motion.\nJ. Travers Lewis K.C. contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario in two actions consolidated. In both, the relief claimed was for a mandamus ordering the corporation of Stratford to assess the present appellants for certain school taxes. The mandamus was granted by the trial judge, and affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe motion is based upon an affidavit alleging that the amount indirectly involved is over $1,000.\nIt would seem clear, and the application apparently is based upon the fact, that no appeal lies in the present case as of right, in view of the decisions of this court, more particularly, Attorney-General for Ontario v. Scully[2]. In that case, which was similar to this in that the judgment complained of dismissed an appeal from the judgment of the Chief Jus- tice of the King\u2019s Bench, who dismissed an application for a writ of mandamus, the court said:\nThere must be special reasons to support an application of this nature.\nIn the later case of the Lake Erie & Detroit River Railway Co. v. Marsh[3], the court, after deliberation, determined that leave to appeal under this very sub-section should only be granted where the case involved matters of public interest or some important question of law.\nIn the present case, however important the judgment of the Court of Appeal may be to the parties to the action, it only affects the construction to be placed upon a particular by-law of the respondent municipality, and an agreement entered into between it and the appellant, and the matter is, therefore, not one at all within the rule laid down in the case above referred to.\nThe application must be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPherson & Davidson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Makins & Gregory.\n[1] 20 Ont.

The plaintiffs succeeded at the trial, and in a Divisional Court, but their action was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which, on application of the plaintiffs, granted an order extending the time for appealing to the Supreme Court of Canada. As the damages recovered at the trial were only $807, there was no appeal to the latter court as of right, and the plaintiffs moved for special leave.\nJ.E. Jones for the motion.\nDouglas K.C. contra was not called upon.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In this case the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was pronounced on the 13th May, 1909. On the 31st December of the same year, the Court of Appeal made an order on the application of the present appellants, by which they purported to extend the time for appealing to the Supreme Court until the close of the present sittings, in order that an application might be made to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal. The appellants now apply, on notice, for such leave, under section 48(e), although the amount involved is less than $1,000.\nBefore considering the latter question, however, we have to determine whether we have power to grant leave at all in view of section 69 of the Supreme Court Act, which provides that every appeal shall be brought within 60 days from the signing, or entering, or pronouncing of the judgment appealed from. Although the 60 days have elapsed, the appellants contend that we have power to grant leave under section 71, which provides as follows:\u2014\nNotwithstanding anything herein contained the court proposed to be appealed from or any judge thereof may, under special circumstances, allow an appeal, although the same is not brought within the time hereinbefore prescribed in that behalf. The jurisprudence of this court is entirely against our having any power to grant leave to appeal after the 60 days have expired.\nIn Walmsley v. Griffith[1], and News Printing Co. of Toronto v. McCrae[2], this court held that neither the Supreme Court nor any judge thereof has jurisdiction under this section to extend the time within which an appeal must be brought.\nIn Barrett v. Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke[3], it was held that even where the court below, as in this case, had extended the time for bringing the appeal, nevertheless the Supreme Court had no power to grant leave to appeal per saltum.\nIn Canadian Mutual Loan and Investment Co. v. Lee[4], the court said:\nMore than 60 days have elapsed since the judgment, * * and under a constant jurisprudence our power to grant special leave is gone, and the time cannot be extended for such a purpose either under sec. 42 (now section 71), which applies exclusively to appeals as of light, or under rule 70 (now rule 108), which has always been construed as not applying to delays fixed by statute.\nWe hold, therefore, that the court has no jurisdiction to grant the leave asked for, and the application must be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cowan & Towers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.E.

Idington J. dissenting. The limitation so provided applies to the case of a minor injured, while residing in his mother's house, by contact with an electric wire in use there under a contract between the company and his mother.\nJudgment appealed from (14 B.C. Rep. 224) reversed, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Lampman, Co.J., and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff, an infant suing by his next friend, was injured, while residing in his mother's house, by coming in contact with an electric wire in use there in connection with the supply of electric light under a contract between the company, defendants, and his mother. The defendants acquired the property, rights, contracts, privileges and franchises of the Consolidated Railway and Light Company, under the provisions of \"The Consolidated Railway Company's Act, 1896\" (55 Vict. ch. 55 (B.C.)), and carried on the operation thereof in their own name. By the 60th section of this Act it was provided that actions for indemnity for injury sustained by reason of the works or operations of the company should be commenced within six months next after the date when the injury was sustained and not afterwards. The injury was sustained on the 26th of December, 1907, and the action was commenced on the 31st of October, 1908. The action was dismissed at the trial, but this judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. A. E. McPhillips K.C. for the appellants.\nTravers Levis K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment in this case prepared by Duff J. and I agree with his reasoning and conclusion that the appellants are entitled to claim the protection of section 60 of the \"Consolidated Railway Companies Act, 1896,\" of British Columbia, in cases coming within it.\nI am, however, unable to agree with him that such section can be invoked in the circumstances of this case.\nThe duty for breach of which the defendants here have been held liable was a duty arising out of their contract to supply electric light to the house of the plaintiff's mother. That contract, which does not appear to have been in writing, was not a personal one to supply light to and for the use of the occupier alone, but to my mind obviously from its very nature, object and purpose extended as well to those of her household. The 44th section of their charter provided expressly that defendants should \"supply electricity to any premises lying within fifty yards of any main supply or cable suitable for that purpose on being required by the owner or occupier of such premises.\" It was clearly within the contemplation of all parties that the electricity supplied should be for the premises of the occupier and therefore necessarily for the use of the occupants of the house. I hold that the duties and obligations arising out of such a contract extend to all those for whose use and benefit it was clearly entered into, and are not limited to the person contracted with alone. Such duties and obligations towards the members and servants of the household are the same as and of equal degree with those towards the householder himself with whom the contract was made. In each case it is an implied duty or obligation arising out of the contract, and being so not affected by the section referred to. I understand my learned brother's opinion to be that the section could not be invoked by the company against the mother with whom they made the contract, because in her case, as he puts it, such an action would be based upon a violation of a contractual right. I agree to that, but it is not a violation of any express right, but of an implied duty arising out of the contract, and is in my opinion available as well to those for whose benefit the contract was undeniably made as to the person entering into it. I assume therefore that the only difference between us is as to the proper interpretation and meaning of the contract for supplying electricity.\nThe contract being for the supply of electricity to the house of plaintiff's mother, and as I think it must be read for the use of herself and family and servants, was subject to such stipulations and conditions as the parties to it might expressly agree upon. These might well be the measure of the defendant's duty arising out of it as well to the person with whom they contracted as to others for whose benefit the contract was entered into. If the company faithfully carried out their contract and injury nevertheless ensued they might be absolved from all liability on the plain ground that they owed no duty to any person of which they were guilty of a breach. But it does seem to me that the measure of the duty they owed to the person with whom they undeniably contracted was the same as that which they owed to all those for whose benefit the contract was obviously made. In all such cases the duty is an implied one, and arises as necessarily in the case of those for whose use the electric fluid is to be supplied as in that of the actual party to the contract. This it is which distinguishes the case of those persons for whose benefit and use the contract is made from the general public. In the present case, as I hold, a clear duty arises out of the contract to this special class of persons for a breach of which when injured any member of it has a right to sue, and which duty and right arising out of the special contract is not within the limiting provision of section 60, invoked by the company here as an answer to this action. The electricity supplied to and for the house of the plaintiff's mother in this case was necessarily, to the knowledge of the company supplying it, for the use of all persons lawfully in the house, whether as members of the family or servants of the owner or occupier.\nThe duty arising out of the company's contract to supply the house with electricity, involved on the part of the company the exercise of the highest skill, care and attention with respect to their wires and the transmission through them into the house of such a dangerous element or power as electricity. To construe the clause limiting the liability of the company to damages for negligence in the discharge of such duty as not applicable to cases where the person immediately contracting has been injured, but as ap- plicable to others for whose benefit the contract must have been entered into, and who I hold were within the contemplation of the parties to the contract, would be to attribute an intention to the legislature which the language of the section does not, as I interpret it, express. I rest my judgment upon the broad ground that the section in question does not extend to any breach of the duty arising out of the contractual obligation on the defendant's part to supply the house of the plaintiff's mother with electricity, and that such duty and obligation arises in the circumstances of this case out of the contract as well towards the son of the owner or occupier living in the premises with his mother as towards the mother herself, and that such being the case and the section not being invocable by the company against the boy's mother in a case of damage to her own person cannot be invoked against the son.\nThe negligence which caused the plaintiff's injuries in this case was not active and positive negligence amounting to misfeasance, but was non-feasance on the part of the company's servants in neglecting to keep their wires leading into the premises of the plaintiff's mother properly insulated. To maintain his action, therefore, plaintiff must have shewn the existence of a contract entered into for his benefit as well as others, and for a breach of the defendant's duty arising under which he had a right of action. Such a contract I have already attempted to shew was proved.\nAs to authorities I have carefully studied the cases cited on the argument and others. Many of them are reviewed by Osler J.A. in Ryckman v. Hamil- ton, Grimsby and Beamsville Electric Railway Co.[2], and more recently by Riddell J. in Allen v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co[3]. The cases of Taylor v. Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway[4], where Alton v. Midland Railway Co.[5], is discussed and commented on, Marshall v. York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway Co[6], and Austin v. Great Western Railway[7], though cases against carriers, are instructive upon the general question involved here.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised on this appeal is whether or not the respondent's action must be held barred by the following section which appears in an Act to amend an Act to incorporate the Consolidated Railway and Light Company, and to consolidate certain Acts relating thereto, and to change the name thereof to the Consolidated Railway Company, and which reads as follows:\u2014\nAll actions or suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway, or the works or operations of the company, shall be commenced within six months next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained.\nBy section 29 of the said Act the Consolidated Railway Company, amalgamating a number of other railway companies was given the right to mortgage\nall tolls, incomes, franchises, uncalled capital and property both real and personal,\nand subject to certain conditions named,\nto take possession of the said property so mortgaged, and to hold and run the same for the benefit of the bondholders thereof; or to lease or sell the said property so mortgaged after such default, and upon such terms and conditions as may be stated in such deed; and in case of any such lease or sale, the lessee or purchaser shall have the right to exercise all the powers and franchises by this Act conferred upon the company, and the said property may continue to be held and operated under the provisions of this Act, with the corporate name and powers of the company; and such lessee or purchaser shall have the same rights, powers, privileges and franchises, and shall stand in the same position, as regards the said tolls, incomes, franchises, powers, uncalled capital and property, real and personal, as the company itself under this Act.\nThe Consolidated Railway Company under the powers given in said section ultimately sold to the appellant in exercise of the powers in said section 29, but did not\noperate under the provisions of said Act with the corporate name and powers of the company.\nThe appellants kept their own corporate name and acted under their own powers, and those given a buyer under said statute.\nThe accident to the respondent was a result of negligence on the part of the appellants in carrying on the electric lighting part of the business.\nAnother statute known as the \"British Columbia Railway Act,\" by section 8, provided as follows:\u2014\nEvery company established under a special Act shall be a body corporate under the name declared in the special Act, and shall be invested with all such powers, privileges, and immunities as are necessary to carry into effect the intentions and objects of this Act and of the special Act therefor, and are incident to such corporation or are expressed or included in the \"Interpretation Act,\" 1890, ch. 39, sec. S.\nThat section and section 42 of the same Act, with other sections thereof, were incorporated by the Act above referred to therein. That section 42, so far as it bears on the case before use, reads as follows:\u2014\nAll actions for indemnity for damage or injury sustained by reason of the railway shall be instituted within one year next after the time of the supposed damage sustained, or if there be continuance of damage, then within one year next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases and not afterwards; and the defendants may plead not guilty by statute, and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act and the special Act.\nI consider both sections, 60 of the first mentioned Act, and section 42 of the \"British Columbia Railway Act,\" may have operative effect given to them without at all helping the appellant's contention. As to the effect of sections 29 and 60 of the first above mentioned Act, if I understand that contention aright, it is that inasmuch as a lessee or purchaser under section 29 is given\nthe same rights, powers, privileges and franchises, and shall stand in the same position as regards the said tolls, incomes, franchises, powers, uncalled capital, and property real and personal, as the company itself under this Act,\nthe protection given by section 60 limiting actions against the consolidated, or selling company, is carried by the words just quoted to the protection of the appellant, that is the purchasing company in actions against it.\nWe must interpret these words just quoted without the aid of direct authority as no case can be found directly in point.\nProbably no one ever before tried to strain so far a kind of legislation usually given a restricted interpretation.\nIt is not seriously contended that the words \"powers and franchises\" are to be looked for to maintain appellant's contention. The words \"rights and privileges\" were in themselves, or each in itself, and especially coupled with these other words, relied upon.\nCan the word \"rights\" in this connection, cover- ing much that is obviously in relation to property or right thereto or therein or something transferable from the Consolidated Railway Company to the British Columbia Electric Company, as result of purchase, be extended to something implied as subject matter liable to be so operated upon by the enactment as to constitute the vesting in the latter of anything in the nature of a right to set up the statute of limitations which appears in section 60?\nI have tried unsuccessfully to find any case wherein the word \"right\" has been held as meaning any such legislative substitution as we must hold it to mean if by virtue of it we give effect to appellant's contention.\nOne or two cases illustrate its legislative meaning and the disinclination of the courts to extend same beyond the context in which it is found. In re Earl of Devon's Settled Estates[8], was a case arising under the \"Real Property Limitations Act, 1833,\" when it was contended that the word \"right\" as used therein covered a power of appointment to uses. Chitty J. said as to such contention:\u2014\nNo real property lawyer in 1833 would have spoken of a power of appointing uses as an \"estate, interest, right or possibility.\" The terms \"right\" and \"possibility\" are used in their technical sense. \"Right,\" for instance, applies to the case of an estate turned to a right which could be enforced only in a real action. I hold that a power is not within the section.\nThen we have numerous analogous cases cited in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, vol. 3, pages 1738 et seq..\nIn the case of Kearns v. The Cordwainers' Co.[9], it was held competent for the Thames Conservancy, 1857, to invade the common right which any of the public had theretofore exercised, notwithstanding the words of the reservation that none of the powers in the Act contained,\nshall extend to take away, alter or abridge any right, claim, privilege, franchise, exemption or immunity to which any owners or occupiers of any lands, etc., are now by law entitled; nor to take away or abridge any local right of ferry, etc. The same shall remain and continue in full force,\nand also that these words must be held to have been intended to cover something vested, and not that falling within a general public right.\nPerhaps the nearest application of the word \"right\" to what is in question is that maintained in the case of Ex parte Raison[10], where it was held that a bankrupt's right to apply for his discharge under the provisions of section 28 of the \"Bankruptcy Act\" of 1833, notwithstanding its repeal, was preserved to him by section 38 of the \"Interpretation Act\" of 1889. It was held that section 38, declaring that the repeal of an Act is not to affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability, acquired, accrued or incurred in that section, preserved the right.\nThat was the reservation to the individual of a personal right and illustrates both what I have referred and what I am about to refer to.\nNor do I think the word \"privileges\" any more effective. It may mean benefits affecting a class of persons or a right conferred on a definite person. In neither sense does it serve herein the appellant which is not one of a class in this relation, nor is it the specific person named.\nThe right to plead a statute of limitations is a privilege, but only as Wood on Limitations, ch. 4, section 31, puts it, and that defence it gives, as follows:\nThe plea of the Statute of Limitations is generally a personal privilege, and may be waived by a defendant, or asserted, at his election; but where he has parted with his interest in property, his grantees, mortgagees, or other persons standing in his place are entitled to avail themselves of all the advantages of his plea.\nI think it would be futile to suggest that the grantees or mortgagees of the property in question herein fall within the meaning of this paragraph except in a limited sense.\nAnd that limited sense so far as relative to the quality of transferability is confined to its effect as an incident of the property or right transferred. It passes only therewith and not otherwise.\nIf, for example, there happened to be any right of property or contractual right possessed by the vendors or mortgagors herein at the time when they transferred, mortgaged or sold the property, I think it would be quite within the right of the appellant in such case as the mortgagee or vendee to plead, just as the vendor might have pleaded, the Statute of Limitations involved in that relation.\nBut is this case in hand the raising of an issue at all like unto that? What is the Statute of Limitations in this section 60 relative to? Is it not against something done or omitted to have been done by the company individually enabled to set up the defence provided for in section 60.\nIt is not the case that arises under the \"General Railway Act\" in relation to a class.\nIts individual character would probably be effective to protect in the appellants' hands the assets transferred as against actions for something done or omitted by the consolidated company. The section does not in terms provide that its assignee may have any such right in regard to some act or omission that the assignee may have been or become guilty of.\nThe express provision in question, it is to be observed, appears, by accident probably, in the same Act in which is incorporated as shewn above the general law of the province in regard to the subject of railways.\nWhy attribute to the legislation an intention to extend such an absurdity?\nIt is only by a process of ratiocination resting on inferences and implications that such a result as appellant desires can be arrived at.\nHaving regard to these and other foregoing considerations and to the well\u2014known rule that anything in the way of legislation abridging the public rights or the rights of any of the public in favour of one acquiring a concession from Parliament or other legislative body must be construed strictly, and that the right must not be extended by implication, can we say that that process I refer to as relied on herein is satisfactory?\nI prefer to say with Lord Cottenham in Webb v. Manchester and Leeds Railway Co.[11]:\nIf there be any reasonable doubt as to the extent of the powers (given in the private Act) they must go elsewhere and get enlarged powers but they will get none from me by way of construction of their Act of Parliament.\nMoreover the section in its very wording is expressly as against anything sustained \"by reason of the tramway or railway\" and the words following \"or the works or operations of the company\" may well be confined to the same subject matter of the railway.\nIf the rule just now referred to regarding the restrictions of concessions is adhered to it may well be argued the privilege is not definitely extended to the lighting department of the company, and all which that implies. That leads to the same result and even if that is waived for argument sake, it is not shewn this particular part of that work existed at the time of the transfer and hence could not have been transferred with such a right.\nIt may be said in reply it is not the work that is transferred, but the right itself.\nTake it that way then the selling company was left without any Statute of Limitations to protect not only its interest in regard to accident cases, but also manifold interests of any and every kind for no distinction is made.\nIs it conceivable such ever was the the intention of anybody? It may be said that is not what is meant by transfer of such a right, but the enjoyment of the like right in common with the selling company.\nTried that way the obvious reply is that this language is not that which any one would use to confer such a common right.\nNay, more, we find the language and purpose of section 29 is relative to property and rights of property to be enjoyed and even if need be the entire corporate powers may be enjoyed by the vendees; yet we find the vendee itself shrank, for some reason or other, from going so far in the acquisition and exercise of rights of the vendor.\nIn short, it refrained from accepting that alone which would have given semblance to a right to claim what it now seeks. I have looked at many cases dealing with the application of Statutes of Limitations, and they uniformly treat, as already said, such statutes in a strict sense restricting them to operations within the literal limits expressed in each case.\nHaving regard to the foregoing I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondent (a minor) against the appellants, in the County Court of Victoria, B.C., claiming indemnity for injuries suffered by him in consequence of an electric shock received through a wire connecting the lights in his mother's house with the mains of the appellants' lighting system in Victoria.\nAt the trial it was shewn by the appellants that the wire through which these lamps were supplied was under normal conditions charged with a harmless (secondary) current of electricity at low pressure (110 volts), but that it was carried by cross\u2014bars upon which was also carried a wire owned by the municipality of Victoria, conveying a (primary) current of high pressure (2,000 volts) supplying an arc lamp for lighting a street in the vicinity.\nThe accident was explained by the appellants on the theory that the swaying of a tree near these wires had brought about a contact between them, thereby causing the current of high pressure to be transferred to the wire connected directly with that through which respondent was injured; and the jury found that the injury was attributable to the negligence of the defendants in maintaining their wires in a situation too close to the trees and in stringing their wires too close to that of the municipality. The questions arising upon the appeal are two: First, whether the appellants are entitled to claim the protection of section 60 of the \"Consolidated Railway Companies Act of 1896,\" upon which they rely; and secondly, assuming them to be so, whether that section has any application in the circumstances of this case.\nIt will be more convenient (since I have come to the conclusion that the appellants are entitled to invoke that enactment) to discuss the second of these questions first. The words of the section are as follows:\u2014\nAll actions or suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway, or the works or operations of the company, shall be commenced within six months next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, or if there is continuance of damage, within six months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards, and the defendant may plead the general issue, and give this Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act.\nIf we leave out the words \"or the works or operations of the company\" the section is the same as that found in the \"Railway Act\" of Canada before the amendment of 1903, except that the period of one year prescribed by the latter Act is by this section reduced to six months. Before the Act which we have now to construe came into force this provision of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" and the corresponding provisions of the provincial railway Acts had been the subject of much judicial discussion. The various opinions and perhaps even the various decisions are not quite harmonious; but there had been, I think (subject to one observation), a substantial concurrence of decision and almost a concurrence of opinion upon two points: First, that the limitation pre- scribed by the section was not available where the action was or might have been founded upon a violation of some contractual right; and, secondly, that in any case it only applied where the cause of action was something done or omitted to be done by the company in the exercise or the professed exercise of what, for want perhaps of a better phrase, have been called its \"statutory powers.\" In \"statutory powers\" one does not, of course, mean to include all the corporate capacities of a company constituted by statute; but only the various powers (conferred by the legislature) to do something which, if done without statutory authority, would (either by reason of the doing of the thing itself, or by reason of some harm arising out of it) expose the person doing it to proceedings for legal redress at the suit of an individual or ad vindicatam publicam at the instance of the proper authorities. The reported judgments, however, suggest the observation that there has been some doubt whether the application of the section is restricted in either of these two respects where the thing done or omitted which gives rise to the action is done or omitted in carrying on some business which the statute not only empowers, but requires the company to carry on. By a still narrower construction of the words \"by reason of the railway,\" Mr. Justice Gwynne, in the North Shore Railway Co. v. McWillie[12], appears to confine the operation of the section to those cases in which the cause of action arises out of some act done or omitted in the exercise, or professed exercise, of the company's powers in respect either of the construction or the maintenance of its line. For the purpose of deciding the immediate point under consideration it is immaterial I think which of these views be accepted. The words of the section before us are\nby reason of the tramway or railway or the works or operations of the company;\nand if we give to these words the narrowest of all the constructions suggested it is difficult to see on what ground it can be held that they are not applicable to the circumstances of this case. The negligence from which the respondents suffered consisted in the company permitting the wire conveying the electric supply for incandescent lamps to be so situated that it was liable to be brought into contact with a wire charged with electricity at a dangerously high pressure. That was negligence either in the construction of its works or in the maintenance of its works. Upon their plain reading the words\ndamages or injury by reason of the * * * works * * * of the company\nobviously embrace any harm arising from such negligence, and it is sufficiently apparent, if I have justly appreciated the effect of the judicial pronouncements touching the construction of the corresponding clause in the railways Acts, that there is nothing in the opinions so expressed to require or justify the exclusion of this case from the operation of the section, unless indeed the circumstances bring it within the principle of those cases in which the section has been held not to be applicable because of the action being based upon a violation of a contractual right.\nI do not think this case can be brought within that principle.\nIt is impossible to hold that in contracting with the mother to supply light for her dwelling house, they contracted with her as agent for the various members of her family and thereby became liable to be sued by each of them for any failure in the execution of the contract. The duty which they owed the respondent was precisely that which they owed generally to persons coming in contact with appliances connected with their system, viz.: so to construct, maintain and work their system that as far as reasonable (which means in this case the highest practicable) care and skill could avoid it such persons should not be exposed to unnecessary danger of injury by electricity, whether generated by them or transmitted to their wires from the mains of the municipality which they were supporting on their poles.\nIn respect of his rights against the appellants in this action, the respondent stands in the same situation as that of any other person suffering from a breach of the same general duty; and without taking undue liberties with the words of the section they cannot be so narrowed as to exclude all such persons from its operation.\nTo come then to the question whether the defendants are entitled to invoke this section. The answer to that question depends chiefly upon the construction of section 29 of the Act, which is in the following words:\u2014\nThe directors of the company may from time to time raise and borrow, for the purposes of the company, such sum or sums of money, upon such terms and in such manner, as they may consider expedient, and may issue bonds or debentures of the company, in sums of not less than fifty dollars, or ten pounds sterling, each, and on such terms and credit and at such prices as they may think proper, and may pledge or mortgage all the tolls, incomes, franchises, uncalled capital and property, both real and personal (whether then acquired or that may hereafter be acquired), of the company, or any part thereof for the repayment of the moneys so raised or borrowed, and the interest thereon; and any such mortgage deed may contain such description of the property, tolls, incomes, franchises, uncalled capital and property, real and personal (acquired or to be acquired), mortgaged by such deed and upon such conditions respecting the payment of the bonds or debentures secured thereby and of the interest thereon, and the remedies which shall be enjoyed by the holder of such bonds, or by any trustee or trustees for them, in default of such payment, and the enforcement of such remedies; and may provide for such forfeitures and penalties in default of such payment as may be approved by the directors; and may also contain, with the approval aforesaid, authority to the trustee or trustees upon such default as one of such remedies, to take possession of the said property so mortgaged, and to hold and run the same for the benefit of the bondholders thereof; or to lease or sell the said property so mortgaged after such default, and upon such terms and conditions as may be stated in such deed; and in case of any such lease or sale, the lessee or purchaser shall have the right to exercise all the powers and franchises by this Act conferred upon the company, and the said property may continue to be held and operated under the provisions of this Act, with the corporate name and powers of the company; and such lessee or purchaser shall have the same rights, powers, privileges, and franchises, and shall stand in the same position, as regards the said tolls, incomes, franchises, powers, uncalled capital, and property real and personal, as the company itself under this Act.\nThe majority of the full court have held that the effect of the sentence\nand the said property may continue to be held and operated under the provisions of this Act with the corporate name and powers of the company,\nis to limit the application of section 60 to the case of actions against the Consolidated Railway Company itself or against a purchaser or lessee operating \"with the name of\" that company. It is not disputed, and it was assumed, I think, by all the members of the court below, that the rights conferred by the succeeding sentences of the section do not rest upon any such condition. In this view, it may or may not be that to take advantage of the authority here given to \"hold and operate\" the property\nunder the provisions of the Act with the corporate name and powers of the company, (whatever may be the precise meaning of those words) it is necessary that the purchaser should assume the name of the Consolidated Railway Company either alone or in conjunction with the \"corporate powers\" of the company; but whatever may be said upon that point, the purchaser might elect to act or not to act under this authority, and if he should elect not to take advantage of it, he would not be thereby deprived of the benefit of any of the rights which, as purchaser, he would, under other parts of the section, be entitled to exercise. In a word, in this view, the assumption of the corporate name if it be a condition at all, is a condition affecting only the exercise of the authority (whatever that may be) conferred by these particular words.\nI think the weight of argument favours this view. The words quoted seem to be inserted parenthetically, and having regard to the circumstance that when the power of sale should come to be exercised the mortgagor company would most probably be in financial difficulties, it is highly unlikely that the legislature would encumber the transfer with a condition requiring that the purchasers should carry on the undertaking in that company's name. Such a condition would most certainly embarrass the company in raising money on the security of its debentures to an extent which might well prove almost prohibitive.\nDoes section 29 then (apart from these words) invest the purchasers with the authority to invoke the benefit of section 60? The object of that section (29) is to enable the company to raise money by debentures charged upon\nthe tolls, incomes, franchises, uncalled capital, and property both real and personal of the company or any part thereof. To carry out that object the company is authorized to mortgage to trustees for the debenture-olders such part of its property and franchises as it may see fit. The section goes on to provide that authority may be given to the trustees upon default to take possession of the property mortgaged and \"run it\" for the benefit of the debenture-olders and to lease and sell it; and then the section enacts that\nin case of any such lease or sale the lessee or purchaser shall have the right to exercise all the powers and franchises by this Act conferred upon the company,\n(here follow the words quoted above which I now omit);\nand such lessee or purchaser shall have the same rights, powers, privileges and franchises and shall stand in the same position as regards the said tolls, incomes, franchises, powers and uncalled capital and property, real and personal, as the company itself under this Act.\nThe legislature seems to have had in contemplation here two kinds of transactions, one in which some integral part of the company's undertaking should be mortgaged to secure the repayment of the moneys borrowed; the other, in which the whole of the company's undertaking should be the security. It is obvious that in its application to the first case some restriction must be put upon the generality of the concluding provision which I have just quoted; the \"rights, powers, privileges and franchises\" dealt with in the last sentence would in that case be such \"rights, powers, privileges and franchises\" only as should be comprised within or be necessary or incidental to that part of the undertaking charged. In the second case, the language leaves no room for doubt that the undertaking of the company was to be dealt with, to use Lord Wat- son's phrase in Redfield v. Wickham[13] \"as an integer\" and that every power, privilege and franchise forming a part of the undertaking or necessary or incidental to the working of it conferred or confirmed by the Act or acquired under the authority of the Act should be exercisable by the purchaser to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as by the company itself. It is not disputed that in this case the whole of the property and franchises transferable under this section (so read) were acquired by the appellants.\nWith great respect, I am unable to agree with the contention that the right conferred upon the company by section 60 is not strictly a privilege. A reference to Austin, Jurisprudence, p. 519, and 8 Bacon's Abridgment (verbo \"Privilege\") shews that such a qualified immunity is not only so described with accuracy, but in accordance with the ordinary use of the word by English lawyers.\nThe only question, therefore, is whether there is anything in the context or in the purpose of the legislature as disclosed by the statute which requires us to give it a more restricted meaning. It is argued that it ought to be read in such a way as to bring it into harmony with the other terms in connection with which it is used and that in that view (I think I am putting the point fairly) it must be held to imply a privilege of a positive kind as distinguished from a mere immunity; that indeed, associated as it is with rights assigned as security for the payment of the company's debts and vesting in the purchaser directly as the result of the transfer to him, it connotes the idea of property. It is said, and quite truly, that the right granted by section 60 has nothing in it of this nature; and moreover that it is a right, so to speak, of a purely personal character, akin to the general power of the corporation to sue and be sued, and not one which is in any way incidental to the enjoyment of the company's property or to the working of its undertaking. I do not think after careful consideration that the word \"privilege\" as it occurs in the collocation \"rights, powers, privileges and franchises\" can properly be so limited. What the legislature seems to be providing for is the vesting in the purchaser not only of those things which are comprised within the enumerated \"tolls, incomes, franchises, uncalled capital, and property both real and personal,\" which pass to him by the direct operation of a transfer from the trustees, but all those rights and privileges which are conferred by the Act upon the company as necessary or incidental to the full exercise and enjoyment of what is transferred.\nI think the right conferred by section 60 is within this class of privileges. In my view that section is at least limited in its operation to causes of action arising out of something done or omitted in the course of the exercise by the company of its \"statutory powers\" (in the sense already explained) whether in its construction, maintenance or operation of its undertaking; whether a still narrower construction is the true one, it will be unnecessary to consider. It is observable that the statutory authority under which these powers are exercised merely has the effect of making lawful acts which, if done without such authority, would or might expose it to legal proceedings, and that this protection, speaking generally, is available only when those powers are exercised rea- sonably. Section 60 goes a step further. It provides that where in the exercise or the professed exercise of these powers something is done or omitted in such a way (in such circumstances of negligence or otherwise) that the statute does not afford an absolute exemption from liability\u2014in such a case, any action must be brought within the prescribed period. The provision thus seems to be rather an extension in a qualified sense of the protection just mentioned; and to be conferred upon the company not simply as a corporate entity bearing a particular name, but as a company incorporated by the legislature for the purpose of carrying on certain specified undertakings which it must be assumed the legislature has supposed to be of public importance.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and of the appeal to the full court and the judgment of the County Court judge restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I agree in the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Duff and Mr. Justice Davies, that the appellants are entitled to the benefit of section 60 of the \"Consolidated Railway Companies Act, 1896,\" to the same extent as was the Consolidated Railway Company itself.\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff, I am also of the opinion that in order to obtain the benefit of that section, the defendants are not required to carry on their operations in the name of \"The Consolidated Railway Company.\"\nI am unable, howeyer, to accept Mr. Justice Davies' view that the plaintiff's action is so founded upon contract that section 60 affords no defence to it. Had the plaintiff's mother, with whom the defendants con- tracted, been injured in circumstances similar to those attending the injury to the plaintiff, her action would have been in tort rather than in contract and section 60 would probably have been applicable even in her case. Lyles v. Southend-on-Sea Corporation[14]. I fail to understand how the present plaintiff can found a claim upon breach of a contract to which he was not a party.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], in favour of the respondent on a stated case.\nThe case stated and agreed upon for submission to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick was in the following terms:\n\"1. George H. Lovitt, late of Yarmouth; in the Province of Nova Scotia, ship-owner, departed this life at Yarmouth on the fourteenth day of November, A.D. 1900, having made his last will and testament, a copy of which is hereto annexed, whereby he appointed the defendants Irvine A. Lovitt, John Lovitt and Erastus H. Lovitt, the executors and trustees of his estate.\n\"2. That the said George H. Lovitt was, immediately before his death, a resident of Yarmouth aforesaid and was domiciled in the Province of Nova Scotia.\n\"3. Probate of the said will was duly granted by the judge of the Court of Probate, in and for the County of Yarmouth on the 19th day of November, A.D. 1900.\n\"4. That the following are the several persons to whom the estate of the said George H. Lovitt will pass under his last will and testament, and the degree of relationship in which they stand to the testator.\n\"Margaret Jane Lovitt, widow of testator; Frank Lovitt, Irvine Ashby Lovitt, Erastus Hurd Lovitt, sons of testator; and Jane J. Burrill, daughter of testator, all of Yarmouth, in the Province of Nova Scotia; and Abbie Thomas and Blanche Thomas, of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, no relation to testator, and \"The Old Ladies' Home\" of Yarmouth, in the Province of Nova Scotia.\n\"5. That the said George H. Lovitt died seized and\npossessed of real and personal property of the value of $557,982.88.\n\"6. That a portion of the estate of the said George H. Lovitt consisted of the sum of $ 90,351.75, which in his lifetime he had placed on special deposit in the Bank of British North America in the City of St. John, taking from the said bank two deposit receipts in the following form:\n\"No. 2111. Deposit Receipt.\n\"Incorporated. Royal Charter.\nBank of British North America.\nSt. John, N.B., 30th December, 1898.\n\"Received from George H.

That at the time of the death of the said George H. Lovitt, the said deposit receipt was in his possession at Yarmouth aforesaid, in the Province of Nova Scotia aforesaid.\n\"9. That a portion of the real property of the said George H. Lovitt consists of a lot of land and premises at Carleton, in the Province of New Brunswick. The said lot of land was appraised at the sum of $2,000, and was devised specifically to Frank Lovitt, the son of testator.\n\"10. That the manager of the said bank at St. John aforesaid, refused to pay to the said executors the said amount, unless and until they took out ancillary probate as hereinafter mentioned, whereupon the defendants took out ancillary probate of the said last will and testament of George H. Lovitt in New Brunswick. Said ancillary probate was granted to the said defendants by the judge of probate for the City and County of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, where- upon the said executors were paid by the said manager of the Bank of British North America at St. John, the amount of the aforesaid deposit receipts.\n\"The plaintiff claims and the defendants deny that the defendants should pay succession duty in respect to the said sum of $90,351.75, so deposited in the branch of the Bank of British North America at Saint John aforesaid.\n\"The question for the decision of the court is, whether the said defendants or said estate, or the devisees, or any and which of them, are liable to pay succession duty in respect to the said sum of $90,351.75, the amount of the said deposit receipts issued by the said Bank of British North America, and if so, what amount to the Province of New Brunswick, and in determining the question the court may refer to and construe the statutes of Nova Scotia the same as if they had been proved before the court.\n\"If the judgment of the court upon the question raised herein is that the same be answered in the affirmative, judgment of the court may be entered for the plaintiff for the amount found by the court to be due, without costs, and if the said questions be answered in the negative, judgment may be entered for the defendants without costs.\n\"Dated this 16th day of February, A.D. 1905.\n\"(Signed) J. W. Longley,\nAttorney- General,\nNova Scotia.\nWilliam Pugsley,\nAttorney-General,\nNew Brunswick.\" The above specifies all the provisions of the will annexed thereto as stated in the first paragraph which are material to the present appeal.\nThe executors appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, holding the estate liable for succession duties on the sum deposited in the Bank of British North America.\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellants. A bank and its branches are one concern: Bain v. Torrance [2]; and this debt was payable by the Bank of British North America, not by its branch in St. John, which is not an entity.\nThe imposition of this duty would be indirect taxation; Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[3]; Attorney-General of Quebec v. Queen Ins. Co.[4]; Attorney-General of Quebec v. Reed[5]; Brewers and Maltsters Assoc. v. Attorney-General of Ontario[6].\nIn case of a devise or legacy to be acquired in the future the imposition of the duty must be postponed. Attorney-General of Ontario v. Toronto General Trusts Corp.[7], and this proceeding is, therefore, premature.\nAnd it cannot be imposed on the residuary estate without express provision therefor in the will. In re Botsford[8].\nHazen K.C., Attorney-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent. For purposes such as those in question here the branch of a bank is distinct entity. Woodland v. Fear[9]; County of Wentworth v. Smith[10]; Prince v. Oriental Bank Corp.[11].\nSuccession duty is based upon administration: Attorney-General of Ontario v. Newman[12] and the appellants in taking out probate of the will in New Brunswick alleged that this money was \"property within the province,\" and are now estopped from denying it.\nIf it is \"property within the province\" the fact that the testator had his domicile in Nova Scotia does not prevent the duty from attaching. Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[13].\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellants.\nHazen K.C., Attorney-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are fully stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nThat portion of the testator's movable wealth upon which the respondent seeks to levy succession duty was not property which passed either by will or intestacy within the Province of New Brunswick. The debts evidenced by the two deposit receipts were due by the Bank of British North America, an English corporation having its head office at London, England, and the situs of these debts was at the domicile of the testator in Nova Scotia. The amount of the bank's indebtedness passed by Lovitt's will to his executors in the province where the will was admitted to probate and the succession devolved. Subsequently, however, to the devolution of the succession in Nova Scotia and in the course of the liquidation of the assets of the estate, the bank at the request of the executors paid the amount of its liability to them in the Province of New Brunswick after they had obtained ancillary letters of probate. Such payment by the bank cannot be said to be a devise or a transfer of property to a person or persons residing within the province within the meaning of the New Brunswick statute. I am of opinion that the amount of the bank's indebtedness to Lovitt was, in the terms of the proviso to the fifth section of the \"Succession Duties Act of New Brunswick,\" property outside of the Province of New Brunswick owned at the time of his death by a person not then domiciled within that province, and that the New Brunswick Act cannot constitutionally have effect to impose a tax upon persons domiciled and resident in Nova Scotia in respect of a succession coming to them under the laws of Nova Scotia.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014I am inclined to apply to this case the principle of international law recognized in nearly all the systems of law of the different civilized nations and laid down in article 6 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, viz., that moveable or personal property is governed by the law of the domicile of the owner, and if I understand correctly the recent decision of the House of Lords in Winans v. The Attorney-General[14] the law is the same in England. The laws of New Brunswick have not imposed a succession duty upon the specific property claimed by the estate Lovitt, and consequently being personal it is governed by the law of the domicile of the late Mr. Lovitt, which was in Yarmouth, N.S., and not by the laws of New Brunswick. Being a mere contract debt, it cannot be contended that it is situated in New Brunswick; but even if it was it cannot be denied that it was personal property. I have therefore no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The question we have to decide in this appeal is whether or not a simple contract debt due by the Bank of British North America to the testator, Lovitt, at the time of his death, was subject and liable in the hands of the executors of the estate to the succession duties imposed and made payable by the statute of the Province of New Brunswick (R.S. vol. 1, ch. 17, sec. 5).\nThere is no dispute about the facts which are submitted to us in the form of a stated case.\nStated briefly, and so far as they are necessary for the conclusion I have reached, these facts are that the testator Lovitt was domiciled in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and died there, having first made his will and appointed the appellants his executors. That some time before his death testator deposited with the Bank of British North America at its branch in St. John, N.B., the sum of $90,351.75, which monies remained with the bank until withdrawn by the executors. That when making the deposit testator received a receipt for the same which specified that \"the amount would be accounted for by the Bank of British North America on surrender of this receipt\"; that it would bear interest at 3%; that fifteen days' notice was to be given of its withdrawal, and that no interest would be paid unless the money remained in the bank for three months.\nThe executors took out probate of the will in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, on the testator's death, and afterwards demanded payment of the debt and interest from the bank at its St. John agency, but the manager there required the executors to take out ancillary letters of probate in New Brunswick before paying them the money, which letters were taken out.\nThe deposit receipt, the evidence of the debt owing by the bank to Lovitt was with him at his domicile, Yarmouth, when he died.\nThe then Chief Justice, Tuck, with whom Landry J. concurred, reached the conclusion, as he says, \"with much doubt,\" that the debt was liable to pay succession duty in New Brunswick relying upon the authority of Attorney-General v. Newman[15].\nBarker J., now Chief Justice, with whom the other members of the court concurred, reached the same conclusion, resting his judgment upon the construction of the New Brunswick statute respecting succession duties, which he held was substantially the same as that upon which Attorney-General v. Newman15 was decided, and upon the statement of Lord Hobhouse in the case of Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[16], who, speaking for the Judicial Committee at page 775, says, that if the amendment to the \"Queensland Succession Duty Act\" declaring\nthat upon the issue of any grant of probate or administration in Queensland succession duty is chargeable in respect of all property within Queensland, although the testator may not have had his domicile in Queensland,\nwas retrospective and applicable to the case before the Committee, it would be conclusive in favour of the liability of the property there in question to pay the tax. It may be possible that this Ontario case of Newman's on which the learned judge in the court below so much relied can be distinguished at least in part from this appeal, and I think it very clear that Lord Hobhouse's dictum does not support the judgment here appealed against. The decision in Newman's Case[17] appears, from the official report of the decision in the appeal court, to have been based upon the propositions that succession duty is payable upon any property in Ontario which can properly be administered only there, and that as the payment of the debts there in question could only be enforced in Ontario and only properly administered there, that settled the question.\nThe opinions of the learned judges who decided that ease in the appeal court of Ontario leave no doubt as to those propositions being the reasons for their judgment, and the decision is not authority for anything beyond that. But if, as I gather from the appeal case, the facts were that some of the deposit receipts in that case were in the same words substantially as those in this appeal, and were given by branches of banks having their head offices outside of Ontario, then, construing those receipts as I do, I would feel myself obliged to dissent from that case so far as it related to those receipts. That decision is, of course, not binding on us, but I desire not to be understood as expressing any opinion upon it beyond what is necessary for the decision of this appeal.\nThe debt in this appeal was a simple contract debt payable by the bank, a British corporation, with its head office in London, to Lovitt, a person domiciled in Nova Scotia. In my opinion payment of the amount could be enforced against the bank by Lovitt, or his executors after his death, either in London, Eng., where the head office was, or in Montreal, where, so far as Canada was concerned, our \"Bank Act\" declared it to be, or in Nova Scotia, where the creditor was domiciled at his death, and where probate of his will was taken out. Whether .the money could be recovered without first giving fifteen days' notice or whether failure to give this notice operated simply to put an end to interest for that time is not necessary to decide and does not in my opinion affect this case.\nBy no reasonable construction of the deposit receipt can the liability of the bank to pay be limited to St. John only. The St. John agency might be closed at any time. It was the Bank of British North America, the corporate body, not the St. John agency, which had no corporate existence or entity that accepted the deposit, created the debt by so doing and became liable for the amount. The bank declared in the receipt given by its agent that the \"amount would be accounted for by the Bank of British North America,\" not by the agency in St. John of the bank, nor by the bank at that agency. No words of any kind are in this receipt evidencing a contract only to pay in St. John or in New Brunswick, nor is there any statement in the case respecting any bank usage or custom which could justify any such finding or conclusion; on the contrary, the liability of the bank is expressed in the broadest terms and without any limiting words beyond possibly those requiring fifteen days' notice to be given of its withdrawal. That notice could surely be given, and properly given, at the head office of the bank either in London or Montreal, and when so given the bank was liable to be sued for payment as well in Great Britain or in Nova Scotia, where the creditor resided, as in New Brunswick.\nIf that statement of the law and construction of the contract is correct the case of Newman on my understanding of its facts has no application.\nThen with respect to the dictum of Lord Hobhouse when speaking for the Judicial Committee in the above cited case of Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[18], it should be remembered that he was speaking with reference to the facts of the case before him. Two of the debts there in question \" were secured by mortgages in land, stock and goods in Queensland\/' while the third debt consisted of \"3,000 shares in the Royal Bank of Queensland.\" And as Lord Hobhouse said: \"As regards locality it is clear that the assets now in question have locality in Queensland; but that does not affect the beneficial interest to which succession duty is attached and which devolves according to the law of the owner's domicile.\" He followed that statement up with the dictum relied on which I am discussing, namely, that if the amendment there in question had retrospective action \"it was calculated to meet such cases as the present one, and would be conclusive\" on the there respondents, that is, speaking with regard to debts and property such as those in question in that case secured by mortgage on lands and goods in Queensland and shares in the Queensland bank.\nBut their Lordships held that, in the absence of the specific words of the amendment declaring \"succession duty chargeable in respect of all property within Queensland, although the testator or intestate may not have had his domicile in Queensland,\" the statute imposing the succession duty, broad and comprehensive as its language was, must be held to include only persons who became entitled by the laws of Queensland, and must be confined to such persons. In other words, that in construing succession duty Acts, unless the language was specific to the contrary the principle of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam should apply and the law of the domicile prevail over that of situation. The words of the section above quoted to which such a ruling was applied, were as broad and as general as one could suppose language could be made to be.\nNow turning to the New Brunswick Act it cannot but be admitted that the words of the main section are as broad as they possibly could be made. They are, however, restricted by a proviso subsequently added declaring:\nThe provisions of this section are not intended to apply, and shall not apply to property outside this province, owned at the time of his death by a person not then domiciled within the province, except so much thereof as may be devised or transferred to a person or persons residing within the province.\nIn. construing this section and sub-section it is manifest that some limitations must be introduced because of the fundamental limitation contained in the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" sec. 92, limiting the power of the provinces as regards taxation to \"direct taxation within the province,\" etc. If the money, $90,325.75, here in dispute, was \"property outside of the province\" owned at the time of his death by the testator whose domicile was in Nova Scotia and had not been devised \"to any person residing in the province,\" then it would come within the express proviso of the sub-section. It had not been so devised, and the single question remained, whether it was or was not property within the province. Construing this sub-section in the light of the rules laid down by Mr. Dicey in his book on the Conflict of Laws (2 ed.), pages 754 to 760, which rules I find fully supported by the authorities, and which govern in the construction of succession duty statutes, I should have no hesitation whatever on my construction, of the deposit receipt in holding this debt to be property \"outside the Province\" of New Brunswick at the time of the testator's death, and not, therefore, subject to the succession duty. It certainly being a simple contract debt was not physically within that province whether the situs of the debt was the domicile of the testator or that of the bank, the debtor, it was alike outside of New Brunswick and the forum to administer the property was clearly that of the domicile of the testator. Attorney-General v. Campbell[19].\nTo my mind the proceedings subsequent to the testator's death, namely, the demand by the executors for the money at the branch of the bank in St. John; the refusal to pay until ancillary probate was taken out; the taking of such probate with the accompanying proceedings, in no wise affects the construction of the statute in question here.\nThe liability of the debt to pay succession duties in New Brunswick depends upon the conditions existing on the day of testator's death. No subsequent proceedings or acts of the executors could operate either to impose or impair such liability.\nThe whole subject of succession duties, the distinction which exists between them and estate and probate duties, and the rules which the courts in a long succession of judgments have found it necessary to lay down respecting the construction of statutes imposing them are authoritatively reviewed in a late case in the House of Lords, Winans v. Attorney-General[20], at page 29. These rules are to be found restated with great clearness in the speeches of the law lords who decided that case, and foremost among the rules or principles is one that unless the statute being construed forbids such a construction the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam will be applied and its application will\nbring constructively the property within or carry it without the reach of the taxing statutes according as the domicile of its deceased owner is withki or without the realm, colony or dominion as the case may be.\nOf course all such rules based as Lord Atkinson in his speech in the case just quoted, page 34, says they are on convenience and springing \"from the necessity of avoiding the difficulties almost insuperable,\" which would arise from their being ignored, must yield to the clearly expressed language overruling them, of a statute passed by a legislature competent to enact it. The questions before us are whether or not with respect to this simple contract debt the legislature of New Brunswick was so competent, and secondly, if competent, has it so clearly expressed itself as to make this debt liable to the succession duties. In the view I take of the facts and of the meaning and effect of the deposit receipt I have concluded that this debt was, to use the language of the sub-section, \"outside of the province\" and not within it at the time of the testator's death; that the subsequent action of the executors in taking out ancillary probate in New Brunswick and withdrawing the money from the agency of the testator's debtor in St. John did not and could not have the effect of bringing within the scope of the succession duties property which at the time of testator's death was not subject to them, and that consequently the appeal must be allowed and the judgment below reversed.\nIt is not necessary for me to say anything beyond what is necessary to reach this conclusion, and I desire on this difficult question of succession duties and the constitutional problems which in Canada surround it, to be understood as not expressing any opinion beyond the concrete case we have before us in this appeal. The extent to which the \"British North America Act\" imposes restrictions upon the taxing powers of the provincial legislatures ; the liability to the tax in dispute which might have followed had this been a specialty debt charged upon lands and goods within the province or consisted of shares in a provincial company as was the case in the Queensland appeal before the Privy Council; or had even the debt been a debt recoverable only in New Brunswick and not elsewhere, are none of them questions which in my view of the facts necessarily arise for decision here, and I purposely refrain from expressing any opinion upon them.\nThe debt in question being a simple contract debt recoverable against the bank debtor elsewhere than in New Brunswick, and owing to a testator domiciled in Nova Scotia when it was created and when he died was outside the Province of New Brunswick, and the forum to administer it was that of the domicile.\nAppeal should be allowed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The late George H. Lovitt deposited in the Bank of British North America two sums of money aggregating $90,351.75, and received for one sum a deposit receipt in the following form: Deposit Receipt.\nIncorporated. Royal Charter.\nBank of British North America.\nSt. John, N.B., 30th December, 1898.\nReceived from George H. Lovitt the sum of eighty-six thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five dollars and 92-100 dollars, which amount will be accounted for by the Bank of British North America on surrender of this receipt, and will bear interest until further notice at the rate of three per cent. per annum. Fifteen days' notice to be given of its withdrawal, and no interest to be paid unless the money remains in the bank three months.\nFor the Bank of British North America,\n$86,775.92. (Sgd.) H. A. Harvey, Manager.\nEntd. O. H. Sharp,\nAccountant.\nHe received for the other sum a similar deposit receipt. After Mr. Lovitt's death in Nova Scotia, where he resided, the bank refused to pay his executors these moneys unless and until they had obtained ancillary letters of probate from the Probate Court of New Brunswick.\nThereupon the executors applied for and obtained such ancillary letters of probate and by virtue thereof obtained payment of the moneys secured by said receipts.\nThe respondent thereupon claimed succession duties had become payable by virtue of the New Brunswick Act known as the \"Succession Duty Act.\"\nThe executors resisted this claim on the grounds that their testator having been domiciled in Nova Scotia, the right to such succession duties was not within the purview of the said Act, and even if so the Act in such regard was ultra vires.\nThe question raised by the latter ground must be resolved by the construction we put upon the \"British North America Act,\" and the former by the construction put upon the above mentioned provincial Act. The \"British North America Act\" assigns by section 92, sub-section 2, as one of the exclusive powers of the Provincial Legislature that of\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nIt is not disputed that the said Act imposing the succession duties it does is intended to be, and speaking generally is, a rightful exercise of this power of taxation.\nIt is claimed, however, that these debts due by the bank were within the maxim mobilia sequunter personam, and must in law be taken to have been at the death of the testator in Nova Scotia, and therefore beyond the legislative jurisdiction of the Province of New Brunswick.\nWhat was the nature of the contract the testator made? What was the nature of the property evidenced or created thereby? Was it taxable and where?\nOn the face of it the contract was entirely made in New Brunswick. And the fair construction of it having regard to what is common knowledge must be that the notice it provides to be given should be given at St. John in that province and payment be made there.\nIt is quite irrelevant to consider what might have happened and what the legal rights of the parties might have become had things happened which have not; just as much so as if a horse or carriage held under bailment and liable to taxation in the province had been, after levy, wrongfully removed beyond it, and so remained and questions raised then as to original validity of the imposition being affected thereby.\nIn the latter case the rights and remedies of the bailor might have changed their character and incidentally the possibility of actual power to enforce the tax might have vanished.\nI submit we obscure the issue by complicating it with possibilities that have not arrived.\nThe simple question is whether or not such a contract as this which was entirely created within the province had become taxable. Can there be any question now that income is held taxable by a province? And if all the varieties of sources of income we have become accustomed to see so taxed are rightly so taxed can it be that the income derivable from such a contract as this is not? If that derivable therefrom can be taxed, how can the thing itself escape taxation if that more obviously direct method were adopted?\nThe incomes from somewhat similar sources of investment were declared assessable by the Ontario Legislature and the claim upheld in the case of Re North of Scotland Canadian Mortgage Company[21]\u2014so long ago as 1881.\nThe company's head office and home was in Scotland. Its business was to lend money on real estate or public securities and act as financial agents.\nThe assessment was for interest on its investments payable to its agents at Toronto or \"at the credit of the company at a bank or being moneys lying at the credit of the company in a bank for investment.\" The shareholders receiving dividends were subject to income tax in Great Britain. Of course this decision is not binding upon us, but is of long standing and illustrative of what, I submit, may be legally done, whether wisely or not.\nNo one would dispute the liability to assessment of a bag of gold received from a non-resident for which a receipt had been given by any one entrusted with it. Can the accompaniment of such deposit of gold by terms and conditions varying the legal liability to account therefor make it less assessable?\nThe case of The Attorney-General of Quebec v. Queen Ins. Co.[22], shews that the business transaction itself, that is, the mere lending or act of acquisition cannot be taxed, as doing so would be indirect and not direct taxation.\nThe case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[23] seems to go further by reason of its comprehensiveness than needed to maintain the right to tax the thing itself in question here, that is, the property in the debt of which the receipt is merely the evidence.\nPerhaps this mode of presentation and analysis of the right may, the more one elaborates it, obscure the consideration of the real question to be solved here.\nThat has been well considered and presented in the case- of The Attorney-General v. Newman[24], where the statute under consideration was in effect identical with and apparently that from which the New Brunswick statute before us was taken.\nI agree generally in the reasoning of the opinion judgments in that case supporting the right to maintain the tax upon substantially the same element of fact as herein.\nI need not repeat or refer to the authorities therein and on the argument herein dealt with.\nThere is, as result of argument here, another view presented to my mind, and I proceed to state it. Section 25 of the New Brunswick \"Succession Duty Act\" enacts as follows:\nAny administrator, executor, or trustee having in charge or trust, any estate, legacy or property subject to the said duty, shall deduct therefrom, or collect the duty thereon, upon the appraised value thereof, from the person entitled to such property, and he shall not deliver any property subject to duty to any person until he has collected the duty thereon. 59 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 16.\nHaving regard to the terms of this statute which the executors solemnly undertook to obey upon obtaining the ancillary letters granted them by the probate court of New Brunswick, preceded by all that that grant implies it seems to me that there is an obligation resting upon them by force of the statute and the proceedings upon which the ancillary letters were got which can only be discharged by the payment of the duties claimed.\nThe Act provides, among other things, the giving of the bond for the express purpose of procuring the payment of these very duties.\nIt is to be presumed that was done. It does not appear as part of the stated case. It does not appear either whether we are at liberty to draw inferences in that regard or not.\nThe parties desire a decision upon the point of the liability to taxation, and if I am at liberty on this stated case to presume these things to have been done that should have been done by virtue of the \"Probate Courts Act\" and the \"Succession Duty Act,\" then it seems to me it would be a travesty upon justice to permit any one to obtain possession of the proceeds of a debt receivable by them only by virtue of ancillary letters granted upon the faith of their engagement, such as must have been entered into herein, and upon the faith of their representations including, it is possible, an oath implying that this property now in question was within the Province of New Brunswick. I assume that the parties to this litigation desire to have the opinion of the court upon no narrow construction of the case submitted, but upon one which would take account of the circumstances and presumptions no doubt existing and which must exist in every such case when the question to be solved herein arises. I have no doubt that the executors assuming duties such as I have assumed the executors in this case assumed in the statute just quoted, are answerable upon that statute as well as upon any undertaking they may have given pursuant to its other provisions. I have just one word to add as to the view ingeniously presented that the ultimate beneficiaries under the will in question upon whom must ultimately fall the burthen of paying duties such as that in question lived beyond the province and that it is upon them and their receipt of their legacies that the tax is in effect imposed and hence ultra vires as an indirect tax as well as of property beyond the province.\nIf I understand the argument aright it is sought to be inferred from this that the proper construction of the \"Succession Duty Act\" was that the tax in such cases was not intended and should only be imposed upon legatees if within the Province of New Brunswick, and that others should escape therefrom. I can not think that any of such constructions was within the contemplation of the framers of the Act. The provisions above referred. to seem conclusively to shew the intention at least to collect such a tax.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether the executors of the deceased George H. Lovitt are accountable for succession duties under the \"Succession Duties Act\" of New Brunswick, ch. 17, C.S.N.B., in respect of certain sums deposited by the deceased with the Bank of British North America at its branch at St. John. These deposits were acknowledged by deposit receipts in the ordinary form and under the authority of ancillary letters of probate granted by the probate court of New Brunswick were paid out at St. John to the executors of the deceased, who at the time of his death was domiciled and resident in Nova Scotia. The points in controversy are: First, were these deposits chargeable with succession duties by the terms of the statute; and secondly, if so, was the enactment in so far as it imposed a duty upon such deposits within the competence of the legislature?\nThe statute after exempting certain property and estates from the operation of it declares in broad terms (section 5) that all property (\"whether situated in New Brunswick or elsewhere other than property being in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and subject to duty whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto had a fixed place of abode in or without New Brunswick at the time of his death\") passing either by will or intestacy shall be subject to a succession duty to be levied, where the aggregate value of property exceeds $200,000, on the whole property, and in other cases upon the share in the distributable surplus passing to the respective beneficiaries according to a scale varying with the degree of relationship borne by the beneficiaries to the deceased.\nThis broad declaration is, however, qualified in an important way by sub-section 2 of the same section, which is in the following terms:\n(2) The provisions of this section are not intended to apply, and shall not apply to property outside this province, owned at the time of his death by a person not then domiciled within the province, except so much thereof as may be devised or transferred to a person or persons residing within the province.\nThe effect of the section read as a whole seems to be that as regards persons domiciled at the time of their death in New Brunswick, the duty is leviable in respect of the whole of their property; and as regards persons not domiciled at the time of their death in that province, the duties provided for by the Act are payable in respect of all property not \"outside the province\" within the terms of sub-section 2. But there is a further and necessary limitation, that, namely, which is imposed by section 92, sub-section 2, of the \"British North America Act,\" by which the provincial power of taxation is limited to \"direct taxation within the province.\" We need not consider whether in its application to the property of persons domiciled in New Brunswick, the first sub-section can be given a construction which does not offend against the constitutional limitation. At all events in its application the property of persons dying domiciled outside the province the Act is not open to impeachment as beyond the powers of the legislature. In confining the operation of the Act in such cases to property which is not outside the province, the legislature must be taken not to have intended to impose any form of taxation which does not fall within the description \"direct taxation within the province\"; and there can be no difficulty in so reading the language used. The question for determination then comes to this:\u2014Is an attempt to levy duties under the provisions of the Act in respect of the deposits in question an attempt to apply the provisions of the Act to property outside the Province of New Brunswick within the meaning of subsection 2 or an attempt to impose taxation which is not \"direct taxation within the province\" within the meaning of the \"British North America Act?\"\nChoses in action such as those in question here can, of course, have no actual local situation. They can have only a constructive situs\u2014a situs in contemplation of law. The general rule, I think, is that stated by Mr. Dicey, at page 310, Conflict of Laws, (ed. 1908)\u2014debts or choses in action are (with certain exceptions that need not be noticed) to be looked upon as situated in the country where they are \"properly recoverable or can be enforced.\" In the case of a natural person this forum is taken to be in the absence of some special stipulation affecting the debt or chose in action, the local jurisdiction within which the debtor for the time being resides. The origin of the rule and the ground upon which it rests are stated by Lord Field in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[25], at p. 481, in the following passage:\nNow a debt per se, although a chattel and part of the personal estate which the probate confers authority to administer, has, of course, no absolute local existence; but it has been long established in the courts of this country, and is a well-settled rule governing all questions as to which court can confer the required authority, that a debt does possess an attribute of locality, arising from and according to its nature, and the distinction drawn and well settled has been and is whether it is a debt by contract or a debt by specialty. In the former case, the debt being merely a chose in action\u2014money to be recovered from the debtor and nothing more\u2014could have no other local existence than the personal residence of the debtor, where the assets to satisfy it would presumably be and it was held therefore to be bon\u00e0 notabilia within the area of the local jurisdiction within which he resided; but this residence is of course of a changeable and fleeting nature, and depending upon the movements of the debtor, and inasmuch as a debt under seal or specialty had a species of corporeal existence by which its locality might be reduced to a certainty, and was a debt of a higher nature than one by contract, it was settled in very early days that such a debt was bon\u00e0 notabilia where it was \"conspicuous,\" i.e., within the jurisdiction within which the specialty was found at the time of death: see Wentworth on the Office of Executors, ed. 1763, pp. 45, 47, 60[26].\nFrom this rule the English courts have derived the criterion for ascertaining the local situation of debts and choses in action for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of courts of pro-bate, and where such liability depended upon the situation of the property for the purpose of determining the liability to duties payable upon property passing in consequence of death.\nThe application of the rule, however, where the debtor is a corporation having a principal place of business and branch offices where it also carries on its business, presents difficulties which do not arise where the debtor is a natural person. Such a corporation, while, for some purposes resident at the place where \"the central management and control actually abides\" (De Beers v. Howe26), is for other purposes (of founding jurisdiction, for example) resident at each of the places where it has a fixed place at which it carries on its business[27]. \"The better opinion,\" Mr. Dicey, p. 163, says,\nseems to be that a corporation has, following the analogy of an individual, one principal domicile, the place where the centre of its affairs is to be found, and that the other places in which it may have subordinate offices correspond as far as analogy can be carried out at all to the residence of an individual. I have come to the conclusion that the moneys in question were properly demandable only at the branch at St. John; and in that view there can be no doubt that so long as the branch should continue to carry on business there in such a way as to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of New Brunswick, that province was the proper forum for the recovery, and consequently, upon the principles above stated, the situs of the moneys deposited within the meaning of the \"Succession Duty Act.\" There, to use the words of Lord Field just quoted,\nthe assets would probably be to meet them and for the purposes of administration they must be taken to be situated there.\nThe principle which I think is applicable for the purpose of ascertaining the true effect of the transaction evidenced by the deposit receipts is that stated by Lord Bowen, then Bowen L.J., in The Moorcock[28], at page 68, in this passage:\nIn business transactions * * \"::' what the law desires to effect by implication is to give such efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended by at all events both parties who are business men;\nand by Lord Watson in Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Co.[29]:\nI have always understood that when the parties to a mercantile contract have not expressed their intentions in a particular event, but have left these to implication, a court of law, in order to ascertain the implied meaning of the contract, must assume that the parties intended to stipulate for that which is fair and reasonable, having regard to their mutual interests and to the main objects of the contract. In some cases that assumption is the only test by which the meaning of the contract can be ascertained. There may be many possibilities within the contemplation of the contract of charter-party which were not actually present to the minds of the parties at the time of making it, and, when one or other of these possibilities becomes a fact, the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence.\nApplying these principles, can any stipulation be implied from these documents and such of the surrounding circumstances as we are entitled to consider as to the place where the moneys referred to in them should be demandable?\nA similar question was raised and decided in Attorney-General v. Newman[30]. In that case there were six such receipts given by six different banks, one of which was the Bank of British North America, all in the same form as those before us. The Ontario Court of Appeal, affirming the Chancellor, unanimously held that the moneys represented by them were only properly demandable at the several branches of the banks where the deposits had been made. Two years afterwards the question was raised in British Columbia, in Re Scott McDonald[31], concerning a deposit in the Bank of Montreal evidenced by a receipt in the same form. The full court of that province unanimously concurred in the view of the Chancellor and the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In both these cases the occasion of the litigation was an attempt by the province to exact duties under a statute similar to the new Brunswick Act. In this case the full court of New Brunswick unanimously adopted the same view. These cases appear to me to be well decided.\nIt is stated in the case submitted to us that the Bank of British North America had a branch office at St. John, N.B., and its head office in London. We must, I think, put aside for the purposes of this appeal any suggestion that the centre of the bank's affairs within the meaning of the principle stated by Mr. Dicey is at Montreal. For the purposes of applying certain sections of the \"Bank Act\" the bank is required by the Act to have a chief place of business there; but those sections have no relevancy to any question on this appeal, and we must, I think, take the principal place of business to be in fact where it is stated to be\u2014in London.\nLet us then apply the principle stated by Lord Bowen and Lord Watson;. Is there any relevant inference or implication which upon that principle can properly be drawn from the circumstance that a customer of a Canadian bank deposits at one of its branches a sum of money upon the terms that the bank will account for the specific sum deposited with interest, upon the surrender of the receipt and upon receiving fifteen days' notice of the withdrawal of the money, and upon the terms that no interest is to be payable unless the money remain in the bank for three months ? In the first place it is clear that the parties regard the transaction as a deposit of money or a loan of money at interest. Is it possible also to treat the transaction as involving an undertaking on the part of the bank to pay at any other of its branches or at its head office across the continent or across the Atlantic, upon notice and demand by the depositor there of the precise sum of money deposited? I do not think myself that looking at the question from the point of view indicated by the language of Lord Watson just quoted, it is possible to suppose that reasonable business men would, if such a point had been raised when the deposit was made, have regarded it as open for discussion. Consider for a moment what such a construction of these instruments involves. There is the very obvious inconvenience of making provision at the various branches and the head office for the verification of these documents when presented from all parts of the country. Then there is the question of time. To confine ourselves to the specific case before us, is it supposable that if the bank had contemplated binding itself to pay this money at its head office in London, some longer notice than fifteen days would not have been stipulated for in order to insure beyond failure sufficient time to make the necessary inquiries in the ordinary way? Then again there is the cost of transmission. Here is a sum of money which the depositor has at his credit at St. John. Is it to be supposed that the bank, without making some provision for the cost of transmission, and without regard to the balance of exchange, would have agreed to pay the precise sum deposited with the agreed interest in London at the option of the depositor? Some suggestion was made that the undertaking of the bank was to \"account\" for the sum mentioned, and that in that word might be implied some provision for the deduction of such expenses. But surely that is to abandon the appellant's point. Upon what is the implication based? It can have no other foundation than the theory that the Bank is to account for the moneys deposited, not as moneys in London, but as moneys in St. John. In other words, you cannot imply such a stipulation, in my judgment, without going quite as far as it is necessary to go in order to imply the stipulation that the obligation of the bank is to make provision for payment and to pay at St. John, in other words, that St. John is the place of demand. From the point of view of the honest and reasonable depositor, it is difficult to see what advantage would accrue to him from making money deposited in St. John, and intended to remain in the bank there as a deposit at interest (which is what these deposits profess to be), demandable in the ordinary course at the head office of the bank. If his purpose were under the guise of making a deposit to get money transmitted to London free of charge, one might understand it. But it is not by such assumptions that the intentions of parties to business contracts are to be arrived at. The discontinuance of the branch at St. John could not possibly affect the interests of the depositor because a condition which the bank by its own act had made it impossible for the depositor to perform would ipso jure cease to bind him. I come to the conclusion, therefore, that the construction placed upon these documents by the courts below is the only one which is calculated to give efficacy to them as business documents in accordance with what must be supposed to have been the intentions of reasonable men entering into the transactions evidenced by them.\nThis alone is sufficient to determine the appeal. But conceding the point just considered against the respondent still, I think, the appeal fails. The argument for the appellant is this. The deposit receipts embody a general and unconditional obligation to account for certain moneys. These moneys admittedly were demandable at the bank at St. John; but whether or not also demandable at other branches they certainly were also demandable at the head office. Now, it is said for the purpose of this statute the situs of a chose in action is the residence of the debtor; and for the purpose of determining the durability of such an asset under such statutes as this as between rival authorities the residence of a corporation is by construction of law deemed to be the place where its administrative business is carried on\u2014in this case London. It follows\u2014so it is argued\u2014that at the date of the death of the testator the choses in action in question must, for the purpose in hand, be taken to have been situate outside New Brunswick.\nThus it is said to result from the application of Lord Field's reasoning that these choses in action (reducible into possession at the residence of the debtor because they would \"probably be\" there, or because they were \"properly recoverable there\"), are for the purpose of determining their situs regarded as properly recoverable and reducible into possession in London only, although it manifestly never entered the mind of anybody until this controversy arose that they should be demanded or recovered anywhere except at the branch office where the moneys were deposited. I am not, of course, returning to the question of implied terms. I am merely emphasizing the circumstance that this result arises purely from the application of a series of constructions of law, and is a result which imparts to the transactions in question a legal effect obviously at variance with any reasonably conceivable expectation of the parties.\nI think the reasoning fails because it is based upon an assumption which I think cannot be sustained in principle, and has no countenance from authority. That assumption, underlying the argument, is that a corporation for the purpose of determining the situs of its obligations can never have more than one residence. A corporation\u2014I have already mentioned\u2014admittedly can have, for the purpose of founding jurisdiction, many residences; and if a corporation be in that sense resident within a given local jurisdiction and performance of a given obligation of that corporation is properly (i.e., lawfully) demandable within that jurisdiction, I do not see on what ground it can be said on the principles stated above that the obligation has its situs exclusively elsewhere. If the corporation is there so that its obligations can be enforced against it there, and if the given obligation is at the demand of the creditor enforceable there (in the sense that the creditor is legally entitled to have it performed there not merely that he may sue there for the debtor's breach of it), then for all these purposes the residence of the corporation (in the relevant sense) must be said to be there. That is really only another way of saying that if the situs of the obligation must be taken in contemplation of law to be determined by the residence of the debtor then the conditions upon which constructive residence of a corporation for this purpose depends are not necessarily to be found in one locality exclusively; and accords with the view expressed by Mr. Dicey in the passage quoted above.\nOf course it is said at once that in this view a debt may be situated at one and the same time in several places; and that in practice great confusion would result. There is nothing in this last suggestion; because it must very rarely happen that an obligation is lawfully enforceable in the sense mentioned at the choice of the creditor at more than one place where the debtor can be said to be resident. It would only occur where an artificial person is the debtor, and in most cases there must be some circumstance indicating one place rather than another as the place where the obligation ought to be performed. It may be that in the conceivable case in which the sole fact should be an obligation, of which performance could at the will of the creditor be exacted from a corporation either at its head office or at another place where it should be held to be resident, it may be that (assuming it necessary to determine the question of situs on these bare facts taken by themselves), the preference ought to be given to the place where the principal business is carried on. But cases in which the question is thus baldly presented must be very rare, and this case is not one of them.\nThis appears to be the difficulty in which in this case the appellants are involved. The jurisdiction of the New Brunswick court having been in fact based upon the assumption that there was personal property \u2014 in other words that these choses in action were \u2014 within the province, can the executors who obtained the grant on that assumption now dispute the foundation of the court's jurisdiction to make the grant? There is a doctrine of the law that one may not approbate and reprobate, play fast and loose, gain an advantage by assuming one position and escape the correlative burden by assuming another and inconsistent position. Gandy v. Gandy[32], at p. 82; Roe v. Mutual Loan Fund[33]; Smith v. Baker[34]. I do not think the executors, having represented these choses in action to be New Brunswick assets and having obtained probate and authority to reduce the assets into possession on that footing and having got possession of them under that authority, could be heard to say, against that province, in order to escape this duty, that they were not assets in New Brunswick. It may be argued that although the executors had a right to elect at which place the moneys should be demandable and reducible into possession \u2014 still until they had exercised their election the situs of the obligation was at the place where the head office of the bank was situated. I do not think that helps the respondent. The executors, it is conceded, had the right to determine whether they should treat these moneys as assets in New Brunswick or in the United Kingdom. Having elected to treat them as assets in New Brunswick and having acquired a full title to them as such under a New Brunswick probate (they could not otherwise acquire a right to reduce them into possession or deal with them there) their title to them must with the probate in contemplation of law have relation to the date of the testator's death; the assets must, in other words, be deemed to have been vested in them under the New Brunswick probate or, in other words, as New Brunswick assets from that date. Ingle v. Richards[35]; Whitehead v. Taylor[36]; Williams on Executors, p. 214. In a word, assuming that in the bald case above suggested the situs assigned by construction of law to these assets would be the place of the head office of the bank, that situs is assigned only in the absence of and subject to other controlling factors \u2014 in this case, in the absence of and subject to the election of the executors. That election once made has all its normal legal consequences and determines the situation of the assets as from the date of the testator's death.\nThere is some danger possibly of forgetting that we are to construe the language of an Act of the legislature with regard to the intention of which, it has been said, that \"the common understanding of men is one main clue.\" It is satisfactory to think, for the reasons I have given, that the constructions of law upon which the appellants' argument rests are not sufficiently inflexible to lead us to the startling conclusion that the New Brunswick Legislature in excluding property \"outside the province\" from the operation of the statute intended to exempt moneys on deposit in branch banks in that province which should be reduced into possession under a New Brunswick probate.\nBut it is said that the duty attached (if at all) at the date of the death and that unless it can be affirmed of these choses in action that they had a fixed situs within the province at that date, this is an attempt to exceed the provincial authority to impose direct taxation within the province.\nBefore dealing with that question it will be convenient to mention that it is a mistake to suppose that the payment of the duties imposed is in no way a condition affecting the right of the executors to collect and administer the estate. The Act requires the executors within thirty days after the grant to enter into an obligation for the payment of the duties, and in default there is a provision for the cancellation of the grant. The executors are made personally responsible for duties leviable upon property handed over by them without first collecting the duty. Then on certain estates (over $200,000) the duty is levied on the whole estate irrespective of the ultimate destination of the surplus.\nIt is observable that the imposition of such duties in respect of moneys reduced into possession under a New Brunswick probate under the protection and authority of the provincial laws seems clearly to fall within the words \"taxation within the province.\" As respects constitutional authority it can, it appears to me, make not the slightest difference, whether at the date of the death the property was in the province or out of the province. The power of the province to impose duties upon property coming under such authority into the hands of the legal personal representatives of a deceased person wherever domiciled has, I think, never been seriously questioned. It is, moreover, direct taxation because the tax is paid by (or out of the property of) the very persons upon whom its incidence is intended to and does fall, namely, those beneficially interested in the estate. The trustees' are the hands through which it is paid, it is true, but the trustees are not (in any sense germane to this question) the persons from whom it is primarily exacted; their personal liability only arises on failure to perform the duty to collect the tax out of the beneficiaries' share or retain the property until the tax is paid.\nNor do I think any difficulty arises from the circumstance that the tax is declared to be payable at or within twelve months of the death of the deceased. On this question of constitutional validity the inquiry is this : Looking at the scope and purpose of the Act as a whole (or rather in this case at the Act as it affects to impose duties in respect of persons dying domiciled outside the province) does the enactment transcend the power to impose \"direct taxation within the province?\" Then, if this power of taxation within the province is sufficient to justify the exaction of this kind of impost in respect of this kind of property in the hands of the executors within the province, is the enactment vitiated because of the circumstance that the duties are declared to be payable at the date of the death at which time it is said this property had not a fixed situs within the province? The answer to that, according to my view of the Act, is this. If the Act applies to such assets as these, it is because they were assets constructively within the province as being choses in action which, according to the agreement of the parties, were to be demanded of the debtor within the province or because they were assets which were in fact reduced into possession within the province, and which either the executors could not be permitted to say were not assets within the province at the death of the deceased, or which were, in contemplation of law, New Brunswick assets in their hands at that date. On any one of these hypotheses these choses in action were assets which indisputably came within the sweep of the power of taxation committed to the province. The declaration (section 13) that the duties should be payable at death or within one year thereafter appears to have been intended (see section 12(2)), to afford a basis for levying interest from the date of death in default of payment when due. Such incidents of the tax appear to me, once it is clear that the legislature is aiming alone at property within the province, to be unobjectionable; and in any view I can see no difficulty in giving to every part of the provision its full application as regards assets which by legal construction are considered New Brunswick assets in the hands of the executors at the date of the testator's death.\nA word as to the general character of the Act. The express language of section 5 excludes the application of the principle, upon which the operation of the statutes respecting succession duty and legacy duty have been in England limited to the estates of persons domiciled within the kingdom. I cannot in view of that language see how the question here can be affected in the least degree by the domicile of the testator. The Act (which, notwithstanding its name, is thus radically different from the English Acts bearing similar titles) in its general features resembles the statutes which under the same name are in force in Ontario and some other provinces of Canada. In view of the composite character of the legislation I do not think the decisions upon the English statutes referred to, or the observations of distinguished judges upon the broad distinctions that have been observed in the Imperial legislation respecting the different classes of death duties, can afford us very much direct aid in the construction of it.\nIt may, however, be proper to add that in the view of Mr. Westlake, at pages 122 and 123, Private International Law (3 ed.), there could seem to be no question that under the statutes regulating the imposition of probate duty assets such as those in question here would in the circumstances have been subject to those duties; and this although the general rule governing the application of those Acts was that stated by Mr. Dicey, p. 313, that the incidence of the duty fell only on property in England at the death of the deceased. And Mr. Dicey, at page 761, says the test was this: Was the property so situate as to give the court power to grant letters of administration or probate?\nThe single question open, to my mind, to discussion is that which I have discussed\u2014very lengthily I am afraid\u2014should these choses in action be held in the circumstances here to be \"property without New Brunswick\" within the meaning of sub-section 2? For the foregoing reasons I think, with great respect, the answer must be in accordance with the judgment below.\nAnglin J.\u2014Three questions arise upon this appeal; the first, whether upon the proper construction of certain bank deposit receipts issued from a branch office of a bank the moneys represented by them are demandable by the depositor or his representatives only at the branch office at which the deposits were made; the second, whether the debts evidenced by these documents are taxable property at the place of deposit within the purview of the \"Succession Duty Act\" of New Brunswick; and the third, whether, in so far as it may be held to cover such debts due to a decedent not domiciled in the province, this legislation is intra vires of a provincial legislature.\nThe deposit receipts are in the usual form. Issued and dated at St. John, N.B., where the deposits were made, but naming no place of payment, they purport to bind the Bank of British North America, after fifteen days' notice, to account to the depositor for two sums of $86,775.93 and $ 3,575.83 with interest, on surrender of the receipts which are non-transferable. The head office of the bank is in London, England. For the purposes of such sections of the \"Dominion Bank Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 29) as apply to it, its chief office is its office at Montreal (section 7). It maintains a large number of branches throughout Canada under the authority of section 76.\nThere are in the record no other material facts bearing upon the first question, which comes before us on a stated case without any evidence as to the circumstances in which the deposit receipts were issued, as to any custom of bankers in regard to their issue or payment, or as to the usual requirements as to the place at which notice is to be given or presentation made in order to payment. At what place or places the debts evidenced by these receipts are demandable must therefore be ascertained from the terms of the documents, unaffected by considerations of \"course of business\" or \"surrounding circumstances.\" Bell & Co. v. Antwerp, London & Brazil Line[37].\nThe terms of the receipts sufficiently imply the exclusion of the general principle of English law, \"that the debtor is to seek out his creditor and pay him where he lives.\" But excepting the fact that they are dated at St. John, N.B., where the deposits were made, they afford no indication of the place of payment. They purport to bind the bank as a body corporate. The bank as a single entity is unquestionably the debtor. Prince v. Oriental Bank Corp.[38].\nDo the facts that the receipts were issued and bear date at St. John and that the debtor stipulates therein for fifteen days' notice of withdrawal and for the surrender of the receipts themselves import a condition that such notice must be given to and demand of payment made at the branch of the bank from which the receipts issued and not elsewhere? That these were implied terms of the transactions was assumed in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, chiefly on the authority of The Attorney-General v. Newman[39].\nThe present record contains nothing which would exempt these documents from the operation of the ordinary rules of evidence and of construction which govern all contracts reduced to writing. If it had been intended that there should be no right to demand payment elsewhere than at the St. John office of the bank, that restriction upon the debtor's liability could easily have been stated. I am, with great respect, unable from the mere consideration of the terms of these documents to import into them such a distinct qualification or modification of the general and unconditional obligation of the bank which they express. I do not stop to inquire whether the mere statement in such an instrument of a place of payment without the addition of some words equivalent to\u2014\"and not elsewhere''\u2014would entitle the debtor to insist upon presentation and demand at the place named. Co. Litt. 210b, note 1[40]. But in the absence of any designation of a place of payment, while it may be questionable whether the creditor would have the right to give notice of withdrawal and to make demand for payment at some local branch of the bank other than that at St. John (see judgment of Esher M.R, in Bell v. Antwerp40, at page 107), a right to give such notice and to demand payment at the head office of the bank in London, England, or, perhaps, at its chief office for Canada, in Montreal, as well as at the St. John branch, is, in my opinion, at all events in the absence of any evidence of custom of bankers or course of business precluding it, conferred by these contracts. Irwin v. Bank of Montreal[41].\nIn Attorney-General y. Newman[42], according to the statement in 31 O.K. 340, some of the banks in which the decedent had deposited his monies had head offices in Ontario. Others presumably had head offices elsewhere. The appeal ease, which I have seen, shews that the monies in question were deposited with six different banks, two of which had, and four of which had not, their head offices in Ontario. One of the latter was the Bank of British North America. The form of the deposit receipts there in question, not given in the law reports, may be found in Mr. Bayley's book on Succession Duty in Canada, at page 50. No place of payment is named in the form there published. Neither does it appear that there was before the courts in that case any evidence of a custom of bankers or of a course of business in regard to deposit receipts or of special circumstances accompanying the deposit. The disposition of the case proceeds entirely upon the assumption, made by the learned judges, that the monies were \"only properly demandable at the branches of the several banks at which the deposits represented by the receipts had been made.\" It naturally followed that they were \"property which could be only properly administered in Ontario,\" and they were therefore \"property situate within Ontario\" and as such taxable by the province. Unless, in some particular not stated in the reports, the facts in the Newman case are distinguishable from those of this case, I must, with all proper respect, express my dissent from the conclusion there reached that monies represented by deposit receipts issued by Ontario branch offices of banks having their head offices outside of Ontario are property which can only be properly demanded and administered in that province.\nThe second and third questions may be conveniently dealt with together.\nThe powers of taxation of a provincial legislature are restricted by section 92 of the \"British North America Act\" to \"direct taxation within the province.\" The \"taxation of property not within the province\" is forbidden. Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[43], at page 513.\nSection 5 of the \"Succession Duty Act\" of New Brunswick (C.S. [1903] ch. 17), as originally enacted, purported to render liable to succession duty\nall property whether situate in this province or elsewhere, other than property being in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, subject to duty, whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto had or had not a fixed place of abode in or without this province at the time of his death, passing either by will or on intestacy.\nUpon the constitutionality of this legislation being challenged by the then Minister of Justice, Sir Oliver Mowat (December 17, 1896), the legislature enacted the following provision, which now appears as subsection 2, of section 5:\nThe provisions of this section are not intended to apply and shall not apply to property outside this province and owned at the time of his death by a person not then domiciled within the province, except so much thereof as may be devised or transferred to a person or persons residing within this province.\nThe property now in question was not \"devised or transferred to a person or persons residing within this province,\" unless the fact that the New Brunswick administrator actually procured payment of the deposit receipts at St, John is to be deemed a transfer to him within the meaning of the exception in subsection 2. I think the devise or transfer intended by the exception in that sub-section is a devise or transfer to a beneficiary within the province of property situate at the time of the decedent's death without the province, and that the exception therefore has no application to this case. Its presence in the statute, however, having regard to its history, serves to emphasize the intention of the legislature, perhaps otherwise sufficiently manifest, to reach by its legislation all property of a decedent which it can lawfully subject to taxation at the time of his death. To apply the language of a learned New York judge,\nthe legislature intended, as I think, to repeal the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, so far as it was an obstacle, and leave it unchanged so far as it was an aid to the imposition of a tax under all property in any respect subject to the laws of this state.\nRe Whiting[44].\nIn order to reach movable property of resident decedents situate outside the province, the legislature proceeds upon this maxim; in order to reach movable property of non-resident decedents, its location in fact, or by legal fiction, is made the test of its situs.\nThe terms of the New Brunswick legislation clearly exclude the application to its construction of the principles upon which were decided the series of English cases, of which Thomson v. The Advocate-General[45] is perhaps the most noted. The legislature has expressed its intention not to confine its taxation to property, the title to which is obtained under the law of New Brunswick, but to subject to what it terms \"succession duty,\" not only all property where-ever situate of a decedent domiciled within the province, but also all property of a decedent domiciled elsewhere, which is not \"outside\" the province.\nIn view of the form of the restriction placed upon the provincial power of taxation by the \"British North America Act,\" if there be any class of property which, though not \"outside the province\" is yet not \"within the province,\" ut res mayis valeat quam pereat, and having regard to its history, which makes manifest the purpose of the legislature not to exceed its constitutional powers, sub-section 2 may, I think, be taken, in the case of a decedent domiciled without New Brunswick, to exclude such property from the operation of section 5. If not, as to such property the legislation would, in my opinion, be ultra vires.\nWe are not now concerned with the purview or the validity of this legislation in so far as it may affect property of a domiciled decedent, which is not within the province at his death and is not brought into the province in the course of administration, if indeed the latter fact be material. Attorney-General v. Dimond in 1831[46].\nIt is important and, at this point, convenient to inquire what is the nature of the tax called a \"succession duty\" which the New Brunswick statute imposes. Is it a tax in the nature of a probate tax, which, like probate fees, is payable as \"a condition of the issue of probate\" or letters of administration? Or is it in the nature of a duty on the beneficial succession to property which is ultimately paid by the beneficial recipient? Is it a tax on the succession itself, or is it imposed on the property which passes? If on the property, is it confined to property having a situs actual or legal within the province? If on the succession, is it a direct tax and is it in the present case \"taxation within the province?\"\nAlthough it contains several provisions which we would expect to find in connection with a probate tax \u2014notably those requiring the filing of an inventory and the giving of a bond by the personal representative (section 6), imposing on him the obligation to pay the tax (sections 15-19), making it payable at death (section 13), and its scale partly dependent upon the aggregate value (section 5), and declaring that the duty shall be \"over and above the fees provided by the chapter of these consolidated statutes relating to probate courts\" (section 5)\u2014the statute does not impose payment of the duty as a condition of the grant of probate or administration, nor does it make the fact that the title to or possession of particular property can only be acquired, or has in fact been acquired, under local letters the test of liability to the tax. It is true that the duty is made collectable in the course of administration, but it differs from a probate tax in that though paid in the first instance by the executor its ultimate incidence is not on the estate, but on the beneficiary (section 15). The specific and pecuniary legatees, and not the residuary legatee, have to bear the burden (Dicey's Conflict of Laws, 2 ed., p. 747). Its rate depends in part on the residence and on the degree of relationship or the absence of relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent. This tax, therefore, partakes of the nature of a succession or a legacy duty as well as of a probate duty. If it were imposed as a condition of probate or administration, it may well be that the legislature could subject to it all property got in under the authority of a grant from a New Brunswick court. If, however, it is not a duty imposed as a condition of probate, but is a tax on the succession or on the property passing, the fact that the property in question was actually got in under the authority of letters granted in New Brunswick does not determine its liability. That depends upon whether the succession occurs in New Brunswick or the property is property within New Brunswick within the purview of the statute, and also upon the constitutional power in either case to impose the tax. The property passed from the decedent and passed to the beneficiaries in the sense that they had acquired their beneficial interest in it, subject, of course, to payment of his debts in due course of administration and, in cases of testacy, to the assent of the executor, immediately on the death of the testator. The tax attached to it, if at all, at the date of his death (section 13). Its liability to duty and its legal situs therefore, cannot depend upon the fact that the executor some time afterwards, and perhaps unnecessarily, took ancillary probate in New Brunswick and got in the property at St. John. Compare Attorney-General v. Hope, in 1834[47], a case of probate tax, and Attorney-General v. Forbes[48], a case of legacy duty.\nThat the legislature may declare dutiable any property of a non-domiciled decedent, which, though not within the province at the time of his death, shall be received or held therein at any subsequent time and for any purpose by this personal representatives may be conceded. But, in my opinion, this it has not done. The provision of the statute that the tax shall attach at the decedent's death, is not consistent with such an intention. The property is not then within the province, and the provincial power of taxation is only \"within the province.\"\nSection 5 indicates an intention to tax the decedent's property at the time of its \"passing,\" and subsection 2 thereof, in the case of the non-domiciled decedent, only property not outside, i.e., within the province at the time of his death. In other words, the statute in effect declares that the only property of a non-domiciled decedent, which is subject to the tax, is that which is within New Brunswick at the time of his death. This view of the scope of the legislation is emphasized by the exception in sub-section 2, of section 5, of \"outside\" property of a non-domiciled decedent, which is devised or transferred to a resident beneficiary.\nBut is the tax imposed on the succession, or on the property itself? The statute says (section 5) that \"property * * * passing by will or intestacy * * * shall be subject to a succession duty,\" and it distinctly declares this duty to be payable where the property which \"passes\" is that of a non-domiciled decedent, whether it be movable or immovable. This latter fact would seem to raise a most serious, if not an insuperable obstacle to construing this statute as imposing a duty on the succession itself. Winans v. Attorney-General[49], at pages 32 et seq., 39 et seq.\nBut it is said that we are bound by the decision of this court in Lovitt v. Attorney-General of Nova Scotia[50], to hold that the duty is imposed on the succession and not on the property. The Nova Scotia statute there under consideration declared \"subject to a succession duty,\"\nall property situated or being within the province of Nova Scotia and any interest therein or income therefrom, whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto last dwelt within the said province or not.\nIf the word \"dwelt,\" as here used, means \"resided\" as distinguished from \"was domiciled,\" this statute may be construed as applicable only in the cases of domiciled decedents and therefore clearly distinguishable from the New Brunswick Act; but if \"dwelt,\" as used in the Nova Scotia Act, means \"domiciled,\" the two Acts appear not to be distinguishable in substance, and in that case this court was probably committed by the decision in the 33rd volume to the view that the duty imposed by these Acts is a tax on the succession. Taschereau C.J., and Davies J., pointedly expressed this opinion upon the Nova Scotia Act and, while Armour J. is reported as merely agreeing in the dismissal of the appeal, on a careful examination of the case, I can find no other ground on which he could well have reached this result. Moreover, I am informed by Mr. Justice Davies that this was in fact the late Mr. Justice Armour's ratio decidendi. But for this decision, with the most profound respect for these three eminent judges, I would have been of the opinion expressed in that case by Mr. Justice Mills that, although the occasion of the tax is the passing or succession, and it is called a succession duty, yet it is upon the property and not upon the succession that it is fastened.\nIt may be questionable how far we should deem ourselves bound, if it be not distinguishable, to follow the decision of the majority of this court in Lovitt v. Attorney-General of Nova Scotia[51], in view of the opinions since expressed in the House of Lords in Winans v. Attorney-General[52], as to the scope of succession duties proper and the property on which they are imposable. But it seems to me not necessary to determine whether or not the former decision of this court is indistinguishable or whether or not it should be deemed still binding. If the duty in question was intended to be a tax on the succession, notwithstanding that it is payable in respect of the movable property of a non-domiciled decedent, and that its amount is made in part to depend upon the value of the whole estate, inasmuch as the succession itself to movable property depends upon the law of the decedent's domicile and the beneficiary acquires his interest under and by virtue of that law (Harding v. The Commissioner of Stamps for Queensland[53], at page 774), it would seem to have been unnecessary to provide so explicitly that the tax shall be payable in respect of property of a domiciled decedent situate without the province. In the case of a decedent domiciled elsewhere, the duty, though confined to property situate in New Brunswick, if levied on the succession would not be a taxation within the province. Moreover, if the law requires the personal representative to pay a tax on the succession, with a right either to indemnity from the beneficiary or to recoupment out of his property, the tax would savour of the indirect. An instance of an indirect tax, given by the Privy Council in Attorney-General v. Reed[54], at page 143, is where \"a person who pays it may be a trustee, an administrator, a person who will have to be indemnified by somebody else afterwards.\" Because the statute appears to me in terms to impose what it calls a succession duty, not upon the succession, but, by reason of the succession, upon the property itself and also because, viewed as a tax on the succession, it would, in the case of a movable property of non-domiciled decedents, be ultra vires, unless bound by Lovitt v. Attorney-General of Nova Scotia[55], to hold otherwise, I conclude that the duty is a tax upon the property itself.\nIf it is a tax upon the property, though payable in the first instance by the personal representative, it is his right to pay it out of, or to deduct it from, the property passing through his hands, and I therefore deem him merely the agent of the province to collect the tax from the beneficiary upon whose property it is directly imposed.\nIf the duty be a tax upon the succession to or acquisition of the property of the decedent, its situs at his death is in the case of movable property not material. But if it be a tax upon the property passing as distinguished from the succession to or acquisition of such property, the situs of the property becomes a matter of prime importance.\nAlthough it is apparently well established in the United States that, as a general rule, the situs of debts for purposes of taxation is that of the domicile of the creditor (and this seems to me the more logical rule: Re State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds[56], at pages 318-9;) and a tax imposed by another State, in which the debtor resided, has been held unconstitutional (Wharton's Conflict of Laws, 3 ed., pp. 171-2), under the law of England which prevails in New Brunswick it is equally well established that a simple contract debt owing by an individual is property which has a local situs where the debtor resides: Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[57], whereas the situs of specialty debts and of debts represented by documents marketable and transferable by delivery is \"where the instruments happen to be.\" Winans v. The King[58], at pages 1026, 1030. That the artificial situs ascribed to debts by English law rather than the situs of the domicile of the creditor is the criterion for determining the liability of such property to taxation seems to be indicated by Lord Hobhouse in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[59], at page 775. That this is the test in a case of probate duty is well settled. Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[60]. And as pointed out by Mr. Dicey, an English decision determining liability or non-liability to probate duty is a decision that the property affected was or was not situate in England at the time of the decedent's death. Conflict of Laws (2 ed.), at page 313.\nWere the debtor in the present case resident only in New Brunswick, the debts evidenced by the deposit receipts would, I think, have been taxable in that province. Adapting language found in Attorney-General v. Neioman[61], \"any property which can only be properly administered in the province is property situate within the province according to the meaning which ought properly to be attributed to those words in the 'Succession Duty Act.' \" But if payment of the deposit receipts held by the late Senator Lovitt was exigible as well in London or Montreal as in St. John, can it be said that the debtor's residence was sufficiently established at St. John to make the moneys represented by the receipts property \"within the province\" of New Brunswick?\nThat a corporation may for some purposes have many residences may be conceded. For instance, though its head office or chief place of business be elsewhere, if it has a place of business, an office or an agency within a province, it may be resident there for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the provincial courts. But if it be necessary to determine what, for purposes of taxation, is the seat of the corporation\u2014what is the place at which it dwells or carries on its business\u2014what is its residence\u2014there are many authorities which indicate that it should be regarded \"as necessarily having its seat or centre of operations in some one spot to the exclusion of all others,\" and that this will be \"the centre where the corporation resides, while the other establishments are merely offices or agencies.\" See decisions collected in Foote's Int. Law (2 ed.), pages 112-121, and in Lindley on Companies (6 ed.), page 1223.\nIf a corporation, for the purpose of fixing the situs of its debts not otherwise determined, should be deemed resident in each province or state in which it may have an agency, or place of business, it is obvious that, as property of the creditor, every such debt might be subjected to taxation in every such province or state. It would seem unreasonable, that the mere exigibility of a debt by legal process at several places should suffice to render that debt property subject to taxation at each of such places. I should require unquestionable authority to satisfy me that this is the law. Of course it is quite competent for a sovereign legislature untrammelled by constitutional limitations to declare any property, wherever situate, taxable and to declare a corporation, for any reason or without reason, resident within its jurisdiction. The only restriction upon its power is the limitation of inability to enforce its laws. But the legislature of a British province, which is empowered to impose only \"taxation within the province,\" cannot by legislative declaration make anything property \"Within the province\" which would not otherwise be such according to the recognized principles of English law. If it could, the constitutional limitation upon its power would be a mere dead letter.\nThe inconvenience and injustice which might result in the case of an insolvent decedent, who leaves property in several jurisdictions in each of which he also leaves creditors, from a holding that, even for purposes of administration, a debt due to him by a corporation should be deemed property having a situs wherever such corporation may have a branch, is obvious. How would the doctrine that creditors within the jurisdiction have a right to satisfaction of their claims out of local assets in priority to foreign creditors be applied? Would the accident of one ancillary administrator rather than another first demanding and obtaining payment of the debt determine the rights in regard to it of the various creditors wherever resident?\nThe sufficiency and the propriety of a grant of letters of administration in respect of such property by the consistorial court of the diocese within which the general and chief business of the corporation was carried on rather than by the court of another diocese within which the corporation had an office and did part of its business seems to be fairly deducible from Ex parte Horne[62]. The same idea that in respect to money due to a decedent from a corporation its residence for the purpose of fixing the situs of the debt and thus making it bonum notabile is its chief place of business runs through the decisions of Romilly MR., and of Giffard L.J., in the case of Fernandes' Executors[63].\nIn \"Willis v. Bank of England[64], at page 38, it is pointed out that\nthough the statute, 7 Geo. IV. ch. 46, sec. 15, requires that bank post bills issued by the branch banks shall be payable there as well as at London, yet the converse has not been enacted, and the bank post bills issued in London are not payable at the branch banks.\nA not unreasonable inference from this decision is that but for the statute the post bills issued by branch banks would have been payable only at London.\nThere is a singular dearth of authority upon the important question as to what should be deemed, for purposes of taxation, the situs of a debt owing by a corporation and exigible at more than one of its establishments. But, in the absence of direct authority, applying the principles which seem to underlie decisions in cases somewhat cognate, and deeming that to be the law which appears most consonant with equity and natural justice, I have reached the conclusion that the situs of the debts represented by the deposit receipts in question here was not at St. John, N.B., but was either at Montreal or at London\u2014for the purposes of this action it matters not which.\nIf this be not so, although their situs may not be definitely outside, neither is it so clearly within New Brunswick that these debts should be deemed subject to the provincial power of taxation. If they are property not \"outside the province,\" within the meaning of that descriptive phrase in the New Brunswick \"Succession Duty Act,\" so far as it includes them that statute is, in my opinion, ultra vires. If the duty is imposed upon the succession itself, rather than, as I think, fastened upon the property passing, and if it attaches in respect of the debts represented by these deposit receipts, it is likewise, in my opinion, not \"taxation within the province.\"\nI would therefore allow the appeal of the defendants.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

IV. c. 31, s. 2\u2014Government railway\u2014Fire from engine\u2014Negligence\u2014Damages.\nBy 7 & 8 Edw. IV. ch. 31, sec. 2, the Government of Canada is liable for damage to property caused by a fire started by a locomotive working on a government railway, whether its officers or servants are or are not negligent, and by a proviso the amount of damages is limited if modern and efficient appliances have been used and the officers or servants \"have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence.\"\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that the expression \"have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence\" means negligence in any respect and not merely in the use of a locomotive equipped with modern and efficient appliances.\nSparks from a locomotive set fire to the roof of a government building near the railway track and the fire was carried to and destroyed private property. The roof of this building had on several previous occasions caught fire in a similar way and the government officials, though notified on many of such occasions, had only patched it up without repairing it properly.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court (12 Ex. C.R. 389), that the government officials were guilty of negligence in having a building with a roof in such condition so near to the track, and the owner of the property destroyed was entitled to recover the total amount of his loss.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the suppliant, but limit- ing the amount of damages to $5,000 to be apportioned among all the parties injured, the share of the suppliant being $3,284.67.\nThe claim set forth in the petition of right in this case was based on the provisions of the Act 7 & 8 Edw. VII. ch. 31, section 2, sub-section 2, which is as follows:\u2014\n\"2. Whenever damage is caused to property, by a fire started by a railway locomotive working on the railway, His Majesty, whether his officers or servants have been guilty of negligence or not, shall be liable for such damages: Provided that, if it is shewn that modern and efficient appliances have been used and that the officers or servants of His Majesty have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence, the total amount of compensation recoverable under this subsection shall not exceed five thousand dollars, and it shall be apportioned among the parties who suffered the loss as the court or judge determines.\"\nThe suppliant's property was destroyed by a fire alleged, and found by the judgment appealed against, to have originated from an engine operating on the Intercolonial Railway at Bathurst, N.B., the sparks from said engine setting fire to the roof of a freight shed adjoining the track and spreading to the property so destroyed. There was evidence, and the Exchequer Court judge found, that this roof was in a defective state. It was also shewn that it had, on several previous occasions, caught fire in the same way, and on most of such occasions the government officials were notified, but only patched it up where it was burned, without repairing it properly.\nThe suppliant claimed $17,000, damages, but the trial judge held that the engine causing the damage was furnished with modern and efficient appliances; that there was no proof that the officers or servants of the government had been \"otherwise guilty of negligence\" within the meaning of the Act above mentioned; and that the damages should, therefore, be limited to $5,000. The suppliant appealed against this assessment of damages.\nTeed K.C. and Knowlton, for the appellant. Under the first clause of sub-section 2 of the section in question the Crown is liable to unlimited damages in case of injury by fire from an engine operating on its railway, and must bring itself within the saving clause to get the advantage of the limitation. See Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Railway Co. v. Barker[2]; Red Mountain Railway Co. v. Blue[3].\nAny negligence of the officers or servants of the Crown contributing to the injury will deprive it of the benefit of the saving clause, and in this case there was negligence in leaving the roof of the freight shed in such a condition that it would act as a fire trap.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent. The failure to repair the roof was mere non-feasance for which the Crown is not liable. Leprohon v. The Queen[4]; Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[5].\nThe term \"otherwise guilty of negligence\" in the sub-section means negligence in the operation of the engine and not negligence generally. Teed K.C. and Knowlton, for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree to allow this appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the construction to be given to section 2, ch. 31 of the Statutes of Canada, 1908.\nSub-section 1 of that section declares the duty of the officers and servants of King with respect to keeping and maintaining the cleared land or right of way free from combustible materials.\nSub-section 2 relates solely to a fire started by a railway locomotive working on the railway. It creates first an absolute liability for damages caused thereby without limitation as to amount. The proviso introducing the limitation upon the extent of liability enacts that two things must be shewn to get the benefit of that limitation; one that \"modern and efficient appliances have been used\"; the other \"that the officers and servants have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence.\" As to the first provision required, the user of modern and efficient appliances, it relates surely only to the particular railway locomotive causing the fire although those words of limitation are not inserted in the clause. No reasonable construction can extend the words beyond. Any proof offered of the user of \"modern and efficient appliances\" otherwise than with reference to the particular locomotive would be foreign to the question to be tried. So with regard to the second provision requiring proof that the officers and servants have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence. The word \"otherwise\" obviously refers to negligence in the manner of using these modern and efficient appliances. You must have the appliances called for by the statute first. Secondly, you must negative any negligence in their user. \"Otherwise\" cannot in the connection in which it is used apply to negligence of officers and servants not in any way directly concerned in seeing that only proper appliances are used or that, when supplied, they are properly used. It does not seem reasonable to extend the word to embrace negligence of officers or servants not directly concerned with the one dominant idea controlling the enactment. That idea is to impose liability upon the railway for damages caused by fires started by inefficient or negligently operated railway locomotives working on the. road. The railway must in any event provide the best locomotives, and they must operate them without negligence. Even when they have so provided and worked their locomotives they must pay for damage up to $5,000 for fires started by locomotives. The damage need not be caused by sparks emitted. It may arise from ashes dropped from the fire box or grate. If carelessly so dropped the damage is unlimited as well as if caused by emitted sparks through the smoke stack.\nIt may be also that the section is open to the construction that negligence in the performance of the duty enjoined in section 1 of keeping the road-bed clear would entail unlimited liability in case of fire started by a locomotive on such combustible material. Mr. Chrysler seemed rather at the close of his argument to avoid combatting the contention that it was so open.\nAs the point is one not necessary for us to determine in this case I would not express any opinion upon it. As I cannot agree to the construction that the negligence spoken of in the section extends to negligence arising out of the condition of the roof of the station building which caught fire I think this appeal must be dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant having brought an action in the Exchequer Court for damages sustained by reason of a fire which destroyed his buildings was awarded only the sum of $3,284.67 though the actual loss is claimed to have been $17,500.00.\nThe action is founded upon 7 & 8 Edw. VII. ch. 31, section 2, sub-section 2, enacted the 3rd April, 1908, which is as follows:\u2014\n2. Wherever damage is caused to property, by a fire started by a railway locomotive working on the railway, His Majesty, whether his officers or servants have been guilty of negligence or not, shall be liable for such damages: Provided that, if it is shewn that modern and efficient appliances have been used and that the officers or servants of His Majesty have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence, the total amount of compensation recoverable under this subsection shall not exceed five thousand dollars, and it shall be apportioned among the parties who suffered the loss as the court or judge determines.\nThe learned trial judge finds that in fact the fire was started by a railway locomotive working on the respondent's railway setting fire to the shingles on the roof of the freight shed of the said railway at Bathurst, and spreading thence to the appellant's hotel about one hundred and twenty-five feet distant.\nThe liability to pay, as above provided, five thousand dollars distributable amongst the sufferers is not denied save by the objection made by the respondent's counsel, that as the fire caught first on the roof and spread thence it cannot be said to have been started by the locomotive. This statement of the sequence of events presents all there is in the argument for such a view and seems to be met by the plain language of the Act. Such subsidiary argument in support of this objection as was attempted to be drawn from the history of cognate legislation and changes therein seems worthless when we find such changes actually remove the obscurity existent in the prior legislation which might, if at all relevant, have lent a slight colour to some such contention.\nThe arguable ground taken by the learned trial judge that whilst the Act clearly creates a liability on the facts he finds the damages must as a whole be limited to the sum of five thousand dollars, is, I take it, the real ground of resistance to the appeal,\nBut when the liability is created by the main part of the sub-section, and by words plainly unlimited, we must see if and how far the respondent is brought within the excepting proviso before we can lessen the responsibility primarily created.\nThere are just two things expressed as foundation for excuse or relief. Both must exist.\nOne is that modern and efficient appliances have been used.\nI take it as tolerably clear from the language used and the common knowledge of and the history of the risks of fire from the sparks or cinders emitted from the fire necessarily incident to the use of locomotives that the appliances referred to are such as relate to the construction and use of the locomotive, and which may reduce such risks to a minimum.\nIt is found by the learned trial judge that such appliances were used and that factor is out of the case. The second requirement to ensure immunity beyond the limit named is \"that the officers or servants of His Majesty have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence.\"\nOne or two observations seem necessary in regard to the purpose and effect of this requirement. I submit, with respect, it has been misapprehended by the learned trial judge.\nIn the first place it is, I repeat, the first part of the sub-section that alone creates the liability.\nIt is not negligence that is the foundation of the obligation at all.\nTrue there may have been negligence which promoted the emission of the sparks.\nBut whether negligence existed or not a new liability is created, and expressly covers primarily all damages caused to property by fire started by a locomotive in use.\nPreviously to this enactment there was no liability on the part of the respondent for such claims as this, no matter how much due to the negligence of respondent's servants.\nAnd this new sub-section does not attempt directly to create a new liability by directly resting it upon negligence.\nHeretofore the only legal claim against the Crown for damages caused to property by negligence was that to property on a public work, and expressly founded upon negligence.\nThis sub-section was to remedy that gross evil endured so long.\nIt was, no doubt, intended, and I think manifestly intended to put an end to such a state of things.\nIt is impossible to conceive when this is rightly apprehended that the negligence in this sub-section referred to and had in view was some actionable negligence. The people for whom and their property in respect of which a remedy was needed were not on but beyond the pale of the public work, and absolutely without remedy. Actionable negligence in their relations to the Crown, in such regard had no existence.\nTo assume actionable negligence as alone that which is meant in this proviso (when and where no such thing exists) is to render the word and term of the proviso a useless absurdity. We must give it a meaning; and giving that conformable to the fundamental rule of its plain ordinary meaning is enough.\nBearing all these considerations in mind, I submit the language of this sub-section is as clear and comprehensive as when read grammatically it is, and doubtless was, intended to be.\nThe justice of it is manifest. If the servants of the Crown have used proper appliances and not been negligent in, or in respect of, any of these things that may have been conducive to the injury suffered from the working or use of the locomotive, he suffering must bear the inevitable result of such use which is needful for the common good.\nOn the other hand, if it is not the inevitable, after due care has been taken, which has happened, the consequences must fall where they in justice properly belong.\nAt the same time, as a matter of expediency, the loss arising from the inevitable has to the limited sum named been imposed with a view to distributing part of the burthen of the loss. As to the absolute justice of this part of the remedy, opinions may differ, but as to the other, it embodies such absolute justice, we should see it is not weakened in any way.\nLet us apply this reasoning to this case.\nThe roof of the freight house which caught fire that spread to the appellant's property and destroyed it was very old; of shaky and curled up shingles; precisely the sort of thing to catch fire and spread it.\nIt caught fire seemingly from the use of respondent's locomotive on three different occasions within the seven weeks immediately preceding that of the 25th of May occurrence, now in question. Remonstrances of a most vigorous kind were made on one or more of these occurrences with the local officers of the road, and the need for a new roof pointed out, and these representations apparently were transmitted to proper authority. Beyond patching up, once or twice, some of the holes burnt in this \"fire trap\" by each fire, we do not hear of a single step having been taken, to watch, to warn, to guard, or to protect property in the neighbourhood, against such manifest danger of fire being started by respondent's working locomotives.\nIf that is not clear negligence within the plain words used and a breach of this condition that the statute requires to be observed by the officers and servants of the Crown to procure relief from the consequences of starting a fire I am unable to understand how grossly His Majesty's servants and officers must offend before their conduct can be called negligent. Nor do I think we have to find out and accurately determine which man is to blame or what degree of authority he had.\nSome one could have stopped the train if need be. Some one could have done something. No one did anything. Some one near at hand ought to have had the care assigned him of meeting such an emergency, and if there was not such an one, that was negligence.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Cassels that there may be in law no duty to one's neighbour to keep a roof in repair.\nThere is, however, a duty not to set it on fire when there is a risk of the fire going to the neighbour's property. His Majesty's servants and officers have been long enough exempt from blame on that score. It was high time such a state of things should end. We must now, I submit, see to it that the scandal has ended; if possible, forever,\nIt was also argued that the negligence referred to in the proviso of this second sub-section must have reference to the negligence legislated against in the first sub-section.\nThe first sub-section stood substantially as it reads now in the Act for a long time before the second was enacted.\nIt gave no express right of action; and of such use as it was in the way of protecting any one in respect of his property, that was given by another Act, but confined to property on the railway.\nThis new sub-section is for the express purpose of protecting people in respect of property off or beyond the railway. In regard to this latter class the first sub-section was of no more use than a painted image.\nIt has, though accidentally brought near to the other, neither grammatical nor necessary legal relation to the subject matter most directly dealt with by the new sub-section. Yet it may hereafter be of some use in relation to the subject matters dealt with by the latter, as for example, in a case where the facts may evoke its use to help but not necessarily to determine whether or not in a limited number of that class of cases, negligence has existed.\nIt is, however, entirely beyond the range of what we have to deal with in this case unless significance is to be given to the transposition of words which took place in it when the new sub-section was enacted and added meaning given by the words \"other unnecessary combustible material.\"\nIt seems, I fear, impossible, having regard to the ejusdem generis rule, to use these added words or the whole sub-section, either to help or hinder the application of a unique new law, which by the second subsection is brought into force over an old barbaric field yet untouched by law, and is not and does not profess in a legal sense any amendment of old law requiring us to fit the old and new.\nIf, however, the added words \"unnecessary combustible material\" in the first sub-section can be read as substantial change then they would cover this very case, Which I do not think legally possible, though perhaps intended so by some one.\nAnother argument suggested was that the negligence mentioned in this proviso might be something not covered by modern appliances, but yet relative to the locomotive or its use or management.\nI am unable to agree in this. Indeed I am unable to quite comprehend its application or that of the nonfeasance rule to this case, for the most obvious negligence in this case is the unguarded use of the locomotive in such a place, and under such dangerous conditions as had been amply demonstrated to exist to the knowledge of the officers of the road (as the learned judge remarked during the trial) whilst no means taken to guard against the consequences of a fourth setting of fire, by its use. It may be possible, by calling things names to indicate passivity instead of activity, to frame an apparently logical, legal proposition that would justify running a train across a half-broken bridge or a locomotive emitting sparks beside a magazine when left wide open and filled with gunpowder. I cannot assent thereto.\nI observe the learned judge anticipated a reference if any need arose to fix the amount of the damages and hence we have no other alternative then direct it. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs, and a judgment entered accordingly directing a reference to ascertain the damages done appellant's property by the fire in question, for executing such a judgment of reference, and the findings thereon and reservation of costs of the reference to be disposed of by the judge of the Exchequer Court.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the enactment in question was designed with a view to making the remedy against the Crown available to persons suffering loss of property by reason of fires started from locomotives on government railways co-extensive with that enjoyed by them under the \"Railway Act\" as against a railway company in respect of loss caused by fires started from a locomotive on a railway not a government railway.\nI think \"negligence\" in this enactment has the meaning attributed to the word by lawyers \u2014 want of care according to the circumstances. The legislature is obviously speaking of incuria clans locum injurice \u2014 to use Lord Cairns' well-known formula; but I think the burden placed on the defence by the statute is to acquit of any such incuria all His Majesty's officers and servants who in the course of their duty are concerned with the construction or working of a Government railway.\nI cannot entertain any doubt that the maintenance of the station in the condition disclosed by the evidence while engines emitting sparks were constantly passing it was negligence in the sense mentioned. Any reasonably careful person must have seen that it was in the circumstances a source of danger; and the failure to take the necessary measures to prevent that comes clearly, to my thinking, within the language used.\nTo say that there was no duty to repair is merely to beg the question. Nor does it help the matter to describe the default of the department as nonfeasance merely. You cannot properly confine your view to the failure to repair alone; you must take that together with the fact that the station was a part of an operating railway. Moreover, on any strict application of principle the fault charged in this case cannot be described as mere nonfeasance. A private individual or a public body erecting a structure which unless it should be kept in repair would, to the apprehension of reasonable persons, be likely to become a source of danger to property in the neighbourhood would incur an obligation to keep it in repair; and if by reason of the failure to do so the structure should become a nuisance the person or body maintaining it would be responsible as if such person or body had caused the nuisance directly. Pictou v. Geldert[6]. Before the passing of the statute no such liability would have rested upon the Crown in such circumstances; but it was to remedy this grievance that the enactment was passed.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014This action was brought in the Exchequer Court to recover damages from the Crown for the destruction of the suppliant's hotel premises by fire communicated from the freight sheds of the Intercolonial Railway at Bathurst. The learned trial judge found that the fire originated from sparks emitted from an Intercolonial engine, which was \"equipped with all modern and efficient appliances,\" and that it was established that the respondent was not liable for \"negligence in operating an engine defectively equipped.\" The learned judge further found' that the roof of the freight shed was in a defective state of repair, and in such a condition as to make a fire more probable than if it were in good repair. He, however, held that the liability of the respondent was limited to a proper proportion of the sum of $5,000, that being the maximum amount recoverable where\nit is shewn that modern and efficient appliances have been used and that the officers or servants of His Majesty have not otherwise been guilty of negligence (7 & 8 Edw. VII. ch. 31, sec. 2, sub-sec. 2),\nhis opinion apparently being that the only negligence which the statute requires the Crown to negative is negligence consisting in the use of an engine lacking modern and efficient appliances.\nWhatever right of action the plaintiff may have, whether it be for limited or for unrestricted damages, is conferred by the Dominion statute, and the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court under section 20(d), R.S.C. ch. 140, to entertain the suppliant's claim, though questioned by the respondent, is in my opinion incontrovertible.\nI am also of opinion that the application of the statute under which the suppliant claims is not confined to fires directly caused by a locomotive, but extends to fires communicated from buildings in or upon which fire has been started by a locomotive.\nBy this appeal the suppliant seeks judgment for the full amount of damages which he has sustained in lieu of the restricted damages awarded in the Exchequer Court. His right to full damages depends on the construction of the words in the statute\u2014\nthat the officers or servants of His Majesty have not otherwise been guilty of any negligence.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that the very presence of these words following the words, \"if it is shewn that modern and efficient appliances have been used\" makes it clear that they were meant to cover negligence other than the use of an engine lacking modern and efficient appliances. If restricted to such negligence they would have no effect whatever, and would be a wholly unnecessary provision. What other negligence are they meant to cover? In themselves they are broad enough to cover any negligence of any officer or servant of His Majesty which occasioned the damage complained of.\nWhile, as I now read it, I find nothing in the section which would justify restricting the application of this broad and comprehensive language to negligence in the operation of the locomotive, I desire to leave open the question whether other kinds of negligence should or should not be deemed to be included.\nAssuming that the provision should be restricted to negligence in the operation of a locomotive\u2014the narrowest construction of which it can possibly admit, \u2014such negligence has, in my opinion, not been disproved; and the statute puts upon the Crown the burden of disproving it. The evidence shews that within four or five weeks before the occurrence of the fire in question three other fires were started on the roof of the same freight shed in circumstances which leave practically no room for doubt that they also were caused by sparks from passing locomotives. These fires were all duly reported to the proper railway authorities and repairs were from time to time made of the injuries done to the roof on these occasions. There is in evidence a report made by the station agent at Bathurst to the district superintendent at Campbellton that\nthe roof of the shed is in a very bad condition and should be shingled at once or there will be a serious loss some day,\nand it is shewn that upon this report a carpenter was sent to make some repairs. He says:\u2014\nI found the roof\u2014a good many shingles were loose; the wire nails had rotted off between the boards and the shingles, as they always do; and I nailed some of them down; but I did not nail the whole roof. * * * I did not nail down all that required nailing. * * * I think it was very bad.\nThere is no evidence that it was because there was not an appropriation for the purpose or for any other sufficient reason that the roof was not renewed or adequately repaired. Nevertheless, with the roof in this dangerous condition to the knowledge of the responsible officers of the railway, a spark-throwing locomotive was allowed to be operated in immediate proximity to it, and, so far as the evidence discloses, without any instructions being given to take any precaution whatever to prevent fire being thus caused. Not only has the Crown in my opinion failed to shew that there was not negligence in operating the locomotive in these circumstances as it was operated, but, if that be necessary, such negligence is sufficiently established by affirmative evidence. I would, therefore, allow this appeal and would direct judgment for the suppliant for the full amount of damages sustained by him to be ascertained by a reference in the Exchequer Court as indicated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cassels. The suppliant should have his costs of this appeal, and of the action in the Exchequer Court including the costs of the reference.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: M. G.

Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 34 S.C. 388) affirmed.\nPer Idington J.\u2014In the present case the patents were valid.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review[1] at Montreal, by which the judgment of Dunlop J., at the trial[2], was affirmed.\nThe appellants were incorporated, in Canada, for the purpose of purchasing and exploiting two Canadian patents of invention of which the respondents, an American company, were owners. The firm of Stillman & Hall, acting as brokers or agents, were the intermediaries through whom the sale of the patent rights was effected. They obtained an assignment of the patent rights from the American company and afterwards transferred them to the Canadian company. The consideration for which these rights were sold to the Canadian company was $100,000, of which $25,000 was paid in cash and $75,000 in first mortgage bonds of that company. The bonds were handed over to the American company, and, on default in payment, they brought an action to recover $9,870.81 for overdue interest thereon, and, by an admission subsequently filed, credited the Canadian company with $5,653.14, leaving a balance of $4,217.67 due on their claim. The Canadian company pleaded that the patents, on the sale of which the bonds were delivered, were invalid and that there was, therefore, no consideration given for the bonds. By a cross-demand the Canadian company sought to recover back the $5,653.14 which they had paid. They also instituted a separate action against the American company to have the invalidity of the patents declared and the sale and transfer of the patent rights cancelled and set aside for want of consideration; they claimed the return of the $25,000 paid in cash on account of the purchase price and that the bonds should be declared null and void and delivered up for cancellation. The firm of Stillman & Hall were made parties to the latter action, as were likewise the Montreal Trust and Deposit Company, the trustees for the bondholders, and the bonds were attached by means of a conservatory order. Stillman & Hall appeared to the action and submitted themselves to justice. The American company pleaded that there was no privity of contract between them and the Canadian company in regard to the sale of the patent rights; that they had sold direct to Stillman & Hall who, in turn, had sold, to the Canadian company, and that there was no warranty as to the validity of the patents. At the trial, Dunlop J. entered a judgment for the balance of $4,217.67 in the action by the American company, and dismissed the cross-demand and the action by the Canadian company. By the judgment appealed from, the Court of Review confirmed these judgments but on different grounds, the question as to the validity of the patents not being considered, and it was held that there was no privity of contract between the American and Canadian companies and that there had been no warranty as to the validity of the patents.\nAtwater K.C. and Duclos K.C. appeared for the appellants.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice and Girouard J. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the court below.\nDavies J.\u2014One of the grounds upon which Archibald J., speaking for the Court of Review, dismissed this appeal substantially was that, in the absence of special language in the assignment of a patent or of special circumstances giving rise to an implication of warranty, there is in law no such implication of warranty of the indefeasibility of the patent arising out of its assignment. There was no special language in the assignment in this appeal and no special circumstances which could give rise to any such implied warranty. On the contrary the language in the assignment from the respondents to Stillman & Hall only purports to transfer \"all the right, title and interest\" of the assignors, while the assignment from Stillman & Hall to the appellants is an ordinary one containing no special language whatever.\nOn this ground and for the reasons given by Archibald J. in support of it, I would, without expressing any opinion upon the validity of the patents, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the patents in question herein are both valid.\nIt is therefore unnecessary for me to follow the several other matters dealt with at such length in argument.\nNor do I see any useful purpose I can serve by following at great length the question of the validity of these patents.\nThe subject can be made a wide one. The mazes we are invited in this case to follow, by some of the quotations, snatched from their surroundings in cases that had come under the adjudication of some of the highest authorities, ought to warn us.\nWe have, amongst others, an apparent quotation, accidentally no doubt attributed to Lord Cairns, which was not his production at all, but a deduction of Lord Davey from what Lord Cairns had said.\nI am not quite sure whether or not that master mind would have adopted it as amplified and I submit extended.\nNor am I quite sure that other high authorities would subscribe to and find applicable to this case arising on our statute some of the quotations given and attributed respectively to each of them.\nOur statute defines what is patentable. I am not clear that the ground it covers is identical with that portion of the Royal Prerogative reserved and preserved by statute as the foundation in England for grants of the like kind of rights.\nInvaluable as is the long line of authority moulding the limits of the latter basis for a grant we must not forget that the basis here rests upon an express statutory limitation, not by any means quite identical with the other.\nThese different foundations for grants of patents are liable to produce and perhaps are producing widely different results.\nOur statute provides for a patent issuing to\nany person who has invented any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement in any art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter which was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof and which has not been in public use or on sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof, etc.\nApply this to the Lina Schuler patent and we have to find in her specification a description of some new \"manufacture or composition of matter\" which will answer thereto as that is the only one of the several subjects given which may cover it.\nIt is admitted the composition need not be a chemical, but may be a mechanical one. Yet stress is laid on the objection that it is claimed in a solidified form. When the necessity for a chemical composition is abandoned I fail to comprehend this objection. It is explained in evidence how it operates when brought in contact with heat and how the consequent dissolution of each element varying in length of time and shape of results helps to supplement and aid the action of the other.\nIt is obvious that the reduction to a fluid state at that stage of its existence before use and up to a certain point of use might render or be supposed to render the composition less effective.\nIt is equally obvious that this reduction may be permissible in an attempt to apply the material to any substance preparatively and in anticipation of heat reaching it.\nNo composition of matter can of itself and without some directing intelligence avail anything.\nIt is objected that the mere discovery of some natural law is not patentable and the high authority of Lord Lindley is cited in one of these inapt quotations I have referred to.\nWhen we have regard to the fact that he illustrated his meaning by reference to Volta's discovery of the effect of an electric current from the battery upon a frog's leg its relevance here is not quite apparent.\nThis claim to invention is not of that nature at all; yet the other alternative is with curious inconsistency put in argument against this patentee's claim that it does not disclose any discovery but uses things and principles of action therein already discovered.\nThat process or combination of such processes of reasoning would, if logically extended, destroy any patent for or in relation to composition of matter.\nThe appellant is on safer ground when attacking the claim to novelty in this case.\nThe allusion in the course of the trial to the chemical discoveries of Gay-Lussac fell short for want of any allusion in the report thereof to this combination claimed here.\nThe article in the Journal of the Society of Arts in 1859 came nearer, but for obvious reasons seems to have been abandoned before us.\nThe bald nature of the claim was much and rightly pressed upon our consideration. It seems to me we must, as in regard to all other documents of this kind, in order to understand the claim, read the whole specification.\nAnd when we do that the claim appears clear enough I think.\nMeaning is thus given to the words \"in about the proportions specified.\"\nIt would have been unwise to lay down any proportionate line requiring the observance of absolute mathematical precision for mixing the composition. Indeed, it might have rendered the workability of the process an impossibility and thus have been self-destructive.\nHowever that may be, the substantial nature of what is to be done and adhered to is clear enough I think.\nThe objections taken to the other patent of Bachert and O'Neill seem to be, if they mean anything, that which would logically deprive any one applying for a process patent of the right to use common knowledge in working out the design intended.\nIt does not seem to me that the using of all this common knowledge that appears resorted to would have enabled any ordinary man, possessed of the same and ordinarily skilled in the subject, to turn such knowledge as of course and without some inventive faculty to account in the way these patentees have done.\nI think, assuming all that has been urged on us, that real inventive faculty is shewn.\nWhat Lord Cairns in fact did say in the case of Harrison v. The Anderston Foundry Company[3], is herein helpful and most instructive, and especially so when we have regard to the matters to be solved relative to these objections to this latter patent.\nAnd the amplification and extension thereof made and applied by Lord Davey relying thereon in the case of Patent Exploitation Ltd. v. Siemens Bros. & Co.[4], where he says,\nthe combination itself constitutes the novelty and merit of the invention. It is sufficient for the validity of the patent if the combination, being the result of thought and experience, is new, and produces some new result or an old result in a more useful and beneficial way,\nmay well be applied as to both patents here in question.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014In the absence of some language or some surrounding circumstances indicating a contrary intention the parties to the assignment of a patent of invention are, I think, presumed to be selling and buying such rights only as the letters patent themselves conferred upon the patentee. If, for want of novelty in the alleged invention, or upon other grounds, it should happen that the letters patent did not operate to vest in the patentee the monopoly it proposed to create, the assignor is presumed to have said caveat emptor. This presumption\u2014which is really the basis of the English rule upon the subject \u2014 is no artificial rule, but arises inevitably from considering the transaction in the way in which mercantile contracts must be considered for the purpose of arriving at the intention of the parties in a particular event respecting which they have made no express stipulation, there being no specific rule of law applicable, viz.: of assuming that the parties both intended to stipulate what was fair and reasonable having regard to the character of the transaction and the subject-matter dealt with. Looking at such a transaction in this way the question is: What would the parties, as reasonable business men, be expected to stipulate as to the burden of the risk of attack if the point should be raised during the negotiations? Nobody can doubt that in the absence of special circumstances, unless the matter was not to be made the subject of a special bargain involving a special consideration moving to the vendor, the parties to the sale of a Canadian patent would agree that the risk should be borne by the vendee.\nThe judgment of Archibald J. demonstrates, I think, that this is the rule in force in the Province of Quebec.\nAnglin J.\u2014A perusal of the documents and correspondence filed as exhibits has satisfied me that it is not possible to interfere with the finding of the Court of Review that Stillman & Hall, Limited, did not act as agents for the respondents, as the appellants allege, but were in fact purchasers from the respondents and vendors to the appellants of the Canadian patents in question. If there were any agency on the part of Stillman & Hall, Limited, the correspondence, with the exception of one letter, Exhibit Dl, is more consistent with their having been agents of the appellants in these transactions than with their having been, as the appellants contend, agents for the respondents. But the transactions themselves took the form of a sale from the American company to Stillman & Hall and a resale from Stillman & Hall to the Canadian company for a different and a much larger consideration, effected by a contract involving other matters to which the larger consideration also related. No adequate or satisfactory explanation why the transactions should have assumed this form, if Stillman & Hall acted merely as brokers, is given by the appellants or by the witnesses who assert that there was a direct sale from the American company to the Canadian company through Stillman & Hall acting as agents for the former.\nHaving regard to the nature of and the circumstances attending the transaction, there is nothing in the facts, that the cheque of the Canadian company in their favour was immediately indorsed over by Stillman & Hall to the American company and that the bonds in question remained in the possession of Stillman & Hall only for a few hours and were then handed over by them to the American company, inconsistent with their having been in fact purchasers from the American company and vendors to the Canadian company.\nThe evidence of Mr. Stillman asserting that Stillman & Hall acted as agents for the American company is flatly contradicted by Mr. Pressinger, who says that in no sense did Stillman & Hall act as agents for the American company, and, again contradicting Mr. Stillman, that no commission was paid to Stillman & Hall by the American company.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge that Stillman & Hall were in fact agents for the American company does not rest upon the credibility of the witnesses whose testimony he heard, but is an inference drawn by him from the admitted facts and the documents in evidence. The proper inference on this question the Court of Review was in quite as favourable a position to draw as was the trial judge. I am therefore of opinion that the finding of the Court of Review that there is no lien de droit, or privity of contract, between the appellants and the respondents\/ which entitles the former to plead failure of consideration or breach of warranty as a defence to the claim of the latter, should be maintained.\nI also agree in the conclusion of the Court of Review that on an ordinary mere assignment of a patent, and in this case a fortiori having regard to the form of the respondents' contract, which imports merely a sale of \"all the right, title and interest\" of the vendors, the invalidity of the patents, if established, would not amount to such a total failure of consideration, or breach of implied warranty of title as would enable the appellants to resist the claim of the respondents for payment according to the tenor of the bonds held by them. Only proof of fraud would entitle the appellants in the circumstances of this case to relief on these grounds; and of fraud there is not a scintilla of evidence.\nThe sale and the assignments of the patents by the respondents took place in New York and were made to a New Jersey corporation. The construction of the contract of sale and of the assignments is therefore governed by the law of one or other of these States. Upon a personal examination of the authorities I find that the law in both these States in regard to the effect of an assignment of patents appears to be the same as the law of England. Caveat emptor is the rule which obtains. The leading American cases are collected in Walker on Patents (4 ed.), secs. 283-4. The leading English authorities will be found in Terrell on Patents (4 ed.), pp. 214 et seq., and Frost on Patents (3 ed.), Vol. 2, pp. 118 et seq. But the fact of the similarity of the law of the States of New York and New Jersey to that of England was not proved as it should have been by expert, evidence. In the absence of such evidence, however, there is a presumption, on which the Court of Review may have proceeded, that the foreign law applicable to any contract with which the court is called upon to deal is similar to the lex fori.\nIf the question under consideration were the validity of the patents or their assignability I should have no hesitation in holding that, although this action was tried in a civil court of the Province of Quebec, the lex fori applicable was that of England. As pointed out by Archibald J., the patent law of Lower Canada is English in its origin. See The Ottawa and Hull Power and Manufacturing Co. v. Murphy[5], at page 231,and Bondier v. D\u00e9patie[6], at page 237. \"Patents of invention and discovery\" are enumerated in the 91st section of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" as a subject within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada and that Parliament has legislated with regard to the nature and effect of patents and their assignability. Upon these matters the law is the same in my opinion throughout Canada and so far as it is not declared by Dominion legislation must be determined by the principles of English law as defined in English decisions and in those of our own courts.\nWe are not, however, now dealing with a question of the validity of the patents, of their assignability, or of the efficacy of the assignments executed. The matter under consideration is the proper construction to be given to contracts of sale and assignment. Although the subject-matter of these contracts happens to be patent rights it is difficult to understand on what ground in determining this question of construction the courts of the Province of Quebec, or we as an appellate court for that province, would be justified in disregarding the principles of the civil law.\nThree Quebec cases have been cited to us in each of which it is alleged the invalidity of a patent has been held to be a good defence to an action to recover the consideration or part of the consideration for its sale. These cases are D\u00e9ry et al. v. Hamel[7]; Perrault v. Normandin[8]; and Almour v. Cable[9]. In the first case the court found in the document of assignment \"une description qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une garantie.\" In the second, the sale was not of a patent but of a pretended secret process. In the third case the Court of King's Bench held\nthat the appellant has proved that no value was given for the promissory note sued upon in this case and that the pretended patent right sold to the appellant was not for any new or useful invention.\nThese appear to be two distinct findings. The court does not assign as its reason for holding that there was no value given for the note the other fact found that the patent was not for a new and useful invention. The report of the case is exceedingly meagre and it may well be that the court deemed the conduct of the respondents fraudulent. I would hesitate to regard this case as an authority for the proposition that upon a bare assignment of patent, in the absence of any evidence of fraud, its invalidity would afford a defence on the ground of a complete failure of consideration or a breach of implied warranty of title.\nTurning from the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec to that of France, there has been no doubt a considerable mass of judicial opinion in support of the proposition that an assignment of a patent does import a warranty of its validity. But in France the doctrine of the civil law on this question appears to be in a state of mutation. According to the opinions of such distinguished modern writers as Pouillet (Brevets d'Invention, 4 ed., pp. 246-7, 250), Allart and Pataille, cited by Pouillet and referred to by Archibald J., in the Court of Review and by counsel for the respondents in their factum, the assignment of a patent does not per se import any warranty of its validity. A contract for the sale of a patent is regarded by these authors as speculative in character, the purchaser acquiring the claim of his vendor for what it may be worth and taking all chances as to its validity. This seems to me to be the true view of the nature of the contracts here in question.\nLooking at the matter in the light of what should, I think, be deemed common knowledge\u2014that upon the sale of a patent right the real subject of sale is the vendor's claim to the exclusive rights which the patent, if valid, gives to him, and that the purchaser acquires that claim knowing that it is subject to attack and that the patent itself carries no guarantee of validity\u2014the \"thing sold,\" in the case of the ordinary assignment of patent rights, should in my opinion be deemed to be not a patent impliedly warranted valid but the claim of the vendor, be it good or bad, for what it may be worth. That this is the true subject of sale is in my opinion indisputable where, as here, the assignment is not of the patent itself, but of all the \"right, title and interest\" of the assignor therein.\nMoreover, it is highly desirable, inasmuch as the validity of patents, their assignability and the form in which assignments may be made are subjects of Dominion legislation, that upon such an incident of the assignment of a patent as the implication of a warranty of its validity the lex fori throughout Canada should be the same. In my opinion, in view of the opinions of French authors to which I have referred, it may be held to be the same; and, whether we look to the civil law to ascertain the proper construction of the assignments of patents here in question because this action was brought in the courts of Quebec, or to the principles of English law for the reason suggested by Archibald J., that the patent law administered in Quebec is English in its origin, the result will be the same.\nI therefore agree with the conclusion of the Court of Review, that invalidity of the patents, if established, would not amount either to a failure of consideration or to a breach of warranty which would serve as a defence to this action.\nIn the view I have taken it is unnecessary to express an opinion upon the validity of the patents. But I do not wish it to be understood that I have formed a view adverse to the respondents on this question.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Atwater, Dados, Bond & Meagher.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Foster.

Davies and Anglin JJ contra.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard and Duff JJ.\u2014The provisions of sub-section (ft) of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d are ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada which directed the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to grant the same facilities in regard to passenger rates and service to the citizens of Mount Royal Ward, in the City of Montreal, as were given to the residents of an adjacent municipality, to enter into arrangements with the appellants to carry the order into effect, and ordering the appellants to enter into the necessary agreements.\nThe City of Montreal, on 1st February, 1909, lodged a complaint with the Board of Railway Commissioners against the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company (which operates a tramway subject to the authority of the Parliament of Canada, confined within the limits of the Island of Montreal), alleging, amongst other things, that that company refused to place the citizens residing in Mount Royal Ward, in the City of Montreal, on the same footing as those of the Town of Notre Dame de Gr\u00e2ce and the Town of Outremont, municipalities of which the boundaries are contiguous to the City of Montreal, and complaining of the rates charged for the carriage of passengers in the service and operation of the tramway. At the time of the complaint, and for some time previously, the Montreal Park and Island Railway was connected with the tramway of the appellants, which is a railway authorized by the legislature of the Province of Quebec and subject to its jurisdiction. On the 6th of April, 1909, the Board ordered that the appellants should be made a party in the proceedings before them upon the complaint and to shew cause why they should not join with the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company in establishing a through route and through rates for the service in the operation of their tramway. After hearing the parties upon the application, the Board, on the 4th of May, 1909, made the order now appealed from, of which the operative part was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cIt is ordered that the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company be and it is hereby directed to grant the same facilities in the way of services and operation, including the rates to be charged by it, to the people residing in the said Mount Royal Ward that it grants to the people residing in the Town of Notre- Dame de Gr\u00e2ce; and that it forthwith enter into the necessary agreements for the purpose of removing the said unjust discrimination; and that, with respect to through traffic over the Montreal Street Railway, the Montreal Street Railway Company be and it is hereby required to enter into any agreement or agreements that may be necessary to enable the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to carry out the provisions of this order.\u201d\nThe appellants contended that, upon the true construction of section 8 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d and of sections 91 and 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d the Board had no jurisdiction over their tramway; and that, being a provincial corporation operating a provincial tramway only in the Island of Montreal and, having no connections with any railway or tramway outside the Province of Quebec, neither their company nor their tramway was subject to the provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act,\u201d nor to the jurisdiction of the Board.\nSpecial leave to appeal was granted, under the provisions of section 56 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d by Mr. Justice Duff, on the question\u2014\n\u201cWhether, upon a true construction of sections 91 and 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d and of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of Canada, the Montreal Street Railway Company are subject, in respect to through traffic with the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\u201d\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and F. Meredith K.C. (Hague with them), for the appellants.\nAtwater K.C. and Butler for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree with my brother Duff.\nIf the incidental or ancillary rule is to be applied in a case like this, then the power of the provincial legislatures under section 92, sub-section 10, of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d with regard to local railways is simply wiped out. To-day the question may be only the transportation of persons tomorrow it may involve the carriage of goods and even perishable articles and, as a consequence, the supply of refrigerators, cars, cold storage warehouses, switching and stations.\nI think the appeal of the Montreal Street Railway Company should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014Appeal from an order of the \u201cBoard of Railway Commissioners respecting \u201cthrough freight.\u201d\nThe \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d in the distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion Parliament and provincial legislatures expressly excepts, in section 92, from the class of \u201clocal works and undertakings\u201d assigned to provincial legislatures, in addition to those undertakings which connected one of the provinces with another or which extended beyond the limits of the province and others specifically described, the following\u2014\nsub-section (c)\u2014such works as although wholly situate within the province are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada, etc.\nSection 91 confers on the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority over all classes of subjects so expressly excepted from section 92.\nThe Montreal Park and Island Railway originally constructed under a provincial charter was such a work, and, being declared by Parliament to be \u201cfor the general advantage of Canada\u201d became a Dominion railway subject in all respects to the legislative powers of the Dominion Parliament and, as a consequence, to the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906, ch. 37. Section 8 of that Act reads as follows: \u2014\nEvery railway, steam or electric street railway or tramway, the construction or operation of which is authorized by special Act of the legislature of any province, and which connects with or crosses or may hereafter connect with or cross any railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall, although not declared. by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, be subject to the provisions of this Act relating to,\u2014\n(a) The connection or crossing of one railway or tramway with or by another, so far as concerns the aforesaid connection or crossing;\n(b) The through traffic upon a railway or tramway and all matters appertaining thereto;\n(c) Criminal matters, including offences and penalties; and\n(d) Navigable waters;\nProvided that, in the case of railways owned by any provincial government, the provisions of this Act with respect to through traffic shall not apply without the consent of such government.\nThe Montreal Park and Island Railway at the time or shortly after it became a Dominion undertaking or work, was or became physically connected with the Montreal Street Railway, which is a provincial road operating under a provincial charter, and part of the Montreal Park and Island Railway line was leased to and other parts operated by the Montreal Street Railway Company, under a somewhat complicated traffic arrangement between the two companies, involving running rights by each company\u2019s cars over the other lines and the leasing of some of the Montreal Street Railway Company\u2019s cars to the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company. At the time the application was made to the Board of Railway Commissioners the physical connection of the two roads existed and passengers were carried directly over one road to and over the other under such traffic agreement and running rights. The carriage of passengers is declared by paragraph 31 of section 2 to be included in the word \u201ctraffic\u201d whenever used in the Act.\nThe 317th section of the Act confers the amplest powers upon the Board of dealing with the traffic upon railways and expressly includes \u201cthrough traffic\u201d and through rates.\nThe question we have to decide is whether or not the Montreal Street Railway by reason of its physical connection with the Montreal Park and Island Railway and the traffic arrangements before referred to are amenable and subject to the jurisdiction of the Board with respect to \u201cthrough traffic\u201d passing from the Montreal Park and Island Railway over its line and vice vers\u00e0,\nA distinction was attempted to be made at the argument between the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over through traffic on a federal road which was interprovincial and that over a road which though federal was wholly within the limits of a province.\nThe appellants contended that section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d should be limited in its application to such provincial railways as connect either directly or indirectly with lines extending beyond the limits of the province and as the Montreal Street Railway was not so connected the. section could not be made applicable to them.\nFor myself I fail to appreciate the distinction suggested. If the physical connection of a provincial railway with a federal interprovincial railway brought the former road under and subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners so far as through traffic passing over it and the federal railway was concerned it seems to me that the same result must follow if such federal railway happened to be itself confined within provincial limits. It is not the physical limits alone of the railway which gives Parliament legislative jurisdiction over it. If the railway connects one province with another or extends beyond the limits of a province it comes within the exception (a) of subsection 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and if being wholly within the limits of a province it is declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for \u201cthe general advantage of Canada\u201d it comes within the exception (c) of that sub-section.\nIn either case and in both cases alike when an undertaking or work is brought within such exceptions it becomes subject to the exclusive legislation of the Dominion, and I fail altogether to understand how it can be held that the physical connection of a provincial road with one of such federal roads, would operate to give the Board of Railway Commissioners jurisdiction over the through traffic over it and not to do so in the case of such connection with the other federal road. The mere accident that the federal road in one case is confined to a single province and in the other runs beyond the provincial boundary cannot determine the question. That must surely depend upon whether or not it is a federal road carrying \u201cthrough traffic\u201d over a provincial one quite irrespective of its limits within or without a province.\nThen it is admitted that with respect to such \u201cthrough traffic\u201d the provincial legislature has not the jurisdiction to legislate. If in such case the Dominion Parliament has not jurisdiction then such jurisdiction does not exist anywhere, and we would have the curious anomaly existing of an enormous class of traffic known as \u201cthrough traffic\u201d being carried over two roads, one federal and one provincial, without either Parliament or the legislature having jurisdiction over such through traffic. Such a condition is, it seems to me, in view of the construction heretofore placed upon the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d impossible. The power to legislate with regard to such through traffic rests somewhere. So far as the federal or Dominion road is concerned it undoubtedly rests with the Dominion Parliament, but to exercise such power effectively the Board of Railway Commissioners to whom it has been given by Parliament must necessarily have some jurisdiction over the provincial road with which the federal one is physically connected. Such jurisdiction of course goes no further than the control of \u201cthrough freight\u201d renders necessary. In my opinion it goes that far. Parliament does not possess, as was suggested, a concurrent authority with the provincial legislature to control this through traffic. If as I have argued it has authority to legislate at all on the subject under the exception to sub-section 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d it has exclusive authority. Assuming there was a domain in which the legislation of the Dominion and of the province might overlap then if the Dominion alone has legislated or if both Dominion and province have legislated and the two legislations conflict that of the Dominion must prevail. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General of Canada[1], at page 68, and City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2], at page 58. In the present case it seems to me that when Parliament legislated the field with respect to \u201cthrough traffic\u201d was covered. Section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d clearly deals with just such a case as this and if intra vires must of course govern. That it necessarily deals with property and civil rights or other matters assigned by section 92 to provincial legislation is no argument against its validity. If it is legislation to the effective exercise of a power exclusively vested in the Dominion or even held to be fairly ancillary to such that is sufficient. The jurisdiction of the legislature over \u201clocal works and undertakings\u201d as over \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d in the province is quite consistent, as said by the Judicial Committee in Toronto Corporation v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[3], at page 59,\nwith a jurisdiction specially reserved to the Dominion in respect of a subject-matter not within the jurisdiction of the province.\nSee also Toronto Corporation v. Bell Telephone Co.[4].\nMy conclusions therefore are that the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d confers jurisdiction upon the Dominion Parliament under the exceptions to section 10 of section 92 to legislate on the subject-matter of \u201cthrough freight.\u201d That legislation has been enacted in section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in terms wide enough to reach the case of \u201cthrough freight\u201d passing from a federal to a provincial road physically connected and that the Board in assuming a jurisdiction over the provincial road for the purpose of giving effect to its order respecting such through freight was acting within its powers.\nI would dismiss the appeal therefore with costs. Idington J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada directed, amongst other things,\nthat with respect to through traffic over the Montreal Street Railway, the Montreal Street Railway Company be, and it is hereby, required to enter into any agreement, or agreements that may be necessary to enable the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to carry out the provisions of this order.\nThe former company now appeals on the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction to make such direction.\nThe appellant is a corporation created by 24 Vict. ch. 84, of the old Province of Canada for the purpose of constructing and operating street railways in the City and Parish of Montreal.\nIts original powers have been many times added to by enactments of the legislature of the Province of Quebec.\nThe manifold details of all these legislative provisions original and supplementary need not be entered into; but we must, I think, observe that from the beginning powers were given to enter into contracts with the said city and adjoining municipalities relative to the construction of the railway, reparation and grading of the streets used, the location of the railway, the time and speed of cars, the amount of license to be paid by the company annually, the amount of fares to be paid by passengers and generally for the safety and convenience of passengers, and the conduct of the company relative to non-obstruction or impeding of the ordinary traffic.\nIts right to fares at all and its entire existence for any useful or profitable purpose depend upon such a contract. Either the contract has been observed or not. If broken the law gives a remedy; and if persistently broken, more than one remedy. Persistent default means forfeiture. If observed, how can Parliament venture to amend it? A step or two in its history unfolds the reason or excuse or peradventure as I conceive proves Parliament never intended such interference.\nThe railway has been changed from having been of the kind served with horse power to that of electric motors, but it has been operated throughout as a street railway for passengers only, since shortly after the company\u2019s incorporation. It never had power to perform other service save in recent years for carrying mails; enlarged by a permission to acquire power (which has not, so far as appears, become effective) from the municipalities, under 6 Edw. VII. ch. 57, sec. 5 (Que.), to carry freight.\nThe Montreal Park and Island Railway Company is a corporation originally incorporated by the legislature of the Province of Quebec by 48 Vict. ch. 74, which Act was also amended by adding further powers.\nIt was of a different character from the other company. It combined the features of a passenger railway with that of hauling freight, and did not depend on the use of streets or highways as the other, but chiefly acquired its rights of way over lands near or adjacent thereto. In short it was a general purpose railway. Merely noting just now these facts and this difference in the character of the roads I will later on refer to the legal results thereof.\nIn 1893, after it had been partly constructed and operated the fact became evident that its services could be made much more beneficial to the public by its arranging with the Street Railway Company to carry, from certain points such of its passengers as desired to reach places served by that road and to which the Montreal Park and Island Railway did not run. Pursuant to section 12 of its charter giving power to do so a traffic arrangement was made with the appellant by a contract between them on the 11th July, 1893, which was to endure for twenty-five years, for the conveyance of passengers through and between the City of Montreal and its suburban municipalities.\nEach was bound by this contract to build and develop its system as specified and thus increase the business the other might thereby expect to reap some benefit from.\nSome cars of the Street Railway Company were to be leased to the other company, but if not enough supplied thus for its own use it might build its own.\nSome of these cars were to be used interchangeably by each company running them over the roads of the other.\nIt followed as travel increased over each road that many cars of each company would not run at all on the other road, but deliver its passengers at its own terminus, or point of junction with the other road.\nFrom each of those who get in the cars that run over the track of the other road an extra fare, but less than the full fare, is exacted.\nFrom each of those unfortunate enough to get on a car confined in its running to the road it belongs to and, getting off that to begin a new journey, full fare may be exacted. It is not pretended in either case that greater fares are exacted than the city contracted for in granting the franchise to run, which is the basis on which the various rights of all concerned rest.\nEach company collects its own fares. The agreement provides for this. Indeed, very likely neither could lawfully do otherwise.\nSome citizens found in all this a grievance, notwithstanding the beneficent effect of the agreement in ameliorating prior conditions sanctioned by the contract of the city made on their behalf. This grievance, along with the other presently to be referred to, was ventilated before the Board.\nIt was the kind of grievance that has at some period or other had to be endured in I think every large city on this continent as the result of civic want of foresight in permitting, without adequate control, more than one company to use the city\u2019s streets.\nIt is not necessary to follow in detail, but yet better to bear in mind, in a general way, how the municipalities in the district of or about Montreal, one after another, created by the same legislature, and authorized by it to do so, each conferred franchises and made bargains to be served respectively by either of these systems.\nRates of travel in each, roughly put at five cents for passing through its own bounds, seem to have formed the basis for such bargains.\nAnnexations of growing suburbs to the rapidly growing city followed (possibly beyond what was expected), and thus the commercial, social and legal problems became day by day more complicated.\nThese companies, however, all the time were (until what I am about to advert to happened) under the control of the legislature of Quebec.\nNot only were they necessarily under such control as corporations created thereby, with \u201cprovincial objects,\u201d but also by virtue of that other exclusive power conferred by the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d sec. 92, sub-sec. 10, on that legislature.\nIt might also be observed that by the same Act the subject of \u201cmunicipal institutions\u201d was assigned to the same exclusive control; and that the purpose of the creation of the appellant was essentially to aid in street travel over highways peculiarly within the control of the respective municipalities, created from time to time by such legislature. These municipalities were also endowed thereby, as no other legislative power could, with the capacity of contracting in such manner as to each might seem meet for its own safety and convenience and for taxation of its street railway companies, being either direct or having relation to the licensing power and license of each by such municipal corporations respectively.\nOne might, if it saw fit, as so many do, adopt the method of exacting as a condition of its concession a pro rata share of the fares or net profits thereof, thinking (if such a word can be used in that connection) to make money thereby.\nAnother (perhaps thinking a little more deeply that such methods might only increase the citizen\u2019s own burdens), might forego the fancied benefit and stipulate instead for a lower fare than the other one which was possibly reaping in its treasury but a small fraction of the increase included in the higher fare.\nI know not whether such varying bargains were made or not. I know that they were possible and probable results of the provincial legislation under which the conditions we have to deal with were created. These facts must not be lost sight of when we try to measure either the purpose or result of the other legislation we have to pass upon.\nCan any one pretend that it is competent for the Dominion Parliament in such a case to meddle at all? The legislature may have been unwise; the municipalities may have been improvident; the condition so created may have been, if you will, intolerable; but the power to rectify it rested in the local legislature or in the existing law governing the civil rights of the parties.\nLet us now turn to see what happened legislatively to even appear to render such interference by Parliament possible. Let us also then examine this legislation now in question and in doing so have due regard to the presumptions, that Parliament can never have intended to invade the rights of any province, or violate the sanctity of any contract or amend the corporate creations of another legislature.\nAfter entering into the above mentioned agreement the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company had itself incorporated by the Parliament of Canada by 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 84, whereby it was so declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. In this very legislation the validity of its then existing contracts with others is recognized and affirmed.\nIt got no powers by such Act of incorporation or by any Act which would constitute it one of either of the classes of works specifically excepted from the operation of sub-section 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d; save within sub-section (5) thereof, that of having been declared to be a work for the advantage of Canada.\nAnd to clear the ground I may as well state neither company fell otherwise within any of such exceptional classes.\nThe relations between the two companies remained the same as fixed by the agreement.\nThe \u201cRailway Act\u201d enacted in 1903 which provided for the constitution of a Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada provided what appears now as section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in the Revised Statutes of 1906, as follows: \u2014\nEvery railway, steam or electric street railway or tramway, the construction or operation of which is authorized by special Act of the legislature of any province, and which connects with or crosses or may hereafter connect with or cross any railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall, although not declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, be subject to the provisions of this Act relating to,\u2014\n(a) The connection or crossing of one railway or tramway with or by another, so far as concerns the aforesaid connection or crossing;\n(b) The through traffic upon a railway or tramway and all matters appertaining thereto;\n(c) Criminal matters, including offences and penalties; and\n(d) Navigable waters; Provided that, in case of railways owned by any provincial government, the provisions of this Act with respect to through traffic shall not apply without the consent of such government.\nIt is upon this section that the Board has founded its order. It was moved thereto by the fact that in 1907 the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company had made a bargain with the municipality of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce, lying beyond Montreal\u2019s limits entirely, to serve its people there with transportation of passengers into Montreal at a five-cent fare, in consideration of receiving a fifty-year franchise from the municipality and exemption from taxation. This the municipality was enabled to give by special legislation of the provincial legislature. The existence of the agreement of the appellant above referred to doubtless helped by its comprehensive nature to enable the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to carry out this bargain.\nIt is conceded that the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.\nIt is attempted to maintain therefore (as if it were a matter of course) that as the result would be to give this district better passenger rates than some other districts there is that unjust discrimination Parliament had in view.\nInasmuch as the only question we have to decide is whether or not the appellant falls within the power of the Board to make the order appealed from, which directs it to remedy this alleged unjust discrimination by abandoning its right under the agreement and entering into some other agreement, I pass no opinion upon whether there in fact is any such discrimination or not.\nIt is urged that as there is in fact that physical connection the agreement provides for and passengers by means thereof pass from one road on to the other there is through traffic, in fact, falling within the meaning of sub-section (b).\nIs that the sort of thing therein meant by \u201cthrough traffic\u201d?\nWas the street railway system of any city or town in Canada supposed to have been within the range of things so legislated about in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d? Was interference thereby with the charters of such roads, the terms of their contracts with the municipalities served, their rates and tolls all dependent on such contracts, and their contracts with each other ever in the contemplation of any one promoting or enacting such legislation?\nI most respectfully submit not. An omnibus line or other means of transportation might as well be held to fall within through traffic if Parliament so willed.\nThe right to deal with these street railways and their proprietors, as to crossings to be made either by them over roads under the jurisdiction of Parliament or by such latter roads over street railways, is undoubtedly vested in Parliament.\nThe right of such a local company, to seek when endowed by its charter with powers to do so, connection of any kind, with the creation of Parliament either physical or limited to the establishment of a through rate or route may also be well within the jurisdiction of Parliament. And I submit the words of the first part of the section and of sub-section (a) can become operative in such cases and thus be given a meaning without doing violence of the kind I have indicated, as obviously is involved in the giving of effect to respondent\u2019s contention.\nSub-section (6) it is urged means something much more than implied in either suggestion. I agree that it may be so for the first part of the section extends to or asserts a jurisdiction over every kind of railway described therein; and uses apt words to cover each class or kind. When however distributing the purpose and limit of the asserted jurisdiction it changes this; and in sub-section (ft) relied upon by the respondent, the words \u201cstreet railway\u201d disappear. It is the through traffic upon a \u201crailway or tramway\u201d that alone is covered thereby. \u201cTramway\u201d by its origin means a freight road. In Britain the term is very commonly extended to cover street railways, but not so here.\nBesides street railways, many local general purpose railways authorized by some special Act of the legislature of a province, may have been had in view.\nI am not called upon to express any opinion of whether or not it would be safe to assume that Parliament in any of these cases could, properly observing the terms of section 92, sub-section 10, of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d assert without the actual or implied sanction of their parent local legislature this jurisdiction over them. I can, however, easily conceive of this legislation having an application thereto that never could have been intended to apply to or render mere street railways subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament.\nNeither the appellant\u2019s origin, history or present conditions lend colour to its being of the class included in sub-section (6) any more than its being in any way related to sub-section (d).\nWe may now turn to section 317 so much relied upon by respondent to define traffic and to bring as a result by virtue of the words \u201cthrough traffic\u201d in subsection (b) appellant within the jurisdiction claimed.\nSection 317 in its whole scope, and in its very language, so clearly relates to a traffic that includes at least carriage of freight as part of the service to be considered that I fail to find therein any encouragement for me to venture to apply it in the sense of aiding the claim set up by respondent.\nWe have no legislative interpretation of the phrase \u201cthrough traffic,\u201d but we have in this Act the following interpretation given of \u201ctraffic\u201d by sub-section 30, of section 2, as follows: \u201cTraffic means the traffic of passengers, goods and rolling stock.\u201d\nThis it is to be observed is not a definition in the disjunctive form necessary to give the effect contended for, by applying the Act to a street railway used only for passengers.\nThe purview of the Act as a whole seems to forbid us interpreting it as if intended to invade needlessly the subjects of either civil rights, or legislative provisions relative to municipal institutions, or the contracts of municipal corporations, or local works and undertakings all of which would be asserted and assisted by a maintenance of this jurisdiction now called in question. I do not deny the possible meaning claimed for these sections, but I would not impute to Parliament in any such case the intention to so enact unless I found it written in the clearest possible language.\nI cannot therefore impute it when the doing so must only rest upon inferences drawn from a section or two exhibiting a general purpose of producing equality in some things relative to certain classes of dealings. Those inferences do not necessarily extend beyond these things over which Parliament has undoubted jurisdiction.\nWhen we are referred to section 317 to find what \u201cthrough traffic\u201d means, let us observe that the section expresses or implies as essential thereto that the Board can create or define it, can insist upon it, and direct the facilities for it and I rather think the accommodations for it also.\nIt seems going very far to draw such extensive powers over provincial legislation and its products, from such a basis as is thus suggested in the classification of transportation, yet it is surely impossible to draw any line between that claimed specifically here and all else thus directly connected with and involved in the proposition. It is not a part but the whole of the subject-matters of and appertaining to through traffic as indicated in the Act which are covered.\nAnother view of this case occurs to me and that is this; assume federal relations and limitations out of the case and all the above recited legislation by both Parliament and legislature to have been enacted by one legislative body and all the contracts and acts done pursuant thereto could it be said in considering such an Act as the \u201cRailway Act\u201d if passed by such a legislature of plenary capacity that it must have been intended thereby to abrogate all such preceding legislation and dissolve everything in municipal and other contracts resting thereupon in the way involved herein? I think not.\nAgain, it is strangely claimed as a basis for the right of interference that an agreement exists which it is claimed provides for through traffic.\nEither the agreement is outside the range of or an infringement of sub-section 7 of section 317.\nIf it can be held to fall within that section then it may be null and void or have become so thereby, but how can that extinction of it become a foundation for the jurisdiction to enforce the making of a new contract and that regardless of the corporate powers to do so?\nBut confirmed, as already pointed out, by Parliament itself, how can the \u201cRailway Act\u201d be held to have been meant to invade the sanctity of a contract thus affirmed?\nIn this regard, possibly section 3 of the Act averts such a result. Neither this view nor that section was put forward in argument.\nBut having regard to the nature of the legislation that takes a step for the express advantage of Canada by declaring the work removed because of that character it seems to me quite arguable and possibly conclusive on the whole issue involved.\nI have thus far proceeded upon the assumption that Parliament properly regarding its constitutional limitations could never have been supposed to have intended what is claimed. I have arrived at the conclusion that its language (though susceptible of such construction) does not necessarily warrant any such assertion of power. Its language must always be read in light of the limits of its constitutional jurisdiction. That language used here when so read is clear, operative, effective and limited. The case, however, was chiefly argued upon the broad question of whether Parliament could or not so deal with appellant, its charter and its contracts as is implied in the maintenance of the part of the order complained of.\nI have no hesitation in saying that in my judgment such legislation by Parliament, as this is claimed to be, against the will of the local legislature creating such corporations as the municipalities, and those others for helping local street travel would be ultra vires, and if this must be held to have such meaning it is ultra vires.\nThe legislative power in relation to those elements of municipal government and all it implies,, \u201clocal works and undertakings\u201d and \u201ccorporations with local objects\u201d together with \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d has been confided exclusively to the local legislatures subject to the checks of the veto, and in regard to local works of their being declared by the Parliament of Canada for the advantage of Canada or two or more provinces thereof and then removed into the jurisdiction of and there to be dealt with by Parliament.\nIn passing I may remark Parliament having that power and yet not having exercised it is, I agree, as was urged, a cogent argument against any intention in the Act to found the interference asserted.\nI am not oblivious of the apparent invasion already made by holding that Parliament may impose upon municipalities duties of guarding railway crossings for which the legislature may never have made provision in the capacity given its municipal creations or otherwise by delegating to them the power of direct taxation to provide therefor.\nThe case of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5], I admit carried the matter far and was upheld in the Privy Council.\nThat was a case not of directing anything as incidental and ancillary to the construction of the railway or the necessities of the case, but like what is now in question; shall we call it the peace, order and good government of the people of Canada?\nI respectfully submit to the authority of that decision in the wide field it operates upon but, as it so often happens principles of legal or constitutional action are not always carried to their logical conclusions, I await results before going further, and relieving, by virtue only of Dominion legislation, a municipality from a contract its provincial legislative creator enabled it to make, and thereby bound it to observe.\nLegal history and especially constitutional history is full of illustrations of the recoil as it were remaining instead of that of the original force moving further forward.\nIt was urged here as there that the power claimed was but ancillary to the main purpose of the Act and thus being merely incidental thereto for the due efficiency thereof might well be exercised.\nAmplify thus every possible exercise of each of the exclusive powers and the residuary powers committed to Parliament, to the fullest extent and if you please in the most logical manner, of the kind involved in the claim, and there would not be much left of the provincial powers; when we have regard to the doctrine that where each has a legislative power that of the local legislature must yield to the supremacy of Parliament.\nPerhaps the best answer to such a reflection is that men, collectively, seldom feel bound to observe any kind of logic in any sequence of their acts; and that public opinion however illogically evoked is the only safeguard and ultimate court of appeal.\nMeanwhile, we, sitting here, must so far as we can, have some regard to the meaning of these words \u201cexclusively make laws,\u201d designed to cover such matters as we are now dealing with.\nThese words are used in an instrument that obviously implies some limitation upon them in order that other exclusive powers given by like words and assigned elsewhere may be effectively exercised.\nCan any limits be thus or otherwise imposed than those arising out of the necessity for giving effective scope and operation to the due exercise of those other exclusive powers or as Lord Watson called it \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d at page 360 of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[6]? Neither phrase perhaps accurately defines everything to be considered, but in the pages 359, 360 and 361 of that judgment the subject of those limitations is comprehensively and with many needful qualifications dealt with in such a way as to be, if I may be permitted to say so, a practically safe guide in other cases as well as that there in hand. But clearly it was not followed by the draftsman of these sections as his guide.\nCan desirableness or expediency or the residuary powers ever be invoked to justify imposing further limitations than that which necessity so defined draws after it? To classify anew by such elastic, sectional, cross classifications the subject-matters of legislative jurisdiction as this \u201cthrough traffic\u201d attempt indicates, must invariably lead to trouble.\nIf the existence of mere relation of some kind, however remote the relation to the subject dealt with, can justify Parliament in annexing everything of that sort as ancillary to its exclusive powers it might in virtue of its power over navigation undertake in all its details the solution of the sewerage question in the cities and towns along the Ottawa River because some of them empty their sewers therein.\nI do not allude to the right to prohibit that, but the assertion, instead thereof, of a right to cure the evil by regulating everything to be done in respect thereof and therefor, by these municipalities. It would be as justifiable as undertaking to manage the street railway of Montreal, because that road had some relations with another over which Parliament, legislatively speaking, had entire dominion.\nI think we must in the development of what the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d has provided ever have regard to the consequences of any decision we come to, including that of the bearing our holding may have in relation to other matters even not directly in appearance involved therein.\nInstead of merely drifting, let us try to see whither we are drifting.\nIf it were necessary to elaborate upon the actual issue now raised a great deal might be said and more forcibly said than is suggested by a consideration of the several conditions of things I have outlined. I have throughout so outlined these to suggest the many and obvious difficulties in the way of holding as intra vires such legislation by Parliament, if assumed to be of the character claimed, and in the next place of imputing to Parliament by language which is ambiguous that which involves such a dangerous challenge of the products of legislative conditions; in this case ratified by itself..\nAs to the argument that the power to rectify an evil must exist wholly in one legislature, I should have thought but for its persistent reiteration that it was obviously futile.\nEvery one can recognize many cases where it does not exist; and also many persons fancy theoretically that if it were not for the partition of legislative powers necessarily incidental to the federal system many evils might be more speedily and more efficiently rectified, instead of sometimes being only partially cured by the effort of one legislative power.\nEvery intelligent man however knows, if he has watched the moulding of public opinion, how fallacious the theory is. Indeed, the converse is, I believe, the case in a large degree. Passing that, what is the argument worth?\nThe need of this very power sought to be exercised in relation to through traffic exemplifies how cautious we should be in assuming that the limitation of legislative power in relation to furnishing a complete remedy necessarily \u201cleaves our country entirely helpless as the argument implies. The evils incidental to the operation of that traffic were and perhaps are international in some of the ranges of its development yet must we wait for others and refrain from any amelioration because clearly the entire power does not lie with our Parliament.\nIn like manner and in a less degree is involved the dealing with all roads within Canada. Parliament can by asserting its power over those roads owing existence to it and obedience to its mandates pretty effectually check any evil of the kind aimed at. Public opinion will soon bring if need be the supplementary aid of other powers.\nStrong measures short of the invasion of provincial rights can easily be devised, possibly within the present Act, and made to be effectual, if there is an evil practice to be cured.\nIt is clear that the order is an interference with provincial legislation in relation to four of the most important subjects assigned to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces. It is clear also that there was no necessity for Parliament to provide for such an interference. It is to my mind equally clear that the maintenance of such a pretension of power on the part of Parliament would breed infinite disorder.\nI think the appeal must be allowed. The respondent\u2019s improvidence and unsuccessful effort to be relieved therefrom perhaps deserve that we should give costs against it, but for the manner the case was presented by the appellant to the Board.\nInstead of merely properly presenting its respectful compliments to the Board it ought to have set forth some of the basic facts of a most complicated condition of things as reason for its protest against the jurisdiction.\nWith respect I hardly think the failure to do so was fair to the Board.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal is based upon the contention that section 8, sub-section (6), of the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d is ultra vires. The enactment is as follows: 8. Every railway, steam or electric street railway or tramway, the construction or operation of which is authorized by special Act of the legislature of any province, and which connects with or crosses or may hereafter connect with or cross any railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall, although not declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, be subject to the provisions of this Act relating to * * *\n(b) The through traffic upon a railway or tramway and all matters appertaining thereto.\nThe phrase \u201cthrough traffic\u201d is, I think, used in the Act in the sense of traffic originating on one railway and terminating on another. With respect to such traffic, all railway companies to which the provisions of the Act are applicable are required by section 317, sub-section 1,\u2014\naccording to their respective powers to afford to all persons and companies all reasonable and proper facilities * * * for the interchange of traffic between their respective railways and for the return of rolling stock;\nand by section 317, sub-section 2, \u2014\nSuch facilities to be so afforded shall include the due and reasonable receiving, forwarding and delivering by the company, at the request of any other company, of through traffic, and, in the case of goods shipped by car load, of the car with the goods shipped therein, to and from the railway of such other company, at a through rate; and also the due and reasonable receiving, forwarding and delivering by the company, at the request of any person interested in through traffic, of such traffic at through rates.\nSuch companies are, by sub-section 3, forbidden to\n(a) make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to, or in favour of any particular person or company, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever;\n(b) by any unreasonable delay or otherwise howsoever, make any difference in treatment in the receiving, loading, forwarding, unloading, or delivery of the goods of a similar character in favour of or against any particular person or company;\n(c) subject any particular person, or company, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue, or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, in any respect whatsoever; or,\n(d) so distribute or allot its freight cars as to discriminate unjustly against any locality or industry, or against any traffic which may originate on its railway destined to a point on another railway in Canada with which it connects. Any company having a railway connecting with another in such a way as to form a continuous line with it or which intersects another railway is required by sub-section 4 to\nafford all due and reasonable facilities for delivering to such other railway, or for receiving from and forwarding by its railway, all the traffic arriving by such other railway without any unreasonable delay, and without any such preference or advantage, or prejudice or disadvantage as aforesaid, and so that no obstruction is offered to the public desirous of using such railways as a continuous line of communication, and so that all reasonable accommodation, by means of the railways of the several companies, is, at all times, afforded to the public in that behalf.\nBy sub-section 5 it is enacted that\nThe reasonable facilities which every railway is required to afford under this section, shall include reasonable facilities for the junction of private sidings or private branch railways with any railway belonging to or worked by any such company, and reasonable facilities for receiving, forwarding and delivering traffic upon and from those sidings or private branch railways.\nBy the seventh sub-section it is provided that any agreement made between any two or more companies contrary to section 317 shall be \u201cnull and void.\u201d\nThe Railway Board is given very full powers to determine as a question of fact in particular cases as well as by regulation to declare, what shall constitute \u201csimilar circumstances and conditions\u201d or \u201cunjust and unreasonable preferences or advantages\u201d; and to decide whether in any given case a company has or has not complied with the provisions of section 317 as well as to declare by regulation what shall constitute compliance or non-compliance with these provisions.\nThe Board, moreover, may for the purposes of section 317,\norder that specific works be constructed or carried out, or that property be acquired, or that specified tolls be charged, or that cars, motive power or other equipment be allotted, distributed, used, or moved as specified by the Board, or that any specified steps, systems, or methods be taken or followed by any particular company or companies, or by railway companies generally. Section 318(3).\nThere are other important provisions touching the regulation of through traffic, but it will not be necessary to refer to them specifically.\nI think the question whether such enactments as applicable to provincial railways and tramways (that is to say railways and tramways subject generally to the legislative authority of the province) are within the competence of Parliament must turn upon the construction of sub-section 10, of section 92, and sub-section 29, of section 91, of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d I think that is so for this reason. These sections deal specifically with the division of legislative powers touching the subjects of railways and railway traffic; and although in the absence of such provisions those subjects (in the Dominion aspects of them and for general Canadian purposes) might have been held to fall within the general introductory clause of section 91 as well as within sub-section 2 of that section (Trade and Commerce), still I think a specific subsection having been devoted to the distribution of the legislative powers in regard to railways and cognate subjects between the Dominion and the provinces we must look there for the law upon that subject.\nThe sub-sections for consideration are as follows: Section 92: \u2014\n10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2014\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province;\n(b) Lines of steamships between the province and any British or foreign country;\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nSection 91, sub-section 29: \u2014\nSuch classes of subjects as are expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThe exclusive authority to legislate in respect of a railway wholly within a province is by virtue of these enactments vested in the provincial legislature, unless that work be declared to be for the general advantage of Canada; in that case, exclusive legislative authority over it is vested in the Dominion. It is no doubt true that Dominion legislation in respect of a work of the latter class may affect directly a work of the former class and it may be that as necessarily incidental to the legislative powers of the Dominion in respect of a railway wholly within the province, but declared to be for the general advantage of Canada the Dominion might legislate directly in respect of the provincial railway upon a subject-matter in respect of which the province might have legislated in the absence of Dominion legislation. For example, two such railways intersect, the exercise of the powers of the Dominion to legislate for the protection of the public as affected by the operation of the Dominion railway might involve the passing of regulations touching the traffic through the point of intersection of the provincial railway and an area surrounding that point of intersection embracing to some extent the provincial line.\nIn the absence of Dominion regulations the province would be empowered no doubt in respect of its own line to make such regulations upon that subject as it should, see fit. But such regulations would be overborne when inconsistent with Dominion legislation. It is upon this principle that the respondents seek to support the authority of the Dominion to pass the enactments of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to which I have referred and to make them applicable to provincial railways intersecting and connecting with Dominion railways. It is said that the legislation is ancillary to the exercise of the Dominion powers in respect of Dominion railways; the principle relied upon is authoritatively stated by the Judicial Committee in the following passage in the judgment upon the Liquor Licenses appeal[7], at page 359:\u2014\nIt was apparently contemplated by the framers of the \u201cImperial Act of 1867,\u201d that the due exercise of the enumerated powers conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by section 91 might, occasionally and incidentally, involve legislation upon matters which are prima facie committed exclusively to the provincial legislatures by section 92. In order to provide against that contingency, the concluding part of section 91 enacts that \u201cany matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d It was observed by this Board in Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[8], that the paragraph just quoted \u201capplies in its grammatical construction only to No. 16 of section 92.\u201d The observation was not material to the question\u2019 arising in that case, and it does not appear to Their Lordships to be strictly accurate. It appears to them that the language of the exception in section 91 was meant to include, and correctly describes, all the matters enumerated in the sixteen heads of section 92, as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature. It also appears to Their Lordships that the exception was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by these sixteen sub-sections, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local or private, in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative beads of clause 91. That view was stated and illustrated by Sir Montague Smith in Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Parsons[9], at pages 108 and 100, and in Cushing v. Dupuy[10], and it has been recognized by this Board in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[11], and in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[12].\nI do not think the principle enunciated in this passage is sufficient to support this legislation as it stands. There is not here the slightest suggestion, and I do not think there can be found in any of the cases the slightest suggestion, that the Dominion has power of its own will to enlarge the limits of its legislative authority. These limits are fixed by the Act itself. What is and what is not within the meaning of the passage quoted\nnecessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers committed to the Dominion under section 91\nin such a way as to give the Dominion the power to enact it must be determined by the courts. What we have to ascertain in this case is whether in conferring upon the Railway Board the large powers over provincial railways constituted by the legislation under consideration, the Dominion has been legislating in a way that is necessarily incidental to the exercise of its legislative authority in respect of Dominion railways.\nLet me observe again that the Imperial legislature has said uno flat\u00fb, so to speak, that the exclusive legislative authority in respect of local railways declared to be for the general advantage of Canada, shall be vested in the Dominion, while the exclusive legislative authority in respect of all other such railways shall be vested in the province. Although these respective authorities, as I have already mentioned, are not so delimited as to be always and in all cases mutually exclusive, that is because there must be cases in which it is impossible for the Dominion to legislate fully in respect of its railways without passing legislation touching and concerning railways which are provincial. To the extent of that necessity we are justified in implying a power in the Dominion to legislate for the provincial railways notwithstanding the circumstance that, broadly speaking, the exclusive legislative jurisdiction in respect of the provincial railways has been committed to the province; but the implication must, I think, be limited by this necessity. It is observable also we have not such a case here as those in which the scope of one of the sub-sections of section 91 has to be determined in relation to the scope of that provision of section 92 which deals with property and civil rights. This latter was the case in Tennant v. Union Bank[13], and Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[14]. In both these cases it was pointed out that it would be impossible for the Dominion to proceed a single step in legislating effectively in regard to banking or in framing a system of bankruptcy law without invading the field marked out by the broad words \u201cproperty and civil rights.\u201d The legislature in conferring upon the Dominion the power to deal with banking and the power to deal with bankruptcy and insolvency, was in each case carving a field out of property and civil rights. In the present case, on the other hand, the Act is dealing with two separate subjects, the boundaries of which can cross one another only incidentally and occasionally. The provision defining the provincial power must be read together with the provision defining the Dominion power, in order to ascertain the limits of either. It is little to the purpose to say that where Dominion legislation and provincial come into conflict the first prevails, That is only so where the Dominion is acting within the limits of the area in which the constitution permits it to act, and the whole question here is whether in enacting the legislation in question the Dominion was acting within or without these limits.\nThe effect of the legislation under consideration is that for the purposes of through traffic a provincial railway, merely because it crosses a Dominion railway, may be made part of the Dominion system, and indeed in respect of the control over it vested in the Board becomes a part of that system. It seems to me that the terms of sub-section 10 shew clearly that this is what was not to take place, unless the provincial railway be declared to be a Dominion work as a whole. I am utterly at a loss to understand how it can be contended that merely because a railway, A-B, crosses a railway, C-D, the power to legislate for A-B involves the power to legislate for C-D, to the extent of making C-D a mere adjunct to A-B for the purposes of through traffic\u2014when the law is that the power to legislate for C-D generally is vested in another body.\nHow can it be said that legislation respecting such through traffic\u2014involving the requirements that C-D shall provide facilities for such traffic, enter into agreements for joint rates, submit to the regulation of the Dominion Board in respect of such rates, and otherwise comply with the provisions above mentioned\u2014is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the legislative powers of Parliament respecting A-B? In many cases \u2014and the present is obviously one of them\u2014the traffic over the provincial railway (assuming compulsory joint traffic arrangements to go into effect) would be the principal and that over the Dominion railway merely subsidiary. Can it fairly be said that in passing legislation which may thus change in toto the character of the undertaking of the provincial railway Parliament is, in substance, exercising its powers to legislate for what if the legislation become effective must be the subsidiary undertaking? Then it is argued that there must be found vested in one single authority the power to legislate wholly with regard to through traffic. But division of legislative authority is the principle of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and if the doctrine of necessarily incidental powers is to be extended to all cases in which inconvenience arises from such a division that is the end of the federal character of the Union. That is not the true solution the true solution lies as Lord Herschell said in the Fisheries Case[15], in the exercise of good sense by the legislatures concerned. It is obvious that with respect to through traffic upon Dominion and provincial railways the difficulty could be met by declaring the provincial railway to be a work for the general advantage of Canada (and the postulate upon which the respondent\u2019s argument rests\u2014that such legislation in respect of the provincial railways should be necessary for the conduct of business on a Dominion railway\u2014 would surely be sufficient ground for such a declaration), or by the constitution of a joint board or separate boards authorized to act together and empowered to deal with such cases.\nThat it might be convenient that the Dominion and the provincial railway should have joint traffic arrangements and that these should be under a single control does not advance the argument of the respondents. The same argument would apply to the case of a provincial line of steamships having a terminus near a station or terminus of a Dominion railway or a provincial telephone line or telegraph line which it might be thought useful to link up with the railway telegraph system. Does anybody seriously think that legislative control of the railways involves (as necessarily incidental to it) under the sub-sections quoted, the legislative power to effect such amalgamations and to reorganize the provincial undertakings to suit the exigencies of the altered conditions? I am wholly unable to understand the ground upon which it can be held that merely because of physical juxtaposition such provincial undertakings so long as they remain provincial can be held (to the broad extent necessary to support such legislation as that in question here) incidental (for legislative or other purposes) to such a Dominion railway\u2014and (in the legislative aspect) especially when it has been declared that the provincial undertaking shall generally be under the exclusive legislative control of the province.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The question upon which leave to appeal has been given under the provisions of sub-sections 2 and 3, of section 56, of the \u201cDominion Railway Act,\u201d is expressed in the orders by Mr. Justice Duff and of the Board of Railway Commissioners in identic terms, as follows: \u2014\nWhether upon a true construction of sections 91 and 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d and of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act of Canada,\u201d the Montreal Street Railway Company (the present appellant) is subject, in respect of its through traffic with the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada. The construction and operation of the Montreal Street Railway is authorized by special Acts of the legislature of the Province of Quebec, and it still remains a railway under provincial control. The Montreal Park and Island Railway, though originally built as a provincial undertaking, having been declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, is now under federal control.\nThe question formulated for determination by this court involves two distinct questions\u2014the first, whether or not an order affecting a provincial railway in respect of through traffic received by it from, or transmitted by it to a federal railway is within the purview of section 8 of the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d; and the second, whether, if it purports to authorize the making of such an order, this legislation is or is not ultra vires of Parliament.\nThroughout this opinion I shall for brevity and convenience use the term \u201cprovincial railway\u201d to signify a railway not owned by a province, but subject to provincial legislative authority; and the term \u201cfederal railway,\u201d to designate a railway subject to federal legislative authority, though not owned by the Dominion.\nThe effect of the statutory declaration that it is a work for the general benefit of Canada has been to render the Park and Island Railway a federal railway to the same extent and as completely as if it were inter-provincial or extended beyond the limits of the Province of Quebec. Its federal character once established exists for all purposes and the jurisdiction of Parliament over it and over everything that is necessarily incidental and ancillary to its operation and to the proper carrying out of the public services which it has been established to render is neither greater nor less than that which Parliament possesses over other federal railways such as the Canadian Pacific and the Grand Trunk.\nI entirely fail to appreciate the distinction which the appellants have sought to draw between a federal railway constructed wholly within one province and having no extra-provincial connection and an interprovincial railway. Both are alike excepted from section 92 of the Act.\nA brief consideration of the form of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d will make it clear that it applies equally to provincial railways connecting with each class of federal railways. The necessity for federal regulation in respect to \u201cthe connection or crossing\u201d must be the same whether the federal railway be such because it is inter-provincial, or because it has been declared to be for the general advantage of Canada. The first paragraph of section 8, which describes the railways to be affected, applies equally to clause (a) dealing with \u201cconnection or crossing\u201d and to clause (b) dealing with \u201cthrough traffic.\u201d This description was not meant to include certain railways for the purpose of clause (a) and to exclude the same railways for the purpose of clause (b). Whatever may be its proper construction and effect, clause (b) applies to the Montreal Street Railway connecting with the Park and Island Railway equally with clause (a). I find no justification for excluding from the operation of either part of section 8 any railway (including a street railway) constructed under provincial authority which connects with a railway within the legislative authority of Parliament, however the authority of Parliament may have arisen. We must next inquire what is the \u201cthrough traffic upon a railway or tramway\u201d to which clause (6) relates. Section 8 declares that certain railways\nshall be subject to the provisions of this Act relating to * * * through traffic, etc.\nThere are several sections of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d which \u201crelate to\u201d through traffic. In some of them through traffic obviously means traffic carried between terminal points on the same railway as distinguished from traffic carried between intermediate stations. From others, particularly those dealing with interchange of traffic and \u201cthrough rates\u201d for such traffic (section 317) to be provided for by a \u201cjoint tariff\u201d (section 334), it is plain that through traffic may also include traffic originating upon one railway and carried to or towards its destination on another. Section 8 deals entirely with the connection or crossing of two railways and it is intended to provide for matters arising out of such connection or crossing. It subjects every provincial railway crossing or connecting with a federal railway to federal legislation in respect to \u201cthe through traffic on the railway or tramway.\u201d Obviously it was not meant\u2014it could not have been meant\u2014to attempt to control through traffic on a provincial railway or tramway in the sense of traffic carried upon it between its own termini. That would be a distinct invasion of provincial rights; it would be direct and substantive legislation on a subject within the exclusive domain of the provincial legislature. Equally clearly the section does not apply to similar traffic on a federal railway; such traffic is fully provided for elsewhere in the statute. It is therefore, reasonably certain that the \u201cthrough traffic\u201d to which the section is meant to apply is traffic carried from a point on one of the connecting railways to a point upon the other; and it matters not whether it is the point of origin or that of destination which is on the federal railway. But for the serious discussion of it at bar and doubts then expressed by some of my learned brothers, I should not have thought the meaning of \u201cthrough traffic\u201d in section 8 open to question. I should add that \u201ctraffic\u201d in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d means \u201cthe traffic of passengers, goods and rolling stock,\u201d (section 3(31)) but not necessarily of all three. The carriage exclusively either of freight or of passengers is, I think, within this definition.\nI am satisfied that the order in appeal deals with matters within the purview of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nI am also of the opinion that this legislation is intra vires of Parliament.\nIf it had no connection with or did not cross a federal railway, the Montreal Street Railway would, no doubt, be a \u201clocal work or undertaking\u201d within clause 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and not within any of the exceptions to that clause, and therefore under the exclusive legislative control of the province. Whether, when the railway with which it is connected became a federal railway, it ceased, as contended by counsel for the respondents, to be such a local work or undertaking as should be deemed for any purpose exclusively within the legislative control of the province it is unnecessary to determine. Assuming that, notwithstanding this connection, the Montreal Street Railway still remains a local work or undertaking within clause 10 of section 92, I am of opinion that the Dominion legislation authorizing the order now in appeal is nevertheless valid. The Park and Island Railway, having been declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, is within exception (c) to clause 10 of section 92. Railways expressly excepted from this clause are, under clause 29 of section 91, one of the enumerated subjects declared to be within the exclusive legislative authority and control of the Dominion. In regard to them Parliament is clothed with plenary powers of legislation, including power to enact measures which may trench upon provincial legislative authority when such enactments are truly or properly ancillary or necessarily incidental to the complete and effective control of such federal railways.\nFrom the judgment of Lord Watson in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[16], I extract the following passage, found at pages 359-360:\u2014\nIt was apparently contemplated by the framers of the \u201cImperial Act of 1867,\u201d that the due exercise of the enumerated powers conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by section 91 might, occasionally and incidentally, involve legislation upon matters which are prim\u00e0 facie committed exclusively to the provincial legislatures by section 92. In order to provide against that contingency, the concluding part of section 91 enacts that \u201cany matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d It was observed by this Board in Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[17], that the paragraph just quoted \u201capplies in its grammatical construction only to No. 16 of section 92.\u201d The observation was not material to the question arising in that case, and it does not appear to Their Lordships to be strictly accurate. It appears to them that the language of the exception in section 91 was meant to include and correctly described all the matters enumerated in the sixteen heads of section 92, as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature. It also appears to Their Lordships that the exception was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by these sixteen sub-sections, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local or private in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative heads of clause 91. That view was stated and illustrated by Sir Montague Smith in Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[18], at page 109, and in Cushing v. Dupuy[19], at page 415; and it has been recognized by this Board in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[20], at page 46, and in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[21], at page 200.\nIf the regulation of \u201cthrough traffic\u201d on a connecting provincial railway, in the sense in which that phrase is used in section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d is \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d to the effective control of the traffic of the federal railway with which the connection exists, the power of Parliament to enact section 8 appears to be strictly within and completely covered by Lord Watson\u2019s language.\nIn several subsequent cases the power of Parliament to pass incidental or ancillary legislation which touches one or other of the subjects assigned by section 92 to the provincial legislatures has been recognized.\nThus its right to prohibit contracts whereby railway companies seek to relieve themselves from liability to employees for injuries sustained through negligence or breach of statutory duty, though involving an interference with the civil right of freedom of contract, was upheld in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General for Canada[22]. Lord Dunedin, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, says, at page 68: \u2014\nThe true question in the present case does not seem to turn upon the question whether this law deals with a civil right\u2014which may be conceded\u2014but whether this law is truly ancillary to railway legislation. It seems to Their Lordships that, inasmuch as these railway corporations are the mere creatures of the Dominion legislature\u2014 which is admitted\u2014it cannot be considered out of the way that the Parliament which calls them into existence should prescribe the terms which were to regulate the relations of the employees to the corporation. It is true that, in doing so, it does touch what may be described as the civil rights of those employees. But this is inevitable and, indeed, seems much less violent in such a case where the rights, such as they are, are, so to speak, all intra familiam, than in the numerous cases which may be figured where the civil rights of outsiders may be affected. As examples may be cited provisions relating to expropriation of land, conditions to be read into contracts of carriage, and alterations upon the common law of carriers.\nAnd the law in question was upheld as \u201cproperly ancillary to through railway legislation.\u201d\nThe right of Parliament in the exercise of its ancillary power to subject to its statutes creatures of a provincial legislature so far as \u201creasonably necessary,\u201d although in regard to the particular subject-matter dealt with there should be inconsistent provincial legislation, is established in Toronto Corporation v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[23], at pages 58, 59; City of Montreal v. Gordon[24].\nNot only is Parliament empowered incidentally to control corporate bodies owing their existence to a provincial legislature, but the very property of a province itself has been held to be subject to the control and disposition of Parliament in the exercise of its jurisdiction to provide for the construction and operation of federal railways. Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[25].\nThe same principle was also illustrated in an early decision that Parliament has the power to impose upon provincial courts duties in connection with the carrying out and enforcement of its laws. Valin v. Langlois[26]. In cases of conflict between Dominion legislation and provincial legislation otherwise valid, the subordination of the latter is again recognized in the last pronouncement of the Judicial Committee upon the subject. La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[27].\nBut while this incidental or ancillary jurisdiction of Parliament is fully established, no definition of what should be deemed \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d or \u201ctruly ancillary\u201d is found in any decision binding on this court. No doubt this is partly due to the difficulty of framing a definition which would be at once sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently restrictive, because what is incidentally necessary must vary in each case with the circumstances, and partly to deference to the advice given in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons[28], at page 109, and approved of by the Judicial Committee in later cases, not to enter\nmore largely upon the interpretation of the statute (the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d) than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nBut in considering whether certain legislation should be deemed necessarily incidental, or truly or properly ancillary, we receive some assistance from expressions of judicial opinion in regard to particular matters.\nThus in a comparatively early case the right of Parliament to interfere with many matters, otherwise exclusively within provincial jurisdiction, as incidental to bankruptcy legislation was recognized. Gushing v. Dupuy[29], at page 415. Interference with executions is instanced as a legitimate exercise of this ancillary power in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[30], and the Lord Chancellor (Herschell) says, at page 200, that\na system of bankruptcy legislation may frequently require various ancillary provisions for the purpose of preventing the scheme of the Act from being defeated.\nAs ancillary to its control of the banks and banking system of Canada, Parliament has the power to legislate in regard to the negotiability of warehouse receipts for banking purposes, although in such legislation an interference with civil rights is clearly involved. The authority to legislate in respect to banking transactions is plenary and\nmay be fully exercised, although with the effect of modifying civil rights in the province. Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[31], at p. 47.\nIn Re Railway Act[32], at page 142, Mr. Justice Davies says:\nExclusive legislative authority on railways, such as are here enumerated, being vested in the Dominion Parliament, that Parliament has, as a consequence, full and paramount power so to legislate upon such matters as fully, properly and effectively to carry out the construction, management and operation of these railways. In so legislating it matters not that they infringe upon the powers of legislation -with regard to property and civil rights assigned to the provincial legislatures. Such invasion is admittedly necessary to enable the Parliament properly and effectively to legislate. The main and controlling question is, therefore, whether the legislation in question can be said to be fairly and reasonably within the plenary and exclusive powers of the Dominion Parliament enabling it effectively to control the construction, management and operation of the classes of railways excepted from sub-section ten of section ninety-two and embraced within sub-section twenty-nine of section ninety-one. I think it may be fairly so held.\nIn City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. [33], the same learned judge quotes as the equivalent of \u201cnecessarily incidental and ancillary\u201d the phrase used by Osier J.A., in Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and Township of York[34], at page 72, \u201ceminently germane, if not absolutely necessary.\u201d\nIn the latter volume, at page 407, is reported a unanimous decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal[35] that Dominion legislation declaring a federal railway company liable \u201cfor the full amount of damages sustained\u201d by reason of a breach of statutory duty is intra vires and entitles an employee, or, if he be killed, his relatives to recover such damages where the breach of duty is that of a fellow-employee, notwithstanding the limitation imposed by the provincial \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d Burton C.J.O., says, at page 411:\u2014\nI think such a power is incident to the general legislation entrusted to them (the Dominion Parliament) to construct and deal with such undertakings and ought not to be restricted in the way suggested.\nIn McArthur v. Northern and Pacific Junction Railway Co.[36], Burton J.A., says, at page 111:\u2014\nIt must be clear, apart altogether from authority, that when power is given to the particular legislature to legislate on a certain subject, such power includes all the incidental subjects of legislation which are necessary to carry it into effect;\nand Osier J.A., says, at page 125, that legislation conferring a right of action for damages arising from the cutting of timber upon a plot of land of limited width, on either side of a federal railway, owned by the Crown in right of the province, but under timber license, is\nwell within the competence of Parliament to pass in order to legislate generally and effectually on a subject within its exclusive powers, even though it may to some extent trench upon the subject of property and civil rights.\nIn Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons[37], Ritchie C. J., said, at pages 242-3:\u2014\nThe Dominion Parliament would only have the right to interfere with property and civil rights in so far as such interference may be necessary for the purpose of legislating generally and effectually in relation to matters confided to the Parliament of Canada.\nThe learned Chief Justice repeated this statement in The Queen v. Robertson[38], at page 111, and at page 139, Fournier J., said:\u2014\ndans une cause assez r\u00e9cente, j\u2019ai eu occasion de dire, et je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, que le gouvernement federal a, sans doute, le pouvoir de toucher incidemment \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res qui sont de la jurisdiction des provinces. Mais dans mon opinion, ce pouvoir ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas au-dela de ce qui est raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislation ayant uniquement pour but le l\u00e9gitime exercice d\u2019un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nI extract the following passage from the judgment of Rose J., in Doyle v. Bell[39], at page 335:\u2014\nI do not understand by the use of the word necessary, as found in various decisions and text-books, that it is meant to lay down the doctrine that to bring within the \u201cpowers of the Dominion legislature any provision of an enactment respecting a subject within the exclusive jurisdiction of such legislature, and which provision might affect civil rights, it must necessarily appear that without such provision it would be impossible to carry into effect the intentions of the legislature, or that probably no other provision would be adequate. On the contrary, it seems to me that if such provision might, under certain circumstances, be beneficial and assist to more fully enforce such legislation, then it must, at all events on an appeal to the courts, be held to be necessary, that is, necessary in certain events. Surely the legislature must be allowed some and, in my opinion, a very wide discretion as to the mode of enforcing its own enactments. It cannot be that the courts are to sit in judgment on the exercise of such discretion and dictate to the legislature whether they shall adopt this or that mode, because in the opinion of the courts one mode is the more convenient or better, or at least as well adapted to effect the purpose of the legislature. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in McDonald v. Riordan[40], the late Mr. Justice Wurtele expressed views which would restrict the incidental jurisdiction of Parliament within very narrow limits. The judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that Parliament had the right to legislate as to the disqualification of the directors of federal railway companies was affirmed in this court[41], and, as the decision is reported, \u201cfor the reasons given in the court appealed from.\u201d But I cannot think that this court meant to adopt or to indorse the views of the learned Quebec judge upon the limitations of the ancillary legislative jurisdiction of Parliament.\nI fully recognize that, as stated by Palmer J., in Attorney-General for Canada v. Foster[42], at page 164:\u2014\nWhere the line of necessity is to be drawn in each particular case is the great difficulty that lawyers have to contend with when expounding our constitution. It must, I think, be determined by a consideration of the general scope of the legislation called in question. There must be a reasonable limitation of its encroachment upon subjects that are exclusively within the power of the other legislature.\nNevertheless, Lord Hobhouse says in the Parsons Case[43], at pages 108-9:\u2014\nIn these cases it is the duty of the courts, however difficult it may be, to ascertain in what degree and to what extent authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each legislature, and to define in the particular case before them, the limits of their respective powers.\nHaving regard to the general tenor of the authorities to which I have referred, it is clear that when, in order to make effective and to fully carry out the object of substantive legislation upon one of the subjects enumerated in section 91, it becomes necessary to assert and exercise ancillary powers which trench to some extent upon the domain assigned to provincial legislation, Parliament possesses these powers. In determining whether particular legislation is or is not within them, \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d is not the test; it is rather \u201creasonable necessity.\u201d Is the authority to pass such legislation requisite \u201cto prevent the scheme of the (substantive) act from being defeated\u201d; to permit of a \u201cplenary\u2019\u2019 exercise of a power expressly conferred; to allow Parliament to exercise \u201cits full and paramount power so to legislate upon the railways enumerated \u201cas fully and effectively to carry out the * * * operation of these railways\u201d; to provide for matters \u201ceminently germane, if not absolutely necessary\u201d to legislation upon an enumerated subject; to cover \u201cincidental subjects\u201d of legislation upon an assigned subject; to ensure that Parliament may \u201clegislate generally and effectually on a subject within its exclusive powers\u201d; to make provisions \u201cjust and reasonable and necessary\u201d in legislating for a purpose within \u201cthe power conferred on the federal government\u201d ? Can this legislation be said\nto be fairly and reasonably within the plenary and exclusive powers of the Dominion Parliament enabling it effectively to control the * * * operation of the classes of railways\nunder its jurisdiction? \u2014 These are criteria indicated in the cases to which I have referred by which the reasonable necessity and the truly ancillary character of incidental legislation may be tested.\nThe late Mr. Justice Rose would have supported such legislation if beneficial and of assistance in more fully enforcing legislation respecting a subject within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. The legislation now before us, however, appears to answer the more conservative judicial tests which I have mentioned.\nIn considering the necessity for federal control of \u201cthrough traffic,\u201d it is well to have in mind that section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d applies to the great railway systems of Canada and the local lines connecting therewith, as well as to such railways as those now before the court; and that \u201ctraffic\u201d includes freight as well as passenger traffic. One legitimate purpose of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of Canada is to prevent undue discrimination in rates in respect of traffic upon railways under federal control when carried under similar conditions and between points similarly situated. If federal railway companies may, indirectly and through the instrumentality of distinct provincial corporations operating local connecting railways, defeat the purpose of this federal legislation against undue discrimination, it would seem that, in respect of through traffic, such local railways should be subject to federal control in order to \u201cprevent the scheme of the Act being defeated.\u201d\nFor instance, point A is on \u201cThe Transcontinental\u201d \u2014a through federal railway connecting at point B with \u201cThe Dominion,\u201d a federal branch line controlled by an entirely independent company, upon which is situate point C; at point B \u201cThe Transcontinental\u201d also connects with \u201cThe Provincial,\u201d a local railway operating under provincial incorporation, but controlled by the interests which control \u201cThe Transcontinental.\u201d On \u201cThe Provincial\u201d is situate point D, equidistant with point C from point B. If this provincial railway should not be subject to federal control in respect to \u201cthrough traffic,\u201d the rate between points A and D might, without any direct discrimination on the part of \u201cThe Transcontinental\/\u2019 be considerably greater than the rate between points A and C in respect of the same class of traffic. A \u201cthrough rate\u201d might be refused between the former points because the provincial company would not make a \u201cjoint tariff\u201d; or an uncontrolled charge by the provincial company between points B and D might result in a gross case of discrimination in rates between point A and the equidistant points C and D.\nIt may not be absolutely necessary to the existence and operation of federal railways that such discrimination should be prevented, but it is certainly reasonably necessary to the satisfactory management and control of traffic upon them that such matters should be subject to efficient regulation. Otherwise, as in the illustration given, the interests controlling a federal railway might be in a position, through the medium of a connecting provincial railway also under their control, to thwart the purpose of unquestionably valid Dominion legislation against unfair discrimination. The plenary exercise of the power to legislate in regard to federal railways would therefore seem to embrace the control of provincial railways in respect of \u201cthrough traffic\u201d and it can scarcely be gainsaid that legislation for the regulation of such \u201cthrough traffic\u201d is \u201ceminently germane, if not absolutely necessary,\u201d to legislation in regard to federal railways themselves.\nAgain, for certain classes of through perishable freight traffic, e.g.: fish, fruit, dairy products and meat\u2014it may be essential that there should not be trans-shipment en route and specially constructed cars may be required. Should \u201cThe Provincial,\u201d under control independent of \u201cThe Transcontinental.\u201d refuse to haul to their destination on its line cars of \u201cThe Transcontinental,\u201d this traffic to and from points on \u201cThe Provincial\u201d might be seriously interfered with, if not destroyed. Morover, refusal by \u201cThe Provincial\u201d to co-operate at the point of connection with \u201cThe Transcontinental\u201d in the transfer of such cars from one road to the other might create difficulties and inconveniences which would unduly impede the traffic. Cars specially constructed for certain kinds of traffic and of which the supply may be limited might be improperly detained upon \u201cThe Provincial\u201d and grave delay and inconvenience be thus caused to shippers as well as loss of business to the federal railway.\nCars employed for the traffic in fish, meat, dairy products and fruit require to be \u201ciced\u201d efficiently and at regular intervals. By slight neglect in this connection serious damage might be caused. Yet, unless the Dominion Railway Commission has some control over \u201cthrough traffic\u201d after it leaves the federal railways and before it reaches them, it might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to secure satisfactory regulation in regard to such matters as \u201cicing.\u201d\nMany other difficulties, with which nothing but a single controlling power can be relied upon to cope effectively and satisfactorily, might, no doubt, be suggested by experienced railwaymen. But these illustrations suffice to demonstrate the reasonable necessity of federal control in respect to \u201cthrough traffic\u201d over provincial railways which connect with federal railways.\nIt may be suggested that the same purpose could be accomplished by joint or concurrent legislative action by Parliament and the provincial legislature. There is no such legislation; and if an attempt were made to arrange for it, there is no certainty that the views of the two legislative bodies would be the same. Again, if the Dominion Railway Commission and a provincial railway commission were each empowered to deal with such matters in regard to federal and provincial railways respectively, there would be no assurance that the standards of both would be alike or that joint action would be practicable; and if the authority were divided only joint action could be effective. At all events, the existence or non-existence of federal legislative jurisdiction cannot depend upon these considerations.\nAgain it is urged that such power on the part of Parliament or its creature, the Dominion Railway Commission, would be open to abuse and that, in the guise of regulations in respect of \u201cthrough traffic,\u201d a provincial railway might be subjected to interference in regard to its rolling stock, its time schedules, its very rails themselves, their gauge and their weight, such as would virtually remove the undertaking from provincial control, or would render it extremely difficult for the provincial authorities to exercise in regard to it that supervision to which they are entitled. Meeting a similar objection in the Fisheries Case[44], Lord Herschell said, at page 713:\u2014\nThe suggestion that the power might be abused so as to amount to a practical confiscation of property does not warrant the imposition by the courts of any limit upon the absolute power of legislation conferred. The supreme legislative power in relation to any subject-matter is always capable of abuse, but it is not to be assumed that it will be improperly used; if it is, the only remedy is an appeal to those by whom the legislature is elected.\nAnd in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[45], Lord Hobhouse, speaking of the exclusive legislative powers of the provinces, said, at page 586:\u2014 To place a limit upon it because the power may be used unwisely, as all powers may, would be an error and would lead to insuperable difficulties in the construction of the \u201cConfederation Act.\u201d\nAnd again, at page 587:\u2014\nIf * * * on the due construction of the Act a legislative power falls within section 92, it would be quite wrong * * * to deny its existence because by some possibility it may be abused, or may limit the range which would otherwise be open to the Dominion Parliament.\nThe Commission created by Parliament for the administration of its railway legislation should be relied upon to have due regard to the fact that the authority of Parliament to enact such provisions as are contained in section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is restricted by the rule of reasonable necessity; and \u201cit must be assumed that\u201d it\nwill exercise the judicial powers which have been entrusted to it in a just and reasonable manner,\nper Osier J.A., in Re Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Township of York[46], at page 73. If it be open to inquiry here, I find nothing in the order now in appeal which indicates disregard by the Railway Board of this moral restriction upon its powers. The learned Ontario judge of appeal also says:\u2014\nI do not think that questions of ultra vires can be decided by unreasonable or extravagant suppositions.\nFinally it was objected that the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d provides a means by which Parliament can assume control over the Montreal Street Railway, viz.: by declaring it to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and that, the statute having provided this means for acquiring control, no other is open. But to declare a railway to be a work for the general advantage of Canada involves the assumption of complete and entire control of it by Parliament and in the case of many local railways which connect with federal railways that may be undesirable. Moreover, if this be a good ground of objection to the Dominion legislation in regard to \u201cthrough traffic\u201d it is equally applicable to the legislation in the same section in regard to control of the physical crossing or connection. It is inconceivable that whenever Parliament desires to compel a provincial railway crossing or connecting with a federal railway to conform to federal legislation in regard to the actual physical crossing or connection it must assume complete control of the provincial railway by declaring it to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nIt should be noted that the section of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d now under consideration deals only with cases in which provincial railways actually connect with or cross federal railways. By this legislation Parliament does not purport to empower the Railway Commission to order a provincial railway to establish such a connection and it is not necessary now to consider whether Parliament could or could not confer such authority.\nCounsel for the respondents contended that Parliament is empowered by the residuum clause of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to deal with \u201cthrough traffic\u201d as a subject not covered by any of the several clauses of section 92. I think it must be admitted that, in the absence of federal legislation dealing with it, provincial legislation in regard to the carriage on a provincial railway of \u201cthrough traffic\u201d received from or destined for a federal railway would be intra vires under clause 10 of section 92. If so, the right of Parliament to subject a provincial railway to federal legislation in respect of \u201cthrough traffic\u201d cannot arise under the residuum clause of section 91. The Judicial Committee has said that legislation under this clause may not\nencroach upon any class of subjects which is exclusively assigned to provincial legislatures by section 92. Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[47].\nEffective legislation in regard to the through traffic dealt with by section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d must trench upon the legislative authority of the provinces over provincial railways. Ex hypothesi legislation which does so encroach would seem to be pro tanto not within the residuum clause, which only confers power\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nMoreover, the \u201csubjects\u201d of railway legislation assigned respectively to Parliament and the provincial legislatures by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d appear to be, to the former federal railways, as described in the exceptions to clause 10 of section 92, and to the latter local railways not within such exceptions. The division of jurisdiction seems to be according to the character of the railways and not according to the nature of the traffic carried or the business done. I therefore agree with Mr. Geoffrion that \u201cthrough traffic\u201d can scarcely be regarded as a distinct subject of legislation not covered by any of the enumerated classes of either section 91 or section 92 and therefore within the legislative power of Parliament under the residuum clause.\nBut, if not within the residuum clause, and if, as seems clear, it be a matter requiring legislative regulation, since the provisions of sections 91 and 92 exhaust the entire legislative field, except as to matters specifically covered by other sections of the Act \u2014 e.g., section 93, Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[48], at page 587 \u2014it follows that \u201cthrough traffic\u201d must \u2018be within the legislative jurisdiction either of Parliament or of the local legislatures or of both.\nIt seems clear that a provincial legislature cannot alone deal with this subject, because in no circumstances can it legitimately enact \u201crailway legislation\u201d affecting a federal railway. Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Co.[49]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The King[50]. Joint or concurrent legislative control, or joint or concurrent control by two bodies of Commissioners, deriving power respectively from Parliament and the local legislature, would be so uncertain and subject to so many difficulties and contingencies that it might often result in failure to make provisions necessary for the regulation of such traffic. It seems to follow that only legislative jurisdiction vested exclusively in Parliament can effectually provide for \u201cthrough traffic.\u201d This consideration confirms the conclusion that such jurisdiction has been conferred by the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the provisions of the eighth section of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d should be held to be intra vires of Parliament as \u201ctruly ancillary to (federal) railway legislation\u201d and \u201cproperly ancillary to through railway legislation\u201d and as\nnecessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred by (one of) the enumerative heads of clause 91, namely, the jurisdiction given by clause 29 of section 91 over railways excepted from clause 10 of section 92. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson, Hague, & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ethier & Co.\n[1] [1907] A.C. 65.\n[2] [1908] A.C. 54.\n[3] [1908] A.C. 54.\n[4] [1905] A.C. 52.\n[5] 37 Can.

On the hearing of a complaint, alleging unjust discrimination in respect to fares, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada refused to take the agreement into consideration when tendered in evidence to justify the granting of the special rates and ordered the company, appellants, to furnish the service to persons using the tramway in both municipalities at the same rates of fare. On an appeal, by leave of the Board, in respect of the propriety of overlooking the contract, submitted as a question of law:\u2014\nHeld, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that, as the existence of the contract was one of the elements bearing upon the decision of the question of substantial similarity in circumstances, the Board should have admitted the evidence so tendered in regard to the agreement in consideration of which the special rates of fares had been granted. APPEAL by leave of the Board, under section 56(3) of \"The Railway Act,\" from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, dated 4th May, 1909.\nThe circumstances of the case are shortly stated in the head-note and more fully set out in the judgments now reported. The appeal was in respect of the same order as was brought in question in the case of The Montreal Street Railway Co. v. The City of Montreal[1]; and the order granting leave to appeal, on the question submitted, was as follows:\u2014\n\"It is ordered that leave be granted to The Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the said order, dated the 4th day of May, 1909, upon the following question, which is hereby declared to be, in the opinion of the Board, a question of law, namely, whether it is right or proper for the Board, in making the said order, to overlook the contract bearing date the 7th day of November, 1907, and made between the said Montreal Park and Island Railway Company and the Municipality of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce?\"\nThe contract mentioned is the agreement referred to in the head-note.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and F. Meredith K.C. (Hague with them) for the appellants.\nAtwater K.C. and Butler for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In order that justice may be done it is necessary for the Commissioners to consider the agreement under which the appellants obtained permission from the Municipality of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce to enter upon its streets. We are not now called upon to decide what effect, if any, is to be given to that agreement in the consideration of the complaint made as to unjust discrimination; but it may serve to explain or justify the alleged difference in treatment complained of by the respondents and should therefore in that view not be overlooked. To meet the charge of unjust discrimination as between the two adjoining municipalities, the railway company attempted to shew that the circumstances were not substantially similar by producing the agreement under which they had been permitted to enter and are now allowed to operate their railway upon the streets of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce; but the Commissioners apparently were of opinion that the question was to be decided upon a bare consideration of the money fares charged. It is manifest, in my opinion, that the cost of construction and of operation are essential elements to be considered in the determination of the question as to whether the circumstances in which the company operated its road in the adjoining municipalities are substantially similar.\nThe appellants were required by the Parliament of Canada (6 Edw. VII. ch. 129, sec. 6) to obtain the consent of the municipality before they could enter upon its streets and the Quebec legislature (8 Edw. VII. ch. 97) approved of the by-law under which the railway company occupies those streets. To justify the charge of unjust discrimination between two adjoining municipalities on the ground of difference of treatment it is necessary that all the circumstances connected with the cost of construction and operation of the railway should be considered and the conditions under which the railway obtained the permission from the municipality to enter upon the streets should be taken into account in this case as any other item in the cost of construction. If in the absence of an agreement the company had been obliged to make a large money payment to obtain the consent of the municipality to enter upon its streets, it is possible that the charge to the passengers to or from that municipality would have been the same as in the case of Mount Royal and the reasonableness of the charge made to the residents of the latter municipality is not to be determined by a mere comparison with the charge made in the adjoining municipality without any knowledge of the circumstances under which the lesser fare is collected.\nI am also of opinion that the Board had no power or authority to compel the Montreal Street Railway, a provincial corporation, to enter into an agreement for the purpose of enabling the appellants to carry out the order made against them with respect to transfers to all points on all lines operated by the Montreal Street Railway in the Town of Westmount or the City of Montreal. The passenger in possession of a transfer goes from one train to another, that is to say, passes from a railway owned or operated by a corporation under the control of the Dominion Parliament to a railway owned or operated by a corporation under the control of a provincial legislature, and the conditions under which the latter company is to carry its passengers from one point to another upon its own railway is not to be determined by the Dominion Board of Railway Commissioners.\nGirouard J.\u2014It is admitted that the rate charged for railway transportation on the Island Railway and The Montreal Street Railway to passengers from Mount Royal Ward, in the City of Montreal, was greater than that charged to passengers from Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce. The railway company met this complaint by tendering in evidence a contract with the Town of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce by virtue of which passengers from that municipality became entitled to some favourable treatment. The Board, however, declined to consider this contract, holding that it was not proper for them to do so, being a private agreement, and ordered the stopping of the differential rates as amounting to \"unjust discrimination\" and finally ordered that the railway company do enter into an agreement with the Montreal Street Railway for the purpose of removing the said discrimination.\nThe question is: Was the Board justified in refusing to take consideration of said contract?\nIn my humble opinion I think it was the duty of the Board to consider that contract. The contract was legal, being in fact expressly provided for by section 18 of the \"Cities and Towns Act,\" 3 Edw. VII. ch. 38 (Que.). That statute empowers cities and towns to grant, under certain conditions, rights, franchise and privileges as may be agreed upon, such as running rights over streets, exemption from taxation and exclusive franchise. The Island Railway was therefore bound to get the consent of the municipality before acquiring these rights which were granted by the above contract. How can it be said that in such a case there can be \"unjust\" discrimination?\nMoreover, I do not understand how the Board can lawfully order the Island Company, true a federal railway, to obtain from the Montreal Street Railway, a provincial railway, an agreement to remove the said discrimination. In my humble opinion railways like the Street Railway Company are entirely out of the jurisdiction of the Railway Board.\nI would therefore allow the appeal of the said Island Railway Company with costs against the City of Montreal.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014Appeal re \"unjust discrimination\" in traffic.\nThis appeal from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners arises out of an application made by the City of Montreal to the Board for an order directing the Montreal Park and Island Railway to grant the same facilities in the way of services and operation, including the rates to be charged by it to the people residing in Mount Royal Ward of the city, that it grants to the adjoining Town of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce, which adjoins but is outside of the city limits.\nAfter a lengthy hearing (the Montreal Street Railway, a provincial road, having been made a party to the proceedings) the Board made the desired order, and further directed that with respect to \"through traffic\" over the Park and Island Railway and the Montreal Street Railway the latter road should enter into the necessary agreements with the Park and Island Road to ensure the carrying out of the order.\nBoth railway companies have appealed to this court, the street railway on the ground of want of jurisdiction in the Board to deal with \"through traffic\" over its lines, and the Park and Island Road, on the ground that in determining whether or not the rates charged by them to and from the Town of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce and those charged to and from Mount Royal Ward unjustly discriminated against the latter, the Board refused to consider an agreement made between the railway and Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce fixing for certain considerations in the agreement expressed rates to and from that town.\nOn the appeal relating to the jurisdiction of the Board to deal with the question of through rates[2] I have already given my opinion affirming the Board's jurisdiction, to which I need do no more than refer.\nThe question 1103V for decision is a narrow though most important one.\nThe form in which it is put by the Board in granting leave to appeal on a matter of law is \"whether it is right or proper for the Board in making the said order to overlook the contract bearing date the 7th November, 1907, and made between the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company and the Municipality of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce.\"\nThe contract in question was put in evidence at the hearing and is printed in the appeal case before us, but it is perfectly plain from the reasons given by Chief Commissioner Mabee that the Board refused to consider that contract or give weight to it in making their order. I interpret 'the question of law we are asked to answer to mean as if put in this form: Was the Board justified in refusing to consider that contract in determining the question of \"unjust discrimination?\" And I would answer that it was. Mr. Geoffrion in his argument before us contended that it was a piece of evidence they were bound to consider and could not ignore, though, of course, he admitted that the weight they should give it was entirely for the Board and could not be considered by us.\nIn order to determine then whether or not the Board could ignore the agreement we must look at its terms and the conditions existing at the time it was entered into. The contention was that the right of the company to run its railway or tramway along the streets of any municipality was by the express terms of its charter made to depend upon the consent of the municipality being first obtained by by-law (see section 6 of 6 Edw. VII. ch. 129), and that in order to obtain such consent the company had been obliged to stipulate for the carriage of the passengers between Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce and the City of Montreal at a certain rate. Such being the case it was argued that while there might be discrimination between that agreed rate and the rate charged to and from the adjoining ward of the city, such discrimination was not \"unjust\" and that it was \"unjust discrimination\" alone which the statute provided against.\nI am not prepared to say that even if the company was obliged in order to obtain the privilege of running its railway along the streets of a municipality, to pay for the privilege, they could adopt such a mode of payment as would enable them to discriminate against an adjoining municipality in the matter of rates. They could pay for the privilege in cash or in any other way they agreed with the municipality, but they could not, in my opinion, adopt a mode of compensation for the concession of the right which they could afterwards invoke to excuse or justify, either directly or indirectly, discrimination. So far as the municipality discriminated against and those using the railway to and from it were concerned the discrimination was not the less unjust because the company chose to adopt this mode of payment for the privilege of laying down their rails in the streets and operating their road. The 315th section of the \"Railway Act\" which governs the case was enacted to secure so far as might be possible equality of rates under \"substantially similar circumstances and conditions.\" The 4th sub-section is peremptory, \"no toll shall be charged which unjustly discriminates between different localities.\" Does the fact that instead of paying a round sum in cash or otherwise to one locality for the privilege of running its road over certain streets the company for reasons of its own agrees instead to charge a low toll or rate to and from that locality; justify it in refusing to give to an adjoining locality, other conditions being equal, the same rate, and in this way create a discrimination which as between the two localities is unjust. If cash was paid for the privilege could they plead that in justification of the discrimination? If the cost of the building of the road to one locality exceeded that of the cost to another, could such excess in cost be advanced to justify the discrimination and prove it not to be unjust? Are these elements and facts which the Board have to inquire into and weigh when determining what is \"unjust discrimination\"? If they are there is no end to the discrimination which companies might create and not contravene the Act. If it was otherwise held and if a company could refuse to one locality rates which they had conceded to another under substantially similar circumstances and conditions and make the granting of the lower rates dependant upon the locality granting concessions to them it seems to me it would amount practically to a transfer to the company of the powers now vested in the Board of determining rates as between localities. I agree with the Chairman when he says \"we cannot take into consideration matters of that sort in the administration of this law.\" But apart from all that, I fail to find in the agreement put in evidence any such consideration paid by the company for the privilege of using the streets of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce. The agreement as to rates with the municipality of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce was not for the privilege simply or for that privilege at all. It was for an exclusive franchise for operating its road on the ground surface for passengers, freight and mails within the limits of the town for fifty years, and also for exemption forever from payment of municipal taxes, which the town might at any time have power to levy on the company, its movable or immovable property or franchises, with certain limited and specified exceptions.\nIt was this exclusive privilege for half a century, and this exemption forever from taxes, which the company was buying from the town which formed the consideration for the rate or toll of five cents agreed upon. It was not the mere purchase of the consent required by statute for the laying of the rails. That statutory permission to use the streets simply for the running of the tramway does not appear on the face of the agreement to be part of the consideration at all (see section 7 of the agreement). It was the monopoly and the exemption the company was buying, something the \"Railway Act\" certainly was not passed to encourage and neither of which could be held to be a \"circumstance or condition\" which the Board should consider in determining the question of \"unjust discrimination.\"\nThe municipalities which would grant similar monopolies and exemptions would, I presume, get in return the lower rates. Those that would refuse would have to pay the higher and so the unjust discrimination clause would be practically defeated. The Railway Board brought into existence to prevent amongst other things unjust discrimination was asked practically, by giving weight to the agreement in this case, to sanction the practice.\nI do not stop to inquire as to the legality of such an agreement by a municipality. It is said the agreement was subsequently validated by the local legislature. But if it was that would not justify it being invoked and given weight to by a Dominion Board acting under a Dominion Act in a proceeding to determine what was or was not \"unjust discrimination\" in rates or tolls upon railways as between different localities. Such validation if it took place goes no further than confirming an act of the municipality which certainly without express legislative authority would be ultra vires the municipality.\nUnder the 77th section of the Act the burden of proving that the lower toll was not unjust discrimination rests upon the company and is not, in my opinion, discharged in any degree by shewing that the lower rate was a consideration for a monopoly of railway privileges and an exemption from taxation purchased by the company from the locality to which they had granted such lower rate. It is, to my mind, impossible to conceive how the purchase of such a monopoly and exemption could operate to make that discrimination just which otherwise would be unjust. Neither the monopoly nor the exemption were necessary to the operation of the road. They were merely incidents the possession and enjoyment of which would make those operations more profitable for the company, but at the expense of the public, and the destruction of any possible competition. My brother Idington has called my attention to the case of Holwell Iron Co., Ltd v. Midland Railway Co.[3]. It was an appeal from a decision of the Railway and Canal Commissioners[4], and being a decision by the Court of Appeal, confirming that of the Commissioners, is of course entitled to the greatest respect. The facts of that case were such as to make the decision of little service to us on this appeal. There an agreement was attacked which had been entered into forty years previously between the Railway Company and the Stavely Hill Iron Co. The railway at that distant period wanted to acquire a strip of land running right through the property of the Stavely Co. on which a private line was laid and also other lines of the Stavely Co. It was obvious, as the Master of the Rolls said, that the claim for severance would be enormous unless provision was made for conveying coal and iron and other materials to and from the company's property on each side of the line. Accordingly the railway company, acting under special powers, purchased from the Stavely Co. the land and railways in question, and all locomotives, engines, etc., belonging to the railways and used for the purposes of the company's business. The consideration was \u00a329,788 plus an agreement on the railway company's part to continue to efficiently work the whole of the traffic of or connected with the Stavely Company's business as it had previously been worked by the latter company. It was these terms which it was contended amounted to the railway company granting exceptional terms to the Stavely Company to the prejudice of the appellants. The question there determined involved the proper construction of section 27 of the \"Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888,\" providing against \"undue preference\" being given by a railway company to one rival trader as against another trader. The Court of Appeal held that the inequality of rates complained of might be explained and accounted for by a fair and honest bargain, the consideration for which had been duly conveyed to and enjoyed by the railway company. The Master of the Rolls was of the opinion that the only question of law open to the appellants was that the agreement was one which the Commissioners could not look at because it was illegal and void, and that when once this point of law was decided in the negative the Commissioners should give it consideration. He winds up his opinion, however, with the following pregnant words: \"Nothing that I have said is intended to apply except to a case where land is taken and arrangements are made for what is to be done on and with reference to the land so taken\" As he had previously said: \"It (the agreement) only provides for certain services to be rendered by the railway company on land the subject-matter of the agreement. It in no way resembles an agreement to purchase goods in return for future gratuitous services to be rendered by the purchaser to the vendor.\"\nLooking at the statute the court was there construing and the special facts of 'the case on which the decision turned, I cannot say that it is an authority for one or other of the rival contentions in this appeal, though I think the principle underlying the decision to be gathered from the last few sentences of the opinion of the Master of the Rolls quoted by me above supports the ruling in the case before us of the Board of Commissioners.\nFor the reasons I have given I would dismiss this appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014The decision in the Montreal Street Railway Company's appeal from the same order as made herein renders the question -submitted rather of an academical character.\nI should have preferred this decision postponed until the judgment passed upon by the court above in review of said decision if to be appealed.\nWe may assume that the Board has jurisdiction over this appellant, but until we know whether or not our decision in the other case is to stand the conflicting considerations bearing upon the question asked are somewhat perplexing.\nAt the threshold stands the question of the validity of the contract between the two companies.\nWe have not had it argued in all its bearings and much less so in the new light our decision presents it.\nFor the reasons I have given in the other case I think it is valid. Amongst other reasons I have given is that which I find in an Act cited confirming this company's contract, but the view I have presented as derived therefrom was not touched in argument, if I remember correctly.\nYet the Board held or assumed it invalid or to be ended in some way.\nIf ended how can appellant, having doubtless contracted with Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce on the faith of that contract continuing, be dealt with justly without an examination of the contract now in question and all that upon which it is founded ?\nIs the contract valid or is it invalid by reason of infringing the policy of the \"Railway Act\"? Or is sub-section 7, of section 317, of the \"Railway Act,\" which in terms does not include contracts like this, to be taken as the boundary of that policy and comprehending everything of a contractual nature which is to be held prohibited and void ?\nThe appellant is surely entitled to know on what ground the Board proceeds and if it declares the contract a violation of the Act, and hence invalid and the franchise gone as an obvious result of illegality, the appellant may when directed to equalize its rates or fares prefer equalizing by levelling up rather than a general lowering.\nIndeed, it may be a financial impossibility to do otherwise.\nThe power given by 8 Edw. VII. ch. 97 (of Quebec), validating the by-law of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce had, so far as that legislature could, authorized the contract with the appellant to grant the franchise.\nThe appellant had been given by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 129 (of the Dominion), the right to run upon the streets of a municipality, but only by and with the latter's consent.\nIs there any implication therein that the terms contained in such consent are authorized? In solving such a question the well-known practice of engrafting on such consents specific contracts can hardly have been overlooked by Parliament.\nI express no opinion. I merely suggest. Is there not an implication that Parliament has sanctioned what is now complained of?\nMany other views occur to me but, in any way I can look, I see no escape from a consideration of the agreement in order that justice be done.\nIt could never have been the purpose of Parliament to remove all inequality by violating manifest principles of justice.\nCertainty the powers of the Board given in some cases to sanction inequality do not indicate that anything but justice, and not mere inequality, is to be the sole guide.\nThe case of The Holwell Iron Co. v. Midland Railway Co.[5], of which the report has come to hand since argument herein, suggests the way the Court of Appeal in England looked at an analogous case and statute, where the court was confined, as we are, to the mere issue of jurisdiction. With what inference of fact the Board may draw we have nothing to do.\nI would allow the appeal without costs for the same reasons as in the other case[6] so far as applicable.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014By an order of the Board signed by the Assistant Chief Commissioner of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, No. 7975, leave was granted to the Montreal Park and Island Railway\nto appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the order (No. 7405) dated the 4th of May, 1909, upon the following question, which is hereby declared to be in the opinion of the Board a question of law, viz.: whether it is right or proper for the Board in making the said order to overlook the contract bearing date the 7th day of November, 1907, and made between the said Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. and the Municipality of Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce.\nThe \"Railway Act\" (section 56, sub-section 3) makes conclusive the opinion of the Board that any question, in regard to which leave to appeal is granted by it, is a question of law; and upon such leave being given the right of appeal is conferred.\nThe question, stated in the order granting leave above quoted, considered merely in itself, appears to be susceptible of more than one interpretation. It might refer to an entire exclusion of the contract as evidence, so that the Board would not be apprised of its nature and purport, or it might refer to a refusal by the Board, though fully apprised of the nature and terms of the contract, to treat its existence or the consideration upon which it is founded or the rights and obligations to which it gives rise as facts which should influence the Board in determining the issue of unjust discrimination with which they were dealing. I exclude accidental or inadvertent omission to take the contract into consideration as something which it cannot have been intended to submit, although the expression \"to overlook\" is more often used to cover such a case than any other. An entire exclusion of the contract\u2014in the sense of a refusal to receive it in evidence, based upon its' inadmissibility\u2014would raise a question of law. But upon a determination by the Board, with the contract before it and full knowledge of its purport and effect and of the circumstances in which it was entered into, that no weight should be given to these facts or conditions in deciding whether there had or had not been unjust discrimination, a question of law cannot, I venture to think, arise, in view of the provisions of section 318 that\nthe Board may determine as questions of fact whether or not traffic is or has been carried under substantially similar circumstances and conditions and whether there has in any case been unjust discrimination, etc.\nNevertheless, if the question upon which the Board intended to give leave to appeal be whether or not it has the right so to determine, the statute apparently precludes our treating it as a question of fact notwithstanding that, under section 318, an issue of unjust discrimination is to be disposed of as a question of fact. Upon an examination of the record I find that the agreement referred to was admitted in evidence. I find that its terms were discussed and the report of the proceedings leaves no doubt in my mind that the Board was fully apprised of those terms and of the circumstances in which the contract was made. The remarks of the learned Chief Commissioner in disposing of the complaint of unjust discrimination make it abundantly clear to me that he was cognizant of all these matters. It is equally clear that he determined that proof of the existence of these facts and conditions would not aid the railway company in establishing to the satisfaction of the Board that the discrimination which had been shewn or admitted was not unjust within the meaning of the \"Railway Act.\" It would, therefore, seem that the question upon which it was really intended to give leave to appeal was not whether the contract and the circumstances surrounding it should be excluded as inadmissible evidence, but was in reality whether, having before it the contract and all necessary and proper information and evidence in regard thereto, it was right and proper for the Board to decide that no weight or effect should be given to these facts and circumstances in the determination of the question whether the discrimination is or is not unjust in this particular case.\nThat the evidence in question was admissible, if for no other reason, to enable the Board properly to consider whether or not the special rates accorded by the appellants to passengers to and from Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce are in the interests of the public, I entertain no doubt. If the giving of these special rates was not \"necessary for the purpose of securing * * * the traffic in respect of which\" they are given, so as to bring this case within section 319\u2014it seems obvious that there may be cases covered by that section which closely resemble this case. It is, I think, impossible to say that in no circumstances and under no conditions can an agreement for special rates be in the public interest, or be something which may affect the justice or injustice of a discrimination. But the admissibility of such evidence is one matter; the weight to be attached to it, or whether it is entitled to any weight in any particular case are very different matters; and it is because of the disregard of the contract by the Board in determining not to give it any weight in this case, that, if at all, the appellants may have ground for complaint.\nAgain, the words, \"whether it is right or proper, etc.,\" present an ambiguity and a difficulty. If they mean whether the Board had the right, in the sense of the power, to disregard these matters as not entitled to weight in determining the justice or injustice of the particular discrimination (which may perhaps be regarded as a question of law) in view of the provisions of section 318 that question must, I think, be answered affirmatively. But if, as was argued, it was intended that this court should be asked to say whether, having the power so to deal with this evidence, the Board properly exercised that power and properly determined that these matters were not entitled to weight in disposing of the issue before it, I am, with respect, unable to conceive how that can be regarded as a question of law. The weight and effect which should be given by the Board to any evidence adduced before it upon an issue of unjust discrimination must in view of the provisions of section 318 be always a question of fact. I think we should therefore assume that the Board did not intend to give leave to appeal upon this possible aspect of the question stated in the order.\nTo summarize: If, notwithstanding that the contract was in fact admitted in evidence and its terms and the circumstances in which it was made were apparently placed fully before the Board and were considered by it for the purpose of determining whether any weight should in the circumstances of this case be attached to them, the question for our determination is whether this evidence was or was not admissible, and if I thought that what had taken place was really an exclusion of the evidence as irrelevant, I would be of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. But, having regard to the proceedings before the Board and to the remarks of the learned Chief Commatter. I therefore conclude that the real question submitted is whether or not, as a matter of law, the Board submitted is whether, as a matter of law, the Board in dealing with this evidence, which was before it, had the right \"to overlook\" or disregard it, in the sense of putting it out of consideration, because it was in their opinion, in the circumstances of this case, not entitled to weight; and to that question, in my opinion, having regard to section 318 of the Act, the answer must be that in so doing the Board was within its rights.\nAs already stated I cannot conceive that the Board intended to submit for our consideration the question \u2014what weight, if any, should be given by it to such a contract as a circumstance affecting an issue of unjust discrimination; and as this is apparently not necessarily the construction of the question as stated, I think we should not assume that this was the question upon which the Board gave leave to appeal as a question of law. Neither do I understand that we are asked to determine, as an abstract question, whether or not, under any or all circumstances, the policy of the \"Railway Act\" requires that the Board should refuse to attach any weight to an agreement between a railway company and a municipality which provides for special rates, on the ground that its existence can in no circumstances have any bearing upon an issue of unjust discrimination. We are dealing with an appeal .in a concrete case and I confine my expression of opinion entirely to that case.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson, Hague & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ethier & Co.\n[1] 43 Can.

Cf. The Queen v Farwell (14 Can. S.C.R. 392).\nJudgment appealed from (12 Ex. C.R. 295) affirmed. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] whereby, with a variation of the findings of the e referee that the Lillooet River, in British Columbia, was a navigable river, the action was maintained with costs.\nThe action was by information filed by the Attorney-General of Canada, on behalf of His Majesty, whereby it was alleged:\n\"1. That pursuant to the agreement of the Government of British Columbia contained in article 11 of the \"Terms of Union\" upon which the Colony of British Columbia was admitted into the Dominion of Canada[2], the legislature of British Columbia by 'An Act to grant Public Lands on the Mainland to the Dominion in aid of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 1880' (43 Vict. ch. 11, as amended by 47 Vict. ch. 14), granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing, and to aid in the construction of, the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, in trust to be appropriated as the Dominion Government might deem advisable, the public lands along the line of the railway before mentioned, as therein particularly mentioned, and which lands are hereinafter called the 'Railway Belt'[3].\n\"2. That both the Lillooet River, which is a tributary of the Pitt River, and the Lillooet Lakes, from which it rises, are wholly situate within the limits of the said 'Railway Belt.' The Lillooet River is about twelve miles long, and is a public and navigable stream. \"3. That the defendant is an incorporated company, having its head office in the City of Vancouver, B.C.\n\"4. That on the 7th of April, 1906, upon the application of the defendant company, the Water Commissioner for the District of New Westminster, assuming to act under the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897,\" ch. 190, B.S.B.C., purported to grant the said company, at the annual rent and for the consideration therein mentioned, a record of 25,000 inches of water (subject to certain reservations) out of the said Lillooet Lakes and tributaries, and Lillooet River and its tributaries, such water to be used for generating electricity, for light, heat, and power, and for milling, manufacturing, industrial and mechanical purposes, at or near lot 404, New Westminster District, and to be diverted from its source at a point at or near the outlet of the lower Lillooet Lake and to be returned at a point at or near lot 404, group 1, New Westminster District, and to be stored or diverted by means of dams, pipes, flumes and ditches.\n\"5. That on the public lands forming part of the 'Railway Belt' and adjoining the said Lillooet Lakes and Lillooet River, is a large quantity of valuable timber, which is entitled of right to be floated down the said river, and the said alleged grant and the diversion thereby authorized will materially interfere with the said right.\n\"6. That the said alleged grant and the rights under the 'Water Clauses Consolidation Act' thereto attached will materially interfere with the rights of the Dominion Government in the 'Railway Belt.'\n\"7. That the capacity of the Lillooet River is about 25,000 inches, and the alleged grant and the proposed diversion thereby authorized will greatly diminish the quantity of water in the said river and materially interfere with the rights of the Dominion Government.\n\"8. That the alleged grant and the proposed diversion thereby authorized will materially interfere with the public right of navigation in the said river.\n\"9. That section 91 of the 'British North America Act, 1867,' provides that the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the following (amongst other) classes of subjects:\n(1) The public debt and property.\n(10) Navigation and shipping. \"10. That sub-section (2) of section 131 of the 'Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897\/ provides that the power conferred by the first sub-section, of entering and taking Crown Lands, shall not extend to lands which shall be expressly reserved by the Crown for any purpose whatever.\"\nThe claim was for (a) a declaration that the grant of the water-record was invalid and conveyed no interest to the company and that it should be cancelled; (5) a declaration that it was invalid as being an interference with property subject to the exclusive authority of the Dominion of Canada; (c) a declaration that it was invalid as being an interference with the public right of navigation and the right of floating timber down the said river; (d) a declaration that it was invalid and unauthorized by or under the provisions of the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897\"; (e) and an injunction to restrain the company from applying under the provisions of the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897,\" for approval of its undertaking and from taking any further steps in regard thereto. The defence denied the allegations of the information, stated that it disclosed no cause of action, and that, in any event, the water-record or grant in question could not be declared invalid or cancelled except upon petition of the Attorney-General or other proper representative of the Province of British Columbia.\nAn order was made referring the determination of the issues of fact in the case to Mr. Justice Martin, a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and, by consent, the Attorney-General of British Columbia was added as a party defendant representing the interests of British Columbia, and appeared before the referee and took part in the proceedings. The referee made his report as follows:\n\"1. The allegations, founded upon certain statutes, contained in the first, ninth and tenth paragraphs of the information were not considered proper subjects of discussion before me under said order of reference.\n\"2. The allegations of fact contained in the third paragraph of said information were admitted.\n\"3. The allegations of fact contained in paragraph four of said information have been proved. It is to be explained that the given point of return of the water diverted from said lakes and rivers, i.e., 'at or near lot 404, group 1, New Westminster District,' is not on the Lillooet River, but on Kanaka Creek, which creek at its nearest point is distant from said river about two miles to the south, and said creek discharges into the Fraser River.\n\"4. The allegations of fact contained in the fifth paragraph of said information have been proved.\n\"5. The allegations of fact contained in the sixth and seventh paragraphs of said information have been proved, and the rights of the Dominion, which have been materially interfered with, include navigation, timber, and fisheries; the result of defendant's proposed undertaking upon the salmon (sockeye) spawning beds in the lake would be specially detrimental, not to speak of the harmful effect upon that fish and other kinds of salmon and trout caused by the reduction of the ordinary volume of water in the river, thereby curtailing the spawning area and probably entirely preventing fish from ascending to the upper reaches of the river at the proper season of the year.\n\"6. The allegations of fact contained in the eighth paragraph of said information have been proved.\n\"7. With respect to the second paragraph of said information the allegations of fact therein contained that both the Lillooet River, which is a tributary of the Pitt River, and the Lillooet Lakes, from which it rises, are wholly situate within the limits of the said 'Railway Belt,' have been proved. Counsel for the defence and for the Attorney-General of British Columbia adduced a considerable body of evidence to shew that the sources of supply of said lakes were to a large extent outside the said 'Railway Belt,' but I have not entered upon the consideration of that matter because in my opinion it is an immaterial issue which it would not be profitable to pursue.\n\"With respect to the allegation in the same paragraph that the Lillooet River is about twelve miles long, and is a public and navigable stream, the evidence establishes the fact that the river is a tidal one for between five and six miles and a navigable one for a distance of upwards of nine miles from its mouth (at Pitt River). Of said nine miles, nearly six miles, up to what is called the town-line bridge, are navigable for power craft of various sizes. Said bridge has prevented any evidence, based on actual experiment, being offered of the capacity of the stream above it for power craft, but the evidence points to the belief that a little and inexpensive work would enable such craft to go up another mile or so. Above the said bridge loggers' and other boats can go up for two or three miles, say about nine miles in all, nearly any time of the year. The balance of the river (which, as a whole, is probably nearer thirteen miles long than twelve, though there is no exact measurement) is for the most part of a different character, the stream becoming much swifter and narrower, and its use is made more difficult by riffles and rapids of varying depth and strength, and shallow and rocky places through which the channel makes its way with less or more facility according to the height of water. There are no falls in the river, and the rapids or shoals are not of a size or nature to prevent prospectors', fishermen's and loggers' loaded boats, of about twenty feet in length being labouriously poled or 'tracked' by line, following the more or less contracted channel, up to the lake during any part of the year, except at the top of freshets, which are of uncertain occurrence owing to their being largely caused by the varying rain or snow fall in the mountains surrounding the lakes.\n\"The river is not obstructed by ice, and is capable of being used to drive logs in a commercial sense for between eight or nine months in the year, the time for so doing depending upon the freshets, which do not as a rule occur in the latter part of June, or in July or August, or till the latter part of September. The river, as a whole, is not of so turbulent a nature as streams which are generally met with in the mountainous section of British Columbia, and it has more than the average natural facilities for driving logs.\n\"It is contended for the defence that the stream has no higher claim to be considered navigable than that portion of the Miramichi River above Price's Bend, which is described in the Queen v. Robertson[4], at page 129, and which was held not to be navigable, but in my opinion it is impossible to really compare the two streams in view of the somewhat meagre description given of the Miramichi. The fact that boats can only utilize a portion of a stream in the ascent thereof by resorting to more or less slow or labourious methods does not of itself determine its navigability any more than does the fact that the descent may be correspondingly swift and easy. In my opinion it comes to a question of degree, and regard must be had to the custom and nature of the country and the manner in which such streams are utilized by those experienced in their nature and peculiarities. The well-known navigation by steamboats of certain turbulent rivers in this province might well be regarded as an impossibility by those who had not the local knowledge and experience. I feel that the question is not an easy one to decide, but after giving due effect to the evidence and argument, I have been unable to reach any other conclusion than that this river is a navigable one.\"\nThe judgment appealed from (rendered on an appeal from the report of the referee), varied the referee's finding as to the river being navigable and declared the grant of the water-record invalid, (a) as being an interference with property subject to the exclusive authority of the Dominion of Canada; (b) because the diversion of water intended to be authorized thereunder will be a serious interference with the navigability of the river; (c) because the said record is not authorized by or under the provisions of the statute of British Columbia, the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897.\" The order was for the cancellation of the grant of the water-record and that the company should be restrained from applying under the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897,\" for approval of its undertaking and from taking any further steps in regard thereto.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellants and cross-respondents. The question, shortly stated, is: Has the Province of British Columbia lost its right to legislate over the \"Railway Belt?\" We contend that it has not lost that right, though it transferred the beneficial interest in the lands within the \"Railway Belt\" to the Dominion of Canada. It still has jurisdiction to pass laws with respect to the lands in the province, situate within that \"Railway Belt,\" and the water-rights incident to such lands. No agreement between the Dominion and the province can have the effect of altering their respective legislative jurisdictions as established by the constitutional Acts. The Imperial Order in Council of 16th May, 1871[5], has the force and effect of Imperial legislation and is to be read with the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" as part of the constitution of British Columbia. This leaves the provincial jurisdiction unimpaired. There has been no \"carving out\" of a portion of British Columbia as federal territory and investing the Dominion with legislative powers over the tract of lands in question. During the argument council discussed the decisions in The Queen v. Farwell[6]; The Attorney- General of British Columbia v. The Attorney-General of Canada[7]; and the following cases were cited: Keewatin Power Co. v. The Town of Kenora[8]; McGregor v. The Esquimault and Nanaimo Railway Co.[9]; The Esquimault Waterworks Co. v. The City of Victoria[10]; Klondyke Government Concession v. Macdonald[11], per Duff J., at page 91; and Hartley v. Carson[12], per Gwynne J., at pages 654, 658, 659, 680, and 681.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondent and cross-appellant. The rights or powers which the company proposes to exercise depend solely upon the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897,\" of British Columbia, and it is impossible that the \"Railway Belt,\" if part of the public property of Canada, can be affected by provincial legislation, since it is provided by section 91 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" that the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends, among other matters, to \"(1) The public debt and property.\" The title of the Dominion to the \"Railway Belt\" is clear, and is assured by the \"Terms of Union\" and Act of the legislature.\nWe refer to The Queen v. Farwell6, per Strong J., at page 425; Farwell v. The Queen[13], per King J., at pages 560, 561; Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[14]; Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada [15], at pages 301-305; The St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[16], at pages 55-59; Ontario Mining Company v. Seybold[17]; Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario[18], at pages 210-211; and McGregor v. Esquimault and Nanaimo Railway Co.[19].\nThe diversion of the Lillooet River, whereby the riparian rights are destroyed and a useful waterway is converted into a dry river bed, and the building of dams, ditches, pipes and flumes for this purpose, all upon the property of the Crown, and without the consent or license of the Crown, are acts of interference which cannot be authorized except by legislation; and for such legislation the Parliament of Canada is the only competent authority.\nIt has been contended that the litigation was premature, as the grant to the company had not yet been approved by the Lieutenant-Governer in Council, or in so far as a right to an injunction was concerned. The company was taking the statutory steps. It had made its application, obtained its grant from the Water Commissioner, thus shewing its intention, and when this action was brought it insisted upon the validity of. the grant, and the power of the local authorities to authorize the works. It is still insisting upon the same thing. Presumably if this action had not been brought the works would have been already constructed and in operation. If an intention to do the act complained of can be shewn to exist, or if a man insists on his right to do, or begins to do, or threatens to do, or gives notice of his intention to do an act which must, in the opinion of the court, if completed, give a ground of action, there is a foundation for the exercise of this jurisdiction. Kerr on Injunctions (4 ed.), pages 13 and 14. It is not necessary that the breach in respect of which the interference of the court is sought should have been actually committed; it is enough that the defendant claims and insists on his right to do the act complained of, although he may not have actually done it. Kerr on Injunctions (4 ed.), page 358. The action has been commenced and the liability is denied at the bar, consequently, there is a right to claim indemnity by action. Hobbs v. Wayet[20], per Kekewich J.\nThe \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897,\" must be construed as not intended to apply to the \"Railway Belt,\" because of the incapacity of the local legislature to extend the provisions of the Act to the public property of Canada.\nThe grant and the works proposed to be executed thereunder are ultra vires of the local legislature to authorize as affecting navigation, which is under the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe referee finds that the Lillooet River is a navigable one, and this finding was only varied upon appeal by the declaration that it is a public and navigable river for a distance of upwards of nine miles from its mouth at Pitt River. Both the referee and the court appealed from hold that the proposed works would seriously interfere with the navigation. These findings are amply supported by the evidence.\nThe proposed works would destroy or interfere with the fisheries of the Lillooet River and also of the lakes, and, consequently, could only be authorized by Parliament, in virtue of its exclusive legislative authority with regard to \"Seacoast and Inland Fisheries.\"\nIt is contended, on the cross-appeal, that there is no occasion or sufficient reason for varying the finding of the referee that the Lillooet River is navigable. This finding must be construed secundum subjectam materiam. The issue is as to whether the flow of water in the Lillooet River is such as to give the river the quality of navigability. The execution of the proposed works would divert the water from the river, and destroy navigation. It is properly found that the river is navigable, and that its character as a navigable river is not affected by the conditions of the stream at or immediately below its origin or outlet from the Lillooet Lakes.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondent and cross-appellant.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellants and cross-respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff. In view of the grounds upon which the majority of the court dispose of the main appeal, it is not considered necessary or desirable to deal with the cross-appeal.\nGirouard J.\u2014I think we are bound by the decision in The Queen v. Farwell[21], and, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. concurred with Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal must be resolved by the meaning of the agreement between the Dominion and British Columbia. I do not see why, though I will presently refer thereto, the local legislation relative to the use of water, should be of any significance in arriving at a determination of what the parties concerned had agreed upon or set forth in writing as agreed upon.\nSpeaking in general terms, there existed in English law at the time of the formation of the contract in question, a clear and definite meaning of what the term land (when used in contracts relative thereto) implied, which seems inconsistent with the exceedingly restricted meaning sought to be attached to it in the contract in question.\nAs between two such British colonies as these concerned therein dealing with regard to lands, I submit the principles of the English law must be kept in view and the primary meaning of the words \"public lands\" must be what that law would impute to such a term. The instrument must be read, of course, in light of the surrounding circumstances and the nature of the business the parties thereto had in hand as well as what the terms and conditions expressed in regard thereto must reasonably imply.\nThe question raised is not such as the precious metals case involved for the terms owning or conveying land have so passed current as meaning that of an ownership thereof that implied the exclusion of that covered by the prerogative rights of the Crown in or over the royal metals. And for that reason the court held, having regard to the nature of the contract and the instrument in question in the precious metals case, that the terms \"public lands\" was used in this restricted sense.\nIt seems to me that case is rather against than for the appellant. If appellant's present contention that the right which passed to the Dominion must be not only subject to, but as a consequence limited by, what a British Columbia legislature, acting within its powers over civil rights, either had chosen or might choose to determine, is sound then there need never have been the trouble there was to decide that case.\nApart from that and before proceeding to consider the relation of such legislation to the land in question I would ask how can the term \"public lands'' be in the ordinary use of language so restricted as to imply an absolute severance in title in or to the land from the title in or to the use of all that water which is needed to make the land valuable and the use of which in law usually goes with it?\nIs it to be supposed that it was contemplated as competent for the party making such a concession of public lands, forty miles wide and hundreds of miles long, of its Own volition, so to drain therefrom the water thereon to serve other lands and uses on either side thereof as to leave this strip a barren waste?\nIt may be replied that the party granting was as deeply interested as the grantee in avoiding such a result. But it is as \"a commercial transaction\" the matter has to be considered in the first place, and next as a project of colonization.\nThe case in hand presents a good illustration of what a profitable use may be made of the water elsewhere and for other purposes and if uniformly persisted in how destructive of its commercial or settlement uses the exercise of such a power over the waters of and on the land may become.\nBesides the land needing water for ordinary purposes, their irrigation may be a prime necessity to rendering them or any part of them worth anything for the purpose of settling them profitably or advantageously.\nThe grant is one of such magnitude that it would seem impossible for any one ever to have considered the acceptance thereof as something of value when undertaking to settle the lands without the water\u2014the first necessity of the settler being in the power of the grantee assuming such a duty, either to give or assure the settler thereof or help him to develop its use.\nTo say that the province might do it better is evading the issue. We have not to approve or disapprove of what possibly neither party might with later experience dream of undertaking now.\nThe province, for example, might also lay out better roads, build bridges thereon, and do better all that which the doing so implies.\nBut this pre-eminently local concern of laying out roads or allowances therefor seems impliedly reserved for the Dominion, for the only restrictions the Act making the grant imposes in that regard is that it is not to\naffect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common or public highways existing at the date (of the Act) within the limits of the lands intended to be conveyed.\nThis expression of the legislature's thought then seems in curious contrast with the new view presented, and especially so when we find the local law had provided, by the 46th section of the \"Land Act, 1870,\" that unless otherwise specially noted at the time of sale all Crown lands shall be sold subject to such public rights of way as may be thereafter specified by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and to the right of the Crown to take therefrom without compensation, any stone, gravel or other material to be used in repairing the public roads and to such private right-of-way existing at the time of sale.\nAre these locally useful reservations implied in the grant now in question? Clearly not and that because of the exclusive and comprehensive nature of the grant.\nIt is said ingeniously what use can be made of a right to the water along with these lands when immediately the Dominion grants any of them they must come under the local law which provides for a severance of the right to the water from that of the land.\nI deny that it is so. I admit the land falls as do the rights of the owner within the legislative control of the province.\nI admit the legislature has the power to expropriate the water on the land so soon as it passes out of the Dominion's control. It has not done so.\nI admit it could expropriate the entire land as well as water so soon as it passes out of the Dominion's control, and that even without compensation. It has not done that either.\nHere we have nothing to do with what it may or may not do, but only, if at all, the law as it exists.\nThe argument has in it more than one fallacy. But the chief one is assuming what is not in my view of the law correct. That is, that as a matter of course under the existing law of the legislature the waters on these lands, even if vested in the Dominion now, would, by the grant of the Dominion to another, ipso facto become the property of the Crown in right of the province.\nNo such thing happens. No such thing is provided for or expected. Even the present statute, \"The Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897,\" further advanced, in the way of appropriating to the Crown control of all water, than any of its predecessors, fails to produce such result.\nThe unrecorded water is all it presumes to exercise jurisdiction over, and that is so defined as to exclude from its operation the water held under \"a special grant by public or private Act.\"\nIf I am right in the meaning I attach to the words \"public lands\" in the agreement, and as a result in the statutes intended to carry out the agreement there is an end of the matter in these lands being thus excepted as a public grant.\nBut as so much importance seemed to be attached in argument to the bearing of the local legislation on the agreement, I may proceed and call attention to a few things overlooked in that view.\nNo legislation even in British Columbia has ever affirmed as an absolute proposition of law that unless expressed to the contrary we must in every case of a legislative\" or contractual nature assume that the title to the land carries with it no interest in the water thereon.\nOn the contrary to the present time the right to the use of the water as it passes is still recognized as in the owner of the land\" for domestic and stock supply.\"\nTrue, it is in such reservations spoken of as the property of the Crown, but yet as if in respect of its use by the land owner \"a general right thereto\" existed. It is hard even for legislators having to solve problems such as the water question in British Columbia to think of the matter as if the dissolution of the tenure of land and use or right to water thereon had become absolute. The common law thought dominates, and rightly so unless something is clearly expressed to the contrary.\nNot to go further back than 1870 the year before the agreement, we have to deal with a comprehensive land Act known as the Land Ordinance, 1870.\" In that Act for the purpose thereof \"Crown lands\" were defined to mean all lands of the colony held by the Crown in fee simple.\nWhat did that mean? What did the holding of lands in \"fee simple\" mean? We have no explanation, and when we are seeking to find a basis for complete severance of title in the land from any right in the water we might expect something more explicit than such an ambiguous answer or interpretation of lands and especially of Crown lands.\nWe are not given any definition of the word \"waters,\" What would seem to be enacted in this regard is not a disturbance of the ancient way of looking at land as associated with and carrying with it the title to the use of the water thereon, but a legislative provision which appears in section 30 of the Act providing for the diversion by a named class of any \"unrecorded and unappropriated\" water from\nthe natural channel of the stream or river adjacent to or passing through such land.\nAnd in the same section, following this provision, is this declaration:\nand no person shall have any exclusive right to the use of such water whether the same flow naturally through or over his land except such record shall have been made.\nA similar provision applicable to water privileges for mining or other purposes appears in section 35, where the provision is made for the diversion of water\u201d not otherwise lawfully appropriated.\"\nI venture to think that up to the Act of 1870 and including that Act there was nothing in the legislation of British Columbia or otherwise to warrant the contention that in 1871, at the time of the agreement in question, there was any generally settled legal opinion that the phrase \"Crown lands\" or the phrase \"public lands\" meant more or less than the plain, ordinary meaning of these English words as they had been understood for ages previously.\nI rather think the mining industry was what first induced the enactment of any such provision as looking to taking of the water from land possessed by the Crown or others. Some of the earlier provisions I am unable to find. Their publications ceased as they were repealed or replaced.\nThe earliest of these I have been able to see is in an Act of 1862, which provided for the sale of Crown lands and promoting settlement in the colony and in that Act appeared a provision in favour of miners and giving them the right of carrying water for mining purposes notwithstanding any recorded claim for the purchase of the land.\nThe phrases used to define what water might be taken are worth noting as well as the limited uses for which the taking or diverting was or ever has been permitted.\nThe words used in the \"Land Ordinance\" passed on 11th April, 1865, was \"any unoccupied water\" in section 44 thereof, which was the predecessor of the section 30 above referred to in the later Act of 1870.\nThe \"Land Act of 1875\" used the phrase:\nso much and no more of any unrecorded and unappropriated water, etc. The \"Land Act of 1884\" used the same words as the preceding.\nWhat was done in the way of legislation severing the right in, or to the use of, water from the land, consisted merely in the creation of a statutory easement, so to speak, and in each case in favour of cultivators of land and miners.\nThe ancient law otherwise remained and remains as it was before. In no sense can it be said that the land and the water were universally and uniformly supposed to depend upon separate rights of or in property.\nThe invasion of the common law doctrines in the province had not and has not yet gone so far as to interfere in any way therewith except in the case of, first, \"unoccupied water,\" then, \"unrecorded and unappropriated.\"\nWe are left to guess at or interpret what the word \"unappropriated\" means, there being no legislative interpretation assigned thereto.\nAnother thing worthy of notice is that the basic idea expressed in the agreement was to have\na similar extent of public lands along the line of railway as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands of the North-West Territories and the Province of Manitoba.\nAnd these were given\nin trust to appropriate in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway.\nThese things, to my mind, all point to what was, from a British Columbia point of view, an entirely exceptional agreement as to public lands beyond the ordinary right given by the province to those acquiring any of them in the ordinary way merely by virtue of the \"Land Ordinance, 1870\/' then in force or any succeeding \"Land Ordinance.\"\nAlmost every term of the agreement is quite inconsistent with the encumbering purposes and policies of such Acts. The province substitutes by it another party, possessed of high, though not sovereign, power, for itself to deal with a large proportion of the Crown lands of the province, as it saw fit, unrestricted in any way except that it must bring or try to bring about their settlement.\nThe nature of the agreement is essentially in conflict with the idea that it must conform to the local policy of British Columbia in any other way than that of promoting settlement.\nAnd so far from tending to restrict the primary meaning of the word \"lands\" all these things tend to emphasize it, and, if possible, magnify the importance of the rights given.\nAnother thing to be observed is that in none of these provisions or otherwise had the local Acts relied upon referred to the Crown or pretended in express terms to bind the Crown.\nWaiving the question of the right of the Crown to make grants out of its rivers or lakes or in doing so to be guided by this method of procedure, there is no express enactment in that regard even in these Acts, though the Acts being specially for the administration of the Crown lands may furnish an irresistible inference that for that limited purpose the Crown is bound.\nIt is not intended and never could have been intended to apply to lands held by the Crown in right of the Dominion for other purposes, and which are not at all within the purview of the legislation in question such as \"The Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897.\"\nHence it seems to me idle to maintain in face thereof that the grant to a settler by the Dominion would as of course bring such land within these enactments.\nThe objection was made that an injunction could not be granted, or should not be granted, until application had been made and passed upon by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe jurisdiction asserted is the common one of preventing threatened trespass or waste, and depends not on anything beyond the reasonable apprehension thereof, which is in no way dependent on the action or possible abstention therefrom by another court or authority.\nI have preferred to rest my opinion on the broad right of the Dominion to the use of the water and issue raised in regard to it which is no doubt what the parties concerned desire to have determined rather than upon the narrow one of the possible interference with navigation, which must depend on the facts. These once ascertained as shewing an interference with navigation the Dominion's right is undoubted.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal, though seeing no ground to complain of the judgment in the court below, I would not, unless the parties feel the issue must be decided, think it wise to cumber this record or embarass any future issue by a needless and fruitless declaration of what on this evidence the proper measure is of navigability or how far the navigable nature of the river extends. Duff J.\u2014The scheme of the \"British North America Act, 1867\/' for the distribution of the public property of the provinces held by them at the time of the passing of the Act has been several times explained in the judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. The Receiver-General of New Brunswick[22], at pages 441 and 442, it was said by Lord Watson, speaking on behalf of the Board, that the object of the Act\nwas accomplished by distributing between the Dominion and the provinces, all powers, executive and legislative and all public property and revenues which had previously belonged to the provinces; so that the Dominion Government should be vested with such of these powers, property and revenues as were necessary for the due performance of its constitutional functions and that the remainder should be retained by the province for the purposes of the Provincial Government.\nThe design of the Act appears to have been that such of the property as by the Act was appropriated to the Dominion should be subject to the exclusive control of the Dominion Legislature, and such as was left in the provinces should be subject to the exclusive provincial control. Section 117 provides as follows:\n117. The several provinces shall retain all their respective public property not otherwise disposed of in this Act, subject to the right of Canada to assume any lands or public property required for the fortifications or for the defence of the country;\nand this appears to be the only provision in the principal Act authorizing the Dominion to take provincial property. There is no provision expressly authorizing a province to assume any property appropriated by the Act to the Dominion. At pages 57 and 58[23], Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said : The enactments of section 109 are, in the opinion of their Lordships, sufficient to give to each province, subject to the administration and control of its own legislature, the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in all lands within its boundaries, which at the time of the Union were vested in the Crown, with, the exception of such lands as the Dominion acquired right to under section 108 or might assume for the purposes specified in section 117.\nThe subjects of the legislative jurisdiction conferred upon the Dominion by sub-section 1 of section 91 are described in the words \"the public debt and property,\" but these words obviously mean \"the public debt and property\" of the Dominion. The only express provision touching the power of the provinces to legislate in respect of the public property is section 29, subsection 5, and the powers there conferred are confined to the public lands of the provinces. In Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Ontario[24], at page 713, Lord Herschell, speaking for the Judicial Committee (comprising the Lord Chancellor, Lord Herschell, Lord Watson, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Morris, Lord Shand, Lord Davey, and Sir Henry de-Villiers), after a full argument, in which all the provinces, as well as the Dominion participated, pointed out the distinction between proprietary rights and legislative jurisdiction; and after observing that the power to legislate in respect of a particular subject-matter would necessarily enable the legislature so empowered to affect proprietary rights, said:\nIf, however, the legislature purports to confer upon others proprietary rights where it possesses none itself, that in their Lordships' opinion is not an exercise of the legislative jurisdiction conferred by section 91. If the contrary were held, it would follow that the Dominion might practically transfer to itself property which has, by the \"British North America Act,\" been left to the provinces and not vested in it. The reasoning upon which these decisions are based appears to involve the principle that except in the special case mentioned in section 117 the distribution of property between the Dominion and the provinces is not subject to be re-adjusted at the will of one of the parties without the consent of the others and consequently, that a province cannot take away either for the benefit of itself or for the benefit of another any of the property appropriated by the \"British North America Act\" to the Dominion.\nThe scheme of distribution found in the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" was, as regards British Columbia, modified by the terms of union with that province. The eleventh article of the latter instrument provides for the transfer to the Dominion of a certain tract of land for aid in the building of a railway connecting the eastern provinces of Canada with the Pacific coast. In the Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada[25], it was said that this article was only one term in a general statutory arrangement, of which the leading enactments were those bringing into force the general scheme of the \"British North America Act\" for the distribution of the provincial property and that the article constituted an exception to that scheme. Having regard to the principle upon which the Judicial Committee seems to have acted in the cases already referred to, it would seem that the true view of the eleventh article is that the power to deal with and manage the tract of land to be transferred to the Dominion thereunder was vested in the Dominion, and that as a consequence the province could neither assume any part of the land so vested in the Dominion for itself, nor dismember the Dominion's proprietary rights in it by conferring any such rights upon others. That, I think, is the view of the effect of the article expressed by the Judicial Committee in the case last mentioned.\nThat the carrying out of the plan of the power company would involve the dismemberment of the proprietary rights of the Dominion is too clear for discussion, and, indeed, I think is not disputed. The plan includes the occupation of the bed of the Lillooet River just below the embouchure of Lillooet Lake by a permanent clam, the raising of the surface of Lillooet Lake, the construction and maintaining of conduits and the permanent diversion of the waters of Lillooet River. If I am right in the views I have just expressed it is perfectly clear that the assumption of such rights by the province over the tract conveyed under the eleventh article either for its own benefit or for the purpose of conferring them upon others, is something which that article by necessary implication forbids. That the transfer to the Dominion of proprietary rights of the province in the tract in question had the effect of vesting in the Dominion all the rights of the province in waters of the lakes and streams within the tract incident to the ownership of the tract seems to me to be clear. It is true that at the time of the Union, as well as at the date of the Act of 1884, the law of British Columbia conferred upon landowners and others the right to obtain from the Provincial Government grants of the right to divert the waters of natural lakes and streams for certain purposes; and it is also true that the legislature must have contemplated that in the existing conditions of the country such grants, in many, if not in most cases, might prejudicially effect the Crown lands in respect of the flow of such waters through or past them.\nIt should seem, however, in view of the considerations mentioned above, the agreement contained in article 11 being carried out by the Act of 1884, the authority given to the provincial officers under the general legislation of the province to make such grants of water rights would ipso jure cease to apply to the tract thereby conveyed to the Dominion, while it remained the property of the Dominion.\nAnglin J.\u2014It was found by the learned judge to whom the issues of fact in this action were referred that the Lillooet River is navigable throughout its entire length. This finding was modified on appeal by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, who held that this river is navigable in its lower reaches extending about nine miles up from its confluence with the Pitt River, but is not navigable in the upper reaches. The learned judge further finds that the navigability in fact of the river in its lower reaches does not depend on the flow of the tide. Against these findings of the Exchequer Court the defendants have not appealed.\nThe scheme of the company is to divert from the Lillooet River 25,000 inches of water flowing into it from the Lillooet Lakes, and to carry this water into Kanaka Creek and thence into the Fraser River. No part of the diverted water is to be returned to the Lillooet. The capacity of the Lillooet River at its exit from Lillooet Lake has been found to be about 25,000 inches, and from this finding there has been no appeal. It follows that, except in so far as it may be preserved by the flow of the tide, the proposed diversion will, if permitted, destroy the navigability of the Lillooet River. The influence of the tide is felt only in the lower six miles of the river. In this state of facts it is manifest that if carried out the diversion proposed by the appellants will seriously interfere with, if not destroy, the right of navigation.\nBy section 91 (10) of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" legislative jurisdiction over navigation is vested exclusively in the Dominion Parliament, and it has prohibited the erection of any dam which shall interfere with navigation. R.S.C. [1906] ch. 116, sec. 4. Because the carrying out of the scheme of the appellants will involve the construction of a dam which will interfere with navigation, I am of opinion that the judgment in appeal should be sustained.\nNo doubt this appeal might be disposed of on this ground alone, and, having regard to what has been said by the Judicial Committee in Citizens Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[26] at page 109, and approved of in later cases, I am not certain that it should not be so disposed of. But counsel expressed great anxiety that this court should determine the validity of the provincial grant of the water-power in question, apart from its undue interference with the rights of navigation. This is said to be a pressing question of general importance in British Columbia, and an expression of opinion upon it, though not necessary to the disposition of this appeal, may therefore be not improper. The Attorney-General for British Columbia v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[27], at page 208.\nIn the Precious Metals Case[28], at page 301, Lord Watson, speaking of the transfer to the Dominion of the lands comprised in the \"Railway Belt,\" said: It seems clear that the only \"conveyance\" contemplated was a transfer to the Dominion of the provincial right to manage and settle the lands, and to appropriate their revenues. It was neither intended that the lands should be taken out of the province, nor that the Dominion Government should occupy the position of a freeholder within the province. The object of the Dominion Government was to recoup the cost of constructing the railway by selling the land to settlers. Whenever land is so disposed' of the interest of the Dominion comes to an end. The land then ceases to be public land, and reverts to the same position as if it had been settled by the Provincial Government in the ordinary course of its administration.\nIt was accordingly held in McGregor v. Esquimault Railway Co.[29], that other land, the beneficial interest in which had been conveyed by the province to the Dominion for railway purposes, but which had subsequently ceased to be the property of the Dominion by a grant thereof to a local railway company, was subject to provincial legislative authority.\nWhile in both these cases it appears to have been recognized that the extent of the legislative control of the province over such lands is not the same while they are held by the Dominion as it is after they have passed into other hands\u2014\nthe land reverts to the same position as if it had been settled by the Provincial Government in the ordinary course of its administration\u2014\nto what extent provincial legislative jurisdiction over it, while held by the Dominion, is abrogated or curtailed is not defined.\nIn the Precious Metals Case[30] it was held that while the jura regalia were not transferred to the Dominion, the beneficial interest in the Crown's territorial rights\u2014their management, and the revenues derivable therefrom\u2014was so transferred. Farwell v. The Queen[31], at page 560. Water-powers existing upon streams flowing through these lands are not jura regalia. So far as they were subject to provincial control or disposition while the lands were held by the province\u2014at all events where they are found upon non-navigable streams\u2014they were incidents of the adjacent property which would pass with other beneficial interests in the nature of territorial rights from the province to any purchaser of the lands upon either side of the stream, unless they were expressly excepted by the terms of the grant itself or were excepted from it by provincial legislation. They are not excepted in the statutory conveyance to the Dominion, and the only legislation of the province in force at the time of the transfer to the Dominion to which we have been referred, as stated by Mr. Justice Cassels, does not affect this case. It does not except unrecorded water-rights from the interest of the lawful occupant of pre-empted and cultivated lands; it merely imposes a condition upon the exercise of his right to divert such waters from their natural course. This is something quite different from so excepting the ordinary rights in such waters which appertain to riparian ownership that they might be bestowed upon some stranger without derogating from the lawful interests of the riparian owner. These rights, therefore, in my opinion, passed to the Dominion under the statutory conveyance with other incidents of the property.\nThese undeveloped water-powers might have been very valuable interests\u2014they may still prove almost indispensable privileges\u2014for the use of the transcontinental railway itself, whose construction the transfer of the lands comprised in the \"Railway Belt\" was designed to aid, should electrical energy be utilized as its motive power. Without derogating from its grant, made pursuant to the terms of union sanctioned by Imperial Order in Council having the force of an Act of the Imperial Parliament, the province could not assert in respect to the lands themselves legislative jurisdiction to sanction their expropriation; neither can it do so with regard to such an incident of the property as the water-power here in question.\nIn my opinion, while held by the Dominion these lands are not subject to such provincial legislative jurisdiction as the appellants invoke.\nThe appellants object that this action has been prematurely brought, because, although the Water Commissioners acting under the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act\" (R.S.B.C. [1897] ch. 190), have granted to the appellants \u201ca record of 25,000 inches of water, etc.,\" their scheme requires the sanction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council before they can proceed with their works. Mr. Lafleur suggests that the scheme as propounded may never receive this sanction, and that until it is given the Attorney-General of Canada cannot maintain this action. I am unable to agree in this view. The appellants should not be heard to say that they may not carry out that which they have avowed it to be their intention to perform.

Appellants;\nand\nJames Davy Respondent.\n1910: February 15, 16; 1910: March 11.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA.\nRailways\u2014Carriers\u2014International through traffic\u2014Reduction of joint rate\u2014Jurisdiction of Board of Railway Commissioners\u2014Practice\u2014Parties\u2014Costs.\nOn a complaint in respect to a joint tariff, between the appellant company and The Michigan Central Railroad Company, under which a rate of three cents per hundred pounds was charged on pulp-wood in car-lots for carriage from Thorold, in Ontario, to Suspension Bridge, in the State of New York, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada decided that the rate should be reduced and ordered the appellants to restore a joint rate which had previously existed of two cents per hundred pounds for carriage of such goods between the points mentioned. The Michigan Central Railroad Company, over whose railway the goods had to be carried from the point where the appellants' railway made connection with it at the international boundary to the foreign destination, was not made a party to the proceedings before the Board. On appeal by leave of a judge to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington and Duff JJ., that the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order.\nPer Girouard, Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014As the Michigan Central Railroad Company was not a party to the proceedings, it was not competent for the Board to make the order.\nThe appeal was allowed without costs.\nAPPEAL, by leave of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, from that portion of an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, St. dated 2nd December, 1909[1], which directed that a joint rate of two cents per hundred pounds of wood-pulp, in carloads, from Thorold, in Ontario, to Suspension Bridge, in the State of New York (which had previously existed and been superseded), via the appellants' railway and the Michigan Central Railroad, should be restored.\nThe appellants are a railway company declared by the Parliament of Canada to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and have power to construct and operate certain lines of railway in Canada, but not outside of the Dominion. The respondent is a manufacturer and shipper of wood-pulp carrying on business at Thorold, in Ontario, and the traffic in question was the carriage of wood-pulp in carloads from Thorold to Suspension Bridge, in the State of New York, one of the United States of America.\nSuch freight is carried by the appellants from Thorold over a line owned and operated by them under their charter powers to Niagara Falls, in Ontario, where their tracks join the tracks of the Michigan Central Railroad Company. Between Niagara Falls, in Ontario, and Suspension Bridge, in New York, the appellant company does not and is not authorized to operate any line of railway nor have they any other line of railway by which they can or do operate to Suspension Bridge, New York. Suspension Bridge is a station a short distance east of the Niagara River in the State of New York, on a line of railway operated by the Michigan Central Railroad Company, a company incorporated outside of the Dominion of Canada, but having the right to operate a railway in certain parts of Canada, as provided for by the statute 4 Edw. VII. ch. 55, and the freight in question, from Niagara Falls, Ont. (where the appellants' tracks connect with tracks operated by the Michigan Central Railroad Company), is carried by the Michigan Central Railroad Company over lines operated by the latter company to Suspension Bridge in the State of New York.\nFor some time prior and up to 1st February, 1908, there was in effect a tariff providing for a through rate of two cents per hundred pounds on such traffic from Thorold to Suspension Bridge, such traffic having been made effective by concurrence therein by the appellants and the Michigan Central Railroad Company. On 1st February, 1908, by a tariff concurred in by these companies, the rate was changed to three cents per hundred pounds, but a reduction was made again to two cents per hundred pounds from 25th April, 1908, to 14th November, 1908. On 15th November, 1908, a tariff came into effect by concurrence of the companies fixing the rate on such traffic at three cents per hundred pounds, and cancelling the former tariff which provided a rate of two cents per hundred pounds. Shortly after the last mentioned tariff came into effect the respondent applied to the Board of Bail-way Commissioners for Canada for an order for a refund of one cent per hundred pounds on freight shipped under the three-cent-rate and for an order directing the appellants to restore the rate of two cents per hundred pounds on such freight. The Michigan Central Railroad Company was not made a party in the proceedings.\nThe order made by the Board was as follows:\u2014\n\"It is ordered that that part of the application directing the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway Company to refund to the applicant the said sum of $219.83, being the additional one cent per 100 pounds paid on forty-two carloads shipped from November 15th, 1908, when the three-cent-rate went permanently into effect, to September 29th, 1909, the date of this application, be, and it is hereby, dismissed.\n\"And it is further ordered that the joint-rate of three cents per 100 pounds at present in force on wood-pulp in carloads, from Thorold, Ontario., to Suspension Bridge, New York, via the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad, be, and it is hereby, disallowed, and the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway Company is hereby required, by the 15th day of January, 1910, to restore the joint-rate of two cents per 100 pounds which was in effect on the said traffic prior to February 1st, 1908, and November 15th, 1908.\"\nChrysler K.C. and George F. Macdonell for the appellants.\nStrachan Johnston for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appeal should be allowed. The Railway Commissioners are without jurisdiction to make the order complained of.\nGirouard J.\u2014The appellants complain that the Railway Board had no jurisdiction to make an order directing the appellants to restore a joint-rate of two cents per hundred pounds on wood-pulp in carloads from Thorold, in the Province of Ontario, to Suspension Bridge, in the State of New York, via The Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad, an American railway operating in this country. The Michigan Central Railroad is not in the case and I cannot see how the said order could have been made. When the proper parties are before us it will be time to decide the question for our decision, but, in my humble opinion, not before that time.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nDavies J.\u2014The order of the Board of Railway Commissioners in this matter, so far as this appeal is concerned, directed\nthat the joint-rate of three cents per hundred pounds at present in force on wood-pulp in carloads from Thorold, Ontario, to Suspension Bridge, New York, via the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad be disallowed,\nand that the former railway company (appellants), by a certain date, should restore the old rate of two cents.\nThe Michigan Central Railroad Company, a foreign corporation, rates over whose road the Board's order thus assumed and exercised jurisdiction, were not cited before the Board or in any way made parties to the proceedings.\nVery interesting and important questions arising out of the proper construction of sections 335 and 336 of \"The Railway Act,\" purporting to confer powers on the Board for the regulation of international joint-traffic, were discussed at length and ably by the counsel for the parties to the appeal before us.\nI cannot understand how it was that the Michigan Central Railroad Company, whose interests were so directly involved in the order under review, were not made parties to the proceedings.\nIt is clear to my mind that the omission to make them parties is fatal to the validity of the order as made and I, therefore, feel myself compelled to concur in the allowance of the appeal on that ground alone.\nUnder the circumstances, I do not think that costs should be allowed.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, directing, amongst other things, the appellants to restore a joint-rate for carriage of freight from Thorold, in Ontario, to Suspension Bridge, in the State of New York, via the railway of the appellants and the Michigan Central Railroad.\nThe appeal is made on the ground that, inasmuch as part of the latter road needed to effect the service in question runs through a part of New York State, and the company which owns or operates it is not a Canadian creation and only subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament in respect of that part of its road within Canada, the Board had not the power to make the order.\nI have no doubt that the road in the United States is absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Board and that the company operating it is, in respect of the part within the United States, also as completely beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.\nI am also clear that this is not one of those cases in which, by specified indirect means, the sanction of a foreign company was intended by the Act to be indirectly coerced into submission to the order of the Board.\nIt is equally clear that the part of that company's road in Canada and its operation therein are subject to the Board as other roads over which it is given jurisdiction.\nIt has been rightly conceded by submitting to the part of the order disallowing the joint-tariff that had been for a time in force that the Board had power to so disallow that joint-tariff.\nIf the order had expressly on its face made its enforcement of the part objected to conditional upon the other company, which is not a party to the proceedings, filing upon request or notice a joint-tariff or a tariff of its own, that would have clearly enabled the appellants to carry freight on the terms indicated could such a conditional direction have been said to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Board? Is that form of conditional direction not implied in the order as it stands? We should bear the history of the tariff in mind and should not run away too readily with the idea that the whole case lies in the bald statement that the foreign road is supposed against its will to do something the Board has not power to compel.\nNo such power is now pretended. And it is conceded on both sides that this is not a case where the old order of things revives ipso facto upon the new being abolished.\nHowever, having fully considered, as well as many others, these suggestions which I have stated in order that it cannot be assumed they were overlooked, I fear the express terms of the order are too explicit to admit clearly of the implications which I have suggested as possible. The order probably took the form it appears in through inadvertence.\nIt does not appear whether anything was done to suggest this to the Board.\nI think we should not encourage mere captious objections which might be overcome by an application to the Board to vary what may only have been, as I suggest, inadvertence.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal without costs. Duff J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Idington.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway Company, a corporation subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, operates a line of railway between the Town of Thorold, Ont., and the Town of Niagara Falls, Ont. At the latter town it connects with the Michigan Central Railroad Company's system. This company operates a line of railway a portion of which lies between Niagara Palls, Ont., and the Town of Suspension Bridge, in the State of New York.\nPrior to the first of February, 1908, there was in force a joint-tariff under which these two railways carried products of the respondent from Thorold, Ont., to Suspension Bridge, N.Y., at the rate of 2 cents per 100 pounds. On February 1st, 1908, the two railways raised this rate to 3 cents; they again reduced it to 2 cents on the 25th April, 1908; but on the 15th November, 1908, they again advanced it to 3 cents. The application before the Railway Board was for the disallowance of the 3 cent rate and the restoration of the 2 cent rate; and also for an order that the appellant railway company should refund to the respondent the sum of $219.83, the extra amount paid by him between November 15th, 1908, and September 29th, 1909, by reason of the increase in rates. He was refused the relief of a refund because in the opinion of the Board the 3 cent rate was legally in force from November 15th, 1908.\nThe Board however ordered\nthat the joint-rate of three cents per 100 pounds at present in force on wood-pulp in carloads, from Thorold, Ontario, to Suspension Bridge, New York, via the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad, be, and it is hereby, disallowed, and the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway Company is hereby required, by the 15th day of January, 1910, to restore the joint-rate of two cents per 100 pounds, which was in effect on the said traffic prior to February 1st, 1908, and November 15th, 1908.\nFrom the first part of this order which disallows the 3 cent tariff there is no appeal. By leave of the Chief Justice of this court an appeal has been permitted in respect of that portion of the order which requires the defendants to restore the joint-rate of 2 cents per 100 pounds in force prior to November 15th, 1908.\nThe Michigan Central Railroad Company were not parties to the application before the Railway Board and are not before this court. The appellants rely upon this fact as an objection to the order in appeal; and they also maintain that, had the Michigan Central Railroad Company been before the Railway Board and had the order been made against both companies, it would nevertheless be beyond the jurisdiction conferred on the Board by the \"Dominion Railway Act,\" inasmuch as the Board thereby assumed to prescribe a tariff or rate for traffic carried beyond the international boundary to a point in a foreign country.\nIf the order exceeds the jurisdiction of the Board because the Michigan Central Railroad Company was not before it, it is unnecessary and it would probably be unwise to pass upon the larger question raised by the appellants.\nThe order requires the respondent company alone \"to restore\" the joint rate or joint tariff existing before the l5th November, 1908. This tariff had ceased to be effective by reason of its having been legally superseded by a later joint-tariff which the Board itself has found to have been legal and effective. ( See section 328(4).) The order for restoration, therefore is, in reality, an order requiring the company to make and file a new joint-tariff. This, in my opinion, it cannot do without the concurrence of the Michigan Central Railroad Company; and there is, and upon the present record there could be, no order of the Board requiring the Michigan Central Railroad Company to concur in the making of such a tariff. Section 333, applicable to Canadian companies, indicates that where a joint-tariff is to be made by the companies themselves both must agree and the only action which the initiating company is enabled to take without the concurrence of the other company is the filing of the joint-tariff after it has been so agreed upon. Although there is no express provision in section 335 regarding agreement of the companies, it is obvious from the very nature of a joint-tariff that there must be such an agreement if the tariff is to be the act of the companies and not of the Railway Board. I am therefore of opinion that the order as drawn requires the appellant company to perform what may be an impossibility and it is for that reason, in my opinion, in its present form beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.\nAn order might probably have been drawn prohibiting the appellants from taking the traffic in question for continuous carriage from Thorold, Ont., to Suspension Bridge, N.Y., at a rate exceeding that which the Board thought proper, which would not have been open to this objection. If the effect of disallowance of a joint-international-tariff is \u2014 under the operation of the \"filing\" sections made applicable by section 338 \u2014 that, until a new tariff is filed or a new toll prescribed, the railways affected cannot charge any tolls for the traffic covered by the disallowed tariff \u2014 i.e., in the case of joint-tariff traffic by the continuous route, I see no reason why such an order as that indicated might not be made. But such an order would not accomplish what the present order, if valid, would have effected.\nMr. Johnston stated that the Board, in his opinion, did not intend to make an order having any greater effect than such a prohibitive order. But it is, I think, not possible to place upon the order actually before us such a limited construction.\nI am not to be understood as expressing any view upon the powers of the Board to make such an order as that in appeal were the Michigan Central Railroad Company before it as well as the present appellants.\nBecause it purports to impose upon the appellant company unconditionally an obligation which it can only fulfil with the concurrence of another railway company, which it may not be able to obtain, I think the present order transcends the jurisdiction of the Board and that for this reason this appeal should be allowed.\nIn the peculiar circumstances of this case there should, in my opinion, be no costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: George F. Macdonell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Thomson, Tilley & Johnston.\n[1] 9 Can. Rway. Cas. 493.\n"}

A portion of the building having been used at intervals for other purposes, it was assessed at a valuation of $1,000 and the society paid, the taxes thereon for some years. Such portion was eventually leased for a term of years to be used for other purposes than those of the society, and the valuation for assessment was increased to $10,000. The lease contained this covenant:\u2014\n\"The said lessees * * * shall and will well and truly pay or cause to be paid any and all license fees, taxes or other rates or assessments which may be payable to the City of Halifax, or chargeable against the said premises by reason of the manner in which the same are used or occupied by the lessees hereafter, or which are chargeable or levied against any property belonging to the said lessees (the said lessor, however, hereby agreeing to continue to pay as heretofore all the regular and ordinary taxes, water rates and assessments levied upon or with respect to said premises, and the personal property thereon belonging to the lessor ).\"\nThe society was obliged to pay the taxes on such increased valuation and brought action to recover the amount so paid from the lessees.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. dissenting, that the taxes so paid were \"regular and ordinary taxes\" which the lessors had agreed to pay as theretofore and the lessees were not liable therefor on their covenant. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the plaintiffs' action.\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nO'Connor K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDavies J.\u2014For the reasons given by Chief Justice Townshend when delivering the majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI think the trial judge, Longley J., neatly and fairly stated the true meaning of the covenant in question in the following words:\nIt means that the lessor is to pay the regular city assessment on the property demised and that the defendants are to meet any special impositions which the city shall by law impose upon them on account of their business. For instance, if the city should impose a license fee upon public shows then the defendants must pay it. If by special legislation they should obtain the right to levy a special tax or assessment upon all moving picture shows then defendants must bear all of these even if they should be made a lien on the building in which such shows were carried on.\nIdington J.\u2014The City of Halifax has to assess property according to its value but must exempt that of such benevolent societies as the appellant when exclusively used by the society.\nThe charter, by section 505, enables the city council to pass ordinances relative to entertainments and licenses for or in respect of same. This, coupled with other sections, is wide enough to enable a fee tax or rate to be imposed in respect of such entertainments either per period of time of occupancy, or number of exhibitions.\nLicenses for such purposes, it was admitted in argument, must be taken out not by the lessees, but by the owner of the building in which the entertainments are held and hence there are secured thereby to the city the payment of the license fees and obedience to all city ordinances regarding the manner of carrying on such business.\nThe following covenants were inserted in the three year lease in question to carry on theatrical exhibitions\u2014\nThe lessees will well and truly pay, or cause to be paid, any and all license fees, taxes or other rates of assessment which may be payable to the City of Halifax, or chargeable against the said premises by reason of the manner in which the same are used or occupied by the lessees hereafter, or which are chargeable or levied against any property belonging to the said lessees (the said lessor, however, hereby agreeing to continue to pay as heretofore all the regular and ordinary taxes, water-rates and assessments levied upon or with respect to said premises, and the personal property thereon belonging to the lessor).\nMuch confusion has been created in the interpretation of these covenants by entirely overlooking the power of the city to impose such fees or other like taxes, by the means above referred to.\nThe first covenant above quoted, obviously referred to this power, and its past exercise as well as its future possible exercise and extension.\nThe very words used, \"license fees,\" etc., \"chargeable,\" etc., \"by reason of the manner in which the same are used\" seem attributable to the possibilities under the powers I refer to for imposing license fees which are certainly a form of tax. Inasmuch as the appellant by virtue of the city ordinance had to apply for and get the license, yet according to the bargain was not to bear the tax therefor, it was necessary for it to protect itself in regard to repayment of that or any like imposition, and did so by this indemnifying covenant.\nAt the same time the words might be wide enough to cover other rates, and the lessors having agreed to pay the ordinary taxes it was necessary to see that the indemnity did not cover too much, and hence the second part binding appellants to pay the ordinary rates.\nA mere minute verbal analysis such as put forward in argument without having due regard to the business the parties had in hand is, I submit, of little value.\nThe lessees agreed to pay all taxes incidental to their business and the lessors all incidental to their ownership.\nIt was an incident of such ownership that, unless exclusively occupied or as interpreted so far as not exclusively occupied, their property was subject to taxes. This interpretation by the assessing power of this exemption may or may not have been the correct one.\nIt certainly was the equitable one. And I have no doubt it was when so interpreted properly applied.\nThe hall that only brought in rental for a dozen nights in a year was in truth not worth more than a thousand dollars.\nThe hall that brought in ten times as much per year was worth ten thousand dollars.\nSuch rates as a varying assessment fixed from time to time were the ordinary taxes the lessor had to pay, and the word \u201cheretofore,\u201d if reasonably applied, means no more than this; as we have paid in the past according to current assessable value we will pay in the future.\nIt may not be quite accurate according to all the rules of law and logic for people so to think and so to speak.\nIt accurately represents, I am convinced, the sound common sense of the assessor and Court of Revision of Halifax.\nWe have not to decide the question of law for them, but we have to try and understand what they were about, and what being their method of doing things must have been in the minds of the contracting parties hereto who would in adjusting their business accept and act upon the well-known understanding of these authorities relative to the law, and the measure they were likely to apply in assessing in the ordinary way this piece of property.\nThis was not the only property of the kind in Halifax concerning the use of which the like questions arose and had to be solved, for the Masonic Hall and Oddfellows' Hall the assessor says were dealt with by a similar method.\nI have no doubt that what the parties intended has been carried out by the judgments of the courts below.\nAnd if I had to treat the matter in the way of trying to give to each word its literal meaning and give effect to every word the result would be the same.\nIt would be impossible in any way one can try to give such an interpretation or apply such a construction not to leave a doubt of whether or not the exact shade of meaning of each word had been properly assigned. The strain put upon one or two words by the appellants' method destroys the proper meaning of others.\nBut of one thing I feel sure and that is, that if taxes upon an assessment of only one thousand dollars a year had been deliberately agreed upon it should have been inserted, and, I think, would have been inserted.\nThose dealing with the business of finding a clear mistake made in this regard should, on its discovery, have taken steps to rectify the mistake rather than their method of settling it.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs claim indemnity from the defendants in respect of certain taxes levied by the City of Halifax on a building owned by the plaintiffs and leased to the defendants. The alleged right to indemnity arises upon the following covenant contained in the lease:\nThe said lessees for themselves, etc., covenant, promise and agree to and with the said lessor, etc., that the said lessees, etc., shall and will well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the said lessor, its successors and assigns * * * any and all license fees, taxes or other rights or assessments which may be payable to the City of Halifax or chargeable against the said premises by reason of the manner in which the same are used or occupied by the lessees hereafter, or which are chargeable or levied against any property belonging to the said lessees (the said lessor, however, hereby agreeing to continue to pay as heretofore all the regular and ordinary taxes, water-rates and assessments levied upon or with respect to said premises, and the personal property thereon belonging to the lessor.\nIn the special Act incorporating the plaintiff society it is provided that all real and personal property exclusively used for the purposes of the society shall be exempted from taxation.\nIt has been established by evidence admitted at the trial that prior to the making of the lease to the defendants the plaintiffs were assessed upon the sum of $1,000 in respect of the building in question, the value of which is said to be about $20,000. The reason for this partial taxation of the property, notwithstanding the exemption provision, was that the society occasionally let a part of their building for other purposes and the assessor in respect of such user deemed the property liable to assessment. Upon appeal from a larger assessment made by the assessor, the amount for which the property should be assessed, having regard to such occasional user by other persons, was fixed at the sum of $1,000. After the lease in question had been made the assessment of the building was increased from $1,000 to $10,000 and the assessor in giving evidence says that this increase was because part of the building\nwas let out for a large rent and occupied permanently and continuously.\nWhether or not the fact that a portion of the building was used for other purposes entirely disentitled the plaintiffs to any exemption from taxation under their charter is a question not before us. The only question for determination upon this appeal is whether in respect of the taxes on the increased assessment, amounting to $9,000, the plaintiffs are or are not entitled to indemnity from the defendants, and that question must be determined upon a proper construction of the covenant above quoted.\nMuch attention has been given, and properly, to the meaning and effect of the words by reason of the manner in which the same are used or occupied by the lessees hereafter.\nIf these words affect and qualify the entire covenant of the lessees it is, I think, obvious that they undertook by that covenant to pay only taxes imposed by reason of something peculiar in the manner of their use or occupation of the premises. It is, therefore, essential to determine whether this adverbial phrase modifies merely the verb \"may be chargeable,\" or modifies also the earlier verb, \"may be payable.\"\nThe two clauses in the covenant descriptive of the taxes of the lessors which the lessees agree to pay are separated by the disjunctive \"or.\" Having regard to this fact and to the grammatical rule\u2014ad proximum antecedent fiat relatio\u2014the adverbial phrase would prim\u00e0 facie qualify only the verb, \"may be chargeable.\" Otherwise there would appear to be no reason for the use of \"or\" and the clauses would be read as if \"and\" rather than \"or\" had been used, which should not be done without some cogent reason. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Henderson Brothers[1], at p. 603.\nIf, however, the ordinary grammatical rule of construction to which I have referred be disregarded, it certainly cannot be said that the adverbial phrase \"by reason of, etc.,\" unquestionably qualifies both the members of the covenant which precede it ; at most it would be doubtful whether it should be deemed to apply to and modify one or both of the preceding clauses.\nIf it be taken to modify both clauses and if, as I have indicated, the result of such an application of the adverbial phrase would be that the lessees covenanted to pay only special taxes levied by reason of something peculiar to the manner of their use or occupation of the premises, it is clear that they would thereby assume no liability for \"regular or ordinary taxes.\" Upon that construction of the covenant the excepting parenthetical clause at the end would have no application. That the draughtsman of the lease thought that he had by the earlier part of the covenant imposed upon the lessees some obligation in respect of \"regular and ordinary taxes\" seems clear; otherwise he would not have deemed it necessary to make the exception contained in the concluding parenthetical clause. The suggestion that this exception was inserted solely ex majori cautel\u00e2 and is mere surplusage does not commend itself to my judgment as a sufficient explanation of its presence in the covenant. Only in the absence of any other satisfactory explanation of its raison d'\u00eatre would I deem this explanation sufficient. Ditcher v. Denison[2], at p. 337. Craies' Statute Law, 101 et seq.\nIf, on the other hand, the adverbial phrase,\nby reason of the manner in which the same are used or occupied by the lessees,\nrelates only to the particular clause in which it is found and modifies only the verb, \"may be chargeable,\" and not the earlier verb, \"may be payable,\" it would follow that by the earlier member of the lessees' covenant they undertook to pay taxes generally, i.e., regular and ordinary taxes, and that by the second member of their covenant, they undertook also to pay any taxes specially levied by reason of their peculiar user or occupation of the premises. So read the lessees' covenant would impose upon them an obligation which might require that the lessors' liability as to some portion of the regular and ordinary taxes should be saved by express exception, if that were the intention of the parties, and the presence of the parenthetical proviso or exception is thus satisfactorily accounted for. That a proviso may be used as a guide in the selection of one or other of two possible constructions of the covenant in which it occurs is well established. West Derby Union v. Metropolitan Life Assurance Society[3], at pp. 653, 655.\nIt is, however, objected that the exception in favour of the lessees is of all regular and ordinary taxes and that it is therefore inconsistent with and repugnant to a construction of the lessees' covenant which would impose upon them any obligation of indemnity in respect of regular and ordinary taxes. This argument overlooks entirely the important words in the exception, \"as heretofore.\" The meaning of these words requires to be elucidated by evidence of the circumstances antecedent to the making of the lease, because the exception is of regular and ordinary taxes \"as heretofore\" paid. For this purpose the evidence to which I have above referred was, I think, clearly admissible, and that evidence shews that before the lease, i.e., \"heretofore,\" the lessors were paying in respect of regular and ordinary taxes, an amount levied on an assessment of $1,000. It is, in my opinion, reasonably clear, reading the whole covenant in the light of the evidence of the circumstances in which it was made, that what the lessors intended to continue to pay in the future, was a portion of the regular and ordinary taxes levied on an assessment equivalent to that upon which they had theretofore paid, and that the purpose of the exception was to take out of the general obligation assumed by the lessees in respect of taxes so much of the future regular and ordinary taxes as should represent what had been theretofore paid on account of such taxes by the lessors.\nIt is a fundamental canon of construction that effect must, if possible, be given to every clause and to every word of an instrument. By no other construction except that which I have indicated can due effect, in my opinion, be given to the parenthetical exception and to the words \"as heretofore\" found in that exception. If the covenant of the lessees imposes no liability for regular and ordinary taxes upon them the exception serves no purpose; if the exception itself is construed as including all regular and ordinary taxes the words \"as heretofore\" are given no meaning or effect\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the construction placed on the covenant in question by Mr. Justice Meagher and Mr. Justice Laurence in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was correct and that this appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment entered in the court below for the appellants also with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: T.

Raney K.C. and J.A. Hutcheson K.C. for the appellants.\nWatson K.C. and Lavell for the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The question in this appeal is as to the liability of the estate of the late James Clark for the sum of $28,450 due to the bank by the Perrin Plow Co., Ltd., at the time of Clark\u2019s death and for which he was liable as guarantor.\nThe guarantee was given by Clark and four other shareholders of a company called the Perrin Plow Co., Ltd., to the bank, in the year 1898. It is very loosely and carelessly drawn and it is exceedingly difficult to determine just what it means. But it was a continuing guarantee for advances made to the Plow Co. by the bank either by discounting negotiable securities or by overdrafts. It contained this sentence:\nThis is a continuing guarantee intended to cover any number of transactions, and agree (sic) that the said bank may deal or compound with any of the parties to the said negotiable securities, and take from and give up to them again security of any kind in their discretion, and that the doctrines of law or equity in favour of a surety shall not apply hereto.\nThere was nothing to indicate that the guarantors were to be or become primary debtors, and the only meaning I can put upon the above sentence read in conjunction with the other parts of the guarantee is that in dealing with or compounding with the parties to the negotiable securities they discounted for the Plow Co. they could \u201cdeal or compound\u201d and take from and give up to them again security of any kind in their discretion, and that in so doing or acting the law or equity in favour of a surety should not apply to discharge the surety. But I cannot construe the sentence to have any such wide meaning as the appellant contends for, namely, that it absolutely disclaimed the application of all rules of law or equity to the dealings between the bank and its guarantors and gave the bank plenary powers of extending the times for payment without prejudice to its rights as against the guarantors. Subsequently to the giving of this guarantee one of the guarantors desired to be released, and a document was drawn up and signed by the other guarantors \u201cratifying and consenting\u201d to his discharge and\nconfirming the said original guarantee and consenting to be bound thereto as if the said Ogle Carss had never been a party thereto.\nThe obvious and only intent and purpose of this document which had seals attached was to discharge one of the original guarantors from and retain the liability of the other guarantors upon the original guarantee. It was not to create any new or extended or varied guarantee and whatever object there may have been in attaching seals to it I cannot assent to the proposition that its effect was to transform the original guarantee into a specialty or otherwise to vary or alter it further than discharging Carss might have such effect.\nIn January, 1900, Clark died having made a will appointing the respondents executors and trustees. On the 28th February, 1900, an agreement was entered into under seal between the executors of the first part, Brodie, Lavell and Patterson, the surviving guarantors of the second part, and the Union Bank of the third part, by which the executors agreed inter alia to:\nconsent to renewal from time to time as may be desired of all notes of the Perrin Plow Company, Limited, in existence at the time of the death of the said James Maitland Clark, deceased, given under the aforesaid guarantee and to an extension of time for the payment of same and the interest thereon, and to the carrying on of the same according to the requirements of the business of the said company until six months after notice in writing withdrawing consent to further extension is given to said bank by said executors.\nThe bank evidently assuming and, from the correspondence put in evidence, construing this agreement as a continuing guarantee, not only for advances made to the Perrin Plow Company, Limited, in Clark\u2019s lifetime, but for further advances to be made after his death, until his executors called a halt by \u201cgiving six months\u2019 notice withdrawing consent to further extension,\u201d went on advancing to the Plow Company from $28,500, which amount that company owed the bank at Clark\u2019s death, up to $298,334 in March, 1907, when it was wound up.\nThe question on this agreement for our purposes is whether or not the executors had any power whatever to bind the estate in the way they attempted to do by agreeing to the continuance of the business of the Perrin Plow Company and the continuance of Clark\u2019s guarantee and liability for the notes in existence at his death guaranteed by him, and to an indefinite extension of time for payment of such notes until they should by six months\u2019 notice put an end to such extension.\nThey had no power as executors to bind the estate by agreeing to \u201cthe carrying on of the same,\u201d that is of the negotiable securities guaranteed by the testator, \u201caccording to the requirements of the business of the company.\u201d Such a delegation of powers to third parties to extend the liabilities of the estate was of course illegal. It practically placed the estate at the mercy of the Perrin Plow Company. It attempted not only to continue and extend the liability of the estate practically for an indefinite time, but made that continuance and extension dependent \u201cupon the requirements of the business of the company.\u201d It was not an attempted exercise of the reasonable but limited powers executors may possess of extending time for payment of debts due the estate. It was a delegation of their judgment as executors as to the propriety of giving an extension of time for payment of a debt guaranteed by the testator to the primary debtor to be exercised by such primary debtor as the requirements of its business called for. The liability of the estate as guarantor for the payment of the $28,500 was attempted to be pledged as a credit asset of the Plow Company to the bank in the interest and for the benefit of that Plow Company, and to be used \u201caccording to the requirements of that company.\u201d It was not the interests of the estate but of the primary debtor and its creditor the bank that were considered.\nThere was no power of any kind in the will to enable the executors to carry on Clark\u2019s business or to enter into any arrangement for the continuance of his guarantee and the extreme stretch of the reasonable common law powers of executors entitling them where the business of the deceased is a valuable asset to carry it on for such reasonable time as may be necessary for them to sell it as a \u201cgoing concern,\u201d per Lord Herschell Dowse v. Gorton[1], could not be invoked to support any such extraordinary and unreasonable agreement as that made in this case. Williams on Executors (10 ed.), pp. 1430-1433, 1554; Farhall v. Farhall[2]; Re Evans[3].\nThe executors\u2019 duty was to wind up the testator\u2019s business and estate, not to enter into an agreement to continue a business in which the testator only had a collateral interest or to continue indefinitely their testator\u2019s guarantee of a debt owed by a limited business company to a bank. Such an agreement was quite beyond their powers and, as against the estate, void. Its disastrous consequences are of course apparent now, but they might well have been anticipated. The bank, strangely enough, without appearing to have taken proper advice went on enlarging enormously their advances to the Plow Company, and treated as an asset of that company under the executors\u2019 agreement the testator\u2019s guarantee for at any rate the amount of the company\u2019s indebtedness at his death, however many extensions were given in the interests of the primary debtor for its payment.\nTo hold valid and binding on the estate such an agreement as that by which the executors of the estate of a deceased party could put the estate into the melting pot of a precarious and speculative business would be indeed to add a new terror to death.\nMy conclusions are that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is right; that the original guarantee was not altered in form or character by the document entered into subsequently, releasing one of the guarantors; that the agreement signed by the executors while good to the extent of the admission of the amount of the debt existing at Clark\u2019s death, was bad in so far as it attempted to bind the estate in the carrying on of the business of the company with the aid of the continued and continuing liability and guarantee of the estate; that these varied and prolonged extensions discharged the estate from any further liability on the testator\u2019s guarantee, and that in any event and whether they did or not so discharge the estate the Statute of Limitations is a bar to the recovery of the only claim the bank seeks to enforce, namely, the payment of the $28,500 due on Clark\u2019s guarantee at the time of his death as admitted by the executors.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe guarantee given by the late Mr. Clark ended upon his death and notice thereof to the appellant.\nIts language never was intended to meet any later liability.\nIt never was intended by the instrument under seal executed by him and others assenting to the withdrawal of one of the sureties to do more than signify such assent and to continue the original liability on the part of the remaining sureties notwithstanding such withdrawal.\nThe only apparently conceivable purpose of putting that instrument under seal was possibly to avert any question of want of consideration for assenting to the change. It cannot and does not pretend, otherwise than by the withdrawal of one surety, to enlarge the original liability.\nThe later instrument between the respondent and the appellant as well as other parties represents a breach of trust and a further contemplated breach of trust on the part of the respondents, who were by the will to become trustees of the remainder of the estate, when realized, and liquidated by them as executors, to invest it in the manner specified for the benefit of the testator\u2019s family.\nThe sum of $28,480, which was the total liability of the testator\u2019s co-sureties at his death under the original guarantee, was taken, regardless of the then solvency of the principal debtor, and of its assets answerable for such liability, and of the then solvency of his co-sureties, and without the slightest regard to the dangers of these assets being lost and these co-sureties becoming insolvent, and without the slightest measure of protection in either regard, as a proper basis to fix as the measure of an indemnity to be met by this testator\u2019s estate in future years after incurring all these risks and also those incidental to the business of the principal debtor; and the respondents entered into an agreement on such basis to bind the testator\u2019s estate to appellant for the continuation of the primary debtor\u2019s liability, the renewal of its notes therefor from time to time, an extension of time for their payment, and the carrying on of the same according to the requirements of its business and confirming and ratifying the liability of the estate for the payment of said sum.\nNor is that all for the same agreement, so far from providing for a charge upon the primary debtor\u2019s estate of the said earlier liability of $28,450, expressly provides for the primary debtor assuming a further liability of $15,000 and giving the creditors advancing that sum a priority over any rights respondent might have to indemnity out of the primary debtor\u2019s assets.\nThe $15,000 referred to does not appear to have been anything for which the testator had incurred any legal liability but, as the recital indicates, what might have become a joint liability with others if certain \u201ccontracts and arrangements had been completed.\u201d\nHe died suddenly. The project had not ripened and did not concern his estate. But the hopes of some of the parties to this agreement and concerned in that project no doubt were disappointed, and to prevent their disappointment would seem to have been one of the moving causes of this peculiar agreement.\nAnd not satisfied with a liability such as the testator had incurred by virtue of a simple contract and from which he could have withdrawn at any time, the actors, as often happens in such cases, tried to consecrate a vicious purpose by means of a solemn form, and put it under seal as if to make it endure thereby, and attempted to restrict the original right of revocation.\nIn short the scheme was not one for the protection or interests of the estate which, so far as the evidence shews, required nothing therefor beyond the plain ordinary method of its realization and investment, as expressly directed by the will, but to enable other men interested in the operations of the primary debtor to carry on its business with a credit based on the entire capital of the testator\u2019s estate thus attempted to be given over for the security of appellant to the extent of the sum of $28,450 and interest compounded in the renewal notes.\nThe comparatively small business, only about two years and a quarter old at testator\u2019s death, had not likely involved much if any loss, if the estate and no other interest had been looked at, as was respondent\u2019s duty.\nTrue it was terminable on six months\u2019 notice in writing which might, if given, be extended months beyond the expiration of that period, by reason of the currency of the renewal notes at such length of time as appellant saw fit to make them.\nThe respondents evidently had been misled, or for want of due care acted improvidently, and forgot all about this precious document, preserved however by appellant as a thing of value upon which periodically its officers looked and always rested upon to save the master from loss.\nOne wonders what they were thinking about, but each shifted the weighty burden of thinking on to the other.\nSuch an indefensible method of administering an estate has not in any court below received the slightest countenance.\nTo aid in the diversion of trust funds by such means as this agreement provides for is no part of the function of a court of justice.\nIf the funds had been, under colour of such an instrument, appropriated to meet the future losses incurred by appellant, knowing the contents of the will as the learned trial judge has found, it might have become the function of a court to see the same restored by the appellant to the children.\nIf on the death of the testator there was by virtue of the original guarantee a liability, which the estate was answerable for, it was the duty of the executors to have it ascertained as soon as the assets of the primary debtor could have been realized, and that estate liquidated, if need be, at the earliest possible date, if the primary debtor was unable to adjust affairs otherwise.\nNo excuse appears for any departure from this simple method of procedure.\nNo power was given by the will to cover such an extraordinary agreement. It cannot be upheld.\nIt was necessary to examine it fully in order to pass upon the further question of the claim having been barred by the Statute of Limitations. Once the agreement out of the way there is absolutely no answer to the plea of the statute most righteously invoked as against a plaintiff so forgetful of the rights of children who could not speak for themselves.\nComing to this conclusion as to the nature of the agreement relied on and its invalidity I have not felt it necessary to examine fully the numerous other grounds of defence, but may say that the argument for appellant seemed to me to misapprehend the learned trial judge\u2019s position which was not, as I take it, that a surety may be released by reason of the unexpected growth and magnitude of what the principal debt or business has become, although within the language of the guarantee, but that the comparatively small liability of testator and risk to his estate thereunder was sought to be changed by the parties to this suit to something beyond the scope of the guarantee or any reasonable implication therein.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am of the opinion that neither the late J.M. Clark nor his personal representatives ever became bound otherwise than as sureties by simple contract with such of the ordinary rights of suretyship as were not explicitly renounced in the original instrument of guarantee. This instrument was not under seal.\nThe sole purpose of the document executed by Mr. Clark and others in September, 1899, was to prevent the release of Mr. Carss, one of the co-sureties, operating as a discharge of the others. The original guar- antee was merely confirmed \u201cas if the said Carss had never been a party thereto.\u201d This document does not import a covenant to pay and did not convert the existing simple contract obligation into a specialty.\nThere is no evidence whatever of any payment or acknowledgment by the defendants subsequent to the 28th February, 1900. Payments or acknowledgments by the principal debtor did not affect them. Re Wolmerhausen[4]. Except perhaps as an acknowledgment, the agreement of 1900 was not, in my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, within the power of the executors, and the bank is chargeable with notice of that fact. This action was not brought until 24th August, 1907. I therefore agree that as against the defendants the claim of the plaintiffs is barred by the Statute of Limitations. Without expressing any opinion upon other grounds taken in the courts below, I would for this reason dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hutcheson & Fisher.\nSolicitor for the respondents: H.A.

Anglin J. contra.\nPer Anglin J. (dissenting).\u2014\"The Railway Act\" requires concurrence by the several companies interested as in other joint tariffs on through traffic mentioned in the Act.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada[1], declaring that the legal rate on crude oil shipments in carloads from Stoy, in the State of Indiana, one of the United States of America, to the City of Toronto, in Canada, is twenty cents per hundred pounds, being the joint tariff fifth-class rate under the \"Official Classification\" published and filed with the Board by the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Company; that the said tariff, upon such filing, became effective and binding on Canadian railway companies under the provisions of the \"Railway Act,\" and was still in force, and ordering the appellants to refund to the respondents the difference in the amount of tolls charged in excess of the rate mentioned upon certain shipments specified in the complaint.\nThe respondents complained of the rate charged them by the appellants for the transportation of crude oil shipped in carloads from Stoy, in Indiana, and carried over the appellants' railway from the international boundary between the United States and Canada to its destination at the City of Toronto, in Ontario; they applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners under sections 317, 321, 323, 333, 334, 336 and 338 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch.37, for an order declaring the legal rate of tolls chargeable on such shipments and for a refund of overcharges. In December, 1906, the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Company (on the line of which Stoy is a station) filed with the Board, under the provisions of section 336 of the \"Railway Act,\" a joint tariff, known as the \"Interstate Joint Freight Tariff, No. B-58,\" making the joint fifth-class rate on such shipments from Stoy to Toronto twenty cents per hundred pounds. Prior to 1st January, 1907, crude oil had no classification, but, on that date, the \"official classification\" coming into force in the United States placed it in the fifth class and this classification was made use of by the appellants, on certain occasions, although they had, on 30th November, 1906, issued and filed with the Board an \"exception\" refusing to accept the fifth-class rate tolls on petroleum and its products shipped from points in the United States for transportation over their line of railway to destinations in Canada, and providing that, on such traffic, from the international boundary or junction points their local or special commodity rates should govern.\nThe order appealed from was as follows:\n\"Order No. 7093.\n\"The Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\n\"Wednesday, the 19th day of May, A.D. 1909.\n\"In the Matter of the complaint of The British American Oil Company of Toronto, complaining that The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada unjustly discriminated against crude oil shipments from Stoy, Indiana, in the United States of America, to Toronto, Canada, by refusing to carry it at the published and filed joint tariff fifth-class rate, in accordance with the \"Official Classification\"' and at the same rate as animal and vegetable oils, in carloads; and that The Grand Trunk Railway Company refused to deliver to the complainants at Toronto cars containing crude oil ex Stoy, Indiana, except upon payment of twelve and one-half (121\/2) cents per one hundred pounds, which additional rate had been paid under protest and which the company refused to refund.\n\"Upon hearing the application, the evidence adduced, the argument of counsel for the complainants and The Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific Railway Companies, and what was alleged\u2014\n\"It is Declared that the legal rate chargeable upon the shipments complained of was twenty cents per one hundred pounds, the joint tariff fifth class rate, under the \"Official Classification,\" published and filed with the Board, which rate is still in force.\n\"And it is Further Ordered that The Grand Trunk Railway Company be, and it is hereby authorized to refund to the complainants the difference between the said rate of twenty cents per one hundred pounds and the rate of thirty-two and one-half (321\/2) cents per one hundred pounds charged and collected by it on the said shipments.\n\"D'Arcy Scott,\n\"Assistant Chief Commissioner,\n\"Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\"\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nStrachan Johnston for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons given by Sir Louis Davies.\nGirouard J. agreed with Davies J.\nDavies J.\u2014It might have been possible to dispose of this appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners. on the ground that the Board had found as a fact that the joint tariff for the continuous route in question from Stoy to Toronto filed December 19, 1906, by the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Company, to take effect January 20th, 1907, was an agreed joint-tariff as between the foreign company filing it and the Grand Trunk Railway Co., and so binding until superseded or disallowed by the Board.\nIf there had been such a finding on the evidence before us I would not have been disposed to interfere and would have been glad to avoid the very delicate and difficult questions which arise upon the construction of the clauses of the \"Railway Act\" relating to joint international traffic. After several careful readings of the reasons of the Chief Commissioner for the making of the order of the Board I am not, however, able to say that any such finding of fact was reached and certainly none has been expressed.\nWe are, therefore, obliged to dispose of the appeal on its legal merits.\nThe order complained of was one declaring that the legal rate chargeable upon shipments of crude oil from Stoy to Toronto was 20c. per 100 lbs. and directing a refund of certain overcharges beyond that rate.\nThe validity of the order depends upon the construction placed upon section 336 of the \"Railway Act\" and specially upon the words or phrase \"joint tariff\" as used in that section.\nThe section deals (inter alia) with traffic carried from a foreign country into Canada by any continuous route owned or operated by any two or more companies whether Canadian or foreign, and provides that \"a joint tariff for such continuous route shall be duly filed with the Board.\"\nThe section does not say expressly by whom it shall be filed, but a consideration of the previous sections dealing with traffic originating in Canada and carried into a foreign country, over any continuous route operated by two or more companies, and the sections dealing with \"traffic passing over any continuous route within Canada operated by two or more companies,\" called by the Chairman \"domestic traffic,\" satisfy me that the construction placed upon section 336 by the Board is the only reasonable and fair construction of its language and the only one which will enable the obvious intention of Parliament as expressed in the Act to be carried out. The construction contended for by the appellants that the term \"joint tariff\" as used in the section 336 means necessarily only a joint agreed upon tariff and does not mean a joint tariff for the continuous route filed by the foreign company initiating the traffic would have the result of paralyzing the control of the Board over such international traffic into Canada. The Board could not interfere with any rates charged on such international traffic whether they were just or unjust, reasonable or unreasonable, unless and until a jointly agreed upon tariff had first been filed. Now, when it is remembered that the foreign company initiating this traffic is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Board unless it submits in some way to that jurisdiction the object of Parliament in passing the section as it did will be apparent. Unless the foreign company submitted to their jurisdiction the Board was powerless. Once it submitted to the Board's jurisdiction then so far as the Act gave them power of control over the rates for this traffic the Board had authority to act. It was not necessary to have the agreement of the Canadian line to give the Board jurisdiction over it. The Board already had that jurisdiction by virtue of the railway being within Canadian territory. Parliament did not intend to make the consent of the Canadian railway a necessary condition of the Board obtaining jurisdiction over this special through traffic originating in a foreign country.\nLet us compare the language of the sections regulating domestic continuous traffic and also international traffic originating in Canada.\nThe regulation of the former, that is domestic traffic, is to be found in section 333, which provides that the several companies may agree upon a joint tariff and the initial company shall file it and the other companies promptly notify the Board of their assent. Then section 334 goes on to provide for cases where there is a failure to agree and vests in the Board the amplest powers of control. Read in conjunction with section 333 the Board has therefore the amplest powers to deal with domestic tariffs and rates and secure them to be just and reasonable. But the section 333 properly leaves it to the companies interested to agree in the first instance to a tariff and file it with the Board. If unjust the Board can at once take steps to remedy the injustice and the statute specially provides them with power to act effectively.\nSo in dealing with the international traffic originating in Canada, section 335 expressly provides that the \"several companies\" foreign as well as Canadian, \"shall file with the Board a joint tariff for such continuous route.\" Agreement is here again made expressly necessary and the reason is apparent. The Board could not exercise jurisdiction over the foreign corporation except where it submitted to their jurisdiction. With respect, therefore, to international traffic originating in Canada the willingness of the Canadian company initiating the traffic was not considered sufficient. The foreign company not subject to the Board's jurisdiction must file its agreement with such joint tariff. That being done the Board then would have jurisdiction to allow it. The ground upon which Parliament apparently legislated with respect to this special international traffic originating in Canada was in order to give the Board full control over it; the tariff filed must be so filed not only with the consent of the Canadian company originating the traffic, but with the foreign company intended to be bound by it. But in dealing with traffic originating in a foreign country (section 336) the language is entirely changed. All words indicating the necessity of specific agreement by all interested roads before filing such a tariff are omitted and the simple fact required to give the Board jurisdiction over an international traffic obviously not within their jurisdiction was the due \"filing of a joint tariff for such continuous route.\" Such joint tariff was not necessarily to be one agreed to beforehand by the Canadian company to be effected by it because, I assume, of the fact that' such company was already within the jurisdiction of the Board. But whatever the reason was the several agreements were not required as they were in the two previous cases. What was essential to get was control over the initiating foreign company and that was obtained, as I construe the section, by providing that they should file the joint tariff. It was obviously the company initiating the traffic that should in the first instance file the proposed tariff and that being done and jurisdiction so gained then the Board could at any time at the instance of the Canadian company or any one else interested either allow or disallow the tariff proposed or, possibly, supersede it. On the latter point of superseding it and imposing another of its own I offer no opinion as the question does not arise here.\nIf the phrase \"joint tariff\" was used in reference to a matter over which Parliament had jurisdiction I would suppose it to refer to a joint agreed tariff, but reading it with reference to the subject-matter dealt with in section 336 and in connection with the two previous sections relating to domestic traffic and international traffic originating in Canada in both of which Parliament expressly enacted that the agreement of the interested companies should be required, and finding all words requiring agreement on the part of the several roads interested omitted when dealing with traffic originating out of Canada, I conclude that such agreement was not deemed necessary for the purpose in view and that it was sufficient when the joint tariff required was filed by the foreign originating company. This being in my opinion the proper construction of the section, I think that the order appealed from was within the powers of the Board and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal raises questions as to the power of the Board to declare that a joint tariff, formulated by a freight traffic association representing roads in both countries, and providing for through rates from points in the United States to points in Canada, over specified roads in each country, when filed with the Board, is obligatory, or whether it can by the order of the Board be made so, upon the Canadian company or companies respectively named therein.\nMuch confusion arises from founding arguments herein upon the sections or parts of sections clearly applicable only to roads entirely within the jurisdiction of Parliament, and hence irrelevant as regards those beyond.\nThere is a pretty clear line (though possibly it might have been made clearer), of demarcation throughout the Act between the latter provisions and those bearing upon international traffic.\nObviously Parliament cannot, in the widest sense, command the foreign company, and accompany its commands with sanctions, such as it can impose in regard to the obligations which it may define relative to the dealings of home companies with each other, and their dealings with those they were created to serve.\nIt has not attempted any such thing. It is, however, quite competent for Parliament to legislate in respect of contracts and business relations of an international character, and well known and recognized methods of forming such contracts and relations; to facilitate the same and the execution of their purposes, promoting thereby trade and all implied therein; and to define the terms and conditions under which such contracts and relations as well as the methods thereof may and shall become obligatory upon those absolutely subject to the power of Parliament.\nActing within these lines Parliament has, to my mind, in sections 336 and others and parts of others of the \"Railway Act,\" provided for many emergencies likely to arise in the course of such international traffic.\nPowerless to command a foreign company to do in its own country anything but what it will, or to enforce its doing in this country what it cannot within its corporate power legally do, Parliament has not attempted such things.\nIt has, however, recognized the long existing practice of companies contracting to carry freight beyond their own roads, and the auxiliary practice of their framing either by mutual contracts, or mutual understandings not taking contractual form, or customary observances of sharing in the burthens and benefits of such contracts as made by the contracting company first accepting the freight thus to be carried, and in the result evolving what is in effect the joint tariff. In dealing with domestic companies it enjoins concurrence and in default thereof gives the entire power to the Board to make and enforce a joint tariff.\nIn regard to international joint tariffs, though concurrence is recognized as expedient and a thing the Act encourages and provides for, it does not make the existence of such joint tariff depend upon the concurrence or will of any company entirely within the power of Parliament. Legislation entirely dependent for its maintenance on the will of those subject to the power of Parliament would be useless and hence absurd.\nIt has been provided by section 336 as follows:\n336. As respects all traffic which shall be carried from any point in a foreign country into Canada, or from a foreign country through Canada into a foreign country by any continuous route owned or operated by any two or more companies, whether Canadian or foreign, a joint tariff for such continuous route shall be duly filed with the Board. 3 Edw. VII. ch. 58, sec. 269.\nWe must give some effect to this legislation.\nThe Act does not contain a single word as to how the tariff has to come about or who is to file it. In the next preceding section dealing with the converse case of the starting points being in Canada \"the several companies\" are to file the joint tariff with the Board.\nIn the latter case the whole contract is formed in Canada and the legality or illegality of it may depend upon what Parliament enacts.\nIn the former, the converse case, the legality or illegality of it may depend upon the law of the foreign State.\nWhether some such consideration moved to the making of this marked difference or not need not be examined here.\nAll I wish to point out here is the difference and a probable reason therefor, which indicates what the basis of legislative action might be in order that it be effective.\nIt certainly is quite competent for Parliament to declare that one or more foreign railway companies may frame a joint tariff applicable to their roads and any other road or roads in Canada and upon the filing of same with the Board that it shall be obligatory upon the roads in Canada covered thereby.\nIs this what section 336 says or implies?\nIf it is there is an end of the question raised for the foreign companies have so adopted and filed a joint tariff covering the very ground in question.\nIt is not so clear as might be that the case I put as within the power of Parliament of adopting a joint tariff to be proposed by one or more foreign companies, and when filed to become obligatory upon the Canadian road, is exactly what Parliament had in. view. The language may bear such interpretation.\nI rather think, however, when we learn that tariffs and especially joint tariffs have been the product of the associated labours of those engaged in the management of the business in question Parliament intended to legislate in relation rather to the condition of things thus created and known to exist than in or with the view of executing what I have indicated as quite competent for it to do.\nThen coming to this condition of things legislated upon or about we have a joint tariff framed in this case in the usual way and filed. The appellant, a member of the body so framing it, after it was formulated, dissented from this item now in question. Just at what stage and by what method it did so or was entitled to do so, and all relative thereto, including the powers of this foreign association to bind the appellant and the means that the latter has (within the constitution of such association) of release from such prim\u00e0 facie binding of it, are questions of fact with which we have nothing to do. We are bound by the facts as the Board has found them.\nIt has found as fact a joint tariff so arrived at to have been filed with it under section 336.\nIt ignores the appellant's dissent. It may or may not be the only or any sound reason for doing so that the \"Railway Act\" makes no express provision for such dissent. It may well be by the terms of the constitution of the association which framed this joint tariff that its authority was limited and conditional upon unanimity. I cannot infer so as a clear and undisputed fact. Indeed, I repeat I have no authority as to the facts to guide me but what the Board has accepted and found as such.\nIt clearly implies in its finding that this exception taken to the classification has to be passed upon by some foreign body before becoming effective.\nMeantime there is found to be in fact a joint tariff.\nThe argument of the appellant treats what has been done, by Parliament or by the Board, in the construction it puts upon the Act, as if an invasion of the foreign jurisdiction and hence void in law.\nThe matter seems to me entirely the other way round. This whole business of the making in a foreign state of an international tariff; the limits of authority in those binding each other or trying to do so; the questions of the binding nature of such attempts, whether within or violating the law of the country where made, must of necessity (in the absence of a clear and definite contract prim\u00e0 facie enforceable everywhere that the comity of nations will carry it), be each and all matters of fact.\nAnd until the appellant produces an entirely different finding, by the Board, upon the fact, in relation to which we are to aid in determining the law to be passed upon, than that we have, I cannot see how we can entertain as arguable any other.\nBut divested of all needless complications including the maze of classification and rates, and their relation to each other and this foreign law, and the custom or usage of these foreign bodies, and their manifold relations, and the assemblage of legal results derivable therefrom, what is involved herein is simply the power of the Board to fix a rate from Windsor to Toronto.\nThis net result is what the respondent seeks. It is admitted that the net result, reached satisfactorily to it, could have been reached directly by the Board putting in figures a fixed rate to cover the appellant's share of the service performed.\nAll this has been fixed as definitely by the process adopted and the order as if it had been put in words and figures.\nThe railway men clearly understand exactly how much each company is to get. The appellant is under no trouble in that regard as to other places than Toronto. Counsel at first professed to put forward the theory that his client did not know how much it was to get, or how long it was to continue. Yet he later frankly admitted the power of the Board to fix the rates within Canada. Manifestly, from their acting upon the new tariff, the officers of his client knew how much its rate gave appellant.\nIf the power exists to produce that result and the result is what the Board could by any proper method reach, does it matter three straws here whether or not we would have proceeded by an entirely different process of thought in attacking the problem?\nAgain, the Board has found as a fact a joint tariff which it thinks the appellant, clearly subject to its powers, ought to have obeyed in duty to the law and the policy thereof in regard to facilities and equality of treatment relative to rates, and has ordered it accordingly to obey.\nThe whole purview of the Act in relation to carriage of freight is of such a nature as to indicate that what the appellant has been doing was in violation of the law governing it and defining its duties in the premises.\nThe order is but a declaration in effect that the rate appellant chooses to give for equal or greater service elsewhere shall be the rate.\nIf through the association it has agreed to act upon the lower rate between other points and to refuse the like to those concerned herein it contravenes section 317, sub-section 7 of the Act.\nThe determination of the subject has been confided to the Board to adjudicate upon and see this equality of treatment executed, and when the Board on the facts it finds has declared that the charge made, though under the guise of a local rate, is illegal as infringing the policy of the law, its colour of right ceases to exist.\nLet us brush away the cobwebs, get to the substance of the matter and see if there is aught else in the order complained of than an establishment or a restoration of that equality of treatment which it has become the legal duty of appellant to observe and which was one of the chief purposes of Parliament in creating the Commission to bring about.\nIf the rate given effect to or proposed to be given effect to by the filing of a joint tariff without the concurrence of the Canadian company affected does not allow it a proper share of the tolls or provide a stable and continuous purpose and policy, or for any other reason is unjust, the Board can relieve the Canadian company if and when shewn to suffer thereby.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. agreed with Davies J.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The order in appeal directs a refund of freight rates, which in the opinion of the Board were illegally charged, and declares a certain tariff filed by the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Company to have been a joint tariff binding on the appellants, the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and to be \"still in force.\"\nThe reasons given by the learned Chief Commissioner make it manifest that the adjudication was wholly based on the assumption that the tariff filed by the foreign railway company bound the appellants because, having been filed by one participating company, though without the concurrence of the other, in the opinion of the Board it became in due course binding on the latter by reason of its failure to apply for disallowance under section 338. This is apparent in the following excerpts from the reasons:\nFirst, as to the joint tariff. If a foreign road, without the approval of the Canadian, files a joint tariff which the latter does not desire to participate in, its course is to apply to the Board, under section 338, to have it disallowed, and if this course is not taken, the tolls provided in such joint tariff become, by virtue of section 338, the only tolls that can be charged.\n* * * * Section 336 of the \"Railway Act,\" which gives rise to the trouble here, is silent as to concurrence, but of course it is not to be assumed that any foreign railway company would file a joint tariff naming participating carriers, without, before filing, having obtained their concurrence, and if such were done, inadvertently or otherwise, under our Act it seems the only course open to the objecting carrier would be to apply for its disallowance.\nThere is a finding that the Grand Trunk Rail-way Company did not concur either in the making or in the filing of this tariff. That he was of opinion that they did not concur at any other stage seems to be the proper inference from the judgment of the learned Chief Commissioner. It is true that reference is made to the acceptance by the appellants of payment for some freight at the rate specified in the so-called joint tariff in question. But the facts, as stated by the Chief Commissioner, would not suffice to found an estoppel, and he does not rest his judgment on that ground. Moreover, in a memorandum, which has been made part of the appeal case, it is stated that a question of law for our decision is whether or not, without its concurrence, the Grand Trunk Railway Co. is bound by the tariff filed by the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Co. If the Grand Trunk Railway Co. should be held bound either by concurrence in fact or by estoppel, the legal question of the necessity of its concurrence would be purely academic. We should not so regard a question submitted by the Board unless its order and judgment compel us to do so ; and in my opinion they do not.\nIt is, I think, clear that the Board did not intend to, and did not in fact, exercise any power (which it may have) to prescribe rates for the traffic in question as upon a refusal or neglect by the companies, or one of them, to concur in or file a joint tariff. It intended to, and did in fact determine that the tariff filed by the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Co., although not concurred in by the Grand Trunk Railway Co. became binding on the latter company merely because it did not move for its disallowance under section 338. I regard the entire order as based on this adjudication and I shall deal with it accordingly.\nBut before doing so I desire to state explicitly that I express no view upon, the existence or the scope of the powers of the Board in regard to rates to be charged by foreign companies in respect of international traffic or as to the application to such traffic, either directly or by analogy, of the provisions of sections 323 et seq. of the \"Railway Act,\" including section 334. I pass no opinion upon the existence or the extent of the jurisdiction of the Board in any particular over foreign railway companies handling international through traffic. Interesting as these matters undoubtedly are, it is desirable that they should be dealt with judicially only when necessary.\nI merely remark in passing that if, as appears to be the view of the Railway Commissioners, Parliament in tended that sections 323, 328, 332 and 334 should apply to the traffic and tariffs dealt with by sections 335 and 336, that intention might very easily have been more clearly expressed. Whether it is desirable that the application of these sections to such traffic should be made unmistakable by declaratory or substantive legislation is a matter for the consideration of Parliament.\nAs the \"Railway Act\" now stands it leaves open many awkward and troublesome questions. No distinction is made between foreign railway companies which operate exclusively in foreign territory and those which operate partly in Canada. Both classes of foreign companies are subject to the control of a foreign legislature and of a foreign tribunal and any attempt to enforce the orders of the Canadian Railway Board against them in regard to the carriage of traffic in foreign territory might lead to a serious conflict of jurisdiction. With the orders of which of the tribunals, if they are not in accord, should the foreign company comply?\nBut while, in the case of a foreign company operating a part of its system within Canada, under sections 398, 404, 430 and 431 sanctions and methods of enforcement which would secure obedience to the orders of the Board may be provided, it is difficult to perceive how, under the existing legislation, such orders could be enforced or disobedience to them punished in the case of a railway operating wholly in foreign territory. Without committing myself to this view, it may not be amiss to say that, as at present advised, concurrent action by the Canadian and United States tribunals, authorized by concurrent legislation of both countries, or action by an international tribunal to be established under such concurrent legislation would appear to me to be the only practical and effective means of dealing with many of the difficulties incident to the regulation of international through traffic.\nWhether on a careful consideration of the \"Railway Act\" (sections 314 to 339 inclusive) the provisions as to the consequences of disallowance in the case of domestic tariffs, including those which confer power on the Board to prescribe rates in lieu of tolls disallowed, may or may not be held applicable to the traffic dealt with by sections 335 and 336, I express no opinion. If this power exists it has not been exercised in the present case. Section 336 requires the filing of a \"joint tariff.\" The very name implies a tariff which is the product of joint or concurrent action by the companies interested. That this is the meaning of the term \"joint tariff\" is made clear in the case of domestic joint tariffs by section 333: agreement of Canadian companies must precede the filing of the tariff. It is only after such agreement, not necessarily evidenced in any particular form, that the \"initial company\" is to file the tariff; it is only a tariff so agreed upon and filed which is binding apart from an order of the Board itself prescribing rates.\nIt is natural to expect to find in the first of the group of sections dealing with joint tariffs an exposition of the idea which Parliament intended the term \"joint tariff\" to convey. That idea is distinctly expressed in section 333, and it is most improbable that, while the \"joint tariff' provided for in sections 333 and 334 must be the result of agreement, that dealt with in sections 335 and 336 may be something wholly and essentially different.\nAn analysis of sections 335 and 336, I think, confirms this view. In the case of a continuous route in Canada operated by two or more companies, the Act prescribes filing only by the initial company. But, in the case of a joint tariff for international through traffic originating in Canada, section 335 directs that the tariff shall be filed by \"the several companies\"\u2014 probably in order that the concurrence of all may be evidenced by their participation in the act of filing which takes place with the Board itself. Filing by \"the several companies\" clearly does not mean filing merely by any one of them. It can only mean either the filing of the tariff by all as a joint act, or the filing of the same tariff by each of the participating companies severally. When we come to section 336, which deals with joint tariffs in respect of international through traffic originating in foreign territory, we find that the statute directs that the tariff \"shall be duly filed with the Board.\" The word \"duly\" must have some meaning in this section; it is an important word; it should neither be entirely rejected nor given no effect. Doe d. Lloyd v. Ingleby[2]. The recurrence of this word in section 338 indicates that it is not used inadvertently. Read without it section 336 does not in terms prescribe that the filing shall be by the participating companies or by either or any of them. But, if the word \"shall\" indicates the imposition of a duty, prim\u00e0 facie that duty is imposed upon the \"two or more companies\" owning or operating the continuous route. If filing by one of the participating companies would suffice, on the assumption that section 333 is not to be looked to for guidance as to the nature or the incidents of tariffs for international traffic, the filing under section 336 may be by either or any of the participating companies, not necessarily by the initial company. If the filing be by a Canadian company, the foreign company or companies interested will have done nothing to indicate submission to the jurisdiction of the Board. While the Canadian company, which alone files the tariff, may be bound thereby (and the jurisdiction of the Board over this company does not depend upon the filing) what possible basis could there be for the exercise by the Board of jurisdiction over the foreign company or companies if not operating at all in Canada?\nBut the word \"duly,\" I think, obviously refers to some manner or method of filing already prescribed by the statute. Hobbs v. Cathie[3]. Applying the ordinary rule \u2014 ad proximum antecedens fiat relatio \u2014 and looking as well to the most cognate section for the prescribed method, we find that in section 335, which likewise deals with joint tariffs for international through traffic, the requirement as to filing is that it shall be by \"the several companies.\" This, I take it, is the method of filing to which the word \"duly\" has reference. I can discover no reason why in respect of the traffic dealt with in section 335 the several companies interested should be required to concur in the filing of a joint tariff which does not apply equally to the tariffs dealt with in section 336. If Parliament meant to prescribe filing only by the foreign company or companies interested it could easily have so stated. It has not done so. In the case of international through traffic originating in Canada it has prescribed filing by the. several companies participating; in the case of international through traffic originating in foreign territory it has prescribed that joint tariffs shall be not merely filed, but that they shall be duly filed. I find nothing in section 336 which warrants the construction that filing by the foreign participating company or companies suffices to make the tariff binding on all the companies interested \u2014 nothing to justify the view that a due filing under section 336 differs from a due filing in compliance with section 335.\nThe provisions of section 339 tend, to confirm the conclusion that in regard to both classes of international joint tariffs concurrence by the Canadian companies interested, as well as by the foreign companies, is requisite. Referring clearly to a Canadian company, the section speaks of these international joint tariffs as \"its tariffs.\" Clause (f) certainly pre-supposes possession by the participating Canadian companies of copies of all international joint tariffs by which they are affected, since they are thereby required to keep a copy of every such tariff on file and open for inspection \"at each freight station or office in Canada to which such tariffs extend.\" Yet, if neither its co-operation in the making, nor its concurrence in the filing of it is requisite, the statute does not provide that the Canadian company shall receive any notice of this joint tariff by which it is to be bound, and of which it is directed to keep copies on file.\nIt seems to me to be reasonably clear that, in order to secure, if possible, for international through traffic, whether originating in Canada or in foreign territory, tariffs which all the participating companies should be bound to respect\u2014the foreign companies as well as the domestic companies \u2014 Parliament intended to prescribe that these tariffs should be filed by all the participants, i.e., by \"the several companies.\"\nA comparison of the several sections which deal with joint tariffs, I think, puts it beyond doubt that, so far as such a tariff is intended to be the result of action by the participating companies, in order that it shall be binding either all the participating companies must agree to it before it is filed, as is required in the case of through traffic over a continuous route wholly within Canada operated by two or more companies, or they must all concur in a joint act of filing the tariff or must each severally file it on its own behalf.\nI am respectfully of opinion that the Board erred in treating the tariff here in question as binding on the Grand Trunk Railway Company without its concurrence merely because it had been filed by the Indianapolis Southern Railroad Company and the Grand Trunk Railway Company had not moved for its disallowance. For this reason and on this ground alone I would allow this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H.

Holland v. Hodgson (L.R. 7 C.P. 328) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nA tract of land, in Nanaimo, B.C., on which were situate a number of small buildings, known as \"Chinatown,\" was sold, in March, 1908, to the plaintiffs. The defendant was, at that time, and for some years previously had been, tenant of a town lot, part of the land purchased by the plaintiffs, at a yearly rental and had constructed thereon the building in respect of which the present dispute has arisen and commenced to remove it from the locality to a new site at some distance therefrom. The plaintiffs obtained an injunction to restrain him from demolishing or removing the building and the defendant moved to set it aside. Affidavits were filed on behalf of both parties in support of their respective contentions, the plaintiffs alleging and the defendant denying that the building formed part of the freehold. On the return of the motion it was agreed that the application should be converted into a motion for judgment upon a stated case to be filed by consent, or, failing agreement, upon the material filed or to be filed by the parties, supplemented by photographs or a view of the premises. The parties failed to agree upon a stated case and His Lordship Chief Justice Hunter, after hearing the arguments of counsel for the parties upon the affidavits and photographs produced, viewed the premises and delivered judgment as follows:\u2014\n\"HUNTER C.J.\u2014 In this case, the defendant was a tenant of the vendor of a town lot bought by the plaintiffs, and claims the right to remove a building erected by him on the lot.\n\"I have had the advantage of a view, and find that the building practically covers the lot; that it is two stories in height; that it rests on rocks placed on the soil. The chimneys are supported on stout poles, which in turn rest on rock. There is a stoop along the front supported by wooden posts, which are firmly attached to a wooden-block sidewalk. The building was used as a store and dwelling house. In my opinion it is a fixture, as it was evidently put there for the purpose of better enjoying the use of the freehold, and the fact that it could no doubt be removed without materially injuring the freehold is immaterial. If that were so, a large number of dwelling houses and shops in the province which are mostly constructed of wood and built on wooden posts, could be treated as chattels.\n\"Judgment for the plaintiffs with costs.\"\nBy the judgment now appealed from, the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversed the judgment of the Chief Justice and entered a judgment in favour of the defendant.\nW. L. Scott for the appellants.\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIES J. (oral). \u2014 The recognized rule for the determination of cases where constructions have been placed upon leased land is stated by Lord Blackburn, in delivering the judgment of the court, in Holland v. Hodgson[1], at pages 334-335, where he says:\nThere is no doubt that the general maxim of the law is that what is annexed to the land becomes part of the land, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to say with precision what constitutes an annexation sufficient for this purpose. It is a question which must depend on the circumstances of each case and mainly on two circumstances as indicating the intention, viz., the degree of annexation, and the object of the annexation. When the article in question is no further attached to the land than by its own weight it is generally to be considered a mere chattel (see Wiltshear v. Cottrell[2], and the cases there cited). But even in such a case if the intention is apparent to make the articles part of the land they do become part of the land. See D'Eyncourt v. Gregory[3]. * * * Perhaps the true rule is that articles not otherwise attached to the land than by their own weight are not to be considered as part of the land unless the circumstances are such as to shew that they were intended to be part of the land, the onus of shewing that they were so intended lying on those who assert that they have ceased to be chattels and that, on the contrary, an article which is affixed to the land even slightly is to be considered as part of the land unless the circumstances are such as to shew that it was intended all along to continue a chattel, the onus lying on those who contend that it is a chattel.\nThis case, like all others of its kind, depends upon the special circumstances and intentions under and with which the constructions were made, and the facts as to their being affixed to the soil.\nIn the record before us, we have not sufficient evidence of what the circumstances were in which the building was placed upon the land, nor are we able from the evidence to reach a conclusion that the building in question was affixed to the freehold or placed there with the intention that it was to become part of the freehold. In the circumstances of this case we think there was an onus on the plaintiff to shew that the building was intended to be part of the land, which he failed to discharge, and having failed the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Russell, Russell & Hannington.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Eberts & Taylor.\n[1] L.R. 7 C.P. 328.\n[2] 1 E. & B. 674.\n[3] L.R. 3 Eq. 382.\n"}

The McAllister Co. was heavily indebted to the Ontario Bank, and being unable to pay the following agreements were entered into.\nMEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT entered into the 19th day of September, 1905.\nBETWEEN:\nTHE MCALLISTER MILLING COMPANY, hereinafter called the Company, of the one part, and:\nTHE ONTARIO BANK, hereinafter called the Bank, of the other part.\nWhereas the Company are indebted to the Bank in the sum of $69,200 as part security for which sum the Bank hold a lien under section 74 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d upon the goods and merchandise of the Company, and also an assignment of all the Company\u2019s book debts and other claims, as well as an assignment of a policy on the life of Charles Balmer McAllister, and the Company are unable to pay the Bank in full;\nAnd whereas it has been agreed that upon payment by the Company to the Bank of the sum of $10,000 and the absolute surrender of all its assets, the Bank assuming payment of certain liabilities as set out in the memorandum attached, the Bank shall release the Company and the individuals thereof from all further liability in respect of said indebtedness.\nNow, therefore, it is mutually agreed between the parties hereto as follows:\n1. The Company hereby surrender to the Bank all their right, title and interest in the assets of the Company as well as in the said policy on the life of Charles Balmer McAllister and agree to assign to the Bank their lease of the Otonabee Mills as well as all claims to damages which they have against The Peterborough Hydraulic Power Company and The American Cereal Company and they authorize the Bank to bring such action or actions in their names as may be necessary to recover said damages, the Bank agreeing to indemnify them in respect of all costs relating to the same.\n2. The Company shall forthwith pay to the Bank the sum of $10,000, the Bank assuming the payment of certain of the Company\u2019s liabilities as particularly set out in the memorandum hereto attached, and will honour the Company\u2019s cheques when issued in payment of such liabilities, the intention of this arrangement being that the settlement should be so carried out as not to injure the credit of the said Company or members thereof.\n3. The Company and the individual members thereof agree to execute to the Bank such further assignments and assurances as may be necessary to vest in the Bank all of the said assets and policy of assurance.\n4. It is hereby expressly agreed that the interest of Jennie B. McAllister in the Lakefield Milling Company is not intended to be transferred or pass to the Bank under this agreement and is not part of the assets of the said Company.\n5. In consideration whereof the Bank shall forthwith release the Company and the individual members thereof from all further liability in respect of their said indebtedness to the Bank, and in the event of the said business being hereafter carried on in the name of the said Company as provided in the agreement bearing even date herewith between the Bank and Charles Balmer McAllister or in any similar way the Bank hereby agrees to indemnify the said Company and the individual members thereof against any and all liabilities then or thereby incurred.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the said parties have hereunto set their hands.\nTHE MCALLISTER MILLING Co.,\nC.B.

And whereas for the more convenient liquidation of the said assets and with a view to disposing of the Company\u2019s business as a going concern, it has been deemed advisable and has been agreed to enter into the arrangement hereinafter expressed.\nNow therefore it is mutually agreed between the parties hereto as follows:\n1. Mr. C.B. McAllister shall continue to carry on the said business under the name of the McAllister Milling Company and to manage the same as a going concern, curtailing expenses as far as possible, and collecting the book debts and other claims so that within a short period the amount due to the Bank may be reduced to the lowest dimensions, having in view the intention to dispose of the Company\u2019s business as a going concern at the earliest date possible.\n2. For his services in this behalf Mr. McAllister shall be allowed out of the business a salary at the rate of one thousand dollars per annum, payable weekly, and he shall not draw any larger sum out of the business.\n3. The business shall be under the supervision of Mr. John Crane, manager of the Bank, who shall have constant access to the Company\u2019s books and to whom Mr. McAllister shall be accountable for all transactions, but the said McAllister shall not be responsible for any error of judgment in the management of the said business or for any loss or losses incurred thereby.\n4. And the said Bank agrees to indemnify the said Company and the members thereof against any liabilities incurred while the business is being continued in the Company\u2019s name, as hereinbefore provided. 5. The said Charles B. McAllister agrees that at any time the Bank may desire, he will, if possible, effect an insurance or insurances upon his life in some company or companies selected by the Bank to such extent as the Bank shall name and will from time to time absolutely assign the policy or policies therefor to the Bank\u2014the said Bank being alone responsible for all premiums in respect of same.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the said parties hereto have hereunto set their hands.\nC.B. MCALLISTER,\nONTARIO BANK,\nJohn Crane, Mgr.\nWitness:\nA.P. POUSSETTE.\nTHIS INDENTURE. made the nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five.\nBETWEEN:\nTHE ONTARIO BANK, of the first part; and\nCHARLES BALMER MCALLISTER and JENNIE B. MCALLISTER, trading in co-partnership under the style of the \u201cMcAllister Milling Company\u201d as well in their individual as in their partnership capacity, of the second part.\nWhereas the parties of the second part are indebted to the parties of the first part in the sum of $69,200 and being unable to pay the full amount of their indebtedness have by instrument bearing even date herewith surrendered to the parties of the first part all their firm assets and have also paid to the parties of the first part the sum of $10,000 in consideration that the parties of the first part would release them individually as well as their said firm from all liabilities.\nAnd whereas, there have been divers accounts, dealings, and transactions between the said parties hereto respectively, all of which have now been finally adjusted, settled, and disposed of and the said parties hereto have respectively agreed to give to each other the mutual releases and discharges hereinafter contained in manner hereinafter expressed.\nNow, therefore, these presents witness, that in consideration of the premises and of the sum of one dollar, of lawful money of Canada to each of them, the said parties hereto respectively paid by the other of them at or before the sealing and delivery hereof (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged), each of them the said parties hereto respectively, doth hereby for themselves, their successors and assigns, and for himself and herself respectively, his and her respective heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, remise, release, and forever acquit and discharge the other of them, their successors and assigns, his and her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and all his her and their lands and tenements, goods, chattels, estate and effects respectively whatsoever and wheresoever, of and from all debts, sum and sums of money, accounts, reckonings, actions, suits, cause and causes of action and suit, claims and demands whatsoever, either at law or in equity, or otherwise howsoever, which either of the said parties now have, or has, or ever had, or might or could have against the other of them, on any account whatsoever, of and concerning any matter cause or thing whatsoever between them, the said parties hereto respectively, from the beginning of the world down to the day of the date of these presents. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the said parties hereto of the first part have hereunto affixed their corporate seal as testified by the hands of their proper officers in that behalf.\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered in the presence of\nFor the Ontario Bank,C. MCGILL,General Manager.\n[Seal.]\nThe respondents also executed a power of attorney to the local manager of the bank to execute for them an assignment of the lease which, however, was never acted upon.\nThe milling business was carried on under said agreements until the bank became insolvent in 1906, when the stock in hand was sold and the premises abandoned. The lease had then over six years to run and the lessors brought action against the respondents for a gale of rent accruing due after such abandonment of possession, and the bank, which had paid it up to that time, was called in as a third party to indemnify respondents. The lessors obtained judgment and an issue was tried between respondents and the bank, the latter setting up several defences against the claim to indemnity, especially the following.\nThat the said agreements, except the release, not being under its corporate seal were never executed by the bank.\nThat if executed the indemnity by the bank only covered existing liabilities and did not extend to future rent for which the bank was not otherwise liable having never accepted an assignment of the lease. That the agreement to accept an assignment of the lease and carry on the business was contrary to the provisions of the \u201cBank Act\u201d and void.\nThat the respondents\u2019 claim for rent was barred by the mutual release executed by them and the bank.\nThe Chancellor who tried the issue gave judgment against the bank which was reversed by the Divisional Court, but restored by the Court of Appeal.\nMorine K.C. and McKelcan for the appellant. The McAllister Co. agreed to assign the lease but the bank did not agree to accept an assignment, and none having been executed the bank is not bound. See Dawes v. Tredwell[2]; Ramsden v. Smith[3].\nAn agreement to assign is not equivalent to an assignment, nor does it necessarily mean to assign the legal title. Manchester Brewery Co. v. Coombs[4], at page 617, commenting on Walsh v. Lonsdale[5].\nThe effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is to enforce specific performance of part of a contract which is not permissible and of an unlawful contract which is still less permissible. See National Bank of Australasia v. Cherry[6]; Small v. Smith[7].\nNesbitt K.C. and D. O\u2019Connell for the respondents. Under section 76 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d the Ontario Bank had power to enter into this agreement. And see First National Bank of Charlotte v. National Exchange Bank of Baltimore[8]; Royal Bank of Indian\u2019s Case[9]; Exchange Bank of Canada v. Fletcher[10]. As to the agreement to assign see Hanson v. Stevenson[11].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal.\nThe intention of the parties as evidenced by the three agreements was to substitute an assignment of all the assets of the McAllister Co. for the lien which the bank then held. The bank undertook in consideration of this assignment and of the money payment of $10,000 to discharge the company from all liability and in addition assumed the payment of certain disclosed accounts due to third parties, which apparently included all the business liabilities of the respondents. To liquidate these assets, or to dispose of the business as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d to advantage, as the bank then contemplated doing, it was necessary to secure the use of the premises in which the milling business was being carried on; and not content with the assignment of the lease which in the circumstances should be considered as included in the assignment of the assets, it was specially stipulated that the company should surrender or assign the lease. It was further found as a fact by the trial judge that the bank entered into possession of the premises, paid the rent for the period of their occupation and obtained, through the company, the lessor\u2019s consent for the assignment of the lease for its full term. In these circumstances, I do not understand how the bank could hope to escape liability.\nWith respect to the alleged violation of the section of the \u201cBank Act\u201d which prohibits trafficing in or carrying on the business of buying and selling goods, wares and merchandise, this was an isolated transaction entered into to enable the bank to realize the amount of an indebtedness which had been legally contracted and anything done for that purpose cannot affect the legality of the transaction under which the bank acquired the assets of the company and assumed its obligation under the lease.\nDAVIES J.\u2014Two main questions were argued upon this appeal. One was that an agreement to assign the lease in question to the bank without any actual or legal assignment of the lease did not involve an obligation on the bank\u2019s part to indemnify McAllister from liability for future rent. We are all of the opinion, however, concurring in that of the Appeal Court of Ontario and of the Chancellor, as stated during the argument, that considering the real nature of the transaction and the actual facts which were intended to occur and did occur, such an agreement to indemnify McAllister against any liability for future rent on the covenants of the lease would be implied.\nThe principal contention of Mr. Morine, however, was that the bank could not legally take or agree to take an absolute assignment of this lease of the McAllister milling property and the assets of the milling firm because the transaction as evidenced by the several agreements entered into by the parties contemplated expressly the carrying on of the milling business by the bank as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for an undefined period, or as expressed in the documents \u201cuntil the bank could sell and dispose of it as such going concern\u201d; that any such transaction was ultra vires of the bank, and in fact a direct violation of the specific provisions of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nI confess that I have had great difficulty in making up my mind whether or no the transaction now impeached as ultra vires of the bank was so or not. I am even yet by no means free from doubt, but my conclusion is that, considering its real nature, object and purpose, the impeached transaction may be held to be one of those which may be fairly and reasonably implied as being within the general powers given to the bank by sub-section (d) of section 76 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d and as not being within the excepted prohibitions contained in sub-section 2 (a) of that section.\nThe section reads:\nThe bank may * * *\n(d) engage in and carry on such business generally as appertains to the business of banking.\n(2) Except as authorized by this Act the bank shall not, either directly or indirectly,\u2014\n(a) deal in the buying or selling, or bartering of goods, wares and merchandise, or engage or be engaged in any trade or business whatsoever.\nI concede that in order to sustain my conclusion of law I am bound to bring the impeached transaction within the enabling clause and to exclude it from the prohibitory clause of the section.\nBut I am not bound to shew express words in the statute conferring upon the bank all the powers which it may lawfully use to carry out its legitimate objects or purposes. It is quite sufficient if I can shew they may be derived by fair and reasonable implication from the provisions of the Act and have not been expressly prohibited or excluded from the general powers conferred. That is the law, as I understand it, as laid down in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[12]; Attorney-General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[13], and Baroness Wenlock v. River Dee Co.[14] In agreeing to take over the lease and milling business as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for a limited time in order to dispose of it to some advantage the bank may be said to have violated in a literal sense the prohibition in the latter part of sub-section 2 (a) against engaging in any business whatever. But if the general powers of the bank of engaging in and carrying on \u201csuch business generally as appertains to the business of banking\u201d given by sub-section (d) are large enough and broad enough to cover such a transaction as that now under discussion, of course it would not come within the prohibitory clause even though the words of that clause literally applied might cover it.\nBanks, from the very nature of the business they are expressly authorized to carry on, must necessarily loan to customers and others large amounts of money and frequently find themselves with debts owing to them by persons who are insolvent or unable to pay. The assets of such debtors may, in this country at any rate, consist in part of a \u201cgoing concern,\u201d valuable as such, but of little value if wound up by sale under execution or mortgage, or they may consist of perishable goods on the way to a market or logs cut on timber limits ready to be floated down the river to market or mill, or in process of such flotation.\nSuch debtors may be quite willing to hand over all their assets to the bank absolutely in compromise or settlement of their indebtedness. To compel the parties to resort in every case to the strict statutory methods permitted of taking security and afterwards realizing on it in due legal form, might in many cases cause great loss without any apparent reason. Perishable goods might not be disposable while on the way to a market except at ruinous loss, and the same may be said of logs being floated to their mill or market. If the \u201cBank Act\u201d means that the bank may not take over and accept absolutely in payment of its debt the real and personal property of its debtor, but must in all cases first take security upon it and realize afterwards on such security, there is an end to the argument. No possible loss which may follow the prescribed course can avail the parties. But it does not appear to me the \u201cBank Act\u201d does say so. There is nothing in the Act which says that though all parties may agree that\nthe simplest and least costly way of closing out a hopeless account is to give the debtor an immediate release in consideration of a direct transfer of his property,\nsuch a settlement must necessarily be declared ultra vires.\nIt seems to me that in all such cases it must be a question of fact to be determined by the court on the special circumstances of each case whether there was or was not a violation of the prohibition of sub-section 2 (a) against dealing in the buying or selling, or bartering of goods or being engaged in any business whatever; or whether the substance of the transaction was not rather and really a bon\u00e2 fide compromise or settlement of a debt due the bank, although such settlement or compromise might incidentally involve, in one sense, a buying or selling or an engaging in business. But where the substance of the transaction is found to be a bon\u00e2 fide compromise or settlement of a past due debt, as under the facts and circumstances I would hold the transaction in question in this case to be, then it seems to me it might fairly be claimed as impliedly authorized by the sub-section (d) of section 76, even though solely to avoid enormous loss it may involve, as in this case it did, the running of the mill as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for what would be deemed a reasonable time in order to dispose of it without ruinous loss.\nA strong argument was made against the legality of such an absolute assignment of the milling property and assets of the McAllister Company as was taken by the bank in this case arising out of the 80th, 81st and 82nd sections of the Act, which authorize the bank to take mortgages and hypothecs of realty and personalty as additional security for past due debts, and enable it to purchase any real or immovable property offered for sale under execution, etc., or by a prior mortgagee, or by the bank itself under a power of sale, and so enable the bank to acquire an absolute title in lands mortgaged to it either by release or sale or foreclosure of the equity of redemption.\nThese sections are enabling ones and are intended to confer upon the bank reasonable and necessary powers to take mortgages and hypothecs from their debtors by\nway of additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business,\nand to realize upon such mortgages by foreclosure or sale, and acquire and hold the absolute title \u201ceither by obtaining a release of the equity of redemption\u201d or otherwise. Their purpose and object was to enable the banks to take and realize securities for debts contracted to them. They did not relate to cases where the bank was compromising its debt and accepting something from the debtor in absolute discharge. They should not be construed as being exhaustive of the bank\u2019s powers or methods of realizing payment or satisfaction from its debtor\u2019s property of the debt due to the bank, or as taking away from the banks by implication any powers which they might reasonably be held to have arising out of the power to\nengage in and carry on such business generally as appertains to the business of banking.\nThey are not prohibitive sections in any way, but enabling only, and while I recognize the strength and force of the argument as to the intention of the legislature to be derived from them, I am not, on my construction of sub-section (d) of section 76 and the powers reasonably to be implied from it, able to say that real or personal property may not be taken by the bank in absolute payment and discharge of its debt from an impecunious or defaulting debtor, notwithstanding those sections which provide for the manner in which additional security may be taken and realized upon for debts due the bank not by way of compromise and discharge. Banking business in Canada must from the very circumstances of the case, I should imagine, be conducted upon a broader and somewhat more elastic basis than in fully developed business communities such as Great Britain, and in construing the powers conferred upon banks to carry on\nsuch business generally as appertains to the business of banking\nit is fair that Canadian conditions should be fully considered and allowed for. Large advances must be made from time to time to lumbermen, fishermen and traders of different kinds to enable them to cut, catch, win and market the natural products of the country and debts and risks necessarily incurred possibly greater than the more conservative systems of Great Britain would approve. It might in many circumstances be unjust and cause unnecessary and unrea- sonable loss to confine the banks to the \u201cadditional securities\u201d clauses as the only way or means open to them to realize their debts.\nIn the case at bar I am not able to agree with one at least of the reasons upon which some of the judges of the Court of Appeal support their judgment, namely, that the carrying on of the milling business by the bank after it took over the property from Mr. McAllister was severable from the rest of the transaction between the parties. I think the transaction, as a whole, must stand or fall together. It was a substantive part of the agreement from the first that it should be carried on by the bank as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d under the management of Mr. McAllister, and it was so carried on. If that part of the agreement which, in my opinion, was substantive and essential is ultra vires of the bank, then I do not see how the other part can be upheld. In my judgment, however, as I have attempted to shew, the transaction as entered into by the parties and carried out by them can reasonably be supported by the implied powers arising out of their general banking business (sub-section (d), section 76), and as these implied powers are not controlled by any prohibitive section of the Act they are to be given effect to.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The many phases of this case have been so fully and carefully dealt with in the court below that I do not feel as if I could add anything to the symposium of law it has given rise to.\nIt seems to me to have been the undoubted purpose of the parties that all the assets of the company, of which the lease in question no doubt was at one time a highly valued part, should be transferred to the appellant, and in consideration of such transfer and an added sum of ten thousand dollars from respondents\u2019 friends given expressly to secure the release of respondents from the embarrassments in which they had got themselves involved the appellant was to see them effectually released.\nIt would be a most melancholy legal result if the law by its necessary operation should defeat the plain purpose of all concerned.\nI cannot agree in any interpretation of the contract that would exclude the implication which the entire scope of the whole arrangement indicates to have been part and parcel of the bargain, irrespective of some considerations of minor import and the provisions there anent relied on to exclude the implication of liability in question herein.\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Osler seems to me to cover so fully the views I hold and the whole of the matters necessary to be dealt with in the case that I cannot do better than assent thereto.\nSince writing the foregoing, shortly after the argument, conflicting views in the court having been presented for consideration, I have re-examined the case. In the result I still agree with Mr. Justice Osler, but to guard against misapprehension of the range of his opinion as I conceive it (though his words may bear another meaning) I may add that I desire to reserve the right to review the question of ultra vires when, if ever, presented under different conditions of pleading but similar conditions of fact. I think the ultra vires aspect is not open to our consideration here. Paragraph 6 of appellant\u2019s defence, being the only part thereof that suggests any such questions as ultra vires or illegality, does not raise either point as distinctly as it should.\nEvery act or contract that is ultra vires is in a sense illegal. Every illegal act or contract is in a sense ultra vires.\nYet something done upon the faith of its being intra vires and proving ultra vires and hence failing of legal effect, merely for that reason, may be attendant with entirely different results from the same sort of thing done in violation of some legal prohibition either statutory or by virtue of the common law.\nIn the former case either party may, according to circumstances, have some right to relief; or to ask that conditional relief only be given to him setting up the ultra vires plea.\nIn the latter case neither can have relief if the defence of illegality be set up or has so developed in the trial of the case that the court must take notice of it.\nAgain, the wilful disregard of the limitations of the power of a corporation may render absolutely illegal that which, if entered into in good faith, might have been merely held and treated as ultra vires.\nIt is difficult to be quite sure what the defence as pleaded aimed at.\nBut the case is pre-eminently one wherein the plaintiffs were entitled if mere ultra vires is relied upon to have it so appear of record in order that they might seek such relief as the justice and facts of the case demand.\nThe pleading is followed in this late stage by the appellant in its counsel\u2019s factum in effect discarding mere ultra vires by relying only upon the acquisition of the land or lease as and for the express purpose of carrying on a flour milling business.\nThis interpretation of the pleading I am entitled to take as covering all there is to complain of in the judgment below under the head of that plea.\nHence, I think mere ultra vires out of the case by this interpretation of the plea set up.\nI think the issue as thus raised in the factum is all that is now open to the appellant and that Mr. Justice Osler\u2019s reasoning clearly disposes thereof.\nIt may be that these questions are identical in this case, but I think that is not so clear.\nIn such a case as we have here a most valuable term might be the only asset and so subject to conditions of assignment as only to be acquired by the will of the debtor.\nI doubt if the \u201cBank Act\u201d stands in the way of a bank, in such dire necessity, accepting a transfer of such an asset, to save a loss arising from a past due debt.\nIt seems to me that position can only be tenable if at all by construing the Act as prohibitive of any absolute transfer of property in consideration of discharge from the obligation due the bank.\nThere is enough in the language of the sections dealing with the subject in its various phases to make a plausible argument for such a contention. But it has not been pleaded or argued and possibly is not worthy of notice.\nIt seems to me as possibly the case that it can only be under some such necessity as arises, in cases like that before us, calling forth what may be called the reserve powers to be implied that the acquisition of absolute ownership, in consideration of discharge, can be tolerated, if at all; except in the way and under the circumstances expressly provided for.\nI do not in this case think I am under the pleading and all other things that appear, either called upon or expected to decide the point.\nI still adhere to Mr. Justice Osler\u2019s finding an implied power in a bank to grapple with such a condition of things as arose here and accept, as a solution thereof, the terms proposed, coupled with the acceptance of the transfer of a lease; and I accept his view of the severability of what was done from that which was a necessary part of the contract.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014In my view of this case the main question raised by the appeal is whether the transaction of September, 1905, was or was not ultra vires of the Ontario Bank. That bank is one of those named in Schedule A to the \u201cBank Act,\u201d R.S.C. 1906, and the following provision of that Act applies to it:\n4. The charters or Acts of incorporation, and any Acts in amendment thereof, of the several banks enumerated in Schedule A to this Act are continued in force until the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and eleven, so far as regards, as to each of such banks:\n(a) the incorporation and corporate name;\n(b) the amount of the authorized capital stock;\n(c) the amount of each share of such stock; and\n(d) the chief place of business;\nsubject to the right of each of such banks to increase or reduce its authorized capital stock in the manner hereinafter provided.\n2. As to all other particulars this Act shall form and be the charter of each of the said banks until the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and eleven.\nThe principles therefore which govern the construction of the powers of statutory corporations are those which must be applied for the determination of the question at issue. These principles are stated in two judgments in passages I will quote in extenso; the first from the judgment of Bowen L.J., in Baroness Wenlock v. The River Dee Co.[15], is as follows:\nAt common law a corporation created by the King\u2019s charter has prim\u00e2 facie, and has been known to have ever since Sutton\u2019s Hospital Case[16], the power to do with its property all such acts as an ordinary person can do, and to bind itself to such contracts as an ordinary person can bind himself to; and even if by the charter creating the corporation the King imposes some direction which would have the effect of limiting the natural capacity of the body of which he is speaking, the common law has always held that the direction of the King might be enforced through the Attorney-General; but although it might contain an essential part of the so-called bargain between the Crown and the corporation, that did not at law destroy the legal power of the body which the King had created. When you come to corporations created by statute, the question seems to me entirely different, and I do not think it is quite satisfactory to say that you must take the statute as if it had created a corporation at common law, and then see whether it took away any of the incidents of a corporation at common law, because that begs the question, and it not only begs the question, but it states what is an untruth, namely, that the statute does create a corporation at common law. It does nothing of the sort. It creates a statutory corporation, which may or may not be meant to possess all or more or less of the qualities with which a corporation at common law is endowed. Therefore, to say that you must assume that it has got everything which it would have at common law unless the statute takes it away is, I think, to travel on the wrong line of thought. What you have to do is to find out what this statutory creature is, and what it is meant to do, and to find out what the statutory creature is, you must look at the statute only, because there, and there alone, is found the definition of this new creature. It is no use to consider the question of whether you are going to classify under the head of common law corporations. Looking at this statutory creature one has to find out what are its powers, what is its vitality, what it can do. It is made up of persons who can act within certain limits, but in order to ascertain what are the limits, we must look to the statute. The corporation cannot go beyond the statute, for the best of all reasons, that it is a simple statutory creature, and if you look at the case in that way you will see that the legal consequences are exactly the same as if you treat it as having certain powers given to it by statute, and being prohibited from using certain other powers which it otherwise might have had. The second from the speech of Lord Macnaghten in Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v. Osborne[17], at p. 94:\nIt is a broad and general principle that companies incorporated by statute for special purposes, and societies, whether incorporated or not, which owe their constitution and their status to an Act of Parliament, having their objects and powers defined thereby, cannot apply their funds to any purpose foreign to the purposes for which they were established, or embark on any undertaking in which they were not intended by Parliament to be concerned.\nThe principle, I think, is nowhere stated more clearly than it is by Lord Watson, in Baroness Wenlock v. River Dee Co.[18], in the following passage: \u201cWhenever a corporation is created by Act of Parliament with reference to the purposes of the Act, and solely with a view to carrying those purposes into execution, I am of opinion not only that the objects which the corporation may legitimately pursue must be ascertained from the Act itself, but that the powers which the corporation may lawfully use in furtherance of these objects must either be expressly conferred or derived by reasonable implication from its provisions.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d adds his Lordship, \u201cappears to me to be the principle recognized by this House in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[19], and in Attorney-General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[20]\u201d\nAnd again at page 97:\nThe learned counsel for the appellants did not, as I understood their argument, venture to contend that the power which they claimed could be derived by reasonable implication from the language of the legislature. They said it was a power \u201cincidental,\u201d \u201cancillary,\u201d or \u201cconducive\u201d to the purposes of trade unions. If these rather loose expressions are meant to cover something beyond what may be found in the language which the legislature has used, all I can say is that, so far as I know, there is no foundation in principle or authority for the proposition involved in their use. Lord Selborne no doubt did use the term \u201cincidental\u201d in a well-known passage in his judgment in Attorney-General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.20 But Lord Watson certainly understood him to use it as equivalent to what might be derived by reasonable implication from the language of the Act to which the company owed its constitution; and Lord Selborne himself, to judge from his language in Murray v. Scott[21] could have meant nothing more. The provisions by which are defined the business that a bank subject to the \u201cBank Act\u201d is permitted to carry on and the powers exercisable by it in doing so, are found in the series of sections beginning with section 76 and headed \u201cThe Business and Powers of a Bank.\u201d The principal section is 76, which I quote verbatim:\nThe business and powers of a bank.\n76. The bank may,\u2014\n(a) Open branches, agencies and offices;\n(b) Engage in and carry on business as a dealer in gold and silver coin and bullion;\n(c) Deal in, discount and lend money and make advances upon the security of and take as collateral security for any loan made by it, bills of exchange, promissory notes and other negotiable securities, or the stock, bonds, debentures and obligations of municipal and other corporations, whether secured by mortgage or otherwise, or Dominion, provincial, British, foreign and other public securities; and\n(d) Engage in and carry on such business generally as appertains to the business of banking.\n2. Except as authorized by this Act, the bank shall not, either directly or indirectly,\u2014\n(a) Deal in the buying or selling, or bartering of goods, wares and merchandise, or engage and be engaged in any trade or business whatsoever;\n(b) Purchase, or deal in, or lend money, or make advances upon the security or pledge of any share of its own capital stock, or of the capital stock of any bank; or\n(c) Lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements or immovable property, or of any ships or other vessels, or upon the security of any goods, wares and merchandise.\nThe question before us conveniently subdivides itself into two: 1st: Does the transaction fall within the prohibition found in sub-section 2(a); and 2ndly: Can it, having regard to the provisions of the Act as a whole, be brought within sub-section 1(d)?\nThe relevant features of the transaction are these. The respondents owed the bank certain moneys which they were unable to pay. They were, however, engaged in grain buying and milling, holding their mill under a lease having some years to run; and they proposed to the bank that the bank should take over the business (assuming the existing liabilities) that the respondents should pay $10,000 and that they should be released from their liability. It was objected that the bank had no means of carrying on the business until a purchaser should be found when the respondents proposed that C.B. McAllister should carry it on for the bank for six months if necessary, and on that understanding the proposal was accepted. The substance of the completed arrangements was that the whole of the beneficial interest in the assets of the business should be vested in the bank and accepted by it in full payment; that the business should be carried on by C.B. McAllister for the bank in the old firm name in order to enable the bank to sell it as a going concern; and that the bank should indemnify the respondents in respect of all liabilities to which they might become subject by reason of the use of their names. No formal transfer of the lease was executed. It seems to me, however, to be too clear for argument that the respondents holding this lease for the benefit of a natural person sui juris under a like agreement would be entitled to indemnity in respect of their liability on the covenants of the lease; the sole question here being, as I have indicated, that concerning the effect of the provisions of the \u201cBank Act\u201d as touching the powers of the bank in respect of such a transaction.\nI think the applicant entitled to succeed on both branches of the question above stated.\nThe power of the bank to make the purchase and enter into the obligations entailed by it were chiefly rested in the court below upon section 30, sub-section (a) of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 1), which provides that\n30. In every Act unless the contrary intention appears, words making any association or number of persons a corporation or body politic and corporate shall,\u2014\n(a) Vest in such corporation power to sue and be sued, to contract and be contracted with by their corporate name, to have a common seal, to alter or change the same at their pleasure, to have perpetual succession, to acquire and hold personal property or movables for the purposes for which the corporation is constituted, and to alienate the same at pleasure,\nand upon an authority said to be implied in the express grant of authority to carry on such business generally as \u201cappertains to the business of banking.\u201d As to the first of these grounds I think it clear that the power to take and hold personalty and to sell it again is a power which can be exercised only in the course of and for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the corporation as defined in the Act from which it derives its powers, and that in its application to the \u201cBank Act\u201d the clause just quoted adds nothing whatever to the powers expressed by or implied in section 76. Does then the authority to\nengage in and carry on such business generally as appertains to the business of banking,\nas conferred by section 76, include the authority to take over a mercantile or other trading business in payment of a debt with the bona fide expectation that by carrying it on and selling it as a going concern a loss may be avoided?\nNobody argues that it is a part of the ordinary business of banking to buy a mercantile business either for cash or upon the consideration of the release of a debt. The question is whether such a transaction is justifiable by reason of the ex- ceptional circumstance that the debtor is unable to pay and that by taking over his business and carrying it on the bank may ultimately, by selling it, get more than it otherwise could get. I do not think in this case we are concerned with the question whether the belief of the bank\u2019s officers was well founded; there is nothing to indicate that the real object and purpose of the transaction was other than what the parties professed it was and its validity must be examined on that assumption.\nNow, it is of course a part of the business of banking to make loans on personal security and to take steps to get them repaid. Does the authority to do this which by section 76(d) is, I think, expressly conferred as an integral part of the business of banking imply the authority to take specific property (of a kind the bank is not authorized to trade in) in payment in such circumstances as to involve the bank in the necessity of carrying on a distinct business in order to enable it to realize that property? Here let me recall the words of Lord Macnaghten quoted above from Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v. Osborne[22], at page 97. The question then is: Can you derive the last mentioned power by reasonable implication from the first mentioned power? The test is not whether the second might be reasonably held to be convenient or conducive to the objects of the bank, but whether it is so necessary for the accomplishment of these objects that the legislature in conferring the first is to be held thereby to have conferred the second. (See last mentioned case at page 96.)\nThe statute itself provides specially for the taking of security as the normal course where debts already contracted are not paid; and for giving full effect to the security by taking over the property comprised by it where necessary. But the assumption of the debtor\u2019s property in satisfaction in the first instance does not appear to be contemplated; and since the same result might be accomplished through the taking of security (which is specially provided for) it is difficult to see how the power to take over such property except in cases where it is held as security can be said to be necessarily implied. It is not unimportant to observe that the power to take over mortgaged property in payment of the mortgage debt is not confined (as Garrow J. appears to have thought) to real property but is expressly made applicable to personal property as well.\nWhatever might have been said respecting the effect of the sub-section standing alone it seems to me to be impossible to give it this effect when read together with the second subsection (a).\nThe only express exception is confined to cases which are \u201cauthorized by the Act\u201d itself. It is, I think, an unwarrantable extension of the meaning of those words to say that such transactions as this\u2014though not necessary\u2014are convenient in the exercise of the business of banking and therefore \u201cauthorized by the Act.\u201d\nThe history of the legislation and of the judicial decisions confirms this view. Section 7 of 13 & 14 Vict. ch. 21, reads as follows:\nAnd be it enacted, that the business of banking shall, for the purposes of this Act, mean the making and issuing of bank notes, the dealing in gold and silver bullion and exchange, discounting of promissory notes, bills and negotiable securities, and such other trade as belongs legitimately to the business of banking, but any company or party who may lawfully exercise the business of banking under this Act, shall also have power to take and hold any property which shall have been bon\u00e2 fide mortgaged, hypothecated or pledged to such company or party, as security for debts previously incurred in the course of their lawful dealings as aforesaid, and sold under any writ, order or process of any court of law or equity and bought at such sale by the company or party, and to re-sell or otherwise alienate or dispose of the same; but except as aforesaid, no such company or party shall deal in the buying, selling or bartering of goods, wares or merchandise, or engage or be engaged in any trade whatever; and the word \u201cbank\u2019\u2019 in this Act shall mean and include any company or party carrying on the business of banking under this Act, unless such meaning be inconsistent with the context.\nSuch transactions as the present were evidently not intended to make part of the business of banking under this definition. An Act passed in the same year, chapter 22, for the first time gave a general authority to incorporated banks to take security on personal as well as real property and thereafter to acquire the rights of the debtor in such property. But from the year 1840 to the present I have found not the slightest indication on the part of the legislature that such transactions as that under consideration were regarded as forming a part of the ordinary business of banking. In Radford v. Merchants\u2019 Bank[23], it was held that it was ultra vires for a bank to take over unfinished goods, finish them, and then sell them, with a view of preventing a loss in respect of a loan. Since the date of that decision (1893) the \u201cBank Act\u201d has been several times re-enacted, but its relevant provisions have remained the same.\nI cannot agree with the view that (for the purpose of determining the competence of the bank to enter into the transaction) you can separate the taking over of the business from the object and purpose of taking it over. The ultimate purpose was to realize the debt; but to do so by carrying on the business until it could be sold as a going concern. The taking over of the business as a going concern for that purpose was plainly in my opinion an infringement of the prohibition against \u201cdealing in buying and selling\u201d unless as I have said it can be justified as a mere subsidiary transaction. That point I have just dealt with; but looking at the purchase as distinct from the arrangement to carry on, then (if I am right in the view that the prosecution of the business contemplated by the parties would, even in the special circumstances of this transaction, be within the prohibition) the transaction is clearly within that class of bargains which have been held to be invalid as entered into with the purpose by the one party known to the other of accomplishing an illegal object. Transactions entered into in contravention of section 76, sub-section 2(a), are of course not only ultra vires, but illegal in the narrower sense.\nThe rule is stated,\u2014I venture to think correctly\u2014in Pollock on Contracts (3 Am. ed.), at pages 485, 487, in these words:\nIntention to put property purchased, etc., to unlawful use. We have in the first place a well marked class of transactions where there is an agreement for the transfer of property or possession for a lawful consideration, but for the purpose of an unlawful use being made of it. All agreements incident to such a transaction are void; and it does not matter whether the unlawful purpose is in fact carried out or not. The later authorities shew that the agreement is void, not merely if the unlawful use of the subject-matter is part of the bargain, but if the intention of the one party so to use it is known to the other at the time of the agreement. Thus money lent to be used in an unlawful manner cannot be recovered. It is true that money lent to pay bets can be recovered, but that, as we have seen is because there is nothing unlawful in either making a bet or paying it if lost, though the payment cannot be enforced. If goods are sold by a vendor who knows that the purchaser means to apply them to an illegal or immoral purpose, he cannot recover the price; it is the same of letting goods on hire. If a building is demised in order to be used in a manner forbidden by a building Act, the lessor cannot recover on any covenant in the lease. * * * It does not matter whether the seller or lessor does or does not expect to be paid out of the fruits of the illegal use of the property. Here the illegal purpose to carry on the business was not only known, but was participated in to this extent at least that, under the agreement, the bank acquired authority to carry on the business under the name of the vendors. There can be no doubt, I think, that for the purpose of applying this rule the distinction between malum prohibitum and malum in se has, to use the words of Best J., in Bensley v. Bignold[24], been long since exploded.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The Ontario Bank having been found liable as a third party to indemnify the defendants, the original lessees, against the payment of rent, under a lease which they had agreed to assign to the bank, appeals to this court for relief on three grounds:\n(a) That in the absence of an express undertaking the bank is not under any obligation to indemnify the defendants;\n(b) That it is ultra vires of a bank to take from its debtor in payment or part satisfaction of his debt an assignment of leasehold premises; and\n(c) That its agreement with them is illegal because it contemplates that the bank shall carry on a trade or business.\n(a) By intimating to counsel for respondents that we did not desire to hear them on the first point, we expressed our concurrence in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario on that part of the case;\n(b) The question as to the legality of the acquisition by the bank of the lease of their debtors has occasioned me some difficulty. The argument against it, based on the provisions of sections 79, 80(2), 81 and 82 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d is somewhat formidable. The statute confers upon banks, in respect of personal or movable property mortgaged to them the same rights, etc., as they are by the Act declared to have in respect to real or immovable property mortgaged to them (section 80(2)). They are expressly given special powers to purchase real or immovable property of their debtors sold under execution, in insolvency, under order or decree of a court, or by a prior mortgagee or by themselves under a power of sale (section 81). They are also expressly given power to take releases of equities of redemption and to foreclose mortgages held by them (section 82). The inquiry naturally suggests itself\u2014if banks have the right to acquire such property directly from their debtors in satisfaction of debts due to them, why are these special powers conferred? The sections containing them appear to contemplate that, except\nfor its actual use and occupation and the management of its business (section 79)\na bank shall acquire an absolute title only to real property which has been already mortgaged or hypothecated to it as security. Does this implication extend to personal or movable property?\nIn several of the authorities relied upon by the respondents in support of their contention that it does not so extend, we find that the banks there before the courts had express powers given them to take their debtors\u2019 property in payment. Thus in the case of the First National Bank of Charlotte v. The National Exchange Bank of Baltimore[25], the statute provided that real estate might be accepted in good faith as security for, or in payment of debts previ- ously contracted (p. 127); and in Bank of New South Wales v. Campbell[26], the banking company had the power to take, hold, etc., any lands, etc., in satisfaction, liquidation or discharge of, or in security for any debt due, or to become due (p. 192). Again in the Royal Bank of India\u2019s Case[27], much relied upon by the respondents, the bank merely took over the shares which had already been pledged to it as security. The only case cited at Bar in which, without express statutory authority, a bank was held entitled to take in payment of a debt due to it property upon which it had not previously held a mortgage or lien as security, is Sacket\u2019s Harbour Bank v. Lewis County Bank[28].\nCounsel for the respondents also rely upon the provision of section 30(a) of the \u201cInterpretation Act,\u201d R.S.C., ch. 1, that a corporation shall be vested with power\nto acquire and hold personal property or movables for the purposes for which the corporation is constituted, and alienate the same at pleasure.\nHaving regard to the words \u201cfor the purposes for which the corporation is constituted,\u201d I incline to the view that this statutory provision was not intended to enable a body corporate to acquire its debtor\u2019s property in payment of a debt, but was rather designed to enable it to take and hold personal property for purposes similar to those for which a bank is by section 79 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d enabled to acquire real estate. At all events this provision of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d can add nothing to the powers conferred by the \u201cBank Act\u201d itself, which defines the purposes for which banks are constituted and the powers which Parliament intended they should possess and exercise.\nThe special provisions of sections 79, 81 and 82 relate, however, only to the acquisition of real or immovable property.\nThe defendants\u2019 leasehold was personalty; and as such the mortmain laws would not prevent the appellant bank acquiring it. Grant on Corporations, pages 127 et seq. and 614. All that is provided in the \u201cBank Act\u201d with regard to personal property is that the bank shall have in respect of personal or movable property mortgaged or hypothecated to it the same rights, powers and privileges which it is by the Act declared to have in respect to real or immovable property mortgaged to it (section 80(2)). Except the inhibitions against dealing in the buying or selling or bartering of goods, wares and merchandise or engaging in any trade or business and against lending upon or dealing in the shares of its own capital stock or in the capital stock of any other bank, there is no express prohibition in the \u201cBank Act\u201d against a bank acquiring personal or movable property. The express prohibition against dealing in goods, wares or merchandise, affords a cogent argument in support of the bank\u2019s right to acquire such property in a manner and under circumstances which do not constitute such a dealing, or to acquire other personal property in any manner.\nMoreover, by first taking a mortgage from its debtors and then a release of their equity of redemption, the Ontario Bank could undoubtedly have acquired their property without departing from the very letter of the provisions of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d assuming that, by virtue of section 80(2), all that is expressed and implied in sections 79, 81 and 82 applies to per- sonal or movable property as well as to real property and that the presence of these sections in the Act (apart altogether from the provisions of the mortmain statutes) by implication excludes the right of a bank to acquire real or immovable property of its debtors in satisfaction or payment of their debts. The Ontario Bank has only done directly that which it might thus have done indirectly.\nThe good faith of its advances to the defendants not having been questioned and the honesty of its avowal that in acquiring their business and leasehold premises its sole purpose was, if possible, to avoid a loss and to endeavour to realize its claim against them by selling the business as a going concern not having been challenged, I am not prepared to hold that in the mere acquisition of the defendants\u2019 lease the bank violated the letter or the spirit of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d I should have been better satisfied, however, had I found in our \u201cBank Act\u201d a provision explicitly conferring on our banks power to acquire their debtors\u2019 property in satisfaction of the banks\u2019 claims similar to that given to other banks mentioned in some of the cases to which I have alluded.\n(c) The documents in evidence and the oral testimony admissible for that purpose, make it quite clear that the intent of the officers of the bank when acquiring the defendants\u2019 business and leasehold term, was to carry on the business for a time in order to sell it with the benefit of the lease as a going concern, and that this intention was well known by the defendants. It is too well established in English jurisprudence to admit of question that illegality of purpose on the part of one party to an agreement, known at the time it was made to the other party, is a fatal bar when the latter seeks to enforce the agreement or any part of it, or any claim arising out of it. Pearce v. Brooks[29]. The test of his right to recover is whether or not, in the presentation of his case, he must rely upon the tainted agreement as the basis of his claim. If so, he cannot succeed, because\nno court ought to enforce an illegal contract or allow itself to be made the instrument of enforcing obligations alleged to arise out of a contract or transaction which is illegal, if the illegality is clearly brought to the attention of the court, and if the person invoking the aid of the court is himself implicated in the illegality. Scott v. Brown, Docring, McNab & Co.[30]\nBy section 76(2) of the present \u201cBank Act\u201d (section 64 of the Act of 1890) it is enacted that\nexcept as authorized by this Act, the bank shall not, either directly or indirectly,\u2014\n(a) deal in the buying or selling, or bartering of goods, wares and merchandise, or engage or be engaged in any trade or business whatsoever.\nIt is suggested that, as subsidiary to the realization of its claim against the McAllisters, which was incurred in due course of banking, and under the power to\nengage in and carry on such business generally as pertains to the business of banking (section 76(1) (d)),\nnotwithstanding the explicit prohibition of sub-section 2 of section 76, it was lawful for the bank to carry on for a reasonable time the milling business acquired from the defendants, in order to dispose of it to the best advantage as a going concern. Had there been no prohibition such as that in clause (a) of sub-section 2 of section 76, I should doubt the sufficiency of such general words as those of clause (d) of sub-section 1 to authorize a bank to carry on any mercantile or manufacturing business. But having regard to the very drastic and comprehensive language in which the prohibition in clause (a) of sub-section 2 is couched, it would in my opinion require terms much more pointed and specific to bring the carrying on of such a business within the words of exception by which the prohibitory clause is introduced. If a bank might carry on a mercantile business to save itself from a loss where money loaned by it is in jeopardy, the prohibition of sub-section 2(a) would be practically removed from the statute. With respect, I am unable to concur in the view that engaging in a mercantile business for a reasonable time in order to prevent or minimize a loss is something which \u201cappertains to the business of banking\u201d and is permissible as subsidiary to the legitimate purpose of realizing a valid banking claim. Apart from the objection that this suggestion involves the introduction of the unsatisfactory test of \u201ca reasonable time\u201d for the determination of the legality or the illegality of engaging in any trade or business which a bank might deem it desirable to carry on, there is the still more formidable objection that in order to hold legitimate the bank\u2019s carrying on of the business for any period, however reasonable, we must qualify the absolute prohibition of section 76, (2) (a) by the addition of a proviso excluding from its operation a case which, as the prohibitory clause reads in the statute, is clearly within it. For this I can find no justification whatever its consequences\u2014and in the present case I fully appreciated the hardship. I see no escape from the conclusion that the carrying on of the milling business of the bank was a prohibited engaging in trade or business.\nThen it is suggested that the provisions made for carrying on the business are severable from the agreement to transfer the business and the lease. It is true that the actual engagement of C.B. McAllister by the bank for this purpose is evidenced by a separate document. But the reference to this document in the instrument of transfer itself sufficiently establishes the existence of the intent of the bank\u2019s officers to carry on the business and the knowledge of it by the defendants. McAllister\u2019s evidence shews that the provision for carrying on the business was part and parcel of the arrangement for taking it over, and was an inducement held out to the bank and practically a condition on which the McAllisters\u2019 offer was accepted. But if a case of actual participation in the illegal purpose is not made out\u2014if upon the evidence this should be regarded merely as a case of illegal intent of one party known to the other, I am, with respect, unable to concur in the view that any real severability exists which would justify the court in holding that the agreement for the transfer of the lease and the consequent implied undertaking of the bank to indemnify the assignors against payment of future rent to accrue due thereunder were not affected by the taint of illegality infused into the entire arrangement by the known intent with which the bank officials entered into it. It matters not that the contemplated disregard of the prohibition of the \u201cBank Act\u201d was merely a means to a lawful end\u2014the realization of a valid claim. The legality of the end never hallows the use of illegal means to attain it.\nIf the contract were still wholly executory on the part of the bank, as parties not in pari delicto, because the prohibition of the statute is directed against the bank and it alone is penalized (section 146), the McAllisters might possibly have recovered the $10,000 paid the bank and have got their business and pro- perty back. Williams v. Hedley[31]. But the fact that the contract is in its most substantial parts an executed contract, that the contemplated illegality has been consummated and that rescission is now impossible would prevent the granting of this questionable relief if it were sought. Kearley v. Thomson[32].\nAgain, if the right to indemnity, which the defendants assert, flowed simply from the fact that the leasehold term had become vested in the bank, as it probably had, Ayers v. South Australian Banking Co.[33]; Exchange Bank of Canada v. Fletcher[34]; the defendants\u2019 claim might be entertained because they would then not require to invoke the illegal transaction to make out their case. Taylor v. Chester[35]. But it is, I fear, impossible for the defendants to escape from the position that their claim to indemnification rests entirely upon an implied term of the very contract by which the bank acquired the lease and business. As part of their case against the bank they must set up and prove that contract. As an integral part of that contract the implied stipulation for indemnification is vitiated as to the McAllisters by the illegality of the use to which the officials of the bank contemplated putting the property which formed the subject of the contract, because the McAllisters were fully cognizant of the purpose, if, indeed, they did not, as a term of the bargain, pledge their active assistance to the bank in accomplishing it.\nNeither may the court refuse to give effect to the bank\u2019s plea of illegality on the ground that public policy will be advanced by refusing to permit it to take advantage of its own misdeed. The hardship of the present case is that, having had the full benefit of the illegal contract, the bank now escapes liability and leaves the defendants to bear an incidental burden, its assumption of which was a material part of the consideration for which they transferred to it their business and paid $10,000 in addition. But this is a situation with which the court is confronted very frequently, when a plaintiff, who has wholly executed his part of an illegal contract, seeks to enforce performance by the defendant of that for which he has received full consideration. It is of greater importance to maintain intact the rule of the court that it will never lend its aid to the enforcement of an illegal contract than to endeavour to do complete justice in favour of suppliants who are themselves without fault. And the rule is the same in equity as at law.\nEquitable terms can be imposed on a plaintiff seeking to set aside an illegal contract as the price of the relief he asks; but as to any claims sought to be actively enforced on the footing of an illegal contract, the defence of illegality is as available in a court of equity as it is in a court of law. Per Giffard L.J. in Re Cork and Youghal Railway Co.[36]\nBecause they require the aid of the court to compel the complete execution of an agreement vitiated by illegality of purpose, of which they were fully cognizant, if they did not in fact agree to aid in carrying it out, the defendants cannot, in my opinion, maintain their claim against the third party, and on this ground the appeal of the latter should be allowed and the third party proceeding should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bicknell, Bain & Strathy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: O\u2019Connell & Gordon.\n[1] 17 Ont.

In expropriation proceedings, under the \"Railway Act,\" the arbitrators in making their award stated that they had not found the expert evidence a valuable factor in assisting them in their conclusions and that, after viewing the property in question, they had reached their conclusions by \"reasoning from their own judgment and a few actual facts submitted in evidence.\" On appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside the award and increasing the damages,\nHeld, that it did not appear from the language used that the arbitrators had proceeded without proper consideration of the evidence adduced or upon what was not properly evidence and, therefore, the award should not have been interfered with.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside an award of arbitrators with costs.\nIn proceedings under the \"Railway Act\" for the expropriation of lands required for the use of the railway the evidence adduced was contradictory and the arbitrators made a personal inspection of the property in question. In making their award, the majority of the arbitrators said:\n\"We regret very much that the evidence submitted consisted so largely of personal opinions of values and produced so little of authentic fact in confirmation. The expert evidence submitted varied so widely in difference of opinion as to land values that we have not found it a valuable factor in assisting our conclusions, and we have been thrown very considerably upon our own judgment in arriving at this decision.\n\"Reasoning from our own judgment and a very few actual facts submitted in evidence we are convinced that the sum of two thousand nine hundred dollars ($2,900.00) is a fair and just valuation of the land under dispute.\"\nThe third arbitrator gave his opinion as follows:\n\"In view of the testimony of three of the witnesses who swore that they were prepared to pay five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for this property I dissent from the above finding, and consider the award should be five thousand dollars for the property less three hundred dollars for the fraction remaining, making a net total of four thousand seven hundred dollars ($4,700.00).\"\nBy the judgment appealed from, the Supreme Court of Alberta took the view that the arbitrators could not substitute their personal inspection of the property for the other evidence adduced and that it appeared that the majority of them had reached their conclusions from their own opinions as to the value of the lands and not from those of the witnesses.\nHellmuth K.C. and Curie for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. and Travers Lewis K.C. for the respondent. GIROUARD J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Alberta en banc setting aside an award of arbitrators fixing the compensation to be paid to the respondent for land expropriated under the \"Railway Act.\" The reason given by the court below was that the majority of the arbitrators, who awarded a smaller amount, substituted their own opinion for the testimony of the witnesses. As usual in these cases, the evidence is contradictory. Personal opinions as to the value of the land are also given. The arbitrators decided to view the premises and judge for themselves. After having done so, they came to the conclusion\nfrom their own judgment and a few actual facts submitted in evidence,\nas they observe, that $2,900 was a fair and just valuation. One of the arbitrators dissented\nin view of the testimony of three witnesses who swore that they were prepared to pay $5,000 for the property.\nI do not think that this evidence is of much value. The Supreme Court of Alberta thinks otherwise and goes so far as to hold that the opinion of the arbitrators based upon their personal examination of the premises cannot control or override the opinions and the statements of these witnesses. I entirely disagree from this view. The arbitrators are bound to give proper weight to the evidence adduced and accept only that which seems to them to be correct; and, to help them to reach this result, they are empowered by law to view the locality. Are all the judges in appeal in as good a position as they were to consider properly all the circumstances of the case? I would long hesitate to set aside an award so rendered by arbitrators selected with the consent of the proprietor, as they were in this case, he approving in writing their appointment by the judge, especially as no irregularity, or informality, or illegality, or partiality is alleged.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The expressions in the award of the majority are certainly unfortunate.\nThey seem almost to exclude the expert evidence and then say:\nWe have been thrown very considerably upon our own judgments in arriving at this decision. Reasoning from our own judgment and a few actual facts submitted in evidence, etc.\nThe presumption must, I think, be in favour of the arbitrators having acted properly.\nThere is nothing else in this case to lead one to the conclusion they did otherwise unless it is implied from these ambiguous expressions.\nBeing ambiguous, how can I affix to them the definite meaning needed to prove their authors had proceeded upon a wrong principle?\nAfter much consideration and hesitation I rather think them capable of being construed, and to have been intended to be used, in such a way as to exclude the implication of impropriety found by the court below.\nIt is quite right for arbitrators to use their own judgment in determining the value or want of value of evidence put before them by experts or others. If it shocks their common sense or common knowledge of affairs, for possessing which they may have been chosen as arbitrators, they are not bound to accept it simply because sworn to.\nThey are often by reason of extreme conflict of evidence driven to exercise that same common sense and knowledge of affairs, in sifting and estimating, so as to get out of the conflict some sufficient grain of truth upon which to proceed properly in the business they have been chosen for.\nCan I fairly say these gentlemen meant any more ? Can I impute to them by virtue of these expressions the substitution of their own personal opinions (apart from such as derivable from the view they had) for the evidence ? I think not.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014With great respect I cannot agree with the view of the court below as to the grounds upon which the arbitrators proceeded. I think it is rather a forced construction of the language used to say that they must have discarded the evidence entirely. After examining the record carefully I am disposed to think there was some reason for regarding the specific opinions as to value put forward by the so-called expert witnesses as of very little weight. There was some evidence, not very much it is true, of sales in the neighbourhood; but sufficient, I think, taken together with the knowledge of the locality gained by the actual examination made by the arbitrators and such general evidence touching the elements of value and the circumstances affecting it as was given by the witnesses to enable them to pass upon the question before them without resorting to the opinions mentioned. It is, I think, to these specific opinions given by the expert witnesses rather than to their evidence as a whole that the arbitrators refer in the passage which appears mainly to have led the court below to the view that the arbitrators had constituted themselves valuers, and had proceeded upon their own personal views without regard to the evidence adduced.\nThe appeal should, I think, be allowed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The ground on which the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed the appeal to them from the award herein was that, the arbitrators having made an inspection of the property in question, the majority wholly discarded the evidence which they had taken and proceeded solely upon their own opinions of the value of the property based on such skill and knowledge as they had independently of the evidence adduced and upon such information as their own inspection gave them. If the award made it apparent that the majority of the arbitrators had in fact pursued this course in reaching their conclusion, I should not have been prepared to disturb a judgment setting aside their award, although it by no means follows that I would have upheld the increase in the amount of the award made by the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nBut while the award of the majority may not be happily worded and might, on cursory perusal, give the impression that, in reaching their conclusion, they had wholly disregarded the evidence, a careful consideration of the award makes it reasonably clear that what they intended to state was that the inspection of the property had satisfied them that certain parts of the evidence adduced could not be relied upon while other parts might safely be made the basis of their adjudication. A proper appreciation of the value of the evidence is always a legitimate object of a view and, if it leads to the discrediting and the consequent rejection of certain portions of the testimony, I am not prepared to say that undue weight or effect has therefore been given to the result of the view. The impeached award states that, while the majority of the arbitrators \"have not found\" the expert evidence \"a valuable factor in assisting (their) conclusions,\" they have reached those conclusions by\nreasoning from their own judgment and a few actual facts submitted in evidence.\nThis language does not, in my opinion, shew that the arbitrators gave no weight or consideration to the evidence before them. On the contrary, it rather establishes that they acted upon such of it as they deemed credible and trustworthy. I am therefore unable to agree with the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alberta that the majority of the arbitrators proceeded on a wrong principle and made an award \"on what was not properly evidence.\"\nWeighing the evidence itself and giving due effect to the fact that the arbitrators had the advantage of a view, it is, I think, impossible for an appellate court to say that the award is clearly erroneous\u2014still less that it should be increased to the amount allowed by the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nI am, therefore, with respect, of the opinion that the Alberta Court erred in interfering with the award, that the appeal from their judgment should be allowed with costs here and below and that the award should be reinstated. Appeal allowed with costs.\n"}

VII. c. 58, s. 242\u2014Construction of statute.\nInjuries suffered through the refusal by a railway company to furnish reasonable and proper facilities for receiving, forwarding and delivering freight, as required by the \"Railway Act,\" to and from a shipper's warehouse, by means of a private spur-track connecting with the railway, do not fall within the classes of injuries described as resulting from the construction or operation of the railway, in section 242 of the \"Railway Act,\" 3 Edw. VII. ch. 58, and, consequently, an action to recover damages therefor is not barred by the limitation prescribed by that section for the commencement of actions and suits for indemnity.\nJudgment appealed from (19 Man. R. 300) affirmed; Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], which affirmed the judgment of Metcalfe J., at the trial, maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported. Chrysler K.C. and George F. Macdonell for the appellants. The action is based upon section 294 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903. No action lies under that section because the proper remedy, if any, is given section 253 of that Act. Craies' Hardcastle, 212, 213. Neither does the remedy in the case arise under the latter section because the Board's order to restore the connection was a power exercised under section 214.\nThe judgment appealed from should be set aside upon the following grounds: (1) The court had no jurisdiction to entertain the action: (2) It is wrong in holding that the order of the Railway Board was a finding of fact conclusive upon the court in this action: (3) There is error in the finding that the respondents were entitled to recover damages arising prior to the 19th February, 1906, the date of the first order of the Board: (4) There is error in the finding that the respondents were entitled to recover damages for the period subsequent to the 19th February, 1906, while the appeal from said order to the Supreme Court of Canada was pending: (5) It should have been determined that the cause of action sued upon was res judicata: (6) There is error in giving effect to the order of the Board of the 19th February, 1906, because that order was superseded and abrogated by the Board, and was waived and abandoned by the respondents by the application and proceedings which were concluded by the second order, on 22nd September, 1906: (7) The action should have been dismissed upon the ground that the claim of the respondents was barred by the limitation prescribed by section 242 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903.\nThe following authorities are referred to as to the enforcing of section 253 in respect to affording reasonable facilities: South Eastern Railway Co. v. The Railway Commissioners[2]; Darlaston Local Board v. London and North Western Railway Co.[3]; Cowan & Sons v. North British Railway Co.[4]; Macnamara on Carriers, 346; Lancashire Brick and Terra Cotta Co. v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[5]; Perth General Station Committee v. Ross[6]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[7]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Perrault[8].\nThe claim is barred by limitation of time: See R.S.C., ch. 37, secs. 284, 306, 427; 2 Can. Ry. Cas. 383-389; McArthur v. Northern and Pacific Junction Railway Co.[9].\nConstruction and operation include all actions upon the statute for breach of any duty in regard to either construction or operation. Rights arising under contract are excluded. Levesque v. New Brunswick Railway Co.[10]; McCallum v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[11]; MacMurchy & Denison, Railway Act, p. 480; see also cases collected in, Zimmer v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[12]; Ryckman v. Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Electric Railway Co.[13].\nNesbitt K.C. and Hudson for the respondents. The grounds upon which the plaintiffs rely generally are: (a) That an action lies for breach of a statutory duty and this right is not limited by the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" giving the Board of Railway Commissioners jurisdiction to make orders for the performance of specific acts; (6) That the finding of the Board that there was a breach of this statutory duty, is conclusive; (c) That the plaintiffs suffered damage; (d) That their claim was not barred by section 242 of the \"Railway Act,\" 1903; (e) That the plaintiffs' claim for damages had not been dealt with by the Board of Railway Commissioners nor by the arbitrators.\nAn action lies for the breach of a statutory duty. Groves v. Wimborne[14]; Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company v. Gidlow[15]; Davis & Sons v. Taff Vale Railway Co.[16]; Crouch v. Great Northern Railway Co.[17].\nThe plaintiffs rely on sections 253 and 294 of the \"Railway Act,\" 1903. The Board had no power to award damages, therefore the court can entertain the action. Duthie v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[18]. If the Board could not entertain claims for damages for a breach of section 214 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, it is evident that its powers are no greater in respect of section 253. The Board is a tribunal possessing only the powers conferred upon it by statute. It was not created to supplant or even to supplement the provincial courts in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, but to exercise an entirely different jurisdiction.\nThe cases relied on by the respondents are: Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Perrault[19]; Perth General Station Committee v. Ross[20]; Balfour v. Malcolm[21], per Lord Campbell, at page 500. The jurisdiction of the court to award damages in the present case is not ousted.\nThe Board has found that there was a breach of the statutory duty, it had jurisdiction to do so, and that finding is conclusive. Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[22]. Apart from the provision of section 42(3) of the \"Railway Act,\" 1903, the decision of the Board is that of a court of record (section 8, \"Railway Act,\" 1903), and, on a matter once litigated between the same parties, it is conclusive. Shoe Machinery Co. v. Cutlan[23]; Lea v. Thursby[24].\nThe plaintiffs suffered damage by reason of the defendants' refusal to supply reasonable facilities. This finding of Mr. Justice Metcalfe has not been questioned by the defendant.\nThe plaintiffs' action is not barred by section 242 of the statute. The provision of that section being a special limitation should be construed strictly. Abbott's Railway Law, 269; Maxwell on Statutes, 429; Anderson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[25]. The breach of statutory duty of which the plaintiffs here complain would not appear to be within the above section if the words therein are given their ordinary and proper meaning. The injury was not caused by construction nor by operation of the railway.\nUnder the old railway Acts where the words of the corresponding section were \"by reason of the railway,\" it was held in a number of cases that the provisions referred only to acts of commission and not to omissions. Reist v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[26], per Robinson C.J.; North Shore Railway Co. v. McWillie[27], at page 514; Findlay v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[28], where all the authorities are collected.\nIn dealing generally with actions (sec. 294, \"Rail-way Act,\" 1903; sec. 427, Act of 1906) Parliament has been careful to provide for acts of omission as well as of commission. When the \"Railway Act\" was recast in 1903, it was divided into headings. The sections in Part VII. were put under the heading of \"Construction of Railway,\" and of Part IX. under the heading of \"Operation of Railway.\" Section 242 is placed at the end of the latter group. Section 253, which gives the plaintiffs their right of action, is grouped under a subsequent heading, namely, Part XI., \"Tolls.\" The words \"construction\" and \"operation\" used in section 242, would seem to be properly applied only to rights of action arising in matters dealt with under these headings. The court should regard these headings as furnishing a key to the clauses ranged under them: Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand[29]; City of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Co.[30].\nThe plaintiffs' claim for damages has not been dealt with before.\nWe also rely on: City of Dublin Steam Packet Co. v. Midland Great Western of Ireland Railway Co.[31]; Pickering, Phipps et al. v. London and North Western Railway Co.[32]; Charrington, Sells, Dale & Co. v. c Midland Railway Co.[33].\nChrysler K.C. and George F. Macdonell for the appellants.\nNesbitt K.C. and Hudson for the respondents.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014The Railway Board has found in this case and this court has declared on a previous occasion[34], that the respondents have been deprived of reasonable railway facilities and ordered the same to be restored.\nIn a case like this the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, section 242, gives an action against the railway company to the proprietor who has been injured by its action. This action is entirely based upon this statute and I cannot conceive that it has any existence outside of its provisions. I quite agree with Mr. Justice Davies that it is outlawed or prescribed by the limitation of one year of that section.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014After a great deal of consideration I have reached the conclusion that the contention of the appellants with respect to the effect of the 242nd section of the \"Railway Act,\" 1903, prescribing a limitation for the bringing of actions for damages must be given effect to in this action.\nThe appellant company and its predecessors in title of the railway operated the same so far as the plaintiffs in this case were concerned by supplying them with spur-track facilities for the carriage to and from their premises adjoining the railway line of goods consigned to them and from them to others. In the autumn of the year 1904, after giving them notice of its intention to withdraw these spur-track facilities, the company tore up the spur-line and thus effectually discontinued the facilities.\nIn September, 1905, the respondents applied to the Railway Board for an order directing the appellant company \"to replace the siding wrongfully taken up from petitioners' property,\" and in February, 1906, the Board made an order\nthat the railway company be, and it is hereby directed to restore the spur-track facilities formerly enjoyed by the applicants for the carriage, despatch and receipt of freight in car-loads over, to and from the line of the said railway company, and the connection between such spur-track and the railway siding on the land of the applicants.\nThe company appealed to this court, which held that the Railway Board had, in the circumstances, jurisdiction to make the order of 1906.\nIn the meantime, pending the appeal, Parliament had amended the 253rd section of the \"Railway Act,\" providing that the reasonable facilities which every railway company was required to afford under that section should include reasonable facilities for receiving, forwarding and delivering traffic upon and from those sidings or private branch railways, etc.\nThis amending statute came into force on 13th July, 1906, and, immediately thereafter, without waiting for the decision of this court on the appeal from the jurisdiction of the Railway Board to make the order of 1906, the respondents made a new application to the Railway Board, dated 28th July, 1906, for a restoration of their former siding track facilities. The appellants had already made an application to the Board for leave to expropriate the lands of the respondents, and the two applications were heard by the Board simultaneously on the 22nd September, 1906, and an order granted allowing the railway company to expropriate respondents' lands, but making it a condition of such allowance or authority that it should, before a date in October, connect its tracks with a siding then existing on respondents' lands, and until possession should be acquired by them of respondents' lands\nshould operate such siding and furnish such facilities in connection therewith as are usual in the case of a private siding connection with a railway.\nThe railway company, on the 29th day of September, 1906, that is within one week from the making of the order, constructed the siding ordered and made the connection constructed on the private siding upon respondents' lands; and the lands of respondents were expropriated by the railway company pursuant to the leave granted.\nThe present action was brought on the 27th October, 1908, to recover damages by reason of respondents being deprived of reasonable and proper facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivery of traffic between the month of November, 1904, when the sidings were removed, and the 29th September, 1906, when they were restored pursuant to the order of the 22nd September, 1906.\nMany important questions were raised and argued as to the right of the plaintiffs (respondents) to recover those damages, but in view of the construction I place upon the limitation clause of the \"Railway Act,\" 1903, section 242, it is unnecessary for me to refer to any other of them than the effect of this section.\nIt reads as follows: Actions for Damages.\nAll actions or suits for indemnity for any damages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be commenced within one year next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, or if there is continuation of damage within one year next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards; and the defendants may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act. 51 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 287.\nNothing in this section shall apply to any action brought against the company upon any breach of contract, express or implied, in the carriage of any traffic nor to any action against the company for damages under any section of Part XI. of this Act, respecting tolls.\nThe acts complained of, the removal in 1904 of the siding track facilities and the continued operation of the railway without those siding facilities until September, 1906, when they were restored by order of the Board, are the wrongful acts of which the plaintiffs (respondents) complain.\nThey are acts which, in my opinion, are covered by the language of the section above quoted. They are \"damages sustained by reason of the operation of the railway.\" I construe the words to mean and include not only the actual physical operation of the railway causing injury or damage, but the manner of operation, wrongful, illegal or improper. There can perhaps be no better example of my meaning than the concrete case we have before us.\nThe railway was operated at the point in question in connection with a private siding on plaintiffs' lands over which their goods were carried to and from their warehouse. The appellant company removed that siding and for nearly two years refused to restore it. They operated the road during those two years without giving the plaintiffs that which they had a right to have, namely, the track-siding facilities. The plaintiffs applied to the Railway Board to have the siding facilities restored which, as they allege, had been \"wrongfully taken away.\" The Railway Board having, as was maintained by this court, jurisdiction in the matter held that such sidings and connections\nand the privilege of loading cars and delivering goods for carriage on such sidings, and of receiving and unloading goods by means thereof, were facilities within the Act,\nand, after reciting the circumstances connected with their removal, held that\nunder all these circumstances the discontinuance of the former service seems to the Board to have been unreasonable.\nThey accordingly ordered their restoration.\n\"The discontinuance of the former service\" was, to my mind, a change or alteration in the manner of operating their road by the company, and was held by the Board to have been \"unreasonable.\" It was, as contended by the plaintiffs, a wrongful and unjustifiable change and one for which they now seek to recover damages. Damages caused by this wrongful removal of, and this wrongful refusal to restore, these siding facilities, appear to me to be clearly within the words of the section \"damages sustained by reason of the operation of the road.\" The road was operated for years with these facilities. They were, as was held, wrongfully withdrawn, and the road continued to be operated for nearly two years without them. The plaintiffs (respondents) claim damages sustained by them by reason of these wrongful acts, the removal of the facilities and the operation of the road without them.\nI agree that to deprive the plaintiffs of their right of action the words of the limitation clause should be so plain and unambiguous as clearly to embrace the cause of action sought to be included within them. The several cases called to our attention and which I have examined do not put the argument higher than that. They are not of much assistance further than as laying down the general rule of construction which ought to be applied to such sections.\nEvery case must necessarily depend upon the precise language of the statute being construed. We have no right either to limit or extend the fair, clear and reasonable meaning of the language used by any rule of construction. After all what we must do in each case is to determine what the fair, clear and reasonable meaning of the words used really is, and if we find it includes the action before us we cannot allow any supposed rule of construction to defeat the obvious and clear meaning of the language Parliament has used. In endeavouring to ascertain the scope and meaning of this 242nd section, we must not lose sight of sub-section 2, which excludes from the operation of the section\nactions brought against the company upon any breach of contract, express or implied, in the carriage of any traffic, and actions against the company for damages under any section of Part XL of this Act relating to tolls.\nIt is not contended, of course, that this action falls within any of these excepted causes of action, but they afford a very good key or guide to the construction of the main section. The contention is that the words of the main section do not cover the action or conduct of the railway company in cutting off the plaintiffs' siding-track facilities, which for years they had enjoyed as part of the operation of the appellant company's railway, and in continuing to operate their road for nearly two years while withholding such facilities from the plaintiffs and thereby causing them damage. The mere withholding of their facilities unless they formed a part of the operation of the road, would not have caused any damage to plaintiffs, That damage was caused because the facilities withdrawn did form part of the general operation of the road.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that these sidetrack facilities did form part of the operation of the railway within the meaning of those words in the section above quoted, and that the action is barred by this statute, not having been begun within one year next after the doing or committing of the damage ceased when the siding facilities were restored.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the action.\nIdington J.\u2014The facts not expressly proven but necessary to establish the respondents' right of action were all relevant to the question of jurisdiction of, and necessary to have been found as a fact by, the Board of Railway Commissioners in order to establish that jurisdiction, which we held they had to make the order relied upon by the respondents.\nIt seems to follow as a necessary implication beyond doubt that the facts in question have been so found within section 42 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 as between the parties hereto and hence, for the purposes of this case, conclusively established.\nAs to the time limit in the Act relied upon to bar this action I do not think it falls in any way one may look at it within the class of cases for which the limitation is provided.\nThe scope and purpose of the provision seem to forbid and the language does not cover it.\nA long line of authorities upon many statutes establish the substantial distinction between acts of commission and omission when similar language has been used.\nA suggestion put forward, by way of drawing from the exception in sub-section 2, of section 242, an argument to support the alleged bar, seems to me entirely out of harmony with the generally received idea that a statute of limitations must be clear and express, and its operation not dependent on nor to be built upon fine-spun theory or speculation.\nBesides, to give full effect to the suggestion would render much of the section as a whole ridiculous when applied to other things its language covers.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The effect of the finding of the Board of Railway Commissioners in The Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson & Son,[35], was that the removal of the spur-track in 1904 constituted a denial to the plaintiffs of their rights under section 253 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903. I think, moreover, that section 427 confers a right of action for such a breach of duty on the part of the railway company.\nThe question remaining is whether section 306 of chapter 37 R.S.C. [1906] applies.\nThat section, in its present form, appeared first in the Act of 1903. The pre-existing section which this provision replaced had been the subject of much judicial discussion and of much difference of opinion. The legislature doubtless hoped by the change effected in 1903 to remove some at least of the prevailing uncertainty respecting the state of the law; but I think it a very profitless speculation to inquire into the existing state of the decisions with a view to getting light upon the meaning and effect attributed by the legislature to the language introduced in that year. We must, I think, take the section as it stands and construe its words in the light of other relevant provisions of the statute.\nThe view put forward by the appellants is that the section applies to any action based upon an alleged violation of any duty by the railway company in course of or in relation to the construction or operation of its works\u2014saving, of course, the exceptions specified in the section itself. The difficulty about this construction is that there appears to be no explanation why if the legislature had meant to pass an enactment having that effect it did not use plain words to express its meaning. The words actually used suggest, I think, that the legislature was trying to express something short of this. The section provides that an essential element in the causes of action to which it applies is that the damage sued for has arisen by reason of the construction or operation of the railway. The fault of the company may be a positive act or omission but unless the action is brought in respect of damage arising by reason of such construction or operation it is outside the scope of the section.\nThe damages claimed here are made up of the expenses incurred and loss of business occasioned through the absence of specific facilities for shipment. I do not think it can be affirmed that in respect of these things the respondents would have been any better off if the railway had never been constructed or had never been in operation; and, that being so, it seems to follow that the damage in question does not strictly fall within the description\ndamages or injury caused by reason of the operation or construction of the railway.\nIf it be said that this interpretation adheres too literally to the grammatical sense of the words used, the answer is that there appears to be no middle ground between a strict literal construction of the section and that put forward by the appellants as indicated above. To adopt the last mentioned construction would appear to be very much like rejecting words which the legislature seems to have deliberately chosen to express its meaning and substituting therefor others which it appears to have deliberately discarded.\nAnglin J.\u2014Three questions are raised by the appellants: the first, whether in adjudicating upon the right of the plaintiffs to the restoration of a spur-line or siding, which the defendants had removed, the Board of Railway Commissioners determined, as a question of fact, under sub-section 2 of section 253 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, that the railway company had not complied with the provisions of sub-section 1 of section 253 requiring them to\nafford all reasonable and proper facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of traffic upon and from their railway;\nthe second, whether, if the Board in fact so determined, its finding was binding upon the Court of King's Bench of Manitoba under section 42 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, and, upon proof or admission thereof, entitled the plaintiffs to a judgment for such damages as they suffered by reason of the failure of the company to fulfil this statutory duty in regard to them; and the third, whether the plaintiffs' action for such damages is or is not within section 242 of the same statute.\nA perusal of the order of the Railway Board, which bears date the 19th February, 1906, with the reasons given for making it, which accompany it as part of the record in the present case, makes it clear that the Board found that the railway company had deprived the respondents of reasonable facilities; that the siding or spur, as a means of shipping and unloading goods, should be regarded as \"facilities\" within the meaning of the \"Railway Act\" ; and that such facilities were reasonable and proper and such as the company should afford. The discontinuance of the facilities was further found to have been unreasonable; and on these grounds the company was ordered to restore spur-track facilities to the applicants.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board to make this order having been questioned, it was affirmed by this court[36]. I have no doubt, having regard to the fact that the statute, 6 Edw. VII. ch. 42, section 23, which did not become law until the 13th July, 1906, that the Board intended to determine, and did in fact determine that the railway company had failed to comply with the provisions of sub-section 1, of section 253, and that its refusal of the applicants' request for the restoration of the spur-line had been wrongful. Unless such a finding of the Railway Board is conclusive in a subsequent action brought to recover damages sustained by reason of the very fact so found, I am unable to appreciate the meaning or effect of the provisions of section 42 (now section 54 of R.S.C. ch. 37). Section 253(2) (now section 318 of R.S.C. ch. 37) expressly provides that the Board may determine as a question of fact whether the company has or has not afforded reasonable and proper facilities; and section 42 declares that the\nfinding or determination of the Board upon any question of fact within its jurisdiction shall be binding and conclusive upon all courts.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board to make the order which it pronounced having been affirmed by this court, the findings of fact upon which the Board based its adjudication must be held to have been made within its jurisdiction and they were properly accepted in the provincial courts as conclusive.\nThere remains the question of the applicability of the limitation provision contained in section 242 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 upon which counsel for the appellants relied in argument. This action for damages was not brought until the 27th of October, 1908. At that time the revised statute of 1906, ch. 37, which had replaced the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, was in force and, as a provision relating to remedies and procedure, section 306 of the later Act, which corresponds substantially with section 242 of the Act of 1903, would, if otherwise applicable, govern this action, notwithstanding the fact that the major part of the damages sued for was sustained before the date when it became law.\nThe spur-track facilities were restored to the plaintiffs on the 29th September, 1906, and service was thereafter supplied to them. The order of the Board for the restoration of the spur had been made on the 19th February, 1906, and its jurisdiction was affirmed by this court[37] on the 10th of October, 1906. Whether the plaintiffs' cause of action was complete and the statutory limitation, if applicable, commenced to run from the date when the damage sustained by the plaintiffs ceased (the 29th September, 1906), or, as argued by counsel for the respondents, a conclusive finding by the Railway Board of the fact that there had been a violation of the statute should be deemed a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' right to sue and their cause of action should therefore be deemed not to have been complete until the final adjudication in this court on the 10th of October, 1906 \u2014 considerably more than a year had elapsed from either date before this action was begun. Therefore, if section 306 of the revised statute applies, it affords a defence to the plaintiffs' claim.\nSo far as material it reads as follows:\n306. All actions or suits for indemnity for any damages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be commenced within one year next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, or, if there is continuation of damage, within one year next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards.\n2. In any such action or suit the defendants may plead the general issue, and may give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at the trial, and may prove that the said damages or injury alleged were done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act.\n3. Nothing in this section shall apply to any action brought against the company upon any breach of contract, express or implied, for or relating to the carriage of any traffic, or to any action against the company for damages under the following provisions of this Act, respecting tolls.\nDuring the argument I was somewhat impressed by the contention that the exceptions in sub-section 2, of section 242, of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 (now sub-section 3, of section 306 ) \u2014 particularly that in regard to actions\nfor damages under any section of Part XI. of this Act respecting tolls\n\u2014 indicate that sub-section 1 should receive a construction which would make it applicable to this case. But a closer study of the excepting sub-section has satisfied me that it does not support this view. The exception in regard to actions founded on contract is merely declaratory of the construction put upon a corresponding provision of the earlier railway Acts in a long series of decisions. There may have been some fear that any actionable injury or damages occasioned by breach of any duty imposed by the sections respecting tolls might possibly be deemed to have been sustained by reason of the operation of the railway notwithstanding that those sections are not found under the heading \"operation.\" It may, for this reason, have been thought advisable to make an express exception, so that there could be no room to question the intention of Parliament to exclude from subsection 1 claims arising from breaches of the sections respecting tolls. The presence of these exceptions, therefore, does not, in my opinion, suffice to justify giving to the language of sub-section 1 a wider effect than its literal meaning imports.\nIn answer to the plea of the statute counsel for the respondents urged\u2014\n(1) That because their claim for damages arose under section 253, which was contained in Part XI. of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, this case falls within the latter exception in sub-section 2, of section 242;\n(2) That by reason of the words, \"after the doing or committing of such damages ceases,\" and of the words,\nmay prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act,\nfailure to perform a duty imposed by the statute, being a mere act of omission, should be held to be not within the section;\n(3) That damage or injury sustained through failure to provide spur-line facilities is not\ndamage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway.\n(1) The first answer made depends upon whether the adjectival phrase \"respecting tolls'' in sub-section 2, of section 242, should be regarded as qualifying the words \"Part XI\" (Part XI is headed \"Tolls\") or the word \"section.\" If it was intended to include all the provisions of Part XI within the exception, the words \"respecting tolls\" were clearly superfluous. Upon an examination of Part XI it will be found that it contained provisions respecting other matters, for instance, those in section 253 regarding facilities and those in section 272 regarding continuous carriage. Upon a proper reading of sub-section 2, of section 242, of the \"Railway Act'7 of 1903, the phrase \"respecting tolls\" must, I think, be taken as qualifying the word \"section,\" and it was actions for damages under those sections of Part XI which respect tolls that were excepted from the limitation imposed by sub-section 1. The substitution in the present Act of the words \"for damages under the following provisions of this Act, respecting tolls\" \u2014 for the words \"for damages under any section of Part XI of this Act, respecting tolls\" makes it quite clear that it is only actions for breaches of sections relating to tolls that are excepted from the operation of sub-section 1 of section 306.\n(2) Although there is authority for the view that, owing to the presence of the words \"doing or committing\" in sub-section 1 and \"was done\" in sub-section 2, of section 306, the limitation should be confined to acts of commission as distinguished from acts of omission \u2014 notably the opinions of Moss C.J.A., and that of Burton J.A., in Kelly v. Ottawa Street Railway Co.[38], particularly at the foot of page 619, and the judgments of Robinson C.J., in Reist v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[39], and of Richardson J. in Findlay v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[40]; there are other cases such as Brown v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[41], which seem opposed to this view. Such English cases as Wilson v. Mayor and Corporation of Halifax[42], and Poulsum v. Thirst[43], appear to establish that the better opinion is that, notwithstanding the presence of such words as \"committed\" or \"done,\" and the absence of any words equivalent to \"not done,\" or \"omitted to be done\" acts of omission in breach of statutory duty might be within the protection of section 306. See also Jolliffe v. Wallasey Local Board[44]; Holland v. Northwich Highway Board[45]. I am, therefore, unable to accede to the view that merely because it contains the words to which I have alluded, without the addition of such words as \"not done\" or \"omitted to be done,\" the application of section 306 should be confined to cases of commission as distinguished from cases of omission. (3) But have the plaintiffs sustained damages or injury \"by reason of the construction or operation of the railway?\" I have given to these words much thought and study. Read literally and according to their ordinary use they do not cover the plaintiffs' cause of action. If it had been found that they were entitled to the facilities in question because similar facilities had been accorded by the defendants to rival traders and that the latter had thereby obtained an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage over the plaintiffs (section 253) a stronger case would be made for holding that damages or injury thus sustained by the plaintiffs were caused by the operation of the railway. But that is not the case presented. Upon the order and findings of the Railway Board the case before the court is purely one of refusal or neglect of the defendants to provide for the plaintiffs facilities found to be reasonable. To say that injury thus occasioned \"is caused by reason of the construction or operation of the railway\" would be to construe these words as including every case of omission to fulfil a duty, the performance of which would constitute part of the construction or operation of the railway. I incline to the opinion that to so read sub-section 1, of section 306, involves an unwarranted extension of a limitation provision.\nMoreover, the \"Railway Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 37) contains one fasciculus \u2014 sections 150-259 inclusive \u2014 of which the heading is \"construction,\" and another set of sections\u2014264 to 305 inclusive\u2014under the heading \"operation.\" Section 306 immediately follows the latter group. This arrangement of the statute is entitled to some weight in determining the purview of sub-section 1, of section 306. The authorities upon this point are collected in Craies' Hardcastle, pages 189 et seq. See also City of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Co.[46], at page 324. In the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 the relative positions of the sections corresponding with these provisions and of section 253 (now section 317) was the same. This classification affords another argument of some cogency in support of the view that actions for damages sustained through breaches of section 317 (formerly section 253) are not governed by section 306.\nThe exception of actions \"for damages under the following provisions of this Act respecting tolls\" casts some doubt on the. soundness of this argument. But when we recall that such exceptions find their way into statutes often quite unnecessarily and because of sheer excess of caution, it seems obvious that too much weight may easily be given to their presence in determining the proper construction of the principal member of a section.\nParliament could so easily have expressly declared the limitation of section 306 applicable to all actions for injury or damages sustained by reason of a breach of any duty imposed by the statute, if that were its intention, that the deliberate restriction of its application to matters of \"construction or operation\" seems to afford a strong indication that the purpose was to con fine it to matters which in the same statute are classified as matters of \"construction\" and of \"operation.\" The contrast between the terms of section 306 and those of section 427 (formerly section 294), which declares, if it does not confer, the right of action, confirms this view of the proper construction of the earlier section. For the foregoing reasons I conclude that section 306 does not apply to this action.\nI have reached this conclusion with some doubt, due to respect for the opinions of some of my learned brothers to the contrary and founded also upon the series of English decisions above referred to\u2014especially upon Holland v. Northwich Highway Board[47], in which an omission to discharge a statutory duty was held to be within the protection of a limitation section restricting the right of recovery in proceedings for \"anything done in pursuance of or under the authority of the Act. But\nthe court before holding a claim to be barred by lapse of time must see clearly that the statute applies.\nLightwood's Time Limit on Actions, 1909, page 3. Doubts, however serious, do not justify a reversal.\nI reserve for further consideration the applicability of section 306 to actions to recover damages for breaches of the provision introduced by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 42, sec. 23, as an amendment to section 253 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 which has been transferred in revision and is now found as sub-section 2, of section 284 (formerly section 214) within the fasciculus headed \"operation.\" This provision does not apply to the present case.\nWith some hesitation, I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clark & Sweatman.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hudson, Howell, Ormond & Marlatt.\n[1] 19 Man.

(1906) c. 37, ss. 47, 155, 159, 235, 237.\nHaving obtained the consent of the municipality to use certain public streets for that purpose, the G. T. P. Ry. Co. applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for leave to construct and approval of the location of the line of their railway upon and along the highways in question. None of the lands abutting on these highways were to be appropriated for the purposes of the railway, nor were the rights or facilities of access thereto to be interfered with except in so far as might result from inconvenience caused by the construction and operation of the railway upon and along the streets. In granting the application the Board made the order complained of subject to the condition that the company should \"make full compensation to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the location of the said railway along any street.\" On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Held, Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting, that, under the provisions of section 47 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. (1906) ch. 37, the Board had, on such application, the power to impose the condition directing that compensation should be made by the company in respect of the damages which might be suffered by the proprietors of the lands abutting on the highways of the municipality upon and along which the line of railway so located was to be constructed.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada granting leave to the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. to locate the line of their railway upon and along certain streets in the City of Fort William, in Ontario, subject to conditions imposed by the Board in respect of the payment of damages to the owners of lands abutting on the said streets.\nLeave to appeal from the order in question was granted by order of the Chief Commissioner upon all questions of law arising thereunder.\nThe order appealed from, dated 6th October, 1909; , was as follows :\n\"In the matter of the application of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter called the 'applicant company' under section 159 of the 'Railway Act,' for approval of the location of its line of railway through the Town of Fort William, in the Province of Ontario, as shown on the plan, profile and book of reference on file with the Board under file No. 1519.\n\"Upon the hearing of counsel for the applicant company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company; and upon the consent of the City of Fort William by agreement dated the 29th March, 1905, and of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by agreement dated December 1st, 1908, copies of which are on file with the Board; and upon the report of the chief engineer of the Board: \u2014\n\"It is ordered that, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the said agreements, and subject to the condition that the applicant company shall do as little damage as possible, and make full compensation to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the location of the said railway along any street in the said City of Fort William, as provided in the said agreement of 29th March, 1905, the location of the applicant company's line of railway through the City of Fort William, as shown upon the plan filed with the Board on the 4th day of June, 1906, be and the same is hereby approved.\n\"Provided that this order shall not prejudice the rights if any, for the reimbursement of the amount of the said damages, if any, which the applicant company may have against the City of Fort William under the said agreement of 29th March, 1905, nor shall it prejudice the right, if any, which the Canadian Pacific Railway Company may have under the said agreement between that company and the applicant company, to be relieved of the payment of any portion of the compensation required to be paid persons interested for damages sustained by reason of the location of the said railway along the said streets, in the City of Fort William as hereinbefore provided.\n\"And it is further ordered that the orders of the Board Nos. 7620 and 8231, dated respectively July 15th and October 6th, 1909, be and the same are hereby rescinded.\n\"J. P. Mabee, Chief Commissioner,\n\"Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\" Part of the location sanctioned is along certain streets in Fort William where the city gave the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company authority to construct its line at grade. The appellants seek to be relieved from this condition on two grounds: first, that the Board, in directing the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company to make compensation to the abutting landowners, exceeded their jurisdiction and invaded the province of Parliament by attempting to extend the liability of the railway company beyond what is contemplated by section 155 of the \"Railway Act\"; and secondly, that the said condition is contrary to law as where a company is constructing a railway along a street at grade the abutting property-owners are not entitled to compensation.\nThe questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nD'Arcy Tate and W. L. Scott for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent, the City of Fort William.\nSinclair K.C. for certain landowners, in Fort William, respondents.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the Fort William Land Investment Company, respondents.\nGirouard J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs. Section 47 of the \"Railway Act\" empowers the Railway Board to authorize the construction of a railway on a public street upon such terms as may be determined. The condition of compensation to the riparian proprietors comes under this section and I am not prepared to limit the scope of its provisions beyond its plain terms and meaning. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014I find it extremely difficult to determine the meaning of the order here in question.\nIt professes to approve of the location of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company's line through the Town of Fort William in accordance with the plan filed\nsubject to a condition that the applicant company shall do as little damage as possible, and make full compensation to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the location of the said railway along any street in the said city.\nIf this means that while approving of the location of the line as submitted to them for approval, they are making such approval subject to an imposition upon the company of greater obligations as to making compensation than those which are imposed by the \"Railway Act,\" then, I think, the order to that extent is erroneous and beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.\nI have said that I am unable to determine what the language of the order means. But the case was argued before us on the assumption that it did mean to impose such additional obligations, and I incline to think that may be its meaning as I understand that was its purpose. The difficulty of determining just what the condition means may make its enforcement, even if held intra vires, to be very great and the extent of the obligation it seeks to impose on the company is something which no one could now estimate. With that, however, we have nothing to do now.\nAccepting the construction placed upon the order I think the condition referred to is ultra vires.\nThe statute has expressed in the 155th section the extent of the company's obligations with regard to compensation payable by them by reason of the exercise of their powers.\nI think the attempt to add to those obligations others which Parliament did not impose, but on the contrary excluded, is an attempt to legislate on the part of the Board and beyond its powers.\nI cannot think that Parliament, in vesting in the Board the great and extensive powers it did, intended to vest in them powers without any limitation.\nMy construction of the sections now before us is that the conditions which the Board may legally make their order subject to must be such conditions as are not inconsistent with the provisions of the statute. This order purports to be made under section 159, which requires the plan, profile and book of reference of the railway generally to be submitted to the Board which, if satisfactory, \"may sanction the same.\" But the same section places specific limitations upon the Board's powers in giving such sanction, and in addition expressly declares that such sanction shall not \"relieve the company from otherwise complying with the Act.\" It would seem to me a reasonable interpretation of the section and one logically following from such declaration that the Board cannot in giving its sanction attach any condition\nrelieving the company from otherwise complying with the Act;\nthat it cannot attach a condition imposing an obligation on the company inconsistent with the Act. In other words the Board cannot legislate so as to amend or change the Act itself while it may attach conditions to its sanction of the location not inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Act.\nMuch reliance is naturally placed upon section 47 of the Act which it is contended confers absolutely arbitrary and uncontrolled powers upon the Board.\nMy construction of that section is that when it is invoked it must be read in conjunction with the special section or sections of the Act under which the Board for the time being is asked to make or on its own initiation makes an order.\nThe order now before us is one in point. It professes to be made on an application of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, under section 159 of the \"Railway Act\" (to which I have already referred)\nfor approval of the location of its line of railway through the Town of Fort William, as shewn on the plan, profile and book of reference on file.\nBut clearly in construing the order and determining the bounds, if any, of the Board's jurisdiction in making it, reference must be had to section 237 which deals with the specific subject-matter of\ngranting leave to construct the railway upon, along or across an existing highway\nas well as to section 155, which deals with the compensation payable by the company in the exercise of its powers under the Act.\nConstruing the three sections together so far as this or analogous applications to the Board are concerned I would read section 47 as being controlled and limited by sections 155 and 237, so far as orders sanctioning the location and construction of railways upon, along or across existing highways are concerned.\nThe former section, 155, defines and limits the obligations of the company with respect to the compensation payable by them in the exercise of the powers granted to them\nto all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers. It would on the one hand clearly, to my mind, be ultra vires for the Board in any way or by any condition of the order it might make to limit the extent of the company's obligations under this section, or to attempt to defeat the right of any one entitled under the Act to such compensation. It would, in my judgment, be equally ultra vires for the Board in its order by any condition to extend or add to the statutory obligations of the company respecting compensation.\nThe case before us was argued on the assumption that the condition to which the order was made expressly subject, imposed upon the company accepting it an obligation to pay to the property owners fronting on Empire Avenue and Hardisty Street, along which the railway was located, compensation for all damage by them sustained by reason of the location of the railway along such streets. It was hardly questioned at the argument and could not, I think, be successfully questioned that such property owners not having had, as admitted, any of their lands taken or their rights of access interfered with, or sustained any structural damages are not under the statute, as construed by the authorities, entitled to recover any damages. The condition of the order of the Board, if it means anything at all, means to impose an obligation upon the company greater and larger than that imposed by the statute. In my opinion that cannot be done under the guise of a condition because the conditions the Board are authorized to make in granting their order must not be inconsistent with the Act, and this condition unless treated as surplusage must be held to be so.\nThen, as to section 237, it seems to me that the general character and nature of the conditions which the Board may lawfully impose as a part of its order sanctioning the construction of a railway \"upon, along or across a highway\" are limited to those which relate to the \"protection, safety and convenience of the public.\" The section expressly so declares. It says:\nThe Board may by order grant such application upon such terms or conditions as to protection, safety and convenience of the public as it may deem expedient.\nAs to the kind and character of such terms, they are entirely for the Board. Whether any additional condition not inconsistent with the other provisions of the Act might be imposed I need not stop to inquire. What, in my opinion, is ultra vires in this case is the imposition of an obligation upon the company inconsistent with section 155 of the Act. This construction of the Act makes any reference to the fact. that the applicants had the authority of a by-law of the municipality duly ratified by its ratepayers and confirmed by the legislature of the province for the location of its line along those streets unnecessary.\nThe Board in approving of the location acted within its powers, and to that extent of course its order is good. In making its order subject to a condition inconsistent with the statute it acted ultra vires, and such condition is bad and void.\nI would therefore allow the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada ap proving of the location of the appellants' line of railway along streets in Fort William on the conditions specified in the order. One of these conditions is that compensation be made to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the said location along any street in said town.\nIt is against this condition the appeal is made. We are asked to declare it ultra vires the Board and that the order thus deleted of this condition be maintained.\nListening to the argument for appellants and hearing it urged that this condition is \"in violation of the Act\" and \"in violation of the judicial construction of the Act\" and \"a contravention of the provisions of the Act in respect of compensation,\" one wonders when the Act was so amended as to prohibit or by what organic law anything had been enacted prohibiting owners of lands and houses fronting on a street from being legally compensated for such injuries.\nThese notions of the Act and this appeal it turns out spring from a strange misconception of the true import of the decisions in such cases as Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand[1], and in Re Devlin and The Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway Co.[2], and the principles of law upon which they properly proceeded.\nWhen a person or corporation is given by Act of Parliament the power to take possession of another's land or invade his rights therein or depreciate its value by the execution of some work thereby authorized to be done he has no legal right to damages or compensation for anything arising from the due execution of such work and the due carrying on of the business so authorized unless Parliament has seen fit to provide for his being compensated.\nThat is all these cases mean. The owners may have suffered, but Parliament had given no remedy therefor. The appellants have not yet acquired any such right over the streets in question and hence the cases have no application.\nParliament has delegated its authority in that regard to the Board and given it by section 47 ample power to see that the exercise of such authority shall be so guarded that injustice shall not be done.\nIt is the bounden duty of the Board to see that the iniquity of transferring to any one another's property or destroying its value merely to enrich the other at his expense is not done by means of the great powers Parliament has given.\nIt was to obviate wrong and injustice in the execution of the powers given by railway legislation and the abuse thereof that Parliament mindful of its own weaknesses committed to the Board the high trusts and wide powers it enjoys.\nIt is urged that the municipal council has agreed to the use of the streets. It was quite right and proper the council's consent should be got.\nIt may be quite right and proper the council should get the power if it has it not to levy upon the ratepayers the compensation necessary to equalize the condition of things a few are expected to suffer for the benefit of all.\nIf this had been provided for the consent of the council might have carried more weight with the Board.\nCounsel seemed unwilling to say that a school might not have been an object of the Board's protection.\nIf the school, the church, the hospital, why may not the dweller in the narrow street? It is all a question of degree. Society is just as much interested in seeing that no section or class of people suffer injustice at its hands as in keeping these institutions free from harm.\nOf course when the best that is practicable has been done there will accrue to some more than others incidental suffering arising from the growth of the social and commercial structure.\nWhere to draw the line is the duty and within the power of the Board.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014Upon an application to the Board for leave to construct a railway upon, along or across a highway under the provisions of sections 235 et seq., the Board has power to refuse the application and it has power to grant the application. It has also unquestionably the power to impose terms and conditions touching the \"protection, safety and convenience of the public.\" With respect to any order of the Board falling within any of these three classes, the parties are without any redress in this court. The authority of this court is limited to considering such questions of jurisdiction as are brought before it under the provisions of the Act and such questions of law as may be referred to it by the Board. The Board further has power under section 47 to suspend the operation of its orders; but it is not material to consider that section because the order now under consideration is very obviously not an order made under a suspensive condition or one to which section 47 can have any application. The order embodies a presently operative leave to the appellant company to construct its railway in certain streets and superadds certain terms, the validity of which is now in question.\nThe meaning of all these terms is on their face not very clear. But counsel on all sides agreed that the intention was that the railway company should be obliged to compensate a certain class of persons who might be injuriously affected by the construction of the railway, but who under the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" itself apart from any order of the Board would have no right to such compensation. It has been held that where a railway is constructed in a street the grade of which is not altered the owners of land and buildings abutting on the street have no right of compensation, as not being persons within the purview of the compensation clauses of the \"Railway Act.\" In Re Devlin and Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway Co.[3]; Powell v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.[4]. The soundness of these decisions was not impeached by the respondents, and I think that having regard to the circumstance that the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" in question have been repeatedly re-enacted without relevant alteration since these cases were decided it is too late now to question them.\nIt was to give such persons not otherwise entitled to compensation a right to compensation that the provision in question was inserted in the order of the Board. The point to be decided is: Was it within the power of the Board to impose such a term when granting the leave asked for? The contention of the respondents appears to rest upon the proposition that since the Board has power to grant or to refuse leave the whole field between these opposite poles is open to them. Whether that is so or not is, of course, purely a question of the intention of the legislature as disclosed by the language of the enactment. Comparison of the language found in the sections with which we are more immediately concerned and that used in other parts of the Act convinces me that the contention of the respondents cannot be sustained. There are many sections of the Act in which the power to impose terms and conditions where an application is made to the discretion of the Board is expressly given without any limitation. Section 233, sub-section 3(a), is one example; section 253, sub-section 20 another. Section 250, sub-section 3 is a third. In other cases the power to provide for payment of compensation in the discretion of the Board is conferred; (see section 249, sub-section 3). In other cases the discretion of the Board with regard to terms and conditions is limited to a particular subject-matter such as public protection and safety; see section 227, sub-section 3(a). The Board again in the exercise of some of its most important functions acts under sections which make no reference whatever to terms or conditions; see sections 158 and 159, and sections 222 and 223. I have great difficulty in understanding why we should find this diversity of language on the point of the power of the Board to impose terms and conditions if the principle of the respondent's argument\u2014that the authority to grant or refuse involves an authority to impose an unlimited range of conditions and terms\u2014be a principle of construction safely or properly applicable to the \"Railway Act.\" I think it cannot be so. I think we are justified in assuming in view of the provisions I have mentioned that when, for example, in section 159 the Board is empowered to sanction the plan, profile and book of reference mentioned in the preceding section and in section 168 the company is forbidden to commence the construction of the railway or any part of it until such sanction has been obtained \u2014 I think we are justified in assuming that the legislature did not intend to confer upon the Board the authority to impose as a term of its sanction a condition (let us say) that the compensation to be paid to persons entitled to it should be estimated as from a date earlier or later than that provided for in the Act, The same observation may be made upon sections 222 and 223, which relate to the construction of branch lines.\nIt is not necessary to consider whether or not in applications such as those last mentioned the Board have some implied power to impose terms. I do not say they have not. It is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say, and my opinion is, that the company's obligations in respect of compensation have been specially dealt with in the other provisions of the Act, and those obligations the Board have no authority to add to except in cases in respect of which such authority is given by Parliament, either expressly or by necessary implication, and, moreover, that no such implication arises from the authority given simpliciter to grant or refuse leave.\nComing to the sections immediately under consideration we find the Board expressly authorized in section 237 to impose terms in respect of one subject-matter. But we find a further provision, subsection 3 of that section. That provision was not discussed in the course of the argument, and I should not desire to express an opinion as to the precise meaning of it; but it shews that the subject of compensation was before the legislature when dealing with the subject of highway crossings and while leaving to the Board expressly a discretion to exact conditions in relation to another subject-matter no such discretion is in terms confided to them in respect of the subject of compensation. As regards section 159, it is true the order purports to be made under that section. But it was treated at the argument as, in substance, an order made under section 237; and the reasons given above, with the exception of the observation just made on the special provisions of section 237, apply in their full force to section 159.\nAll these reasons convince me that in professing to exercise the discretion it did the Board exceeded its authority. I think it is really not much to the purpose to say that the company need not act upon the order. The effect of the order is to give the sanction of the Board to the line provided for. The company may, of course, abandon the construction of its line. But it cannot construct its line except upon a route sanctioned by the Minister and the Board. The order of the Board may, of course, be changed and the route altered; but in the meantime the only lawful route is that prescribed by the order.\nAnglin J.\u2014As a condition of approving the location of the appellant's railway (\"Railway Act,\" sec. 159) upon and along Empire Avenue and Hardisty Street in the City of Fort William, the Board of Railway Commissioners has imposed the term that the company shall\nmake full compensation to all persons interested for all damages by them sustained by reason of the location of the railway along any street in the said City of Fort William.\nThe argument of this appeal proceeded on the assumption that the Board has by its order also given the company leave to construct its line of railway upon these highways pursuant to sections 235-243 of the \"Railway Act.\" It should be noted, however, that the order in appeal does not purport to be made under, or in the exercise of the powers conferred by these sections.\nAt bar counsel agreed that the purpose and effect of the term which I have quoted from the order is to require the company to compensate owners of lands abutting on the two highways for depreciation in the value of their properties owing to interference with access thereto and with the use of the streets as a means of ingress and egress and for any other loss which the construction and operation of a railway in such streets may entail.\nThe appellants maintain that the imposition of such a term as a condition either of approving of the location of a railway or of granting leave to construct it upon highways is ultra vires of the Board. They allege that the Board has required the company to make compensation for injuries from liability for which it is exempt under the \"Railway Act,\" and also that the Ontario legislature has, by confirming an agreement made by the company with the City of Fort William, in effect, declared the landowners not entitled to the compensation which the company is required to allow them.\nThe statute confers upon the Board extensive powers and wide discretion in dealing with applications for sanction of the proposed location of railways or for leave to construct them upon highways. By subsection 3 of section 159, unless the Minister of Railways otherwise specifically directs (and in this case he has not given any such direction), the Board is empowered to sanction a deviation of not more than one mile from the general location approved by him under section 157. By section 237 the Board is expressly authorized to impose certain terms \u2014 including the providing of a substitutional highway\u2014as a condition of granting leave to construct a railway upon an existing highway. Under section 28 it may of its own motion determine any matter which under the Act it may determine upon application; and under section 26(2) it may order that which it may authorize the company to do. By section 47 the Board is empowered to direct in any order that it shall come into force only upon the performance of any terms which the Board may see fit to impose.\nIn considering whether a proposed location of a railway along a highway should or should not be approved, the Board, in the exercise of its discretion, must necessarily take into account all the surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the construction and operation of the railway upon the interests of the owners of lands abutting on the highway. Having power to grant or to refuse its approval or to direct a deviation in the location of the railway, the Board must determine whether, having regard to all the interests involved and affected, it should sanction the proposed location, unconditionally, conditionally, or not at all. If it is satisfied that neither the exigencies of the railway company nor the interests of the public warrant the practical destruction of the highway and the cutting off of abutting properties without compensation, yet that the interests concerned taken as a whole will be best served and justice effectually done by permitting the railway company to use the highway with compensation to the property owners, rather than by refusing its application or ordering a deviation, I see no reason why the Board may not, having regard to the discretion which it must necessarily possess in giving or withholding its approval, exercise the power conferred by section 47 and impose upon the railway company the making of such compensation as a term of the order granting its application for approval or leave.\nThe Board has in fact determined in the present case that neither the interest of the public in the construction of the appellants' railway nor the necessities of the railway company itself warrant its sanctioning, without providing for compensation, a scheme entailing the injury which the private property owners must sustain as a result of the construction and operation of a steam railway along Empire Avenue and Hardisty Street. It has, therefore, in effect decided that the application of the company should be refused unless it is prepared to accept the conditional approval which has been given. Though inform an approval of the location upon terms, those terms being in the nature of a condition precedent, the order is in substance tantamount to a refusal of approval unless the company should accept the terms prescribed. Instead of ordering a deviation the Board has allowed the company an opportunity to avail itself of the highways upon these terms. It would perhaps have been better had the order taken the form of a refusal to approve the location unless the company should assent to the terms which the Board thought it proper to impose. But that, in my opinion, is in substance, though not in form, what the Board has done; and I think that in so doing it has neither erred in law nor exceeded its discretionary powers.\nA railway company has not the right or power to locate and construct its line upon a highway without the sanction and leave of the Board. It may be that when that leave or sanction has been obtained the obligation of the company to make compensation for damages caused by the exercise of the powers thus conferred is, under section 155 of the \"Railway Act,\" as judicially interpreted, so restricted that it excludes liability for injuries sustained by owners of land adjoining a highway along which the railway is carried at grade. But it does not follow that the tribunal in which is vested the authority to determine whether the company shall or shall not be granted this power may not impose the making of such compensation as a condition of granting it. In my opinion section 155 of the \"Railway Act\" has no application at this stage of the matter, and the order of the Board, whether it should be regarded as confined to a sanction of location under section 159, or should be deemed also to include leave to construct under sections 235 et seq., is within the powers conferred by section 47, and is not inconsistent with or in contravention of section 155 or any other provision of the statute to which our attention has been directed.\nHaving regard to the terms of section 237, the Board may possess a wider discretion when acting under section 159 than in cases to which sections 235 et seq. alone are applicable. But as the present order is certainly made under section 159, it is unnecessary to consider this question.\nIt is true that the municipality of Fort William has undertaken by agreement with the appellants to grant them \"free of all costs and liability\" the right to build and operate in perpetuity a double track line of railway on Empire Avenue and Hardisty Street. This agreement was ratified by a by-law submitted to the ratepayers of the city and the by-law was subsequently confirmed by the legislature. 5 Edw. VII. (Ont), ch. 48. The words \"free from all costs and liability\" in the agreement prima facie relate to rights of the municipality to be affected by the construction of the rail: way. They do not purport, and should not be taken to have been intended to affect the interests or claims of others not parties to the agreement. As I understand that document, the municipality thereby undertook to relieve the railway company from all claim on its part and all liability to it in respect of the actual right of way which the company should acquire upon and over the highway named. The private property owners were not parties to the instrument and their rights could not be affected by it. If it should be deemed to manifest an intention that the municipality shall save the railway company harmless in respect of all rights or claims which these property owners might have by reason of its occupation and use of the streets in question, the agreement might perhaps be construed as meaning that the municipality will indemnify the company against payment of such compensation as that now in question. But such an undertaking by the municipality would in nowise destroy or diminish any claims of the property owners against the railway company, whatever right over it might have against the municipality. The confirmation of the agreement by by-law and by legislation has not altered its meaning or effect. It remains a private agreement between the municipality and the company. All that the legislature has done is to put beyond question the power of the municipality to make the agreement. The rights of the respondents, other than the municipality itself, remain entirely unaffected by it.

SPECIAL QUESTIONS OF LAW referred by the Governor in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration.\nThe following are the questions so submitted on the report of His Majesty's Privy Council for Canada, dated 6th April, 1910.\n\"The Committee of the Privy Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that, pursuant to section 60 of the 'Supreme Court Act,' the following questions be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, viz.:\n\"1. Is a preliminary inquiry before a magistrate necessary before a charge can be preferred under section 873(a) of the Criminal Code?\n\"2. Has the lawful deputy of the Attorney-General, appointed by competent provincial authority in the Province of Alberta, authority to prefer a charge under section 873(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, without the written consent of the judge of the court or of the Attorney-General in person and without an order of the court?\n\"3. Has the lawful deputy of the Attorney-General, appointed by competent provincial authority in the Province of Saskatchewan, authority to prefer a charge under section 873(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, without the written consent of the judge of the court or of the Attorney-General in person, and without an order of the court?\n\"4. Has the lawful deputy of the Attorney-General, of a province of the Dominion of Canada, appointed by competent provincial authority, authority to grant the leave of the Attorney-General of his province, under section 17 of the 'Lord's Day Act'?\"\n\"F. K. Bennetts,\n\"Asst. Clerk of the Privy Council\" The above mentioned sections of the Criminal Code and \"Lord's Day Act\" are set out in the head-note.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, appeared for the Government of Canada.\nForde K.C., Deputy Attorney-General, for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n(C. A. Grant for the Province of Alberta.\nThe court answered the first question in the negative, Idington J. dissenting. The other three questions were unanimously answered in the negative. Their Lordships delivered the following reasons to support their answers.\nGirouard J.\u2014I think that the observations made by this court in Re Legislation respecting Abstention from Labour on Sunday[1], applies more strongly in a case like this. I have serious objection to sit in a case which looks very much as if it were an appeal from provincial courts in a criminal matter where the statute says there is no appeal to this court. However, as our advice has no legal effect, does not affect the rights of parties, nor the provincial decisions, and is not even binding upon us, I have no objection to express my concurrence in the answers prepared by this court.\nDavies J.\u2014The questions one, two and three referred to this court respecting section 873(a) of the Criminal Code practically ask us to sit as a court of appeal on the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of the Province of Saskatchewan, in the case of The King v. Duff[2]. As no such appeal is allowed in criminal cases where the judgment of the provincial court is adverse to the Crown, I felt strongly that the better course would be for this court to refer the questions back to His Excellency in Council, pointing out the fact that the questions substantially though indirectly involved such an appeal and ought not to be answered by us.\nIn addition I may add that we have not had the benefit of an argument on both sides of the questions. Counsel representing the Crown alone submitted their contentions. In giving my answers to the questions 1 do so with reluctance and solely in obedience to the imperative provisions of the statute, \"Supreme Court Act,\" section 60, and out of deference to the order of His Excellency in Council. At the same time I do not think this court or its members would feel bound in any concrete case which might arise hereafter by any expression of opinion we may now give on these questions.\nI am strongly inclined to the opinion that the subsections (l) and (m) of section 31 of the general \"Interpretation Act\" of the Dominion, which were strongly relied upon by Mr. Forde as clearly settling questions two, three and four in the affirmative, do not apply to them at all. The expression \"Minister of the Crown,\" in sub-section (e) refers, I think, to a Minister of the Crown of the Dominion of Canada only, and not to the ministers of the several provinces. It is difficult to imagine the Parliament of Canada \"directing\" a provincial minister to do a specific act or thing. They might \"empower\" as it is put in the alternative in the sub-section. But it seems to me Parliament never intended that a \"lawful deputy\" of a provincial minister, whose duties as such are limited and defined by the several provincial legislatures as they respectively may from time to time determine, and may and probably are in many cases very far from co-ordinate with those of the provincial minister, should have and exercise all the powers conferred from time to time by Dominion statute upon the minister himself. These considerations would not apply to the cases of Dominion Ministers of the Crown and their deputies the relative powers and duties of whom are defined by Dominion statutes, and are subject, of course, to its directions and supposed to be well known to Parliament when legislating. Following this reasoning sub-section (m) when it refers to \"any other public officer or functionary\" means, on my construction, any other public officer or functionary of the Dominion, and does not relate to provincial officials. This construction, if correct, would effectually dispose of questions two, three and four, in the negative. Even if not correct, I would still be of the opinion that the Deputy Attorney-General of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta are not entitled as such to prefer a formal charge in writing against any person under section 873(a) of the Criminal Code, as enacted by the \"Criminal Code Amendment Act\" of 1907, ch. 8. That section permits the charge to be preferred by \"the Attorney-General or an agent of the Attorney-General.\" I agree with Chief Justice Wetmore that the Deputy Attorney-General is not ex officio such an agent, and this quite apart from the special limitation upon his powers placed by section 10 of \"The Act respecting the Public Service of Saskatchewan,\" 6 Edw. VII. (1906) ch. 5, and the similar statute of the Province of Alberta. At the time when section 873(a) of the Code was passed, there were persons in each of these Provinces of Albert and Saskatchewan appointed by the Departments of the Attorneys-General respectively to act for the Crown law officers at the respective courts to which they were appointed and who were styled \"agents of the Attorney-General.\" These were, in my opinion, clearly the persons and the only persons referred to by the section in question as \"an agent of the Attorney-General,\" and their special mention would, even if sub-sections (l) and (m) of section 31 were held applicable to the construction of section 873(a) of the Code, exclude Deputy Attorneys-General. These sub-sections of section 31 are only to be invoked when (as the section says) a contrary intention does not appear. Here by specifically naming a special well-known class of persons as \"agents of the Attorney-General\" for the performance of a special judicial function or duty, the general deputy head of the department, not being within the class, is excluded. \"The contrary intention\" does appear and excludes the application of the sub-sections.\nThe 10th section of the provincial Act, 1906, to which I have above referred, limits and defines the powers of the deputy heads of the several departments as follows:\nIn the absence of any head the deputy head of the department shall perform the duties of such head unless an acting head of the department is appointed or the performance of such duties is otherwise provided for by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; and the deputy head so acting during such absence shall exercise all the powers vested in the head as to the control of the other employees of the department. In the ex parte argument addressed to us this section (no doubt inadvertently) was not called to our attention, but it seems to me conclusive, even if the sub-sections of section 31 of the general \"Interpretation Act\" did apply, against the contention submitted that the Deputy Attorney-General was ex officio an agent of the Attorney-General within the meaning of the terms in section 873(a) of the Criminal Code.\nAfter examining the criminal legislation of the Dominion with respect to the North-West Territories, and the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan carved out of them, and also the section of the Code (873 (a)) applicable to those provinces alone, I am of opinion that the true construction of that section does not require that there should have been any preliminary examination before a magistrate before a charge could be preferred under that section. For the reasons I have given I would therefore answer questions one, two and three in the negative.\nSection 17 of the \"Lord's Day Act,\" to which question No. 4 relates reads as follows:\nNo action or prosecution for a violation of this Act shall he commenced without the leave of the Attorney-General for the province in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, nor after the expiration of sixty days from the time of the commission of the alleged offence.\nHere there is no mention of \"an agent of the Attorney-General\" exercising the functions and powers conferred on the latter officer. The leave of the Attorney-General himself must be obtained. In my view of the construction of sub-sections (l) and (m) of section 31 of the general \"Interpretation Act,\" there can be but one answer and that in the negative. Even if the subsections are applicable, I would greatly doubt whether the \"leave of the Attorney-General\" required by section 17 could be given by the Deputy Attorney-General. The high official named is called upon to exercise a judicial or at the very least a quasi judicial function in granting or refusing leave to commence an action or prosecution under the Act, and I think the case of Abraham v. The Queen[3] a strong authority for the position that it is a function which he must personally discharge and which he cannot delegate, and which is of a character and nature not covered by sub-sections (l) and (m) even if applicable.\nI answer that fourth question in the negative.\nIdington J.\u2014The creation of this court has been generally supposed to have been intended as an exercise of the powers given by the \"British North America Act,\" section 101, which is as follows:\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nIt was constituted as a court of law and equity. It was given an appellate and other jurisdiction.\nIn consequence of doubts expressed in In re Legislation respecting Abstention from Labour on Sunday[4] the \"Supreme Court Act\" was amended by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 50, now section 60 of the Act.\nI must be permitted to doubt if it can as such be made a court or commission of general inquiry, as the amendment seems to read.\nThe words used in section 101, i.e., \"the better administration of the laws of Canada,\" may, however, cover a pretty wide field. If this inquiry extends beyond that field it probably is ultra vires.\nAssuming but doubting if, in some such way the inquiry falls properly within the second part of the above section 101, it becomes pertinent thereto at the threshold to try to understand what Parliament was about when amending the Criminal Code, by section 873(a).\nIt is to be observed that though procedure falls within the power of Parliament subject to that\nthe administration of justice in the province including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction and including procedure in civil matters in these courts\nis assigned by section 92, sub-section 14, to the authority of the legislature.\nParliament saw fit to amend the Criminal Code by enacting as follows:\n873(a). In the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, it shall not be necessary to prefer any bill of indictment before a grand jury, but it shall be sufficient that the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged.\n2. Such charge may be preferred by the Attorney-General or any agent of the Attorney-General, or by order of the court.\nThe question raised thereupon is: Has either the lawful Deputy Attorney-General of Saskatchewan or of Alberta within his province the power of the Attorney-General thereof under this section?\nThe creation of a Deputy Attorney-General and the definition of his powers are entirely within the power of the legislature and may be so regulated as to vary as directed from day to day. Certainly Parliament is not to be supposed to have intended to meddle therewith. Nor can I imagine it was intended to entrust the duty to one whose power to execute it varied from day to day.\nThe question of what power Parliament has to assign to and enforce the performance of a given duty by any one holding a particular office created by and under another autonomous power suggests an interesting inquiry not easy of definite solution.\nFor that, if no other reason, its nominee by such a method of designation ought in reason to be holding an office that has some relation to the subject-matter being dealt with; and the more intimate the better.\nThough the authority of the Attorney-General of a province is also subject to legislative limitations, custom, tradition and constitutional usage, having charged him with the administration of justice within the province as his primary duty, also pointed him out as the proper one to have assigned to him such a duty as this section assigns.\nParliament was constituting in a new country an authority to discharge the duties which the ancient institution of the grand jury had elsewhere so long performed.\nI would assume that Parliament had regard to the history of that body and to such conditions of law and custom as governed and guided it and in confiding to any officer the delicate duty of placing a man on trial without the slightest notice beforehand as contended for here it might be supposed to have had some regard to the responsible character of his position as well as to the kind of person it was entrusting with such duties.\nIt might well be observed that the Attorney-General is a person generally known to the public and so much in the public eye as to be probably responsive to such just criticism for neglect of duty as his deputy clearly might not be. An admirable deputy attorney-general within the sphere of duties the legislature had assigned him might be quite unfitted to discharge such functions as this new condition of affairs required.\nThe evident purpose of the whole enactment was to throw the responsibility directly upon one man.\nHe might if he saw fit name his agents for discharging, indeed, for the special purpose of discharging, such onerous duties. Yet he should remain the responsible head for such delegations of power to enable the duty to be properly discharged.\nThe express power of delegation thus given seems to exclude the idea of any other being substituted.\nA deputy attorney-general is not necessarily the agent of the Attorney-General in any sense. He fills, as said already, whether nominated or removable by the Attorney-General, an office generally created by local statute and discharges duties thereby assigned.\nMuch less can it be the case that he can be said to fall within the special description given in the Act.\nOn the other hand the deputy might be merely the nominee of the Attorney-General. In such case, inasmuch as the Act implies clearly that the Attorney-General should select special agents for this purpose, it on this assumption excludes any one else and thus also the strained meaning sought to be placed on the \"Interpretation Act.\"\nThat meaning is not only inconsistent with the purview of the amended Code and the very words of the section in question, but with the interpretation clause of the Code assigning the meaning to be given the words \"Attorney-General\" in the Code. How could Parliament more pointedly shew the inconsistency that the \"Interpretation Act\" recognizes as possible and fully provides against than this?\nAre we prima facie to assume Parliament had the intention in every case wherein it assigns a power to a provincial officer and implies a duty to execute it that it must of necessity mean thereby as of course to include any and every kind of deputy he may have? The clause relied on in the \"Interpretation Act\" is hardly to be stretched so far.\nBut in principle, as it seemed to me from the very first, this case is within the case of Abrahams v. The Queen[5]. It also is almost within the very language of the statute there in question.\nA Crown counsel is but the deputy of the Attorney-General and the lawful deputy for the time and place named.\nThis was a case where an indictment had been preferred for an offence within the meaning of the \"Vexatious Indictments Act\" as it stood in section 28 of \"An Act respecting Procedure in Criminal Cases,\" etc., 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 29.\nIt prohibited the grand jury unless certain preliminary steps described had been taken from finding any bill of indictment\nunless the indictment for such offence is preferred by the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General for the province or of a judge of a court having jurisdiction to give such direction or try the offence.\nNo special efficacy can be attached to the word \"bill\" as suggested in the factum herein to distinguish it from this case especially in view of the new meanings given contemporaneously with the enactment of section 873(a) to the word \"indictment.\" See section 2, sub-section 16, of the Code.\nThe substance of the thing was looked at by this court following the English courts. And the power of any one, save and except him specially and specifically designated by his office to perform the judicial act of giving legal sanction to the proceeding of putting a man on his trial, was properly repudiated.\nThe second sub-section of the section of the \"Interpretation Act\" now relied upon stood then just as it does now. No one seems to have had the courage to try it on the court. In a sense the Crown officers might have been urged there as deputies and even lawful deputies.\nIn substance and in language it is seldom we can get cases so nearly alike. Substitute the word \"charge\" now included in the word \"indictment\" and the cases seem almost on all fours.\nIt was the judicial quality of the act required to be done that was held to render substitution impossible. It is that which renders it inconsistent here with the meaning in the \"Interpretation Act.\"\nMoreover, in this case the question involved is not the comparatively trifling one there as to half a dozen or so specified crimes, but it is the operation of the whole Code.\nThe deputies attorney-general not only claim that the right and duty of putting any man on his trial has devolved upon each of them, but also that of doing so without any need of a preliminary proceeding of any kind.\nIf such be the import of the amendment so much more significant is the designation by Parliament of one man and his agent specifically delegated to discharge his appointor's duty in that regard. But is that the case? At first blush it seemed so. However, when I find the interpretation section of the Code amended to make the Act as amended by this section 873(a) workable, it is evident it is not intended this new section should be as it were an entirely new code of procedure in itself.\nIf we interpret section 871, sub-section 2, in light of these amendments, we find some curious results possible.\nIt seems to imply that where a man has been prosecuted and some one bound over -to prosecute him the charge may have to be confined within the limits of the original prosecution.\nOf course all this, it may be said, is to be discarded and a new prosecution, as it were, instituted by the Attorney-General within section 873 (a).\nOn the other hand Is section 872 entirely inoperative? Are all the provisions relative to preliminary examination and inquiry and need therefor in the Code as it stood up to this amendment 873(a) revoked?\nOr is the said section only intended to substitute the Attorney-General or agent or judge for the grand jury?\nIt is necessary in order to properly appreciate all this and answer the first question submitted to bear in mind the history of legal development relative to criminal prosecutions.\nOriginally the grand jury had the right to entertain any complaint and present any offender without any preliminary inquiry. In practice I think this was in later times not always or unrestrictedly adopted.\nIn the old Province of Canada the law was changed in 1861 by the \"Vexatious Indictments Act\" expressly taking away the power in seven named cases of misdemeanour unless with the consent of certain designated officers or judges.\nWith some changes in 1869 the law stood as above indicated till the Criminal Code was enacted in 1892.\nSection 641 thereof expressly prohibited indictments being preferred unless there had been the preliminary examination followed by a prosecutor being bound over or a committal; or the Attorney-General or any one by his direction or a judge permitted.\nThis was again amended by 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 46, and again by the Revised Statutes of Canada and stood as it now stands in the Criminal Code sections 870 to 873 inclusive.\nThese sections are plain. They require, except in specified cases left to the discretion of an Attorney-General or a judge of a court of record or of criminal jurisdiction, preliminary proceedings.\nThe amendment section 873(a) does not in the slightest degree imply any intention to repeal them beyond the obvious necessity arising from the substitution of the officers above named for the discharge of the functions of the grand jury relative to placing a man on his trial.\nIt deals only with the case of \"the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence.\" How charged? Is it confined to those who have been judicially so charged, by virtue of the provisions of the law for committing the accused for trial?\nHow can it mean aught else? The word \"charged\" is the apt one to designate a person accused and in charge. Doubtless it has another meaning, but it may well be argued that it is in this restricted sense that the Act applies it.\nIt is true the Attorney-General by this interpretation may either have the power given him under the Code in two ways, or deprived of that he had already been given by section 872 of the Code.\nIt is equally true and significant that in one place he alone is given the power and in the other place he or his agent, and in reading these sections and giving each its full force the object is fully accomplished of substituting some one else for the grand jury without bringing about a revolution in the later principles upon which the administration of criminal justice proceeded.\nI am sure such a thing never was intended. I am sure it would end in evil. The principle acted upon of not permitting any one to be put on trial without preliminary examination had been carried so far as to discard a coroner's inquisition. See section 940.\nIt may be said that merely rendered going before a grand jury necessary.\nI am satisfied from the practice of such a thing, though possible in law, never having been attempted, it was of set purpose to bring about a definite preliminary examination, as the key-note of criminal prosecution save where an Attorney-General or judge directed otherwise.\nThe result was in the plainest possible case the hearing had to be repeated before a magistrate to ensure committal for trial.\nThe policy of the law that there should be a preliminary examination was thus clearly settled and so settled in order that on grounds of humanity and justice that examination might, as so often happens, enable one accused, without perhaps the slightest foundation, by cross-examination of his accusers or by his own explanations to dispel the false appearances against him and save him the pain and indignity of being improperly placed on his trial.\nThe differences between that and the system of placing a man on his trial without being given such opportunity is most radical. The tendency in the one method is towards a humane administration of justice and in the other towards the vicious reverse thereof.\nThere are cases arise as, for example, prosecutions of municipal or other corporations in respect of such nuisance as the maintenance of unwholesome jails or court houses or for non-repair of roads where such considerations might not operate; but where the Attorney-General might properly, if inconvenience unlikely to arise, authorize on his official responsibility the trial of what after all savours of the trial of a civil proceeding.\nIt seems to me the question cannot be answered as if beyond doubt, and when answered here and thus ex parte can bind no one.\nBut I am quite sure of one thing relative to the administration of justice, and that is that no one entrusted therewith or any part thereof should ever jeopardize or prejudice by the adoption of a doubtful course of procedure, when a safer one was at hand, either the administration of justice or the standing, reputation or freedom of another for a single hour.\nI therefore answer the first question, \"yes,\" and each of the others, \"no.\"\nThese answers are relative to the acts to be done under 873(a) for obviously the answer must be so qualified. Duff J.\u2014To all the questions submitted I answer \"no.\" For my reasons I refer to the opinion of my brother Davies. I desire, however, to add one or two observations upon the legal quality and effect of these answers and the opinions upon which they rest. The practice of asking the extra judicial advice of the judges upon questions of law is an ancient practice. Seemingly the last recorded instance in England in which without statutory authority such advice was sought by the Crown occurred in 1760, when a question arising out of the proceedings against Lord Geo. Sackville was submitted through Lord Mansfield and answered. In that case, as in many previous cases, the judges expressly declared that if the question should afterwards be brought before them judicially they should be ready \"without difficulty to change\" their opinion[6]. It has long been settled that the House of Lords is entitled to require the answers of the common law judges upon questions as to the existing state of law whether arising out of litigation pending before the House or not. But in such cases the opinions of the judges have not in themselves the authority of judicial precedent. In Head v. Head[7], at page 140, Lord Eldon said:\nThe answers given by the judges, therefore, although entitled to the greatest respect as being their opinions communicated to the highest tribunal in the kingdom, are not to be considered as judicial decisions.\nLord Eldon is here speaking of opinions given in answer to questions arising out of contentious litigation actually pending before the House and given after full argument. The view of a very able and experienced judge touching the value of such opinions where there is no cause and no argument may be gathered from the following passage in the opinion by Maule J. in McNaghten's Case[8], at page 204:\nI feel great difficulty in answering the questions put by your Lordships on this occasion: First, because they do not appear to arise out of and are not put with reference to a particular case, or for a particular purpose, which might explain or limit the generality of their terms, so that full answers to them ought to be applicable to every possible state of facts, not inconsistent with those assumed in the questions; this difficulty is the greater, from the practical experience both of the bar and the court being confined to questions arising out of the facts of particular cases; Secondly, because I have heard no argument at your Lordships' bar or elsewhere, on the subject of these questions; the want of which I feel the more, the greater are the number and extent of questions which might be raised in argument; Thirdly, from a fear of which I cannot divest myself, that as these questions relate to matters of criminal law of great importance and frequent occurrence, the answers to them by the judges may embarrass the administration of justice, when they are cited in criminal trials.\nIn more recent times it has been held that the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice upon questions submitted to it under section 29 of the \"Local Government Act\" is consultative only and not judicial. Ex parte County Council of Kent and Council of the Borough of Dover[9].\nWith regard to questions submitted under the Dominion statute the course of the Judicial Committee has, I think, been very instructive. The authority conferred by the statute has been sometimes used for the submission of specific points in controversy between the Dominion and the provinces upon the construction of the \"British North America Act\" which, as bearing upon the validity of specific statutes, it was thought desirable to have determined; both sides to the controversy having accepted the issue and the tribunals having the benefit of the fullest argument upon it. Even in such cases the Board has usually refused to pass upon questions touching private interests not represented [the question relating to the rights of riparian proprietors for example[10]], or to answer questions the replies to which might properly be influenced by the circumstances in which the questions should arise for actual judicial decision. Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[11], at page 529.\nThe questions submitted in this case relate to the construction of statutes governing criminal procedure and the answers to them could not well be affected by the circumstances of any particular case in which they might arise; and they are therefore not open to the same objections as may be taken to purely hypothetical questions. But the court is called upon to answer them, having heard argument from one point of view only; and in these circumstances it is clear that the opinions expressed in the answers given cannot have tire weight attached either to a judicial deliverance or to an extra-judicial opinion pronounced after hearing the possible diverse views of the question presented in argument. Indeed, there is not a little danger that such answers may, as Maule J. said in the passage already quoted, tend \"to embarrass the administration of justice,\" (not only in this court, if, as is most likely we should hereafter be called upon to answer the same questions when raised litigiously), but in other courts also, which may naturally feel greater delicacy than this court on a proper occasion would feel in treating the questions passed upon as res nov\u0153, notwithstanding such opinions.\nAnglin J.\u2014Parliament has advisedly denied to the Crown the right of appeal to this court in criminal cases from judgments of provincial courts in favour of defendants. Because a review of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in The King v. Duff[12], is unavoidably involved in the disposition of the present case and also because of the strong disapprobation expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the practice of procuring judicial opinions upon abstract questions (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[13]; The Brewers' Case[14]) the court answers the questions now submitted with reluctance and diffidence, solely in obedience to the imperative provisions of the statute (\"Supreme Court Act,\" section 60), and in deference to the order of the Governor-General in Council. It must be understood that as this opinion is given without the advantage of argument except on behalf of the provincial Attorney-General, it would not be proper that it should be deemed binding in any case which may hereafter arise, whether in this court, or in any provincial court.\nIn the absence of any provision in the Criminal Code that there should be a preliminary magisterial inquiry before a charge is preferred under section 873 (a), the right to commence proceedings in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta against persons accused of offences by preferring charges as provided in that section would appear to be unqualified.\nUnder sub-section 1, of section 873, of the Criminal Code, applicable to the other provinces, a bill of indictment may be preferred in respect of a charge as to which there has been no preliminary inquiry. This section is the legitimate successor of part of section 28 of 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 29 \u2014 other parts of which are replaced in a modified form by sections 871 and 872. Under section 28 the preferring of an indictment by the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General was in certain cases an alternative to its being preferred by a person who had been bound over to prosecute (section 871 of the Code) or to its being preferred by a Crown prosecutor (section 872 of the Code), or by the grand jury sua sponte against a person who had been committed for trial. Section 28 provided that \"no bill of indictment\" for certain specified offences\nshall be presented to or found by any grand jury unless the prosecutor or other person presenting such indictment has been bound by recognizance to prosecute or give evidence against the person accused of such offence, or unless the person accused has been committed to or detained in custody, or has been bound by recognizance to appear to answer to an indictment to be preferred against him for such offence, or unless the indictment for such offence is preferred by the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General for the province.\nUnder this section it cannot, I think, be questioned that a preliminary investigation before a magistrate was not a pre-requisite to the preferring of an indictment by the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General. It must not be forgotten that these provisions were restrictive of the former absolute and unqualified right of grand juries proprio motu to present indictments against any person whomsoever.\nWhile the territory now included in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan was, as part of the North-West Territories, subject in all matters to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, the statute in force provided that \"no grand jury shall be summoned or sit in the Territories.\" R.S.C. (1886) ch. 50, sec. 65. The courts of criminal jurisdiction of the Territories were constituted without grand juries. The provincial legislatures of these two provinces have seen fit to continue this constitution of their courts.\nHaving to deal with courts so constituted, Parliament found itself obliged to provide some substitute for the methods of commencing criminal trials prescribed for other parts of Canada in which grand juries form part of the criminal courts as constituted by the provincial legislatures. In the North-West Territories trials were begun\nby a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the offence * * * charged (54 & 55 Vict. ch. 22, sec. 11).\nWhen the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created Parliament thought proper to make a more formal and definite provision, and for this purpose enacted in 1907 what is now clause 873(a) of the Criminal Code. This provision is a re-enactment of section 11 of chapter 22 of 54 & 55 Vict. and an application of sub-section 1, of section 873, of the Criminal Code to the criminal courts as constituted in these provinces. Parliament does not assume to deal with the constitution of these courts; it merely provides, as it is its duty to do, a procedure suited to the courts as it finds them constituted. Parliament having for that purpose adapted to the existing local conditions the provisions of sub-section 1, of section 873, of the Code, I see no sufficient reason for holding that a preliminary proceeding, not requisite when a charge is preferred by bill of indictment under section 873(1), should be deemed necessary when a similar charge is preferred under section 873(a). In the former case, with or without preliminary investigation by a magistrate the grand jury may present a bill of indictment preferred by the Attorney-General or by any one by his direction or by any one with his written consent. In the latter the proceedings are commenced by a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the offence charged, which is preferred not before a grand jury, but directly to the court and petty jury by the Attorney-General or an agent of the Attorney-General or by any person with the written consent of the Attorney-General.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the answer to the first question propounded should he, \"no.\"\nThe power and duty of the Attorney-General under sub-section 2, of section 873(a), is statutory and quasi-judicial. Action by him is substituted for that of the grand jury under section 873. It is well established that such statutory powers and duties can be delegated only under, and in strict conformity with statutory authority. In Abrahams v. The Queen[15] this court so determined in regard to the functions of the Attorney-General under section 28 of 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 29, the prototype in part of section 873(a), sub-sec. (2). The Queen v. Hamilton[16]; The Queen v. Townsend[17]. Two sorts of delegation are expressly provided for in sub-section 2, of section 873(a), viz., to\nan agent of the Attorney-General \u2014 and by \"the written consent of the Attorney-General.\"\nAgents of the Attorney-General were well known in the North-West Territories before the constitution of the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. They were then agents of the Attorney-General of Canada. It was stated at bar by counsel for the provincial Attorneys-General that there are to-day in these provinces similar agents of the provincial Attorneys-General. These agents have no. general authority to act for the Attorney-General. They carry out specific instructions given in particular cases. They probably correspond to persons acting by the direction of the Attorney-General in other provinces under section 873(1). The Deputy Attorney-General is not in my opinion an agent of the Attorney-General within the meaning of sub-section 2, of section 873 (a). The form of the questions referred to us renders it unnecessary to consider delegation by \"written consent.\" The fact that these two methods of delegation are specified in section 873(a) is in itself a cogent argument that Parliament did not intend that any other delegation should be permitted.\nLooking for other statutory authority to support the delegation of the powers in question to the deputies of the provincial Attorneys-General, counsel invoke clauses (l) and (m) of section 31 of the \"Interpretation Act.\" Although at first inclined to think that clause (m) might apply, I am now satisfied that it does not. In clause (l) the words \"Minister of the Crown\" mean a member of the Dominion Government \u2014 one of the ministers mentioned in R.S.C. ch. 4, sec. 4 \u2014 and not provincial ministers of the Crown. The scope and nature of the \"Interpretation Act\" and the purpose of clause (l) of section 31, seem to me to require that its application should be so restricted. Counsel seemed rather disposed to concede this idea of the purview of clause (l) to be correct. If it be so, the word other in clause (m) preceding the words \"public functionary or officer\" indicates that the application of this clause is likewise confined to Dominion appointees to the exclusion of provincial functionaries or officers. We would, I think, give to these clauses of the \"Interpretation Act\" a much wider and more sweeping effect than it is at all safe to assume Parliament contemplated were we to hold that by virtue of them such a quasi-judicial power as is by section 873(a) conferred on the Attorneys-General of Alberta and Saskatchewan is vested in their deputies. This power is of such a nature \u2014 so personal and so discretionary \u2014 that nothing but specific legislation unmistakably applicable can justify its delegation. If the deputies of the Attorneys-General of these two newer provinces are by virtue of the general provisions of the \"Interpretation Act\" clothed with this power, the deputies of the Attorneys-General in all the other provinces must have the like power under section 873(1). No one has yet been bold enough to prefer such a claim. The history of section 873(1) is wholly inconsistent with its existence. Having regard to the intimate connection between section 873(a) and section 873 (1) already alluded to, and to the history of the latter in the courts and in Parliament, I think I am justified in saying that the language in which section 873(a) is couched affords sufficient evidence of that inconsistency in intent and object which suffices to render the provisions of clauses (l) and (m) of section 31 of the \"Interpretation Act\" inapplicable to it. (R.S.C. ch. 1, sec. 2.)\nI therefore conclude that for lack of statutory authority their deputies are not, as such, clothed with the powers conferred by section 873(a) on the Attorneys-General for the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nMany of the same considerations apply with even greater force in the case of the powers conferred on provincial Attorneys-General by section 17 of the \"Lord's Day Act.\"\nThe answer to each of the three questions referred, numbered respectively 2, 3, and 4, should, in my opinion, be \"no.\"\nIf the powers in question should be held to be vested in a .deputy attorney-general virtute officii, having regard to the provisions of section 10, of chapter 4, of 6 Edw. VII. (Alberta), and of section 10, of chapter 5, 6 Edw. VII. (Saskatchewan), the occasions on which the deputies of the Attorneys-General in those provinces could exercise them would probably be comparatively rare.\n[1] 35 pan. S.C.R. 581.\n[2] 2 Sask.

Well, I have some recollections of that contest myself, and I ask the Doctor: Why did you at that time withdraw your name from the Liberal convention? The majority of the delegates came there determined to see you nominated? Why did you not accede to their request? Doctor Kendall, what was your price? Did you get it? Take the good Liberals of this county into your confidence and tell them what happened in those two awful hours in a certain room in the Sydney Hotel that day?\n\"The proceedings of the convention were held up for no reason that the delegates saw, but for reasons which are very well known to you and three or four others whom I might mention. One speaker after another killed time at the Alexandria Hall while you were in dread conflict with the machine. Finally the consideration was fixed and you took off your coat and shouted for Johnston. What was that consideration?\nOn the trial of an action by K. against the proprietors of the Post the jury gave a verdict for the defendants.\nHeld, Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the publication could only be construed as charging K. with having withdrawn his name from the convention for personal profit, and was libellous. The verdict was therefore properly set aside by the court below and a new trial ordered. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia setting aside a verdict for the defendant and ordering a new trial.\nThe facts appear in the head-note.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellants.\nMellish K.C. and D. A. Cameron K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin. The article complained of is libellous upon its face and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014The question in this action is solely whether the words in question charged as being defamatory and libellous are necessarily so, and admit of no other construction, and whether the jury having found a verdict for the defendants, this court is justified in setting it aside and granting a new trial. The trial judge thought the article complained of meant to charge the plaintiff with the offence of violating a particular sub-section of the 265th section of the \"Elections Act,\" while the Chief Justice of the court below thought it meant to charge a violation of a different sub-section of that section of the Act. It is admitted now that neither of these contentions can be maintained. The sole question remaining is whether the words used are susceptible of any interpretation other than a defamatory one, and whether that question is for the jury to determine or for the court. It is not by any-means, a question as to the meaning the members of the court would attach to the words if acting as jurymen, but simply whether or not the finding of the jury on a question pre-eminently for them to decide was such as no jury of reasonable men could fairly reach.\nI have said the question of libel or no libel is one pre-eminently for the jury, and no case appears to be reported in England for the last 50 years and more in which a verdict for the defendant in a libel suit has been set aside upon the ground that the jury should have found the publication to be a libel. The verdict must in cases to justify its being set aside be manifestly wrong, and the alleged libel one admitting of no other construction than a defamatory one. In the present case the contention is that the words complained of are of that character. It is said that although the letter in which the words appear forms part of a political controversy, it really charges that the plaintiff at a certain time when he was sure of the party nomination by his friends at a political convention of the party to which he belonged, held for the purpose of nominating candidates to contest the county for the Dominion House of Commons, withdrew his name from the contest \"and took off his coat\" and worked for his rival candidate, and further, that he did so as a consequence of some price or consideration. It is maintained that the only possible meaning attributable to the libellous article is that the plaintiff had \"sold out,\" as it is said, for his own ends and purposes, and in this way took advantage of the good opinion his friends had formed of him, and that the article further charged that the consideration or price of plaintiff's withdrawal, although promised, was not given. The further necessary contention is made on behalf of respondent that no reasonable man looking at all the circumstances and facts appearing with respect to the publication could say the words were capable of any other construction or meaning than st the defamatory one suggested.\nThe majority of the court I understand accept this view. I am unable to do so and find it necessary therefore to state as shortly as I reasonably can my reasons for being unable to concur in holding that arbitrary construction of the article in question to be the only possible one which reasonable men could make.\nIt is necessary, of course, to look at the article as a whole, at its subject-matter and at the relative positions in which the parties stood towards each other. The plaintiff was a prominent politician in his county, had been its representative in the Commons and had sought for a re-nomination in the southern half of the constituency which had been subdivided. At a convention called of the party delegates the plaintiff's name had after conferences and disputes been withdrawn, and the alleged libel had reference to this withdrawal. The defendants' newspaper was the local organ of the opposite side of politics, and some years after the withdrawal on the eve of another political contest published the letter charged as being libellous.\nThat letter asserted practically that there had been a price or consideration given or promised to induce plaintiff to withdraw his name and intimated pretty clearly that good faith had not been kept and the promises had not been carried out. Did this necessarily mean that the plaintiff had withdrawn his name in consequence of some corrupt or immoral promise made to him of personal future advantage to himself, or was it capable of a more innocent meaning not necessarily libellous. The whole circumstances were in arriving at their conclusion to be weighed by the jury. As practical men they would know that many different reasons not necessarily corrupt or immoral would induce strong party men out of loyalty to their party to withdraw their names from nominations, even though at the time they had every reason to believe they had a majority of the convention with them, and they would also know that the political opponents of such men would in their comments or criticisms on the withdrawal, place the matter in the worst possible light and indulge in strong extravagant and indefensible language with regard to it. In deciding whether or not those who read the article would understand it as charging plaintiff with having made a corrupt or immoral bargain for himself, however, as the price of withdrawal of his name, they would naturally consider what the article expressed that while the plaintiff supposed himself to have a majority of the convention favourable' to his nomination, he had a strong rival. They would also consider as practical men the local political situation which probably, as in most places, demanded practical unanimity in the party as the price of success at the polls, and the pressure which under such circumstances would be brought to bear by the party agents or managers to ensure the withdrawal of one of the rival candidates; the appeal to party loyalty; the consequences which would flow from disunion; the party gratitude which would be earned by the self-sacrificing candidate in future nominations. On the other hand, they would consider the well-known and understood extravagance of language used by party papers on the eve of elections and during their progress towards their political adversaries, and might possibly reach a conclusion that language so published might be understood by those who read it as not carrying the imputation suggested by the mere natural consideration of the words themselves. All these things had fairly to be weighed and considered by the jury. They evidently and properly rejected the interpretation which the learned trial judge suggested the words bore. They must clearly, as shewn by their verdict, have concluded that under all the circumstances the people who read the article would discount its violence and extravagance, and would not understand it as conveying the grave imputation which its reading in the serene atmosphere of the courts and apart from the local facts and circumstances might justify.\nI cannot believe this court in a libel action is justified in setting aside such a finding of a jury and is compelled to accept as the only possible meaning of the words complained of that which may be said to be their natural and ordinary meaning when used under ordinary circumstances and with reference to the every day matters of life.\nI think the language used by some of the most distinguished jurists on the subject of the relative rights and duties of juries and judges in actions of libel alike appropriate and instructive in this appeal and are binding authorities upon us in cases such as the one before us. I venture to insert one or two of them.\nIn the case of Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty[1], at page 762, Lord Penzance is reported as saying:\nI am, therefore, of opinion that if a publication, either standing alone, or taken in connection with other circumstances, is reasonably capable of a libellous construction, it is for a jury, and not for the court, to say whether a libellous construction should be put upon it. The question not being what a court of law might understand by it, but what inferences the class of people to whom it is addressed would draw from the language used, it is properly and essentially a question of fact, and as such properly devolves upon a jury.\nAnd Lord Blackburn in his speech at page 775, after reviewing the law on the question of libel or no libel as it stood before the passage of Fox's Act says in his speech:\nBut though no doubt the court has more power to set aside verdicts in civil cases, there is no reason why the functions of the court and jury should be different in civil proceedings for a libel, and in criminal proceedings for a libel. And accordingly it has been for some years generally thought that the law, in civil actions for libel, was the same as it had been expressly enacted that it was to be in criminal proceedings for libel.\nIt certainly had always been my impression that there was a difference between the position of the prosecutor, or plaintiff, and that of the defendant. The onus always was on the prosecutor or plaintiff to shew that the words conveyed the libellous imputation, and if he failed to satisfy that onus, whether he had done so or not, being a question for the court, the defendant always was entitled to go free. Since Fox's Act at least, however the law may have been before, the prosecutor or plaintiff must also satisfy a jury that the words are such, and so published, as to convey the libellous imputation. If the defendant can get either the court or the jury to be in his favour, he succeeds. The prosecutor, or plaintiff, cannot succeed unless he gets both the court and the jury to decide for him.\nNow, it seems to me that when the court come to decide whether a particular set of words published under particular circumstances are or are not libellous, they have to decide a very different question from that which they have to decide when determining whether another tribunal, whether a jury or another set of judges might, not unreasonably, hold such words to be libellous.\nIn the later case of Australian Newspaper Co. v. Bennett[2], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reviewed the law on the subject of the respective functions of courts and juries in actions of libel and the Lord Chancellor, Herschell, in delivering the judgment of that Committee said, at page 287 :\nIt is not disputed that, whilst it is for the court to determine whether the words are capable of the meaning alleged in the innuendo, it is for the jury to determine whether that meaning was properly attached to them. It was, therefore, the province of the jury in the present case to determine whether the words used were written of the plaintiff, and whether they bore the defamatory sense alleged.\nWindeyer J. observed in the course of his judgment that he admitted that the court would only be justified in reversing the finding of the jury \"if their decision upon that point is such as no jury could give as reasonable men.\" This is a correct statement of the law. Their Lordships have not, any more than the court below had, to determine in the present case what is the conclusion at which they would have arrived, or what is the verdict they would have found. The only point to be determined is, whether the verdict found by the jury, for whose consideration it essentially was, was such as no jury could have found as reasonable men.\nThe judgment of the court below was founded on the use of the word \"Ananias.\" Windeyer J. has expressed the opinion that only one meaning could be attributed to that word, that every one must understand it to impute wilful and deliberate falsehood, and that therefore the mere use of the word \"Ananias\" which necessarily involves such an imputation, could not reasonably be held to be innocent, or to be otherwise than intended to cast this imputation upon the plaintiff. Even admitting that the natural effect of the use of the word \"Ananias,\" standing alone would be to convey the imputation suggested, the learned judge appears to their Lordships, with all respect,, to have lost sight of the fact that people not unfrequently use words, and are understood to use words, not in their natural sense, or as conveying the imputation which, in ordinary circumstances, and apart from their surroundings, they would convey, but extravagantly, and in a manner which would be understood by those who hear or read them as not conveying the grave imputation suggested by a mere consideration of the words themselves. Whether a word is, in any particular instance, used, and, would be understood as being used, for the purpose of conveying an imputation upon character must be for the jury.\nApplying to the case before us the law as I understand to be laid down alike by the House of Lords as by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, I am of the opinion that the jury having under all the circumstances of this case found a verdict for the defendants, it would be exceeding the legitimate function of this court if such verdict was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court would then in reality be taking upon itself the function which the law has committed to the jury of looking at the alleged libellous matter as a whole and determining whether under all the facts and circumstances as proved before them it is defamatory of the plaintiff.\nIdington J.\u2014At first I was inclined to think the letter complained of might be read as one of those ambiguous productions not necessarily meaning much or of as serious import as respondent alleges.\nHowever, the word price is an ugly one and it seems on reflection hard to give another meaning to it than respondent claims. And it is by no means clearly intended in this production to have been synonymous with the word consideration, which is used later and clearly might be ambiguous if it stood alone.\nThe evidence of the appellant's manager seems clearly to lead to but one inference of how he as a bystander interpreted this language.\nThe court below seems to have been unanimous as is frankly admitted by counsel in taking the same view.\nI do not think in face of all parties concerned, but the jury so reading the letter, I ought to say the jury may have been right after all.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed. The function of a court of appeal in passing on an application to set aside the verdict of a jury in an action for libel where the only issue is whether the publication complained of is libellous and the defendant has succeeded, has been thus described by the Judicial Committee in Australian Newspaper Co. v. Bennett[3]:\nWhether the verdict found by the jury, for whose consideration it essentially was, was such that no jury could have found as reasonable men.\nTheoretically, therefore, the function of the court of appeal in such cases does not materially differ from its function in any application to set aside a verdict of a jury as against the weight of evidence, as that expression has been explained and applied in modern cases. In determining the question, however, the court has always in actions for libel regarded the opinion of a jury that the publication complained of is not libellous as of the greatest weight. The point in all such cases is: Do the words convey, that is, would sensible persons reading them in the locality in which the publication was circulated regard them as conveying, an imputation damaging to the character of the plaintiff? If the jury think they do not convey such an imputation that, of course, is not necessarily conclusive. The imputation may be so plain that no reasonable persons could take the view of the jury, and in that case the court may act. But the question of the effect of words in their bearing upon reputation in the locality from which the jury is taken is one of those perhaps upon which a jury ought to be most qualified to speak. So much weight has been given to this circumstance that for nearly sixty years there appears to be only a single reported instance of a verdict for a defendant having been set aside in England on the ground that the language of the publication was necessarily defamatory; and in that instance the question of libel or no libel had been left to the jury, although the libellous character of the words had been admitted by the pleadings. In Wills v. Carman[4], at page 225, a most able and experienced judge, Armour C.J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, went so far as to say:\nAccording to the usual practice of this court new trials are not granted in actions of libel such as this, merely on the ground that the verdict is against the evidence and the weight of evidence. It is for the jury to say whether alleged defamatory matter published is a libel or not, and the widest latitude is given to them in dealing with it.\nThere are two grounds upon which it is contended that the jury in this case has failed to do its duty. It is said first that the publication manifestly imputes an offence against the \"Dominion Elections Act,\" and secondly, that it plainly charges the plaintiff with having withdrawn his name from a liberal nominating convention where the members desired to nominate him, as the result of an arrangement through which he was to receive some personal benefit for doing so.\nAs to the first of these contentions, it is to be observed that the question is : What is the meaning of the words ? Not what did the writer intend to convey by them, still less on what grounds did the writer think they might be justified. (Hulton & Co, v. Jones[5], at pages 23 and 24, per Lord Loreburn.) Now the contention is that the words convey a charge that the respondent was guilty of an offence under the \"Dominion Elections Act,\" ch. 6, sec. 265(g), or section 265 (i). The first of these sub-sections was not, I think, relied upon by Mr. Mellish, and we may eliminate it from the discussion. The second is that relied upon by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. The offence which this letter is said to charge is that somebody offered to give or procure him an office, place or employment if he should not become a candidate and that by accepting the office and refraining from presenting himself for nomination he became a party to the offence. Nobody, of course, pretends that the words in themselves in their natural and ordinary meaning convey any such imputation. The whole contention is based upon the circumstance that the manager of the defendant company in an affidavit filed to procure an adjournment of the trial had stated his intention of procuring evidence (in support of his plea of justification) to shew that Dr. Kendall had acted upon an arrangement that he should be appointed to the Senate of Canada. This affidavit, in my view, is not of the least, value upon the question the jury had before them. Nobody disputes that the defendant was entitled, in addition to his plea of justification, to dispute the libellous character of the publication; and it is, I think, a most novel suggestion to say that because words may be justified by proof of a criminal offence, they can on that ground alone be held to impute one. A father informs his friends that he will not permit his son to associate with a given person; his reason for doing so is that he believes that person to be a criminal. Does that make his words actionable per se? If he is sued may he not at the same time deny the words to be actionable and in the alternative allege that plaintiff is a thief?\nOn this point not only do I think the verdict of the jury not unreasonable, but I think it right. The words do not, in my opinion, on any fair construction convey the suggested imputation. On the second point there is much more to be said; but without expressing my own view as to the meaning of the words (which would perhaps not be material on point at issue), it seems to me to be impossible to say that the words are incapable of an innocent construction.\nDr. Kendall the letter states was a public man whom a majority of a liberal convention wished to nominate as the liberal candidate at the election of 1904. Then it is said that he refused to allow his name to go before the convention; and that is commented upon in this passage:\nThe Doctor had a great deal to say of the elections in 1904. Well, I have some recollections of that contest myself, and I ask the Doctor: Why did you at that time withdraw your name from the liberal convention? The majority of the delegates came there to see you nominated? Why did you not accede to their request? Doctor Kendall, what was your price? Did you get it? Take the good liberals of this county into your confidence and tell them what happened in those two awful hours in a certain room in the Sydney Hotel that day?\nThe proceedings of the convention were held up for no reason that the delegates saw, but for reasons which are very well known to you and three or four others whom I might mention. One speaker after another killed time at the Alexandria Hall while you were in dread conflict with the machine. Finally the consideration was fixed and you took off your coat and shouted for Johnston. What was that consideration?\nThis passage does no doubt imply the allegation that there was an arrangement between Dr. Kendall and what is called \"the machine,\" by which Dr. Kendall was to receive a consideration for withdrawing, and that Dr. Kendall withdrew, and that he then supported the candidature of Mr. Johnston. Does this necessarily involve a disgraceful imputation? I do not think anybody would suggest that were it not for the use of the words \"price\" and \"consideration.\" It is said that these words imply that the arrangement included a provision for bestowing upon Dr. Kendall personally some profit or material benefit in return for the withdrawal of his name or his support of Mr. Johnston. I do not think that is necessarily so. In the language of political controversy the words \"price\" and \"consideration\" are constantly used, with perhaps some rhetorical exaggeration, to characterize concessions of a purely political nature involved in political arrangements; without any idea of conveying and without conveying any imputation damaging to personal character. Illustrations of this would immediately occur to any intelligent person.\nTherefore, I think the jury were not bound to hold that the language in question here involves the charge that there was anything sordid in the conduct of the respondent, or that the concession made to him was of such a nature as that, in acting upon it as he is alleged to have acted on the occasion in question, he was necessarily playing a dishonourable part.\nAnglin J.\u2014If the publication of which the plaintiff complains were reasonably susceptible of any construction not defamatory, I would agree that the verdict for the defendants should not have been disturbed.\nThe question, therefore, is whether in all the circumstances it can be said that a jury of reasonable men could not possibly find that the article, although it contains that which had much better not have been published, did not reflect upon the plaintiff's character. Australian Newspaper Co. v. Bennett[6], at page 289.\nCounsel for the appellants pressed upon us as reasonably possible one or two constructions of the letter published by the appellants \u2014 such as that it might be taken to mean that the plaintiff had withdrawn his candidature on a previous occasion in order to prevent the disastrous consequences of a split in his own political party upon some sort of understanding more or less definite that his doing so would be to his own political advantage in the future\u2014which would rather redound to the credit of the plaintiff than prove injurious to him. But, having regard to the manifest purpose of the letter before us to injure and discredit the plaintiff, then a prospective Parliamentary candidate, apparent to everybody who read it, I have no doubt that the words complained of are not susceptible of any construction which is not defamatory. To charge that a political candidate in such circumstances withdrew his candidature for a consideration or a price (the interrogative form in which it is couched does not render the charge less plain or pointed) is to impute to him, if not the making of a corrupt and criminal bargain, at least that he was a party to a discreditable transaction. The question is not what readers of the letter would believe of the plaintiff, but what they would understand the writer to charge. That, I think, admits of no doubt. Publication having been conclusively proven, in the absence of any defence whatever the verdict for the defendant was, in my opinion, clearly\nperverse and so unreasonable as to lead to the conclusion that the jury have not honestly taken the facts into their consideration,\nO'Brien v. Marquis of Salisbury[7], at page 137, \"was such as no jury could have found as reasonable men.\" Australian Newspaper Go. v. Bennett[8], at page 287. The cases of Levi v. Milne[9] and Hakewell v. Ingram[10], have never been overruled and are cited by Mr. Odgers in a late edition (1905) of his work on Libel, at page 654, as unquestioned authority for the proposition that:\nA new trial will, however, be granted when the matter complained of is clearly libellous, and there is no question as to the fact of publication, or as to its application to the plaintiff, and yet the jury have perversely found a verdict for the defendant, in spite of the summing up of the learned judge.\nSee also Folkard on Libel (1908), page 317. To quote the language of Best C.J.:\nIf the jury were to be made judges of the law as well as of fact, parties would be always liable to suffer from arbitrary decisions. * * * Being clear that the publication in question is a libel I am of the opinion that the rule for a new trial should be made absolute. 4 Bing. 195, at pages 199, 200.\nThe right to grant a new trial in a libel action where the verdict, though in favour of the defendant, is incontrovertible wrong is affirmed in Parmiter v. Couplarid[11].\nThese authorities have never been overruled. No case has been cited, and, so far as I can discover, there is no reported case in which the court, although of opinion that a verdict importing \"no libel\" was clearly perverse and the document in question indubitably not susceptible of any but a libellous meaning, nevertheless refused a new trial on the ground that in libel cases a verdict for the defendant upon such an issue is always conclusive.\nSuch dicta as that of Lord Blackburn in Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty[12] should not, I think, be. taken to mean more than that, where the defendant has had a verdict the court cannot upon appeal enter judgment for the plaintiff however clear the libel, and may give him no greater relief than a new trial, because in order to succeed the plaintiff must \"get both the court and the jury to decide for him.\"\nI fully appreciate the reluctance of the courts to interfere with verdicts of juries in libel cases. But where, as here, the defamatory character of the publication does not admit of dispute, the order for a new trial should not be disturbed.\nI would, therefore, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

An Act of the legislature authorized the purchase of the site and a special tax for its cost and future maintenance of the library. The City Council invited tenders for plans of the building and accepted that of C. Bros. & Co. The scheme, however, fell through, the money offered was not paid nor the library built. C. Bros. & Co. sued the city for the cost of their plans.\nHeld, that the city had no authority to enter into any contract involving the expenditure of municipal funds in respect to the said building and the action could not be maintained.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs and increasing the amount thereby awarded.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nO'Connor K.C. and Finlay McDonald for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents. GIROUARD J. agreed with Duff J.\nDavies J.\u2014For the reasons given by Chief Justice Townshend, who dissented from the judgment rendered by the majority of his colleagues I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts. I desire to add a few words.\nI am quite unable to agree with the reasons of Mr. Justice Drysdale, concurred in by a majority of the court appealed from, that the special Act relating to the proposed Carnegie Library \"conferred upon the defendant corporation legislative authority to erect a public library, purchase a site therefor, and assess to the limit mentioned for its annual maintenance.\"\nThe enacting part of the statute is strictly confined to authorizing the Town of Sydney to include in the estimates of the amount required for the general purposes of the town, f 1,900 per annum for three years, to be expended in the purchase of a site of a free public library in Sydney, and an annual sum of $1,500 for the support and maintenance of the library when built.\nThe preamble recited the reason for the grant of these limited powers to the corporation. They were substantially that Andrew Carnegie \"had donated to the town the sum of $15,000 for the erection of a free public library, conditioned on the Town of Sydney contributing annually towards its support $1,500 and that the ratepayers \"had approved of the acceptance of the said gift\" and of the expenditure of $5,700 for the purchase of a site.\nAs a fact the gift of $15,000, for reasons unnecessary to refer to, was never paid by Mr. Carnegie or received by the corporation. If the money had been paid over and received there might possibly have been implied the necessary powers to expend it for the purpose given and to authorize the creation on the part of the corporation of a liability which could be enforced against it. But whether that would be so or not we have not to determine. The money never was paid over and no implication of legislative authority to erect a library at the expense of the citizens of the town could in my judgment possibly be implied from the statute in question.\nIn this view of the case it is unnecessary for me to say anything on the point raised and argued by Mr. O'Connor that whether the city corporation had the power to do so or not they never did as a fact enter into any contract with the plaintiff.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is a municipal corporation to which a proposal had been made if it furnished a site for a library that Mr. Carnegie would donate fifteen thousand dollars to erect a building thereon.\nThe promoters of the scheme induced the legislature to confer upon appellant's council the power to buy the site needed and to levy the price thereof and an annual sum named for maintenance.\nWithout a vestige of authority beyond this it is contended there was implied therein the power to tax the ratepayers to pay for plans and specifications, although in the face of the transactions involved the cost thereof was to come out of the said fifteen thousand dollars if and when received, and as the scheme fell through, never was received.\nThere is not, so far, as I can see the slightest ground for any such implication. There was never a legal duty imposed upon the municipal authorities to do anything relative to procuring or building or maintaining a library. If some such duty had existed then the acts relied upon, though done by a committee possessing no legal right to create any such liability, but which made a report which was adopted by the council, might have lent some colour to this suggestion of implication.\nIn the entire absence of any such duty the council's authority did not extend beyond the mere exercise, when it saw fit, of the limited power given.\nBut on the face of this report relied upon and said to have been adopted by the council as if that would add to the council's powers, no final determination or acceptance of such plans and specifications appears.\nIndeed, the contrary is implied.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed. It is conceded very properly by Mr. Newcombe that the authority of the municipal council to pledge the credit of the municipality in respect of payments for the services of the respondents must be derived from the Act of 1903, ch. 169; and that no such power being expressly conferred by that statute it can only be found in such implication as is necessary to give effect to the objects of the statute. I do not think there is anything in the enactment implying such authority. The statute authorizes the purchase of a site for a library and the levying of the cost of it within a specified limit and of a specified annual grant as a part of the ordinary taxation of the inhabitants. The Act is passed upon the assumption, as the preamble shews, that the necessary funds to defray the cost of erecting a building are at the disposal of the municipality; and it was manifestly not the design of the legislature by this statute to authorize the levying by taxation of the moneys required for that purpose. The legislature did obviously contemplate the erection of a building to be used for housing a library and I think in view of the preamble it is fair to say that the municipality was expected to undertake the administration of the fund in hand for that purpose. But while it might be a convenient thing that in such circumstances the municipality should have power to enter into contracts by which its general credit should be pledged\u2014that was by no means necessary to enable it effectively to apply the fund for the purpose of attaining the object in view. In the absence of such necessity there is, in my opinion, no satisfactory foundation for the implication which the court below has drawn from the provisions of the Act.\nAnglin J.\u2014It is not a reasonably necessary and, therefore, in my opinion, in this case not a proper implication from the statute passed by the Nova Scotia Legislature (3 Edw. VII. ch. 169) that the corporation of the Town of Sydney was clothed with authority to make any expenditure or to incur any liability for or in connection with the projected building for a library \u2014 at all events until the sum of f 15,000 promised for that purpose by Mr. Andrew Carnegie had been placed at its disposal. In the absence of such legislative authorization, the municipal corporation lacked the power to enter into the contract sued upon. On this short ground I think this appeal must be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Finlay McDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. H. Covert.\n"}

(1900) c. 163, ss. 22 and 27\u2014Secondary evidence\u2014Ejectment\u2014Mesne profits.\nSection 27 of the \"Evidence Act\" of Nova Scotia (R.S.N.S. (1900) ch. 163) provides that \"a copy of a notarial act or instrument in writing made in Quebec before a notary public, filed, enrolled or enregistered by such notary and certified by a notary or prothonotary to be a true copy of the original, thereby certified to be in his possession as such notary or prothonotary, shall be received in evidence in any court in place of the original, and shall have the same force and effect as the original would have if produced and proved.\"\nAnd by the first two sub-sections of section 22 it is provided that: \u2014\n\"The probate of a will or a copy thereof certified under the hand of the registrar of probate or found to be a true copy of the original will, when such will has been recorded, shall be received as evidence of the original will, but the court may, upon due cause shewn upon affidavit, order the original will to be produced in evidence, or may direct such other proof of the original will as under the circumstances appears necessary or reasonable for testing the authenticity of the alleged original will, and its unaltered condition and the correctness of the prepared copy.\"\n\"(2) This section shall apply to wills and the probate and copies of wills proved elsewhere than in this province, provided that the original wills have been deposited and the probate and copies granted in courts having jurisdiction over the proof of wills and administration of intestate estates, or the custody of wills.\"\nHeld, that a copy of a will executed before two notaries in the Province of Quebec under the provisions of article 834 C.C. certified by one of said notaries to be a true copy of the original in his possession, is admissible in evidence on the trial of an action of ejectment in Nova Scotia, as provided in section 27. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff brought action to recover possession of a lot of land in Sydney, C.B., which he claimed as devisee under the will of one George I. Bradley, of Montreal, Que. The defendant set up a title by possession, and also claimed a large sum in payment for improvements and disbursements.\nThe plaintiff proved the title of George I. Bradley and tendered in evidence a copy of his will certified by a notary of Montreal. The will purported to be in authentic form and executed before two notaries as required by article 843 of the Quebec Civil Code. The trial judge admitted the copy as proof of the will, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the lot and mesne profits for nine years, also allowing defendant his claim for improvements. This judgment was affirmed by the full court in Nova Scotia which held, however, that plaintiff could only recover mesne profits for the period in which the title was in him and the defendant's claim should be limited to the same space of time. This would give plaintiff more than was allowed at the trial, but as there was no cross-appeal the latter amount stood.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, claiming that the copy of the will was improperly admitted in evidence, and that his claim should be allowed as settled at the trial.\nO'Connor K.C. and A. D. Gunn for the appellant. Finlay McDonald for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington. Davies J.\u2014The will, the admissibility of which in evidence was in question, in this case, was executed in the Province of Quebec before two notaries public in manner and according to the requirements of article 843 of the Civil Code of that province.\nIt was known to the law of Quebec as an \"authentic will\" and remained of record with one of the witnessing notaries as an original document as required by article 844.\nNo probate was contemplated or could be made of such a will when filed or remaining with the notary.\nThere are two other classes of wills which may be made pursuant to the Code, namely, holograph wills and \"those made in the form derived from the laws of England,\" article 842.\nThese two latter classes of wills must be probated as provided by article 857 and special provision seems to be made for the probating of wills found amongst testator's effects after his death. Section 1367 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe 27th section of the \"Evidence Act\" of Nova Scotia provides as follows:\nA copy of a notarial act or instrument in writing made in Quebec before a notary public, filed, enrolled or enregistered by such notary and certified by a notary or prothonotary to be a true copy of the original, thereby certified to, be in his possession as such notary or prothonotary, shall be received in evidence in any court in place of the original, and shall have the same force and effect as the original would have if produced and proved.\nA copy of the will in question in this case duly certified by the notary with whom it was recorded to be a true copy of the original in his possession as such notary, was offered in evidence at the trial of this cause. It came within the very words of the statute, being a notarial act or instrument in writing made in the Province of Quebec before a notary public and filed and enrolled by him.\nIt appeared on its face to have been executed in compliance with the formalities required by the laws of Nova Scotia respecting wills, otherwise it would not have any effect upon the disposition of lands in that province purported to have been made by it.\nThe section of the \"Evidence Act\" above quoted, enacts that such certified copy\nshall be received in evidence in any court in place of the original, and shall have the same force and effect as the original would have if produced and proved.\nNo language could, in my opinion, be plainer alike as to right to put the certified copy in evidence and as to its effect when so received.\nIt is to \"have the same force and effect as the original would have if produced and proved.\"\nThe certified copy of the will was admitted in evidence and the judgment of the Supreme Court now in appeal held that it was rightly so received and that it had the full effect prescribed by the section above quoted.\nThe argument of Chief Justice Townshend, who dissented from the judgment, was based upon the grounds that the section relied on made no specific mention of \"wills\" and that these instruments are fully dealt with by section 22, sub-sections 1 and 2.\nThe section reads:\nThe probate of a will or a copy thereof certified under the hand of the registrar of probate or found to be a true copy of the original will, when such will has been recorded, shall be received as evidence of the original will, but the court may, upon due cause shewn upon affidavit, order the original will to be produced in evidence, or may direct such other proof of the original will as under the circumstances appears necessary or reasonable for testing the authenticity of the alleged original will, and its unaltered condition and the correctness of the prepared copy.\nSub-section (2) This section shall apply to wills and the probate and copies of wills proved elsewhere than in this province, provided that the original wills have been deposited and the probate and copies granted in courts having jurisdiction over the proof of wills and administration of intestate estates, or the custody of wills.\nThis sub-section 2 only refers to wills proved elsewhere than in Nova Scotia, which have been probated in courts having jurisdiction over the proof of wills, etc., and therefore would cover the two classes of wills executed in Quebec, namely, holograph wills and \"wills made in form derived from the law of England.\"\nIt does not, however, cover \"wills in notarial or authentic form\" filed or remaining with the notary before whom it was received such as the one in question, the probating of which is not contemplated by the Code.\nThese latter are, in my opinion, clearly covered by section 27 of the \"Evidence Act\" as \"notarial acts or instruments filed, enrolled or enregistered\" by a notary.\nThe Chief Justice seemed to be of the opinion that if this certified copy of the will was admitted \"transfer of land could be made without any record in the province and without any of the proofs required by our (N.B.) statute for authenticating the due execution of wills.\"\nBut that is not so. \"Authentic wills must be made as originals remaining with the notary,\" article 844. They must conform to all the special prescribed requirements of that and the following articles, and so far as they make any disposition of land in Nova Scotia they must conform to the proofs of the statutory law in that province relating to the due execution of wills. The intention of the legislature seems to be plain that so far as wills executed in Quebec in \"notarial or authentic form\" are concerned, and which cannot be probated there, they fall within section 22, which latter section clearly does not cover such authentic wills as the one here in question.\nI agree with the disposition of \"mesne profits\" made by the court below and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014Two questions are raised by this appeal.\nThe appellant claims he is not liable as he has been found for mesne profits and is entitled to full value for improvements he had made on land in question before action brought.\nI think the learned trial judge's findings of fact upheld by court below cannot be disturbed.\nOn such findings I do not see any legal error.\nThe other point is that the proof accepted, of the will made in Quebec and under and by virtue of which the plaintiff claimed, was inadmissible, and even if admissible insufficiently proven.\nThe will was certified by one of the Quebec notaries by whom it was drawn up and before whom it was executed and in whose hands it had been as usual in that province left after execution.\nThe will never was admitted to probate.\nIt is urged that unless and until so admitted this action cannot succeed.\nIn the \"Evidence Act\" of Nova Scotia there are two enabling sections to overcome the difficulty of adducing proof by secondary evidence relative to documents which it is physically impossible or highly inconvenient to produce at trial or even within the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe first, being section 22 of said Act relative to wills, is as follows:\nThe probate of a will or a copy thereof certified under the hand of the registrar of probate or found to be a true copy of the original will, when such will has been recorded, shall be received as evidence of the original will, but the court may, upon due cause shewn upon affidavit, order the original will to be produced in evidence, or may direct such other proof of the original will as under the circumstances appears necessary or reasonable for testing the authenticity of the alleged original will, and its unaltered condition and the correctness of the prepared copy.\nSub-section (2). This section shall apply to wills and the probate and copies of wills proved elsewhere than in this province, provided that the original wills have been deposited and the probate and copies granted in courts having jurisdiction over the proof of wills and administration of intestate estates, or the custody of wills.\nThe first sub-section just quoted never could have been of use for such purpose as here in question.\nThe second sub-section makes it applicable to wills though it seems to contemplate probates only. But pass that it makes it applicable only where \"the original wills have been deposited and the probate and copies granted in courts having jurisdiction,\" etc.\nWhen this was first enacted there was impossibility in some cases not unlikely of occurrence to get probate in Quebec at all. 2 Edw. VII. ch. 37 (Quebec), helped to overcome this.\nI will not say it would now be impossible to get probate of any will in Quebec. But of what good?\nA probate is but prim\u00e0 facie evidence of the authenticity of a will.\nIt is liable after probate to be attacked and. set aside.\nIn Quebec the practice of observing the form of having documents executed before a notary or notaries and the system of law recognizing such officials and constituting the documents so executed authentic is the legal equivalent of the probate. Hence wills made in authentic form are not as Chief Justice Townshend fears if recognized likely to become a source of fraud or danger any more than probates in another country.\nThe authentication by a public official in the one case accompanies the act done and precedes and in the other succeeds the death of the testator.\nIt is, I take it, recognizing such a condition of things that the Legislature of Nova Scotia enacted as follows by section 27 of said Act:\nA copy of a notarial act or instrument in writing made in Quebec before a notary public, filed, enrolled or enregistered by such notary and certified by a notary or prothonotary to be a true copy of the original, thereby certified to be in his possession as such notary or prothonotary, shall be received in evidence in any court in place of the original, and shall have the same force and effect as the original would have if produced and proved.\nIt was, I rather think, from a comparison of article 1215 of the Civil Code of Quebec taken therefrom and adapted to what was needed in Nova Scotia relative to transactions in Quebec.\nThere is nothing inconsistent between these two sections, Nos. 22 and 27.\nIndeed, I venture to submit there is nothing difficult or dangerous in permitting operation being given to both and more that there are possible cases even where English law prevails in which probate of a will dealing only with land and not naming an executor may be impossible and a third section covering this ground would be advisable legislation for Nova Scotia.\nAs to Quebec, where the will is not authentic probate undoubtedly can be got and this section 27 is only as to notarial acts or instruments in writing and leaves others, for which the safeguards of notaries does not vouch, untouched and to fall under the 22nd section.\nThere is this to be observed as possibly wanting in this case at the trial. Some proof of the Quebec law as to notaries and their practice of retaining wills so as to render it physically impossible to produce them, perhaps had better have been given to enable the secondary evidence to be admitted.\nThe nature of the objections as appearing on this record leaves it doubtful if the point was taken.\nFortunately, assuming it was inasmuch as we can here (see case of Logan v. Lee[1]) take judicial notice of the law that such was the case the objection falls.\nI think the section 27 applies herein and is quite sufficient to cover the other objections taken.\nI agree in the reasoning of Mr. Justice Russell, which covers points I have not touched upon.\nAppeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. concurred with Idington J.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am of opinion that, under section 22 of R.S.N.S. ch. 163, it was proper to receive the notarial copy of the will of Geo. J. Bradley in evidence and to act upon it without further proof of its authenticity, validity or due execution in conformity with the requirements of the law of Nova Scotia as to wills disposing of real property. I agree with Mr. Justice Russell that\nIf this section had been intended merely to say that the original document should be received in evidence valeat quantum it might well have closed with the phrase directing that it should be received in evidence in place of the original. In that case the question might still be left open whether, although admissible in evidence and effectual for some purpose, it could be effectual to operate on the title to land in this province. * * * It (the notarial copy) is to have the same force and effect as the original would have if produced and proved. Proved how? Proved to have been executed in the manner in which it purports to have been executed. The language might have been more explicit, but I think it means nothing if it does not mean this.\nI further think that the language of the statute means that the notarial copy is to be deemed not merely evidence of an original document, in the terms of the copy, having been duly executed as the copy purports to shew, but also prim\u00e0 facie proof of an original instrument otherwise valid.\nI am also of opinion that the provisions of section 27 do not apply to a Quebec notarial will, which this was. Probate of such a will is not required in Quebec. If section 27 were applicable, it does not at all follow that its presence in the statute would render section 22 inapplicable. Prescott Election Case[2].\nUpon a perusal of the judgment of the learned trial judge and of the evidence before him I am further of opinion that the plaintiff has received full compensation in respect of his expenditure for improvements.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Rule 2 of the rules of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. provides that \u201cIn addition to these rules, the time-tables will contain special instructions, as the same may be found necessary. Special instructions, not in conflict with these rules, which may be given by proper authority, whether upon the time-tables or otherwise, shall be fully observed while in force.\u201d Trains running out of Brantford, Ont., are under control of the train-despatcher at London. The railway time-table has for many years contained the following foot-note:\u2014\n\u201cTilsonburg Branch.\u2014Yard-engines at Brantford are allowed to push freight trains up the Mount Vernon grade and return to Brantford B. & T. station without special orders from the train-despatcher. Yard-foreman in charge of yard-engine will be held responsible for protecting the return of the yard-engine, and for knowing such engine has returned before allowing a train or engine to follow.\u2014A.J. Nixon, Assistant Superintendent.\u201d\nThis regulation or instruction had not then been submitted for the approval of the Governor-General in Council.\nBy Rule 224 \u201call messages or orders respecting the movement of trains * * * must be in writing.\u201d\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that assuming the foot-note on the time-table to be a \u201cspecial instruction\u201d under Rule 2, it is inconsistent with the train-despatching system in force at Brantford and if, as the evidence indicates, it purports to authorize the sending out of engines under verbal orders to push freight trains up the grade it is also inconsistent with Rule 224. Such instruction has, therefore, no legal operation.\nHeld, per Girouard and Anglin JJ., that it was not a \u201cspecial instruction\u201d but a regulation, and not having been sanctioned by order in council operation under it was illegal.\nBy \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d a \u201ctrain\u201d includes any engine or locomotive. Rule 198 provides that it \u201cincludes an engine in service with or without cars equipped with signals.\u201d\nHeld, per Girouard, Idington and Anglin JJ., that an engine returning to the yard after pushing a train up the grade, is a \u201ctrain\u201d subject to the provisions of Rule 224, and to the rules of the train-despatching system.\nThe accident in this case occurred through the yard-foreman failing to protect the engine on its return to the yard.\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that the company operated the yard-engines under an illegal system and were liable to common law damages and that sub-section 2 of section 427 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d applied.\nHeld, per Duff J., that since, as regards the danger of collision with trains stopping at Brantford for orders, the system of operating the yard-engines through the telegraphic despatchers would clearly have afforded greater protection than that in use, and since there was admittedly no impediment in the way of adopting the former system, there was evidence for the jury of want of care in not adopting the safer system; and the fact that the existing system had been in operation for 25 years was evidence from which the jury might infer that the general governing body of the company was aware of it. And further, following Smith v. Baker ((1891) A.C. 325), and Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall (42 Can. S.C.R. 420), that, in these circumstances, the company was responsible for the defects in the system.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial awarding the plaintiff damages under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d and refusing her common law damages.\nThe material facts are set out in the above head-note.\nGibbons K.C. and G.S. Gibbons for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondents. GIROUARD J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014As far as this court is concerned our late judgment in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[1], lays down the law binding upon us that, as between master and servant, the duty of the former to\nprovide, in the first instance at least, fit and proper places for the workmen to work in, and a fit and proper system and suitable materials under and with which to work\nis one which cannot be got rid of by delegating its discharge to others, and as to which the doctrine of common employment cannot be invoked. I am, therefore, quite prepared to accept the argument of Mr. Gibbons, for the appellant, that if there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding that the death of Fralick, the engine driver, was caused by a defective system in respect of the operation of the defendant company\u2019s trains on the Mount Vernon grade not authorized by the rules sanctioned and approved by the Governor in Council the doctrine of common employment could not be invoked by the company to enable them to escape a liability for which they would but for the application of such doctrine be liable.\nDuring the course of the argument before us a very important question was raised as to the legality of this system which the company had inaugurated some twenty-five years before the accident, and continued down to the present time, of permitting the yard-engine at Brantford under the special circumstances and conditions which existed at this particular spot to push freight trains up the Mount Vernon grade and return to Brantford B. & T. station without special orders from the train-despatcher. That departure from the general system prescribed by the rules seems to have been accepted in the courts below as at any rate not illegal or in conflict with the general rules, the only question raised being whether it was or was not in itself a defective system.\nThe jury found it was defective, exposing the employees to unnecessary danger for the reason that when away from the yard it was not and should have been under the control of the train-despatcher. They further found that the adoption and use of the system was due to the negligence of Superintendent Gillan and yard-master McGuire, and that the collision which caused the death of the engineer, Fralick, was due to McGuire allowing the \u201cengine to leave the yard without protection,\u201d and that the accident would have been prevented if the defects in the system had not existed.\nThe defendant company contended that the system in operation at the place in question was established under an instruction printed on the employee\u2019s time-table and authorized by Rule 2 of the general rules and regulations; that the uncontradicted evidence shewed it to be a good system affording adequate protection; that it had been in force and observed at all necessary times for some twenty-five years without any accident resulting from it; that it was not in conflict with the other general rules, and that, as found by the jury, it was McGuire\u2019s negligence in not protecting the return of the engine as the instructions required him to do, which caused the death of the deceased engineer.\nThe situation at the place where the accident occurred, as I gather it from the factums and plans and the statements of counsel, was somewhat peculiar, but the facts relating to it were not in dispute.\nThe Buffalo and Goderich lines of the Grand Trunk Railway, and the main line to Sarnia tunnel, pass through the City of Brantford. At right angles to these two main lines and running underneath them is the line to Tilsonburg, and, in order to get to the Tilsonburg line, the trains or engines have to go down a steep grade, and by means of a sharp curve switch on to the Tilsonburg branch by means of an under-pass. About seven or eight miles out of Brantford on the Tilsonburg branch is a steep grade known as the Mount Vernon grade, and it frequently happens when freight trains are very heavy on this branch that the yard-engine at Brantford has to assist in pushing trains up this grade. When the yard-engine is required for this purpose the yard-foreman in charge of the engine is required to remain either in the yard, or station on the Tilsonburg branch, or at one of the switches leading down the grade to the Tilsonburg branch to see that no train follows on that branch until his engine has returned from pushing the train up the Mount Vernon grade. The rule in the \u201cemployees\u2019 time-table\u201d governing this and what is put in as exhibit at the trial, is as follows:\nYard-engines at Brantford are allowed to push freight trains up the Mount Vernon grade and return to Brantford B. & T. station, without special orders from the train-despatcher. Yard-foreman in charge of yard-engine will be held responsible for protecting the return of yard-engine, and for knowing such engine has returned before allowing a train or engine to follow.\nOn the morning of the accident the yard-engine at Brantford was in charge of yard-foreman or conductor McGuire, the engine was required to be used as a pusher up the Mount Vernon grade, and the yard-fore- man saw the engine placed at the rear of the train preparatory to starting. After leaving his engine on the Tilsonburg branch, McGuire came up the main line and jumped on a train that was pulling into the Brantford station on the Buffalo and Goderich line, instead of remaining at the switch to protect his engine from any trains that might follow. While doing this he failed to notice a train on the other side of the train on which he had ridden into the station and which was going up the Tilsonburg branch, and, owing to his neglect allowed that train to pass the switch down the Tilsonburg branch, where he should properly have stationed himself to protect his engine until its return, the result being that this engine, in returning, collided with the train which he should have stopped at the switch, and the engineer, Fralick, was killed.\nThe defendant company tendered a large mass of experienced railway men to testify with respect to the adequacy of the system provided on this Tilsonburg branch. After a number of these had been examined the trial judge thought it unnecessary to call further witnesses of the same class. The substance of the evidence given by these railway experts was to the effect that similar systems to that provided for by the instruction at Tilsonburg prevailed on the railways with which they were connected; that it was a good, safe system providing adequate protection and in throwing the responsibility upon one competent man had advantages over systems which divided the responsibility between the train-despatcher and others. No evidence was given to the contrary unless that of element is so considered. His evidence, however, was simply to the effect that yard-engines were controlled in other parts of the defendants\u2019 system by train-despatchers, and that this particular yard-engine could have been so controlled while and when it was used as a pusher on the Mount Vernon grade. He, however, did not venture to say that the existing system was defective or that a double protection of train-despatcher and yardman, involving divided responsibility, would be a better system.\nThe trial judge directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the $3,300 awarded under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d and dismissed the action at common law. The Court of Appeal confirmed his judgment on appeal by the plaintiff on the ground that there was no evidence to justify the jury in finding the system a defective one. Both courts proceeded on the assumption, which apparently was not challenged, that the instruction or rule on the time-table making the yard-foreman responsible for protecting the return of the engine when pushing trains up the Mount Vernon grade and return, without special orders from the train-despatcher and for knowing such engine had returned before allowing a train or engine to follow, was legal in the sense that the company had power to make it and was not inconsistent with the general rules. The only question argued in the courts below with regard to the instruction, as I gather, was whether it inaugurated and sanctioned a defective system of regulating the trains or not.\nIf I had to give my opinion upon the question whether or not the evidence justified the jury\u2019s finding of a defective system I should answer \u201cNo, it did not,\u201d and my judgment would be to maintain that of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal on the appeal to this court. However, a new question was raised and the legality of this instruction was for the first time directly challenged as being in conflict with the general rules which had been approved by the Governor in Council, and were by statute made binding upon all parties. Rule 2 of the \u201cGeneral Rules\u201d under which Mr. McCarthy endeavoured to support the validity of the instruction reads as follows:\nIn addition to these rules the time-tables will contain instructions as the same may be found necessary. Special instructions, not in conflict with these rules, which may be given by proper authority, whether upon the time-tables or otherwise, shall be fully observed while in force.\nIf the instruction in question can be deemed to be a \u201cspecial instruction, not in conflict with the rules,\u201d then the question whether or not the evidence justified the finding of the jury that the system it provided for was defective would necessarily have to be determined on this appeal.\nIf the instruction, however, is determined to be \u201cin conflict with the rules\u201d then, it appears to me, that the question whether it authorized or created a good or bad system is irrelevant and that it offers no defence to the action. See section 311 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nIf the \u201ccontrol of the train-despatcher\u201d over the yard-engine when engaged in pushing a train up Mount Vernon grade was necessary as part of the system authorized by the rules, then the system established under the present authority of Rule 2 would be legally and fatally defective. On this important question I have from the first entertained grave doubts which I cannot say are even now entirely removed.\nIt is, I think, clear that while no rule explicitly declares that the movements of trains are to be under the control of the train-despatcher, it is the general scheme of the rules that they should be so controlled, and it is not unfair to say that any departure from that general scheme must be clearly justified.\nIn the case of the movements and shunting of all yard-engines when in the railway yards or of any engines or cars between semaphores on the line of railway it is conceded that no such control of the train-despatcher is requisite. I take it such control would not be possible. All such movements of trains within railway yards and between semaphore signals on the line are impliedly exceptions from the general scheme. Then comes Rule 2 authorizing special instructions as the same may be found necessary which, I take it, involves departures under special circumstances from the general scheme or system which do not conflict with any particular rule. Any instruction within those rules must be fully observed while in force. No one contends that any instruction under Rule 2 could justify a defective system, and, assuming as I have that the instruction in question here introduced a good and proper system, the only remaining question is: Was it in conflict with the general rules?\nAs the yard-system and the system of shunting between semaphores, though at variance with the general scheme, is nevertheless not in conflict with any special rule and not illegal, so, it seems to me, the system authorized by this instruction, good in itself and not contravening, in my opinion, Rule 450 with regard to movements varying from or additional to the time-table, is not illegal. I think it may fairly be held to come within Rule 2 and, therefore, authorized if not in itself defective.\nMr. Gibbons invoked Rule 224, requiring all messages or orders respecting the movement of trains or the condition of track or bridges to be in writing, as being in conflict with the instruction or system relied upon by the company, but I do not agree with that. Apart from the facts that this rule does not come under the class of Rules 450 and following, relating to the movement of trains by telegraphic orders, there is no finding that the yard-master\u2019s order was not in writing. It must be conceded that the rule does not and cannot apply to the movements of yard-engines in yards and of other engines within semaphores in shunting or otherwise moving trains, and I see no reason why under Rule 2 a special system for special conditions otherwise good and proper could not be introduced without a written order for every movement just as in the case of yard-engines, or engines shunting or moving cars or trains between semaphores.\nMy conclusions are, therefore, that there was no evidence whatever before the jury which would justify their finding the system, under which the engine which caused the accident was operated, a defective system; that there was no particular rule of the general rules of the company, as sanctioned and approved by the Governor in Council, which required an order from the train-despatcher to justify the running of the yard-engine as a pusher up the steep grade at Mount Vernon, although the general scheme of these rules contemplated the movements of trains generally being under the control of the train-despatcher and that Rule No. 2 of those so sanctioned and approved was passed for the purpose of giving the railway authorities power, in exceptional circumstances and conditions such as those existing in this case, to authorize instructions with regard to assisting trains up steep grades such as the one here relied upon. In these circumstances, the common law liability which otherwise would arise as against the company cannot be invoked.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an accidental collision on the respondents\u2019 railway between an engine in charge of Engineer Yapp sent out by a verbal order of the yard-foreman, from Brantford yard, to push a freight train up a grade about seven miles out on the Tilsonburgh branch (and running on its return trip from such service) and a freight train which the yard-foreman had failed to stop. In the result the appellant\u2019s husband was killed.\nThe company admit liability but only within the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act,\u201d for which damages were assessed at $3,300. This is not appealed against. The appellant claimed to recover as at common law and damages on such basis were provisionally assessed at $8,250.\nThe jury found all questions submitted in favour of the appellant, but the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal held she could not in law recover beyond the first named sum.\nThe appeal involves an examination of the law relative to the movements of trains on the respondents\u2019 road.\nThe respondents\u2019 management framed rules for their transportation department, pursuant to the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d then in force and had them so sanctioned by the Governor in Council as to come into force on the first of July, 1901.\nThe Act, as amended by 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 23, rendered it obligatory that all by-laws, rules and regulations made by directors or company should be reduced to writing and, except as to such as related to tolls and such as were of a private or domestic nature and did not affect the public generally, should be submitted to the Governor in Council for approval.\nUnless so sanctioned they are declared to have no effect. The Governor in Council might rescind such sanction or any part thereof. No one else can.\nWhen so approved they were binding upon and to be observed by all persons, and sufficient to justify all persons, acting thereunder.\nRule 2 was as follows:\n2. In addition to these rules, the time-tables will contain special instructions, as the same may be found necessary. Special instructions, not in conflict with these rules, which may be given by proper authority, whether upon the time-tables or otherwise, shall be fully observed while in force.\nMany years before this some one in authority framed a special instruction put upon the time-table and made to read as follows:\nTILSONBURG BRANCH.\nYard-engines at Brantford are allowed to push freight trains up the Mount Vernon grade and return to Brantford B. & T. station, without special orders from the train-despatcher. Yard-foreman in charge of yard-engine will be held responsible for protecting the return of yard-engine, and for knowing such engine has returned before allowing a train or engine to follow.\nA.J. NIXON,\nAssistant Superintendent.\nThe time-tables, no doubt with this, were issued periodically for years before said rules, and the superintendent in charge for some years previous to and at the time of the accident in question adopted and used same form.\nIf it can be made effective merely by such a method the superintendent and his predecessors are the proper authority to issue it. Each time-table which has these instructions upon it is framed so as to lead one to infer it is issued by the sanction of the second vice-president and general manager of the company and other leading officers thereof.\nThere is no provision in it or by its author for orders given under it being reduced to writing. Its later use in that regard is, in the particular case now under inquiry, shewn by what transpired in connection therewith. Yapp, the engineer, says he simply was told by the yard-foreman to take the yard-engine out as he had repeatedly done before on the like service.\nIn view of the evidence of such conduct having extended for years previously I take it none of these incidents of the method had ever varied and that oral orders of the yard-foreman or yard-master were part of the method of applying such instruction.\nAmong the rules above referred to are Rules Nos. 224 and 226, which read as follows:\n224. All messages or orders respecting the movement of trains or the condition of the track or bridges must be in writing.\n226. Extra trains must not be run without an order from the superintendent or train-master.\nAfter the enactment of such stringent rules as these there surely was an end to any shadow of authority for the continuation of such a system.\nIf it ever had any legal existence that was surely abrogated by Rule No. 1, which reads as follows:\n1. The rules herein set forth apply to and govern all roads operated by the Grand Trunk Railway system. They shall supersede all prior rules and instructions in whatsoever form issued which are inconsistent therewith.\nHow can any system dependent on oral order be more \u201cinconsistent\u201d with or \u201cin conflict with\u201d these rules? Rule 1 uses the word \u201cinconsistent,\u201d and Rule No. 2, these latter words. The rules are intended, I take it, from their general scope, to cover, as far as possible, every phase of operating the transportation department of the railway.\nLet us see if anything exists to detract from the force of this glaring \u201cconflict\u201d and \u201cinconsistency.\u201d\nLet us note the statutory meaning of train, and also observe that Rule 198 says:\nWhenever the word \u201ctrain\u201d is used it must be understood to include an engine in service with or without cars, etc.\nAnd, by the same rule,\nextra trains are those not represented on the time-table.\nThen, Rule No. 200 distinguishes extra trains as \u201cpassenger,\u201d \u201cspecial,\u201d \u201cfreight,\u201d \u201cextra\u201d and \u201cwork-train.\u201d\nThe rules above quoted shew the absolute need for orders being in writing and that an \u201cextra,\u201d of which this \u201cworking-train\u201d or engine in charge of Yapp was one, could not run without an order from the superintendent or train-master.\nNeither ever gave any such order as, expressly and implicitly, is here recognized.\nThere is no other method adopted or sanctioned by these rules than the telegraphic method for the movement of trains. Once they are despatched and in motion on their way pursuant to order so given, there is a section of these rules headed, \u201cMovement of Trains,\u201d which provides for their conduct towards each other and in their own movements and the precautions to be taken, but does not provide for their starting otherwise than indicated by telegraph messages.\nIt is in this section that the above quoted Rules 224 and 226 are placed, as if to emphasize their import. Then, we have next after that section, headed in large type \u201cRules for the Movement of Trains by Telegraph Orders.\u201d And in this there are twenty rules and a great many illustrations of how the operations are to be carried on, covering together in all some nineteen pages of the book.\nAmongst those illustrations are given those applicable to \u201cwork-trains,\u201d of which class Yapp\u2019s engine was one.\nThen, take Rule 450 in this section of the rules as an illustration of what is directed generally and is key to the whole situation.\nIt provides for special orders varying from or additional to the time-table. They are to be issued by the train-master.\nThey are not to be used for movements that can be provided for by rule or time-table.\nThe context and heading, as well as the rule above quoted, indicate that they are to be in writing and as emergencies arise, and only permissible of communication by telegraph.\nThis instruction now in question seems to have been just of that character that a time-table could not provide for, but which a rule most certainly could and the rules most certainly had already provided for.\nA rule such as the instruction implies would have required governmental sanction.\nIf such a thing had ever been submitted I cannot believe it ever would have been listened to.\nWhy was the thing of so long standing never tried?\nDoes it not follow from all these considerations that the instruction was in conflict with the rules?\nHow can the rule be conflicted with better than by an implied repeal pro tanto and systematic observance of substituted orders?\nIt is clear that an additional safeguard against accident may well be provided by instructions in this way.\nIf, for example, this instruction could be read as if the action to be taken were upon the hypothesis of a train-despatcher\u2019s order, or a train-master\u2019s order, in writing and this protection supplementary thereto, no harm could follow. It would be consistent with the rule. Such no one pretends to have been the mode of applying it.\nBut how can something which no one pretends to be in itself superior to the safeguard supplied by the telegraphic rules expressly designed to govern the movements of trains be justified?\nIt must never be forgotten an engine is declared to be a train.\nIf an official of any kind can provide thus for one train he may, if he see fit, provide for half a dozen, or more. What limit can be assigned to his power? Clearly if he can take one train he can take every train and substitute an entirely different system. Indeed, counsel for respondent suggested the movement of trains could, if seen fit, be done by telephone.\nI should hope no one, in face of the statute rendering these rules obligatory and the obtaining of the sanction of the constituted authority in that behalf also as a necessarily binding obligation, will, if he regard his personal liberty, try that without such sanction.\nYet that is just, on a large scale, what has been done by some one here on a small scale.\nExperts were able to say what was adopted was, in their opinion, safe. The statute has not left it to experts to determine.\nTrain masters have large authority to exercise over trains, but even they and the superintendent are enjoined to put their orders for such car or extra train in writing; yet this superintendent put his in the shape of an overriding instruction committing the duty to a yard-foreman without more than the printed instruction contains and, apparently, in entire disregard of Rule No. 224 which requires every order respecting the movement of trains to be in writing.\nThe clear inference from the evidence of Yapp, the engineer who took the pilot engine (a train) out, is that any order was oral.\nI think the fair inference is there never was compliance with this Rule 224 so far as regarded the movement of any engine sent out by virtue of these instructions.\nIf all these considerations do not demonstrate this instruction as inconsistent with the purview of the rules as a whole and, hence, in conflict therewith, I do not know what would.\nIndeed, if this method of procedure is permissible, the rules, so far as they can have any relation to the movement of trains, including every detail therein which directly concerns the safeguarding of the public may be frittered away and the obligatory sanction of governmental supervision in that regard reduced to a solemn mockery.\nThis gives rise to more than one point of view in its result.\nIn the first place: Is there not thus created a condition of things that entitles the servant to say (quite independently of the liability directly given by statute, to which I will refer presently), the protection he was entitled to at common law has not been given?\nCan he be said to have contracted against risks which implied a violation of the statutory rules, which have the force of law; yes, a systematic violation?\nIs it not just as clearly this had become an indefensible mode of which the respondents knew or ought or must be taken to have known?\nNo doubt rules had been enacted before and received governmental sanction, but it is to be observed that just at this stage of growth of railway legislation, 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 23, sec. 9, sub-sec. 2, had proposed governmental assistance to frame such rules and, whether given or not, it was something of which the directors of this company must be held to have had notice, and, it might not be unfair to infer, had, as the result, produced the rules before us which govern or ought to have governed this case.\nThe express language of Rule No. 1, as already noted, swept away every previous instruction inconsistent with the new rules.\nWhy was this one retained in use?\nIt surely must have come to the knowledge of the directors revising such work. Its then long use for preceding years clearly implies it was only by crass neglect that it could have been overlooked. Its operation continued nevertheless. Whose duty was it to see that its operation ceased?\nWas it not the duty of the company to have taken steps to protect its servants by expressly prohibiting the use of such an antiquated method? The rules, as I read them, not only sweep away the instruction, but forbid its continuance.\nThe continuation of this instruction was, no doubt, due to neglect on the part of every one, from the directors down to the superintendent.\nIt was, I incline to think, incumbent on the respondent at the trial to have removed the presumption of neglect or ground to infer same on the part of the directors relative to the instruction having been repealed. It may have been that such was done and the evidence of continual and continuous use is untrue. The case of Britannic Merthyr Coal Co. v. David[2], seems to me, in principle, to throw upon the respondents the onus of proof of the condition of things, at this new starting point, and of inference of orders being otherwise than indicated.\nIt may be answered, the directors had done so by inviting its company\u2019s servants to read the new rules. I doubt if that suggestion should suffice to excuse when the thing continues for seven years afterwards and the inconsistencies not pointed out.\nIf this inference is not the proper one to draw, it then comes back to the use of an unjustifiable mode or system for so long a time being, of itself, sufficient, under said conditions, to bring home to the company the knowledge that their servants were not properly protected.\nIf proof were needed, do we not find it in this very case? Who is defending it?\nIt is being justified. If in law, as I have found it, unjustifiable, how can the company say and be permitted to prove it, rely on it, if thus unjustifiable, unless there is to be implied the authority of the company to do that complained of?\nI submit this reasoning in this connection as relative to the line of argument which was presented by the law as laid down in Wilson v. Merry[3], and herein much relied upon, and to overcome the difficulty thereby created.\nIf that difficulty is thus surmounted and the proof brought home to the company of knowledge of negligent, and in this case, in my view, illegal (which quality of illegality adds evidence) methods that case no longer applies and the law as laid down in Smith v. Baker[4] applies.\nThe jury have found, and I must say, after a perusal of the entire evidence bearing upon such issues, most properly found that the defendants\u2019 superintendent was negligent in permitting such a state of things to exist, as to rest upon the obviously imperfect safeguard when the rules provided an obviously safer one.\nThe ability and right of juries to find, as against so-called experts, is criticized in this and another case before us. I dissent therefrom. As the learned trial judge intimated in answer to such contentions, the issues here, (and, I may add, in most cases involving accidents on a railway) are easily understood by men of ordinary common sense.\nThe classes from which juries are drawn are quite as ready as others to appreciate all that and especially the mechanical and other devices so often to be considered, and, with every respect, I may say, a great deal better than others, their superiors in other respects, the habit of thought of, and how much load the brain of, the average workman on the railway can and is likely to carry into effective use.\nIt was this latter factor in this case that failed and the failure of any expert to appreciate that fact and admit the system of the rules was superior to trusting a man loaded as this man was, would condemn the expert, in my humble opinion. I do not read their evidence as a denial of that, but as palliation and excuse.\nThe juryman has his limitations of efficiency, just as others, but he did not fail in this case.\nI have now to point out another ground which, with respect, hardly got full justice done it.\nThe point is taken in a few lines, at the end of the appellant\u2019s factum, that what was done gave a right of action at common law for a breach of a statutory obligation, but the failure to comply with our rules requiring statutes relied upon to be quoted leaves me in doubt as to what was really intended to be raised.\nI agree in the claim put forward that such an action would lie, but, how far does that carry us?\nDoes it get over the doctrine of common employment?\nIt still leaves the superintendent the fellow-servant who committed the breach unless knowledge and consequent authority can be imputed in some such way as I have outlined.\nI doubt if it can be treated as if, as definite and absolute as, a statute for fencing machinery, for examples. I should have liked to have heard argument on this, or, perhaps, what was covered in the defective factum. The \u201cRailway Act\u201d expressly gives the right of action by section 427, sub-section 2.\nIf this is the common law claim made in pleadings, and they are wide enough to cover it, or in the factum equally so, then, it seems to me maintainable and overcomes all the difficulties in the appellant\u2019s way.\nIndeed, it seems conclusive, having regard to the frog-packing case of LeMay v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[5], which arose under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888, being 51 Vict. ch. 29, the forerunner of this Act now in question.\nIt was sought there to have the Act interpreted as if excluding the servant from its benefits, but, the Court of Appeal, upholding the learned trial judge and the Chancery Division, held the servant had the same right under it as any other person\u2014in short, that he was a person.\nThe case of Washington v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[6], upon the same Act and provision, except with regard to a license given not to pack, but in which the point, if the Court of Appeal had erred in the previous case, was still open if the defendant had seen fit to take it and bring it here and to the Privy Council.\nI suspect the reasoning upon which the courts had gone in the earlier case was thought to have rendered this hopeless.\nAs I agree in that and cannot distinguish this case therefrom, I think the appellant entitled thereby to maintain her claim.\nI need not say that it is only upon the ground that I hold the instruction I have dealt with as invalid that this sub-section of section 427 becomes clearly operative.\nThe provision of subject-matter, respecting which the company had power to make rules, when these were made, distinctly enumerated such as to render it applicable here. The rules, though brought into force before this amending sub-section, are, I think, being in force, those which fall within the exact words of the section 427, sub-section 2.\nI do not mean to express or imply any opinion as to the right of action in a like case on the Act as it stood before this amendment, nor do I wish to imply that my opinion of the inconsistency between the instruction and the rules holding former invalid is the only basis upon which the action resting upon the sub-section in question can stand.\nOut of respect I followed the line of conflict forcibly pointed out though not followed up in detail in argument and examined the case from every point of view suggested on either side with such reflections as I could add, but regret the importance attached throughout the entire proceedings to what seems to me, perhaps erroneously, so entirely irrelevant, to the exclusion of that consideration the said sub-section and whatever may be said as to it certainly has seemed to me entitled to.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and judgment be entered for the full amount of damages assessed with costs of suit.\nDUFF J.\u2014I find myself unable to agree that the plaintiff\u2019s claim can be sustained under section 427 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d I am not able to discover any necessary ex facie conflict between the time-table instruction under which McGuire acted and the approved rules. The rules do not in terms declare that the method of moving trains by telegraphic orders is to be the one exclusive method to be employed upon the respondents\u2019 system. I think that omission is a very pointed one. There is sufficient evidence in this case to shew that the practice authorized by the instruction in question is one which has been in operation in dif- ferent places on the system for many years, and if it had been the intention to abolish that practice I should have expected to find an explicit provision to that effect.\nThen there is Rule 224 which requires that all orders for the moving of trains shall be in writing. On the face of it there is certainly nothing in the instruction repugnant to this rule, assuming in the meantime the rule to apply to a yard-engine when outside the limits of its yard. It was suggested on the argument that the instruction necessarily implies the operation of the engine under oral orders from the yard-foreman to the engineman. The instruction itself does not require that the orders shall be given by the yard-foreman. It says nothing about who is to give the orders. If it is to be assumed that the yard-foreman is to be a person not competent to give written instructions\u2014I am afraid that is rather a venturesome assumption for this court\u2014that is a sufficient reason not for reading the instruction as conflicting with one of the rules, but for inferring that the yard-foreman was not the person to give the orders.\nThe evidence is conflicting respecting the origin of the order on the morning of the accident. The engineman says it came from McGuire; McGuire denies this. The impression one gets is that the order was an oral one; but the evidence is not directed to the point and is quite equivocal. Nor is there any evidence as to the practice commonly observed in that regard. Strange to say no such official as a yard-foreman appears to be mentioned in the book of rules produced. If the engineman of the yard-engine when operating under the instruction is to be treated as an \u201cengineman\u201d within the rules, then it is quite clear from Rules 50 and 52 that he is not under the orders of the yard-foreman. I should have thought indeed unless there is something in the circumstances of railway practice generally or of the locality in question here making it obligatory upon us to give to the instruction a different interpretation, that one must read it as subject to the paramount authority of the rules and not as conflicting with them. I am disposed, however, to read the rules governing the movement of trains as not applying to yard-engines except when coupled with one or more cars. I think that where you have two distinct classes of engines mentioned and you have the \u201ctrain\u201d defined to the extent of saying that it shall include one of these classes, that is a sufficient indication that it excludes the other. If it be said that there is nothing in the rules authorizing yard-engines to leave the limits of their yards, the answer seems to be that there is nothing in the rules prohibiting it and that Rule 2 does authorize the giving of special instructions not inconsistent with the rules themselves. I have no doubt that an instruction confined in its application to the yard-engines of a particular station and authorizing the use of those engines in a specified limited service is a special instruction.\nI have perhaps not made it clear that I should not wish to express a confident opinion that an examination of the rules with such light as might be thrown upon them by extrinsic evidence properly admissible, might not shew that the instruction relied upon is one which is in conflict with the approved rules and therefore does not come within the authority conferred by Rule 2. To me it is sufficient for discarding the consideration of the question for the purposes of this appeal that I feel satisfied, first, that the instruction is capable of being read as not in conflict with the rules, and secondly, that I am not satisfied that we have before us all the evidence which might throw light upon the question whether, on the true construction of both, there is any such conflict. It has been repeatedly held that this court will not consider a view of the facts not put forward before if there be any question whether further relevant evidence might have been adduced if it had been advanced at the trial. Lamb v. Kincaid[7]; The \u201cTordenshjold\u201d v. The \u201cEuphemia\u201d[8]. And see Seaton v. Burnand[9]; Nevill\u2019s Case[10]; Browne v. Dunn[11]; City of Victoria v. Patterson[12].\nI have, however, come to the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed upon the ground upon which she placed her case at the trial. With great respect for the courts below, I think there was evidence from which the jury might conclude that the system under which the yard-engine was used beyond the yard limits on the Tilsonburg branch was a system not to be reconciled with the exercise by the appellants of that degree of care they were bound in the circumstances to exercise for the purpose of avoiding collisions on that branch. First, a word about the law. Having regard to the consequences of such a mishap as a collision between trains moving in opposite directions upon a single track line, the defendants, I think, were bound to exercise a very high degree of care to prevent such accidents. They owed that obligation,\u2014as respects the system of managing trains\u2014in my opinion, as well to their servants as to others. If it would be clear to reasonable persons with competent knowledge that by the adoption of one system they would in an appreciable degree enhance the risk of such collisions, or that by the adoption of another system they could in an appreciable degree diminish that risk, and if the adoption of the comparatively safer system would not involve them in any appreciable difficulty or expense in the working of the railway, then, in my judgment, it was their plain duty to adopt the safer system. Now, it is not disputed that by subjecting McGuire\u2019s engine to the orders of the despatcher the company would have brought upon themselves no increased difficulty in management, no appreciably increased expense. The experts called on behalf of the respondents support the system in operation simply because they say the precautions are sufficient. The question of fact then for the jury on this branch was: Did the system in operation involve any unnecessary peril to persons travelling on the Tilsonburg branch, that is to say, any peril which might have been avoided or lessened by placing this yard-engine under telegraphic orders? I do not agree, with great respect, with the learned judges of the courts below that on this point it was the duty of the jury to accept the opinions of the experts. Indeed, I am not confident that if I had been a juryman and the evidence had impressed me as it now impresses me, reading it in the record, I should not have concluded from the evidence of those witnesses that any competent and careful man applying himself to the subject in the course of his duty and with a real appreciation of the responsibility of the company, would have seen that with regard to one class of trains at least there would be a distinct advantage in point of safety by placing the engine in question under the control of the despatcher. With respect to trains obliged to stop at Brantford for orders, I do not think it is seriously disputed that such an accident as that which led to this litigation\u2014although it might conceivably have occurred\u2014could hardly have taken place if the yard-engine and the train had been under the control of the same set of persons. It appears to me that that of itself is sufficient to support the verdict on this branch of the argument. If in respect of a certain class of trains one system affords greater safety than the other, assuming that in respect of all other trains it afford only equal safety, and if this comparatively greater degree of safety can be had without any extra cost, without any disturbance or dislocation of other arrangements, without any added embarrassment or difficulty,\u2014what possible excuse could there be for not adopting the safer system? I think, however, notwithstanding the opinions of the experts, that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding as regards all trains that the telegraphic system is the safer, and that reasonably competent persons ought to have known that.\nThe responsibility of the company for the defects in the system is sufficiently established, in my opinion, by the cases of Smith v. Baker[13], at pages 339, 353 and 364, and Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. Mc-Dougall[14], at pages 424 and 426. The system in question had been in operation for twenty-five years; that, in my judgment, is sufficient to put the onus upon the company to shew that it was not brought home to the general governing body.\nThere remains another contention of Mr. McCarthy\u2014that the plaintiff has not sufficiently con- nected the alleged negligence of the respondents with the collision that caused her husband\u2019s death. The precise point taken, and very forcibly put, is that the proximate cause was the negligence of McGuire. It was, I think, McGuire\u2019s first duty to protect his engine, and, given the system in operation, it was his default unquestionably which led to the accident. I do not think, however, that the case is governed by the principle relied upon by Mr. McCarthy; it seems to be outside the decision in Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins[15], and ought rather to be referred to the principle of a series of cases from which Lord Dunedin distinguished the last mentioned case, at page 646, in this sentence:\nThe duty being to take precaution, it is no excuse to say that the accident would not have happened unless some other agency than that of the defendant had intermeddled with the matter.\nIt is pointed out again and again in the evidence given by the expert witnesses that no system can be devised by which the human element, and therefore the possibility of human error and carelessness, can be excluded. The desideratum is a system which consistently with reasonable efficiency reduces to as low a degree as possible the risks arising from the imperfections of human instruments. The charge against the company is, and the default found is, that they failed to adopt a system which to a much greater degree (and\u2014in the case of trains obliged to stop at Brantford for orders as Fralick\u2019s was\u2014almost entirely) would have eliminated the chances of any lapse such as that which McGuire was guilty of. It is no answer then to say that McGuire was in fault; because it was in not providing a better means of preventing such defaults and avoiding the evil effects of them when they take place that the respondents\u2019 failure of duty consisted.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having obtained judgment for $3,300 under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d the plaintiff appeals from the refusal of the Ontario Court of Appeal, affirming the judgment of Meredith C.J., to direct the entry of judgment for her for $8,250, the amount at which the jury assessed her damages if she should be held entitled to recover at common law for the death of her husband.\nIn my opinion the appellant is entitled to succeed, but on a ground not presented at the trial, or before the Court of Appeal, and, if taken, not at all adequately developed in her factum in this court.\nIn the local working time-table for the middle division of the Grand Trunk Railway System (No. 33), the following \u201cregulation\u201d or \u201cinstruction\u201d (which it should be deemed I shall discuss later) was inserted:\nTILSONBURG BRANCH.\nYard-engines at Brantford are allowed to push freight trains up the Mount Vernon grade and return to Brantford B. & T. station without special orders from the train-despatcher. Yard-foreman in charge of yard-engine will be held responsible for protecting the return of yard-engine, and for knowing such engine has returned before allowing a train or engine to follow.\nWhile returning from pushing a freight train up the Mount Vernon grade, pursuant to a verbal order of yard-foreman McGuire given under this regulation or instruction, the Brantford yard-engine collided with an engine drawing a special train driven by the plaintiff\u2019s deceased husband, who was killed in the collision. This train left Brantford under orders from the train-despatcher at London, given through the operator at Brantford, neither of whom knew that the yard-engine was then out on the Tilsonburg branch. Yard-foreman McGuire did not expect Fralick\u2019s train. Having other urgent duties to perform, after sending out the yard-engine he did not remain at the switch of the Tilsonburg branch, but went to another part of the yard to place some cars at a freight shed. While he was thus engaged, Fralick\u2019s train left the yard without his noticing it.\nThe defendants admit liability under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d in consequence of McGuire\u2019s failure to protect the return of the yard-engine. The jury have found that the system in use on the defendants\u2019 railway is not reasonably safe and adequate, and that it was defective and exposed the employees to unnecessary danger\u2014because the yard or pilot-engine when away was not under the control of the despatcher, and that the accident in which the plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed would have been prevented had there not been such defects in the defendants\u2019 system. They further found that the deceased did not voluntarily undertake the risk to which the defective system exposed him.\nMuch argument was devoted to the questions whether the system under the time-table regulation or instruction above quoted was or was not reasonably safe, and whether the adoption of such a system was or was not per se negligent, having regard to the fact that the entire middle division, including the Tilsonburg branch, is operated under a train-despatching system controlled from London. In the view I take of this case we are not concerned with these questions. But, in the course of his able argument upon them, Mr. Gibbons demonstrated, in my opinion conclusively, that the operation of a yard-engine outside the limits of the yard under such a regulation or instruction as that quoted from the time-table No. 33 rendered ineffectual and useless, on the portion of the railway affected by it, the precautions prescribed by the rules of the train-despatching system and was in conflict with and destructive of the fundamental principle of that system\u2014viz., complete knowledge and control by the train-despatcher (except in cases of such inevitable accidents as engines becoming stalled or trains parting on a grade, for which the approved rules make other suitable provisions) of all movements of every train and engine outside yard limits.\nThe yard-engine while outgoing may be regarded as part of the train which it pushes, and, as such, moving under the train-despatcher\u2019s orders; but, when returning, its movement is solely under the direction of the yard-foreman and if, as happened in this instance, he should fail to discharge his duty, whether through his own fault or through inevitable accident, the elaborate precautions prescribed by the rules of the train-despatching system not only afford no protection to the returning yard-engine or to an outgoing train, but form a veritable trap for the employees in charge of the outgoing train by lulling them into a false sense of security.\nNo expert opinion evidence is necessary upon these matters. These conclusions are so obvious from a simple statement of the train-despatching system and the time-table regulation that a common jury can safely and properly draw them.\nThe findings of the jury in this case\u2014that the system was not reasonably safe but was defective and that it exposed the employees to unnecessary danger, the defect in it being that the yard-engine when away from the yard was not under the control of the despatcher\u2014probably involve a finding that the system of directing the movements of the yard-engine under the time-table regulation or instruction was in conflict with the train-despatching system and destructive of its essential principle. If this is not involved in these findings of the jury, since the learned trial judge reserved to himself\nthe disposition of any question of fact not covered by the jury\u2019s findings, which might be necessary to be found in order to determine the rights of the parties,\nthe Court of Appeal could, and, therefore, this court may make any proper findings not inconsistent with the findings of the jury. The evidence, in my opinion, not only warrants, but renders inevitable, the finding that the operation of a yard-engine outside the yard limits under the sole direction and control of the yard-foreman and without communication with or orders from the train-despatcher was in direct conflict with the rules governing the train-despatching system in force at Brantford and on the Tilsonburg branch, and destructive of the protection which that system was designed to afford to employees operating, and to passengers being carried upon trains leaving Brantford on the Tilsonburg branch.\nThe rules of the transportation department of the Grand Trunk Railway System, produced by the defendants as those in force when the plaintiff\u2019s husband met his death, were sanctioned by the Governor-General in Council under section 217 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888, to take effect on the 1st of July, 1898, or the 1st of August, 1901 (both dates are given in the book produced and, for the present, it is not material which is correct). By section 214 of that statute the company was empowered, subject to the restrictions in this and the special Act contained to make rules and regulations * * * (f) for regulating the travelling upon, or the using or working of the railway.\nBy section 217 the company was obliged to submit such rules and regulations for approval by the Governor General in Council, and it was declared that they should have no force or effect until so approved. When so confirmed they were, by section 220, declared to be binding on all persons. These provisions, amended in immaterial particulars, were continued in the legislation of 1903, and are now found in sections 307, 310 and 311 of chapter 37 of the Revised Statutes of Canada. It is not suggested that the sanction of the rules and regulations so approved and confirmed, or of any part thereof, was ever rescinded (63 & 64 Vict. ch. 23, sec. 9, now R.S.C. [1906], ch. 37, sec. 310 (2)). There is no evidence in the record that the regulation or instruction printed at the foot of time-table No. 33 was ever submitted to or sanctioned by the Governor-General in Council. It appears that it has been upon the time-tables and that the Brantford yard-engine has been operated under it as a freight train \u201cpusher\u201d for about twenty-five years. By consent of counsel, an inquiry was made during the argument of this appeal to ascertain whether any such approval of this regulation or instruction had been obtained, with the result that counsel for the defendants admitted that none could be shewn. Inasmuch as this regulation or instruction is relied upon by the defendants as warranting the movement of the yard-engine, if it required the approval of the Governor-General in Council to render it valid, the burden, in my opinion, rested on the defendants to establish that such approval had been given. I, therefore, proceed upon the assumption that it had not been approved. If not so approved or sanctioned, and if it was a rule or regulation within sections 214, 216 and 217 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888, it was of no force or effect (section 217), and operation under it was illegal. I think it was a regulation intended to govern \u201cthe working of the railway\u201d and that as such the company was obliged to procure the sanction of it by the Governor-General in Council before operating under it.\nMr. McCarthy strongly urged that this foot-note to the time-table should be deemed not a rule or regulation requiring submission to and approval from the Governor-General in Council, but merely a \u201cspecial instruction\u201d within Rule 2 of the \u201cGeneral Rules,\u201d which reads as follows:\n2. In addition to these rules, the time-tables will contain special instructions, as the same may be found necessary. Special instructions not in conflict with these rules, which may be given by proper authority, whether upon the time-tables or otherwise, shall be fully observed while in force.\nAlthough upon the time-table and of local application only, the provision regarding the use and movement of the Brantford yard-engine as a \u201cpusher\u201d was permanent in character and scarcely fell within the description \u201cspecial.\u201d It regulated the \u201cusing or working\u201d of a portion of the railway. It was of such importance that it should, on that account alone, be classified as a rule or regulation rather than as a mere special instruction. It abrogated the rules of the train-despatching system in regard to the yard-engine to which it applied. Upon these grounds I think it required the sanction of the Governor-General in Council.\nBut, if it should, nevertheless, be regarded as a \u201cspecial instruction,\u201d it would be authorized by Rule 2 only if not in conflict with the rules approved by the Governor-General in Council. For reasons which I have already given I regard the conflict between this \u201cinstruction\u201d and the fundamental idea of the train-despatching system as irreconcilable. It is, moreover, inconsistent with the rules of that system. They provide for operating under written orders only; for a record of all such orders; that they should originate with a train-despatcher and should be transmitted through local operators, who are required to write them out, manifolding so as to prepare the necessary number of copies and to repeat back the order to the despatcher\u2019s office. An elaborate system of checks and counter-checks to minimize the possibility of mistakes is provided. All these regulations were set at naught when a yard-foreman was empowered, upon mere verbal order, to send an engine out of the yard without any order from, or even the knowledge of the despatcher or the local operator. Whether it should be regarded as a regulation within the statute, or as a special instruction within Rule 2\u2014the foot-note to time-table No. 33 purports to authorize a practice so utterly inconsistent with the train-despatching system that, in my opinion, it is not susceptible of justification or defence.\nBut, it is said there is nothing in the rules making the use of the telegraphic train-despatching system obligatory and, therefore, that the adoption of the practice which the time-table foot-note purports to authorize was not a breach of the statute. The first of the general rules says that:\nThe rules herein set forth apply to and govern all roads operated by the Grand Trunk Railway system.\nIf this does not suffice to render the use of the tele- graphic train-despatching system obligatory on the defendants\u2014I rather think it does\u2014the fact that they have adopted it for and have applied it to the entire middle division, including the Tilsonburg branch, precludes the possibility of their legally making any regulation or giving any instruction in conflict with that system or with the rules approved for carrying it out.\nIt is not pretended that the foot-note to time-table No. 33 contemplated that the yard-foreman\u2019s orders to the engineman on the yard-engine should be in writing. The form of the foot-note itself, the character of the employee who was to act upon it, and the circumstances in which he was to act all indicate that he was meant to give merely verbal directions. That is the practice which has prevailed and that practice, as followed on the occasion in question, is justified by the defendants. Yet Rule 224 provides that:\nAll messages or orders respecting the movement of trains * * * must be in writing.\nThis rule is not in the group relating to the movement of trains by telegraphic orders. The time-table foot-note seems to have been in direct conflict with it also.\nMr. McCarthy further contended that the yard-engine when executing the movement in question was not a \u201ctrain\u201d within the meaning of the rules, and he referred to Rule 198, which reads, in part, as follows:\nWhenever the word \u201ctrain\u201d is used it must be understood to include an engine in service with or without cars, equipped with signals as provided in Rules 155 and 156.\nThe application of this defining provision to the entire book of rules is questionable. But, if it is generally applicable, the statement that the word \u201ctrain\u201d shall include an engine with certain equipment does not necessarily mean that an engine lacking such equipment is never to be regarded as a train for the purposes of any of the rules. Such interpretative provisions are inapplicable when the context indicates a contrary intention. A contrary intention is abundantly indicated in the rules governing the train-despatching system. The \u201cRailway Act\u201d defines the word \u201ctrain\u201d as including any engine or locomotive. I have no doubt that a yard-engine sent several miles out from its yard limits to push a freight train up a grade forms part of that train while outgoing, and is, when returning alone, itself a train. The rule that a yard-engine is not required to display markers does not necessarily mean that such an engine when employed outside the yard should not display these signals. I rather think this exemption applies only when it is employed in the yard as a yard-engine properly so-called, and that, when sent abroad, for whatever purpose, it should carry markers under Rule 155. But, whether it should or should not display markers when sent out as a \u201cpusher,\u201d I have no doubt that it is then within the provisions of the rules governing the train-despatching system and must be regarded as a train to which those rules apply.\nI, therefore, reach the conclusion that, in operating under the regulation or instruction contained in the foot-note to the middle division time-table, the defendants were contravening section 311 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. [1906], ch. 37), and were doing what was illegal. This renders superfluous any consideration of the intrinsic merits or demerits of the system under which the Brantford yard-engine was operated as a \u201cpusher.\u201d It was argued that this illegal practice was not the proximate cause of the collision in which the unfortunate Fralick was killed; that the sole proximate cause was McGuire\u2019s neglect of his duty to protect the yard-engine by preventing Fralick\u2019s train from going out on the Tilsonburg branch until its return. There can be no reasonable doubt that had the movement of the yard-engine when on the branch been directed by the train-despatcher, Fralick\u2019s train would not have been allowed to leave Brantford until its return, and the collision would never have occurred. The jury have found that the accident would have been prevented had the defects in the system not existed. As forcibly put by Mr. Gibbons, one main purpose of the train-despatching system is to prevent as far as possible the occurrence of disasters likely to result from entrusting the protection of trains to such an employee as a yard-foreman, charged with other duties, often of a pressing nature, and apt, through momentary carelessness, or excessive zeal and eagerness to perform all his work promptly, coupled with an inadequate appreciation of the danger involved, to fall into the error of taking what he may consider a slight risk\u2014just as McGuire seems to have done. If not the immediate cause of the collision in which Fralick was killed, the partial abandonment or abrogation of the train-despatching system was eminently calculated sooner or later to lead to such a result; and it was, in fact, an operative cause of the collision. In case of a breach of statutory duty by a defendant such causation of the injuries for which damages are claimed suffices to support the action.\nIf a defendant, who is required by statute to provide certain means of protection, has chosen to sub- stitute for them other means, however effective when properly carried out, but which have failed to afford protection owing to negligence of the person employed to carry them out\u2014and if it be found on sufficient evidence that had the statute been obeyed the injury complained of would not have been sustained, the defendant\u2019s position is that of a man from whose failure to discharge an absolute statutory duty injury has resulted. He substitutes means other than those prescribed by the statute entirely at his own peril, and if he would discharge himself from liability he must see to it that the protection thus provided proves efficacious. He takes the risk of all injuries which observance of the statute would probably have prevented.\nIn such cases his breach of statutory duty may be regarded as the cause of the injury jointly with any other neglect of duty (not being contributory negligence chargeable to the plaintiff), which may have been the more immediate occasion of it. Illidge v. Goodwin[16]; Dixon v. Bell[17]; Beven on Negligence (Can. ed.), p. 546.\nIf a man obliged under the \u201cFactory Act\u201d to guard dangerous machinery should fail to do so and, instead, should place a watchman to protect persons obliged to move about it, he would have no defence to the claim of such a person (based on an injury sustained while the watchman was negligently absent and which, if present, he would in all probability have prevented) if a proper guard on the machinery would have saved the victim.\nHad the regulations approved under the statute been observed and had the \u201cpusher\u201d engine been operated under the control of the train-despatcher, he would, no doubt, have held Fralick\u2019s train either at Brantford station or at the Tilsonburg switch and McGuire\u2019s breach of duty under the time-table foot-note would not have resulted in the collision. In this sense the defendants\u2019 breach of their statutory duty was a proximate\u2014if not the proximate cause of the collision. In McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[18], notwithstanding that the immediate cause of the fall of an elevator was carelessness of the engineman in allowing it to strike the sheave-wheel with force, since the consequences of this carelessness would probably have been avoided had the defendants supplied proper guide-rails, their negligence in failing to do so was found to be the proximate cause of the accident. This court refused to set aside the finding, and upon it held the plaintiff entitled to recover.\nIf a defendant is a wrong-doer without whose wrong-doing the plaintiff would not have been damaged, he cannot be heard to say that there is some other wrong-doer who contributed to the damage.\nSault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Co. v. Myers[19].\nFinally, it was contended for the defendants that, having employed competent officials to frame their rules and time-tables, as the jury have found, they cannot be held responsible at common law for the introduction or continuation by those officials of a regulation in contravention of the statute.\nThis regulation appears on a time-table bearing the signatures of Charles M. Hays, second vice-president, E.H. Fitzhugh, third vice-president, W.G. Brownlee, general transportation manager, and U.E. Gillen, superintendent. It has been in force on the Tilsonburg branch since it was opened\u2014for a period of about twenty-five years. In these circumstances knowledge of it may, I think, be imputed to the company.\nBut, whether this be so or not, the duty to submit rules and regulations for the working of the railway to the Governor-General in Council is statutory: the prohibition against departure from these rules sanctioned by the Governor-General in Council is absolute. To an action founded on the breach of such duties, the defence of common employment is not available. Groves v. Wimborne[20]; David v. Britannic Merthyr Coal Co.[21], at page 152. Moreover, by section 427(2) of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. [1906], ch. 37), for injuries resulting from breaches of their statutory duties railway companies are declared to be liable to the full extent of the damages sustained. Curran v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[22]\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be allowed and that the judgment entered for her should be increased to the sum of $8,250. She should have her costs of this appeal, but no costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario because of her failure to raise in that court the point on which she has now succeeded.\nAppeal allowed with costs.*\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gibbons, Harper & Gibbons.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W.H.

As to the constitutionality of adopting a system of interrogations of the judiciary even when the questions are confined to subjects of the kind thus indicated. MOTION on behalf of the Provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Alberta, by way of protest against the Supreme Court of Canada, or the individual members thereof, entertaining or considering the questions, hereinafter referred to, submitted by the Governor-General in Council, and that the inscription on the roll for the hearing thereof be stricken from the list, and that the same be reported back to the Governor-General in Council as not being matters which can properly be considered by the court as a court, or by the individual members thereof under the constitution of the court as such, nor by the members thereof in the proper execution of their judicial duties.\nThe matters referred by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council by Orders in Council on 9th and 30th May, 1910, were as follows :\n\"1. What limitation exists under 'The British North America Act, 1867,' upon the power of the provincial legislatures to incorporate companies?\n\"What is the meaning of the expression 'with provincial objects' in section .92, article II., of the said Act? Is the limitation thereby defined territorial, or does it have regard to the character of the powers which may be conferred upon companies locally incorporated, or what otherwise is the intention and effect of the said limitation ?\n\"2. Has a company incorporated by a provincial legislature under the powers conferred in that behalf by section 92, article II. of \u2018The British North America Act, 1867\/ power or capacity to do business outside of the limits of the incorporating province ? If so, to what extent and for what purpose?\n\"Has a company incorporated by a provincial legislature for the purpose, for example, of buying and selling or grinding grain, the power or capacity, by virtue of such provincial incorporation, to buy or sell or grind grain outside of the incorporating province?\n\"3. Has a corporation constituted by a provincial legislature with power to carry on a fire insurance business, there being no stated limitation as to the locality within which the business may be carried on, power or capacity to make and execute contracts\u2014\n(a) within the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province;\n(b) outside of the incorporating province insuring property within the province;\n(c) outside of the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province?\n\"Has such a corporation power or capacity to insure property situate in a foreign country, or to make an insurance contract within a foreign country?\n\"Do the answers to the foregoing inquiries, or any and which of them, depend upon whether or not the owner of the property or risk insured is a citizen or resident of the incorporating province?\n\"4. If in any or all of the above mentioned cases (a), (b) and (c) the answer be negative, would the corporation have throughout Canada the power or capacity mentioned in any and which of the said cases on availing itself of the 'Insurance Act,' 1910, 9 & 10 Edw. VII., chapter 32, section 3, sub-section 3 ?\n\"Is the said enactment, the 'Insurance Act,' 1910, chapter 32, section 23, sub-section 3, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\n\"5. Can the powers of a company incorporated by a provincial legislature be enlarged, and to what extent, either as to locality or objects by \"(a) the Dominion Parliament?\n\"(b) the legislature of another province?\n\"6. Has the legislature of a province power to prohibit companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada from carrying on business within the province unless or until the companies obtain a license so to do from the government of the province, or other local authority constituted by the legislature, if fees are required to be paid upon the issue of such licenses?\n\"For examples of such provincial legislation see Ontario, 63 Vict. ch. 24; New Brunswick Cons. Stats., 1903, ch. 18; British Columbia, 5 Edw. VII. ch. II.\n\"7. Is it competent to a provincial legislature to restrict a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada for the purpose of trading throughout the whole Dominion in the exercise of the special trading powers so conferred or to limit the exercise of such powers within the province?\n\"Is such a Dominion trading company subject to or governed by the legislation of a province in which it carries out or proposes to carry out its trading powers limiting the nature or kinds of business which corporations not incorporated by the legislature of the province may carry on, or the powers which they may exercise within the province, or imposing conditions which are to be observed or complied with by such corporations before they can engage in business within the province?\n\"Can such a company so incorporated by the Parliament of Canada be otherwise restricted in the exercise of its corporate powers or capacity, and how, and in what respect by provincial legislation?\"\nThe questions referred by order in council, on 29th June, 1910, were as follows: \"1. Is it competent to the legislature of British Columbia to authorize the government of the province to grant by way of lease, license or otherwise the exclusive right to fish in any or what part or parts of the waters within the 'Railway Belt,'\n\"(a) as to such waters as are tidal, and\n\"(5) as to such waters as although not tidal are in fact navigable?\n\"2. Is it competent to the legislature of British Columbia to authorize the government of that province to grant by way of lease, license or otherwise the exclusive right, or any right, to fish below low water mark in or in any or what part or parts of the open sea within a marine league of the coast of the province?\n\"3. Is there any and what difference between the open sea within a marine league of the coast of British Columbia and the gulfs, bays, channels, arms of the sea and estuaries of the rivers within the province, or lying between the province and the United States of America, so far as concerns the authority of the Legislature of British Columbia to authorize the government of the province to grant by way of lease, license or otherwise the exclusive right, or any right, to fish below low water mark in the said waters or any of them?\"\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. for the motion. There is no jurisdiction conferred upon Your Lordships to consider and determine the questions now referred and the court and the members thereof should refrain from doing so. The jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to enact section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" must be supported, if at all, under the terms of section 101 of the \"British North America Act,' 1867. With this section must be read sub-section 14 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act.\" The terms of section 60 do not fall within the terms of section 101 relating to the constitution, maintenance and organization of a \"general court of appeal,' nor within those relating to the establishment of \"additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\" The term \"administration of the laws\" must refer to the enforcement of laws after adjudication between parties, or upon proper application by the application of legal remedies. Section 60 provides for a proceeding of an entirely different character.\nThe court is asked to arrive at a conclusion which is not to be enforced in any way and which is utterly ineffective in so far as it may throw light upon the views entertained by the members of the court upon the questions at the moment when they are referred.\nThis is not a matter of the administration of the law. In dealing with the questions referred, the court is not dealing with the laws of Canada. In two of the references the questions are as to the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures and can have no relation to the administration of the laws of Canada. Section 101 in conferring jurisdiction to establish additional courts for the better administration of the laws expressly limits this power to the laws of Canada as opposed to the laws of the provinces:\u2014and this limitation has been clearly understood and acted upon by Parliament on various occasions, as, for instance, in section 67 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" where the operation of that section is made dependent on the provincial legislature agreeing and providing that the Supreme Court of Canada should have the necessary jurisdiction. The same proviso is found in section 32 of the \"Exchequer Court Act.\" Without such proviso Parliament would have clearly infringed upon the provincial jurisdiction conferred by sub-section 14 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act.\" Reference may also be had to the general scope of the \"Exchequer Court Act.\"\nIt would seem that section 60 has no relation to the administration of any law whether of Canada or of the provinces, but simply provides for taking opinions in an entirely advisory and ineffective manner, in an entirely non-judicial capacity, just as Parliament might have provided for taking opinions of any other body or person upon any question, legal or otherwise, upon which the opinion of such body or person was of interest to the Dominion of Canada. A consideration of some instances in which the matter has been brought before this court will shew that this has been the almost unanimous opinion of its members. Of the references under section 60, and sections it now replaces, made to the Supreme Court of Canada on various occasions, with but one exception the reference has been, in a sense, upon consent of both parties, no objection being raised to the expression of the opinions, and those opinions have been consequently expressed, as a general rule, without consideration of the power of Parliament to impose such a duty upon the court, or its members, or upon the desirability or non-desirability of acting upon the reference. Re Provincial Fisheries[1], per Taschereau J., at p. 539. In Re \"Lord's Day Act\"[2], objection was taken to the jurisdiction by a private party merely as to answering questions in respect to hypothetical or supposed legislation. The majority of the court considered this objection well taken, but concluded that, as the court theretofore had answered similar questions, and as the Privy Council had answered questions of the same character, they should proceed to answer the questions in that case; see cases referred to by Idington J. and his remarks, at page 600, on the section now represented by section 60, which apply equally to the question now raised and explain and justify the course heretofore taken in answering questions under section 60. The special difficulty as to hypothetical questions has since been cured by an amendment to the section. In Re Criminal Code[3], the whole question was the subject of discussion; see per Girouard J. at page 436; per Davies J., at page 437; per Idington J., at page 441; per Duff J., at page 452; and per Anglin J., at page 454.\nThe answers requested are of an entirely advisory and non-judicial character, not by-way of the exercise of functions of a court of appeal nor of a court for the administration of the laws of Canada, and, therefore, not within the terms of section 101 of the \"British North America Act.\" Parliament has no jurisdiction to command or compel the giving of advice by members of the Supreme Court of Canada, who, when once duly appointed, are no longer in any sense under the orders of Parliament except in so far as it has jurisdiction to legislate for that court as a court.\nThe feeling that this court, although not viewing the section as legislation binding upon it, should, nevertheless, out of courtesy or deference to Parliament and to the Governor-General in Council, render answers, involves very serious consideration in a case where any party concerned raises objection. If the Government, although in certain circumstances entitled to obtain opinions, by obtaining those opinions are obtaining something not merely of use for \"their information or guidance, but which may be a source of embarrassment to the administration of justice in its proper channels, they are obtaining something to which they are not entitled. An opinion by the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada is entirely different from an opinion given by any other individuals, even if equally qualified, inasmuch as all provincial courts, while not, perhaps, legally bound to give effect to that opinion, would feel themselves bound by that opinion as though it were a judgment of the court, notwithstanding that the matter was not brought before the Supreme Court of Canada through the usual and proper channel, with the usual procedure devised to safeguard the interests of parties.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy-Minister of Justice, contra.\u2014The answers requested are, by sub-section 6 of section 60, declared to be advisor y only. This is within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada; it forms part of the legislation enacted by the group of sections, in the \"Supreme Court Act,\" included in sections 35 to 49, and is consistent with them. The same objections were taken, arguendo, by Mr. Blackstock K.C., in Re \"The Lord's Bay Act\"[4], at pages 588-589, notwithstanding which the court proceeded to answer the questions there submitted, as it has done in numerous other cases referred under the same legislation. Notices of the present references have been duly given to the governments of all the provinces and several of them have signified their concurrence and the desire to have the questions answered.\nLafleur K.C., on behalf of the Provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, stated that these provinces had consented to the reference in regard to \"Fisheries,\" and, also, on behalf of the \"All-Canada Insurance Federation\" that they were desirous of having the questions respecting the \"Insurance Act\" decided.\nA. Geoffrion K.C., on behalf of the Province of Quebec, stated that the province desired to have the questions respecting the \"Insurance Act\" disposed of by the court.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question, and the only question, we have now to dispose of, is a preliminary objection which has been taken to' our hearing and considering these references made to us by order in council, on the ground that notwithstanding anything contained in the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" the Parliament of Canada cannot impose upon this court the duty of answering questions which, as those representing some of the provinces contend, do not apply to legislation actually passed by that Parliament, or to legislation which it is intended it should pass.\nThe questions relate to:\n(a) The limitations placed by the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" upon the power of provincial legislatures with respect to the incorporation of companies; (b) The competency of the legislature of British Columbia to grant by way of lease the exclusive right to fish in certain parts of the waters within the \"Railway Belt\" in that province;\n(c) The validity of certain sections of the \"Insurance Act,\" 1910.\nThe Province of British Columbia consents to the reference with respect to the granting of licenses to fish within the \"Railway Belt.\"\nVarious questions involving, as those now submitted, the true construction of the \"British North America Act\" with respect to the exercise of the legislative power of Parliament and of the provinces respectively have been at different times submitted to this court by the executive and answered; in some instances, it is true, in recent years, under protest. The answers given to those questions have been on several occasions appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that body assumed it had jurisdiction to deal with them, although certainly in no respect under the legislative control of the Parliament of Canada. A list of those references will be found on page 267 of Mr. Cameron's \"Supreme Court Practice.\"\nSpeaking for myself, I feel bound by the rule established for us by these precedents which date back to the very beginning of this court. They have established a rule of conduct which now has for me the force of law.\nIf the practice originated (as a learned legal writer says) in error, yet the error is now so common that it must have the force of law.\nI entertain no doubt, however, that independently of all precedent it is our duty to consider the questions submitted. It is not necessary for us to say now whether everything that is or may be involved in the consideration of each of the questions referred would or would not properly fall under our cognizance. If in the course of the argument or subsequently it becomes apparent that to answer any particular question might interfere with the proper administration of justice, it will then be time to ask the executive, for that reason, not to insist upon answers being given; and this might very properly be done notwithstanding that such answers would not in any circumstances have the binding force of adjudications, like decisions given in regular course of judicial proceedings. Lord Watson, in the Brewers Case[5]. In other words even in the absence of those special provisions in the \"British North America Act\" and the \"Supreme Court Act,\" to which I will hereafter refer, I would still hold that the members of this court are the official advisers of the executive in the same way as the judges in England are the counsel or advisers of the King in matters of law, our constitution being \"similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\" (Preamble of the \"British North America Act.\") The same Act, in the distribution of powers, declares\nthat the executive government and authority of and over Canada continues to be and is vested in the Queen.\nIn England the practice of calling on the judges for their opinion as to existing law is well established. Evidence of its existence will be found as far back as history and tradition throws any light on British legal institutions[6]. After quoting the section of the constitution of Massachusetts which provides for taking the opinion of the judges by the executive or legislative department, Chief Justice Gray says[7]:\nThis article, as reported in the convention that framed the constitution, limited the authority to the Governor and Council and the Senate, and was extended by the convention so as to include the House of Representatives; and as may be inferred from the form in which it was originally presented, evidently had in view the usage of the English Constitution, by which the King, as well as the House of Lords, whether acting in their judicial or their legislative capacity, had the right to demand the opinions of the twelve judges of England.\nThe case in which the Lords in their judicial capacity called for the opinion of the judges, is a very familiar one. I might mention O'Connell v. Case[8], in which the decision. of the Lords was against the opinion of the majority of the judges. A well-known precedent may be cited of McNaghten's Case[9]. Here not only was there no litigated question before the Lords, but not even any pending legislative question. The Lords, in the course of their debates, having fallen into a discussion about a case recently tried at the central criminal court, but not in any way before them, a case developing interesting questions in the law relating to insanity, conceived that they would like to know a little more accurately what the law on those points was. They accordingly put a set of \"abstract questions\" to the judges \u2014 questions not arising out of any business before them, actual or contemplated. One of the judges protested against this proceeding and his objections bear a close resemblance to those urged in support of this preliminary objection, e.g., that the questions put do not appear to arise out of and are not put with reference to a particular case, or for a particular purpose, which might explain or limit the generality of the terms, that he had heard no argument;\nand that he feared\nthat as the questions relate to matters of criminal law of great importance, the answers to them by the judges might embarrass the administration of justice when they are cited in trials.\nThe Lords took notice of this and while courteously thanking the judges for their opinions, expressed a unanimous judgment that it was proper and in order for the Lords to call for opinions on \"abstract questions of existing law.\"\nFor your Lordships (said Lord Campbell) may be called on, in your legislative capacity, to change the law and before doing so it is proper that you should be satisfied beyond a doubt what the law really is.\nThese words of Lord Campbell are absolutely applicable to this reference. In anticipation of possible legislation on the important subjects of insurance, incorporation of joint stock companies and control of fisheries, the executive of Canada desires to be advised as to the constitutional limitations upon its legislative power. In McNaghten's Case[10] Lord Brougham refers to the case of \"Fox's Libel Act,\" when the judges answered questions about the existing law of libel. Lord Campbell cited an instance where the judges were called on to give their opinion upon the questions of law propounded to them respecting the \"Clergy Reserves (Canada) Act.\"[11]. One of the questions was whether the Legislative Assembly of United Canada had exceeded their lawful authority in legislating with respect to the sale of the clergy reserves. Lord Wynford said he did not doubt the power of the House to call on the judges and to have their opinion as to existing law. He recalled the instance when he was Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas that he communicated to the house the opinion of the judges with regard to the usury laws, and the house subsequently passed a law on the subject. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Lyndhurst) concurred \"as\" to our right to have the opinions of the judges\" on existing law. In a previous case the judges begged to be excused from giving an opinion, requested by the House of Lords, upon the question whether a pending bill was in conflict with previous acts relating to the Bank of England. The questions were argued by counsel on both sides; but the judges said that the inquiries were not\nconfined to the strict construction of existing Acts of Parliament.\nIn re Westminster Bank[12].\nThis is not a case in which we are called on to express an opinion by anticipation on causes actually depending before the courts nor is it to be supposed for one moment that we will consider ourselves bound by the opinions given in answer to the questions submitted to us if the principles involved are brought before us in due course of law. As Lord Mansfield said in the Sackville Case[13],\nwe shall be ready, without difficulty, to change our opinions, if we see cause, upon objections that may then be laid before us, though none have occurred to us at present which we think sufficient.\nI am certainly of opinion that the practice of taking counsel, as it were, with the judges, to ascertain and elicit their opinions upon a specific question before it had been brought judicially before them is objectionable. And I entirely agree with what is said by Mr. Hargrave[14]:\nHowever numerous and strong the precedents may be in favour of the King's extra-judicially consulting the judges on questions in which the Crown is interested, it is a right to be understood with many exceptions, and such as ought to be exercised with great reserve lest the rigid impartiality so essential to their judicial capacity, should be violated. The anticipation of judicial opinions on causes actually depending should be particularly guarded against, and therefore a wise and upright judge will ever be cautious how he extra-judicially answers questions of such a tendency.\nAt the same time we must not forget that judges are officers of the Crown, and I adopt without any reserve the opinion expressed by Dorion C.J., a man of wide political and judicial experience, when, speaking for the full Court of Queen's Bench in Quebec, he said in Bruneau et al. v. Massue[15]:\nThe judges of the Superior Court as citizens are bound to perform all the duties which are imposed upon them by either the Dominion or the local legislature. If these duties were either incompatible or too onerous to be properly performed, provided neither legislature had exceeded the limits of its legislative power, it would become the duty of the local and Dominion Governments to suggest a remedy by some practical solution of the difficulty, but it does not devolve upon courts of justice to assume the authority of declaring unconstitutional a law on account of the real or supposed inconveniences which may result in carrying out its provisions.\nThese words were subsequently quoted with approval by Chief Justice Sir W. Meredith in Langlois v. Valin[16], at page 16, and they are specially applicable in the present circumstance. This court was established by the Parliament of Canada\nas a general court of appeal for Canada, and as an additional court for the better administration of the laws of Canada[17], under the authority of section 101 of the \"British North America Act.\" That section is as follows:\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nAnd we are asked to answer certain questions submitted to us by the executive for the express purpose of obtaining information which may assist in the administration of the fundamental law of the Canadian constitution, the \"British North America Act.\"\nDealing now with the constitutionality of those provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" under which this reference has been made. That Act was drafted and passed through Parliament when Hon. T. Fournier was Minister of Justice and was brought into force by a proclamation issued by Hon. Ed. Blake, his successor in office. The general legal presumption that a legislature does not intend to exceed its jurisdiction is strengthened in this case by the fact that constitutional lawyers of such eminence as Blake and Fournier are responsible for the legislation, the validity of which is now challenged.\nI presume it will not be suggested that the Imperial Parliament could not constitutionally confer upon \"the Canadian Legislature the power to establish a court competent to deal with such references as we have now before us; and, if not, how could more apt words be found to express their intention to confer that power? Could better words be used to convey the widest discretion of legislation with respect to the all embracing subject \"the better administration of the laws of Canada?\" It cannot now be doubted either in view of the decision of the Privy Council in Valin v. Langlois[18], that if the Parliament of Canada might have created a new court for the purpose of hearing such references as are now submitted, it could commit the exercise of this new jurisdiction to this court.\nThe distinction between creating a new court and conferring a new jurisdiction upon an existing court is but a verbal and non-substantial distinction.\nIf any doubt remains as to the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament in the premises, a reference to section 91 of the \"British North America Act,\" which provides that the Parliament of Canada may from time to time make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislation of the provinces, should dispel that doubt.\nLord Halsbury, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Riel v. The Queen[19], at pages 678-9, said, interpreting the words \"peace, order and good government\":\nThe words of the statute are apt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to. They are words under which the widest departure from criminal procedure as it is known and practised in this country have been authorized in Her Majesty's Indian Empire. Forms of procedure unknown to the English common law have there been established and acted upon, and to throw the least doubt upon the validity of powers conveyed by those words would be of widely mischievous consequence.\nIt has not been argued, and I do not think it could seriously be argued for a moment, that if Parliament possesses the power to make these references, that power has not been vested in the executive. Section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as originally enacted, read as follows:\nThe Governor in Council may refer to the Supreme Court for hearing or consideration, any matter which he thinks fit; and the court shall thereupon hear or consider the same and certify their opinion thereon to the Governor in Council; provided that any judge or judges of the court who differ from the opinion of the majority may, in like manner, certify his or their opinion or opinions to the Governor in Council.\nIn view of doubts expressed by members of this court at different times as to whether the intention, of the legislature had been clearly expressed, changes have been made widening the scope of that section until we finally have section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which is in the following terms:\nImportant questions of law or fact touching\n(a) the interpretation of the \"British North America Acts,\" 1867 to 1886; or\n(b) The constitutionality or interpretation of any Dominion or provincial legislation; or,\n(c) The appellate jurisdiction as to educational matters, by the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" or by any other Act or law vested in the Governor in Council; or,\n(d) The powers of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislatures of the provinces, or of the respective governments thereof, whether or not the particular power in question has been or is proposed to be executed; or,\n(e) Any other matter, whether or not in the opinion of the court ejusdem generis with the foregoing enumerations, with reference to which the Governor in Council sees fit to submit any such question; may be referred by the Governor in Council to the Supreme Court for hearing and consideration; and any question touching any of the matters aforesaid, so referred by the Governor in Council, shall be conclusively deemed to be an important question.\n2. When any such reference is made to the court it shall be the duty of the court to hear and consider it, and to answer each question so referred; and the court shall certify to the Governor in Council, for his information, its opinion upon each such question, with the reasons for each such answer; and such opinion shall be pronounced in like manner as in the case of a judgment upon an appeal to the Court; and any judge who differs from the opinion of the majority shall in like manner certify his opinion and his reasons.\n3. In case any such question relates to the constitutional validity of any Act which has heretofore been or shall hereafter be passed by the legislature of any province, or of any provision in any such Act, or in case, for any reason, the government of any province has any special interest in any such question, the Attorney-General of such province shall be notified of the hearing, in order that he may be heard if he thinks fit.\n4. The court shall have power to direct that any person interested, or where there is a class of persons interested, any one or more persons as representatives of such class, shall be notified of the hearing upon any reference under this section, and such persons shall be entitled to be heard thereon.\n5. The court may, in its discretion, request any counsel to argue the case as to any interest which is affected and as to which counsel does not appear, and the reasonable expenses thereby occasioned may be paid by the Minister of Finance out of any moneys appropriated by Parliament for expenses of litigation.\n6. The opinion of the court upon any such reference, although advisory only, shall, for all purposes of appeal to His Majesty in Council, be treated as a final judgment of the said court between parties.\nIt is to be observed that this section was enacted to remove all doubt as to the intention of Parliament, to get the opinion of the members of this court as to the validity of proposed legislation as well as of all existing legislation.\nSection 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as it was originally enacted, seems to have been taken from 3 & 4 Wm. IV. ch. 41, which reads as follows:\nIt shall be lawful for His Majesty to refer to the said Judicial Committee (the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council), for hearing and consideration and such other matters whatsoever as His Majesty shall think fit, and such Committee shall thereupon hear or consider the same, and shall advise His Majesty thereon in manner aforesaid.\nIn re Schlumberger[20], at page 12, speaking of this section, the Right Honourable Dr. Lushington said, dealing with an objection to the jurisdiction of the Privy Council to hear and consider a petition referred to them by order in council: The only construction that can be placed upon the section above quoted is a construction which shall give to the words therein contained their complete meaning, without limitation whatsoever,\nand further,\nthat the Judicial Committee were not entitled to put any limitation on these words in any matter referred to them by the Crown.\nIn addition to those above mentioned, constitutional cases of great importance to a colony have been referred by the Sovereign to the Judicial Committee, such as to the power of the legislature of Queensland in respect of money bills and the validity of Protestant marriages in Malta and upon their report have been decided by the Governor in Council. (See P. papers, 1894, No. 214, 1896, 7982.)\nObjection was taken by some of the judges of this court to the hearing of the reference Re Sunday Legislation[21]. At the argument on the appeal to the Privy Council, it appears from the report that Mr. Newcombe, in reply said:\nThen, my Lords, Mr. Riddell has questioned the jurisdiction under the \"Supreme Court Act\" to make the reference. I do not know whether your Lordships desire me to reply to that.\nTo which Lord McNaghten said:\nI think we know the terms of the Act. They are wide enough to embrace it.\nThe sections of the \"Supreme Court Act\" to which I think useful reference may be made are:\nSection 3, which constitutes the Supreme Court as a general court of appeal and as an additional court for the better administration of the laws of Canada;\nSections 35 to 49 inclusive, defining the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; Sections 60 to 67 inclusive, which define the special jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which includes not only references by the Governor in Council but also references by the Senate and House of Commons, habeas corpus and certiorari and cases removed by provincial courts.\nIn addition we have section 55 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. [1906] ch. 37, which provides that the Railway Commissioners may refer questions for the opinion of the judges of the Supreme Court. This power has been freely exercised by the Commission and we have never to my knowledge refused to answer the questions submitted. Can it now be successfully argued that the Railway Commissioners have the power to make references to this court and that the Parliament, that created the Commission, has not got that power?\nSection 55 of the \"British North America Act\" provides that a bill may be reserved for the signification of the Sovereign's pleasure. Before exercising this prerogative of rejection would it not be within the power of the Home Government to refer the question involved to the Judicial Committee under the fourth section of 3 & 4 Wm, IV. ch. 41, above quoted? If so, by analogy, may we not argue that the same principle would apply to the case of disallowance which may be exercised in connection with the power of supervision over provincial legislation entrusted to the Dominion Government, as provided for in section 60 of the \"British North America Act\"? If a provincial Act is reserved by a lieutenant-governor for the consideration of the Governor-General in Council, the opinion of the members of this court as to its constitutionality might well be taken for the guidance of His Excellency. If this may be done after an Act has been passed, why should it not be competent to seek such advice in advance of legislation?\nFor all these reasons I hold:\n1. That the Governor in Council has the power under the constitution to make this reference;\n2. That it is the duty of the members of this court to hear the argument of counsel and to answer the questions, subject to our right to make all proper representations if it appears to us during the course of the argument, or thereafter, that to answer such questions might in any way embarrass the administration of justice.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014As to the motion to quash, I would prefer to wait for judgment till the matter is discussed on the merits. I am prepared, however, to say that the Governor-General in Council has jurisdiction to refer the constitutionality or interpretation of federal statutes or other federal matters to this court; but he cannot do so if the subject-matter of reference is merely provincial; and with regard to the latter I think the \"Supreme Court Act,\" especially section 60 (para. (b) ), is ultra vires. In a case like this, this court does not sit as a general court of appeal for Canada, but as an \"additional court for the administration of the laws of Canada\" within section 101 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\"\nThis additional court is a court of common law and equity in and for Canada and is merely advisory. Its decision binds no one. R.S.C., ch. 139, section 3.\nThe consent of the provinces is not sufficient to give us jurisdiction, unless they agree to the reference and constitute what may be called a submission to the court which is always open to litigants even at common law; and in such a case the decision of this court should be binding as to the parties to it.\nDavies J.\u2014Questions with regard to the legislative powers of the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures, and also as to the meaning and extent of certain enactments made by these bodies respectively, having been referred by the Governor in Council to this court pursuant to section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" for hearing and reasoned answers our jurisdiction has been challenged on the ground that the section of the \"Supreme Court Act\" above referred to was either altogether or in part ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe preamble to Canada's constitutional Act refers to the expressed desire of the provinces then confederated\nto be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution-similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom,\nand the Act was passed to carry into effect that expressed desire.\nIn the division of legislative powers assigned to the Canadian Parliament and legislatures, Parliament is empowered generally to\nmake laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces,\nand is given exclusive and paramount legislative authority over all matters coming within the 29 classes of subjects specifically enumerated.\nThe classes of subjects exclusively assigned by the 92nd section to the legislatures of the provinces embrace\n14. The administration of justice in the province including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both , of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nIn addition to this division of legislative power, section 101 provides for the establishment by Parliament \"notwithstanding anything in this Act\" of a general court of appeal for Canada and of any additional courts for the better administration of its laws.\nThe first step necessary to determine whether in authorizing questions to be put to this court on important constitutional and legal points by the Governor in Council, Parliament acted beyond its powers is to determine whether section 60 is in conflict with the powers exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures. If it is not in such conflict then in my opinion the objection is entirely disposed of.\nThe \"Federation Act\" as was said by the Judicial Committee in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[22], at page 588,\nexhausts the whole range of legislative power and whatever is not thereby given to the provincial legislatures rests with the Parliament.\nSub-section 14 of section 92 of our constitutional Act is the one with which it is contended section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is in conflict. I quite fail to appreciate in what respect this can be held to be so.\nThe former assigns to the legislature the exclusive power to make laws for the administration of justice in the province.\nThe latter authorizes the Governor-General in Council to submit important questions to this court relating to the powers of Parliament and the legislatures respectively, and to other subjects affecting the general administration of the laws of Canada.\nThe answers which the judges of this court are required to give to the questions asked are reasoned answers after having heard arguments from counsel representing the different conflicting interests. But these answers are simply to aid the Governor in Council in reaching conclusions for which they must be held entirely responsible. The answers do not bind the Governor in Council. He may act in accordance with them or not, as he pleases, giving them just such weight as he pleases. They are advisory only. They do not bind even this court as has been often said before if at any time it is called upon in its strictly judicial capacity to decide the very question asked. Being advisory only and not binding upon the body to whom they are given or upon the judges who give them they cannot be said to be in any way binding upon the judges of any of the provincial courts. For these reasons I am of the opinion that there is no necessary conflict between the two sections and that therefore the objection taken to the constitutional validity of section 60 fails.\nBut even if it was decided that such conflict did exist, it would by no means determine the invalidity of the clause attacked. The inquiry would then be removed one step further back and would require the proper construction of section 101 authorizing Parliament,\nnotwithstanding anything in the Act, to constitute a general court of appeal for Canada and also additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada. If that, section and the legislation of Parliament under it are broad enough to confer on the Governor in Council the power to put these questions then that alone would dispose of the objection.\nIn my opinion the language of the section is quite broad and ample enough to confer the required and assumed power. The section says that, \"notwithstanding anything in this Act\" the Parliament of Canada may, etc., so that even if the powers conferred when exercised necessarily conflicted with any of the exclusive powers of the legislatures they would be constitutional. We all know that the laws of Canada are administered by the several departments of government, that these laws consist not only of the statutes passed by Parliament but of the rules and regulations authorized by these statutes to be made by the Governor in Council, the better to carry out the general object and purpose of the statutes. The administration of these statutes and regulations often and necessarily under our constitution involve the determination of most difficult and novel legal and constitutional questions. It would only seem right and proper that there should have been in the constitutional Act some means authorized by which the opinions of some independent tribunal might be obtained on such questions as related to the proper interpretation of the constitutional Act itself; the constitutionality or interpretation of Dominion or provincial legislation; or the exercise by the Governor-General in Council of any of the judicial or quasi-judicial functions he may under the constitutional Act be called upon to discharge, as well as other kindred questions.\nIn my judgment such an apparently desirable object was accomplished by the language of the 101st section. The powers given to Parliament by that section whatever they may be construed to cover and include were certainly paramount powers, not limited by any powers of legislation assigned to the provincial Parliament. They are given expressly \"notwithstanding anything\" in the constitutional Act.\nIn my opinion they are broad and ample enough to cover the powers which Parliament has attempted in the 60th section to exercise. They authorize the establishment of a court for the better administration of the laws of Canada. Parliament has established this general appeal court as such a court. There cannot be any constitutional objection in my opinion to its doing so and with matters of policy we have no concern. The better administration of the laws of Canada may and doubtless frequently does necessarily involve a consideration and determination of the extent, meaning and constitutionality of provincial legislation and the advisory powers with which section 60 deals cover and are intended to cover both fields of legislation. In point of fact and law, these powers of legislation, Dominion and provincial, are so interlaced that one can hardly be considered apart from the other.\nIf I am right in my construction of this section 101 nothing more remains to be said on the question before us. It is said that this court is a general court of appeal for Canada, but I see no constitutional reason if Ave were that and that alone, why Parliament could not impose on it the duty of giving reasoned answers to such important questions as it might authorize the Governor-General in Council to ask.\nBut Parliament has made this court more than a mere general court of appeal. It has made it also a \"court for the better administration of the laws of Canada,\" and, as I have already said, that, to my mind, removes any reasonable doubt upon the point in question.\nThe different references which have from time to time been made to this court have always been heard and answered without question as to the constitutionality of the section under which they were made. Many appeals of a most important character have gone to the Judicial Committee from the answers given by this court on these references, but in no case has any such objection as that now under consideration been taken. The section largely, indeed almost substantially, as it stands to-day was passed in 1891, based on a resolution introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. E. Blake, accepted by the late Sir John A. Macdonald, then leader of the government, and adopted unanimously by the House. These facts by no means conclude the question. At the same time they shew what the opinion of many of Canada's most distinguished jurists has been and it is hard to believe that such a point as that now raised, if well taken, could have escaped the observation of all the distinguished counsel who have argued the question on the many references made, and the jurists who constituted the board of the Judicial Committee and decided those of them which were appealed to that board.\nIf the power of Parliament now in controversy to pass section 60 is held to depend upon the general power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada, then of course the question whether there was a conflict of jurisdiction between the Dominion and the provincial authorities would have to be decided. It seems to me that the very broadest construction should be placed upon these words, \"peace, order and good government.\" They certainly would, in relation to the objection now taken, be construed in the light of the words in the preamble that our constitution was to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\nWhile the constitutions of the Dominion and the provinces are mainly written and defined, that of the United Kingdom is unwritten and is the growth of customs, precedents, practices and principles defined from time to time, sometimes by Acts of Parliament, and sometimes by judicial decisions, sometimes left undefined. When we find that it has been the undoubted right of the House of Lords, itself the highest court of appeal in the United Kingdom, as also a branch of the High Court of Parliament to summon the common law judges before their House to answer questions as to what the law of the Kingdom is on any given question, and when we further find that the Imperial Parliament has itself enacted laws declaring the right of the King in Council to call upon the Judicial Committee, itself a court of appeal, in certain matters, alike in England and from the Dominions of the Crown beyond the seas, we can fairly say that such right to obtain the opinions of the common law judges and of the Judicial Committee is a principle of the British constitution and in accordance with its spirit. When, therefore, we are called upon to determine what meaning should be given to the power assigned in our constitutional Act to Parliament to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada, we cannot hold that legislation requiring the judges of our Court of Appeal to answer questions submitted to them by the Governor in Council is not in accordance with the spirit or principle of our constitution and would not be within Parliament's powers.\nMy conclusions, therefore, are, first, that the legislation challenged by the motion now before us is constitutional under section 101 of our constitutional Act, and that if there is a doubt upon that point it comes clearly within the power of legislating for the peace, order and good government of Canada, because it is in accordance with British precedent and practice, and is not in conflict with any of the powers exclusively assigned to the legislatures of the provinces.\nI say nothing whatever about the particular questions now before us awaiting argument. Whether they go further than they should must be determined later.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The jurisdiction of this court to answer the questions submitted by these references has been challenged by the motion made.\nI respectfully dissent from the conclusion arrived at by a majority of the court. I agree in regard to our jurisdiction to answer some of the questions submitted. But the decision as a whole implies not only that Parliament has, but also has exercised, the power of commanding this court, originally constituted and established a court of common law and equity, never supposed to have been constituted by virtue of any other power than section 101 of the \"British North America Act,\" which enacts as follows,\n101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada, to become an advisory adjunct of the Department of Justice and fill the place usually held by subaltern law officers of the Crown. As if to shew more clearly than ever this section 101 to be its sole foundation the constituting Act was amended by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 50, section 1, being substituted for the original declaration, and stands now as follows:\n3. The court of common law and equity in and for Canada now existing under the name of the Supreme Court of Canada, is hereby continued under that name, as a general court of appeal for Canada, and as an additional court for the better administration of the laws of Canada, and shall continue to be a court of record.\nI desire at the outset to make clear that the references which have the sanction of the provincial government to their submission by the Dominion government are within the jurisdiction of this court.\nSection 101 of the \"British North America Act\" does not so clearly as it might cover the ground of authority for the creation of a court of quasi-original jurisdiction to dispose of such constitutional controversies as said references imply between the Dominion and provinces. But said section 101 and sub-section 14, of section 92, of the \"British North America Act,\" coupled together do lay such a foundation of authority and followed by section 67 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and the correlative provincial legislation provided for therein, do seem to me sufficient to confer jurisdiction within the limits thus assigned.\nHowever that may be, the jurisdiction of the court I think, was always wide enough to cover submissions made jointly by Dominion and province. And the province in some cases has so legislated as to render it necessary to inform the Attorney-General of the province of any constitutional question raised in any case, and enabled him to intervene. I see no objection to the practice that has arisen as the result of all this by which the Dominion and provinces have repeatedly come directly here, and stated and argued the point of legal controversy involved, and had the same decided and then sometimes ap- pealed to the Privy Council.\nI am not oblivious of the fact that the omission in the \"British North America Act\" to provide expressly for the expedients thus adopted, leaves them open to criticism, which is, however, answered, it seems to me, by the implied constitutional powers we must assume to be inherent in these constituent bodies mutually to protect and so far as possible delimit their respective spheres of jurisdiction in relation to each other or the subject-matters assigned to each to deal with.\nThis sane method thus adopted and long acted upon, I do not question; nor do I question section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" in so far as in aid thereof. I cannot agree in the sweeping attacks upon it in argument here by way of asserting its entire invalidity.\nI therefore hold so far as regards the reference in the Fisheries case, said to be made pursuant to an understanding between the Dominion and the Province of British Columbia, and thereby falling within said method, that it is within our jurisdiction.\nIt was objected in argument that our decision of that might in an indirect way affect other provinces.\nSuch must of necessity under our system of jurisprudence, resting upon precedent, be the result of any decision of any concrete case, where the precedent created thereby may bind in a like case between other parties not made parties to such preceding cases.\nThe like result would also follow if a point of constitutional law happened to arise in an action between private litigants and be there decided.\nI also am of opinion that section 101 enables Parliament to confer, if it see fit, on this court, jurisdiction to hear disputed cases involving or springing out of the application of the laws of Canada.\nI do not think that the phrase \"any additional courts\" in said section implies that the additional courts must of necessity be a separate tribunal composed of different persons.\nIndeed, the words \"additional courts\" are, I think, relative to the existing provincial courts, administering the laws of Canada as well as of the provinces.\nThis court as originally constituted was blended as it were with the Exchequer Court. Their respective functions were defined, but the same persons were judges of both courts.\nMoreover, the power of Parliament to delegate its powers of trying election petitions to a provincial court, was duly maintained though it might have constituted under section 101, a court of its own for the purposes of such trials.\nThe question of separation of one or more juridical powers when being created, or of consolidation of two or more after their creation, when and so far as within the power of Parliament to constitute the judicial powers then in question, seems to me entirely matter of convenience and expediency, and does not touch the question of jurisdiction.\nI am, therefore, prepared to hold that if and in so far as this court has been or may be duly given jurisdiction to administer any laws of Canada, and so far as the proceedings in question can be brought thereunder, we are bound to observe and discharge such judicial functions as implied therein. In the submission In re Criminal Code[23], made to us last term, though inclined to think the reference pushed the power and duty to the verge of the reasonable limits section 101 of the \"British North America Act\" would permit, I, with some doubt, agreed the questions might fall within the words of that section.\nIn disposing of that reference the majority of the court seemed impressed, as I was, with the futility of the proceeding, and intimated that \"their opinions bound no one. But as it was quite competent for Parliament to enact relative to criminal procedure whatever it pleased, no great harm could arise from answering any such questions.\nThe questions here submitted relative to the \"Insurance Act\" enacted by Parliament are of an entirely different character. It is not so admittedly within the power of Parliament. It is in truth the true meaning of the \"British North America Act\" that is involved. How can the solution of that be said to be administering the laws of Canada unless presented in a concrete case?\nTo say that our opinion may bind no one is, I respectfully submit, not a satisfactory disposition of the matter. For if Parliament has the power to insist upon an answer it must be because it would be competent for Parliament to enact, and that it might enact, retrospectively and prospectively that our answers, or rather the concurrent answer of the majority, is or is to become law, binding all concerned.\nThis brings us to the solution of the problem of whether or not Parliament can by any method impose upon this court the duty of answering or constitute by any method a judicial court that can properly be asked to answer, in an inquiry of this kind now submitted to us and in face of the submission being objected to by all the provinces concerned, and only spoken to by counsel for the Dominion and possibly our nominee.\nLet us first assume this court has been constituted only by virtue of the authority of section 101 above quoted, and see if anything therein can justify such a position as asking or answering all these questions. Pass for the present those relative to the meaning of any statute enacted by Parliament. The observations I am about to make may well apply to those questions as well as to the others relative to the \"British North America Act\" and provincial statutes to which I will first direct particular attention. Some different considerations may arise relative to the questions touching the laws of Canada. But some of the considerations I am about to bring forward apply to all.\nNo one can pretend that answering these questions is an exercise of or falls within the appellate jurisdiction of this court. Every one will admit, however, that the questions of law involved therein may each and all involve the very issue of law to be presented at any moment by a private litigant or be raised by a province in private litigation or come within the range of a controversy which section 67 and provincial legislation have paved the way for, if not expressly provided for, being dealt with by mutual submission.\nWhy should any or all of such parties be prejudiced and embarrassed by a proceeding of this kind?\nIt is not of its expediency I am treating, for that does not directly concern this inquiry, but of its bearing upon the administration of justice. That whole subject, save as specifically provided, is by section 92, sub-section 14, expressly assigned to the provincial authorities. I say the whole, for when that administered in each province is so, there is nothing left unless in unorganized territory. And there is only one exception or method of reservation given by the \"British North America Act,\" so far as provincial legislation and the judicial administration thereof is concerned and that is by way of appeal to this court. It is the method that (if permissible), I may say, appears in the Quebec resolutions at the meeting that led to the passing of the \"British North America Act.\" And the power to create additional courts appears to have been resolved separately and expressed as relative to the Acts of Parliament.\nAll rights springing from or resting upon provincial legislation must be determined first by the local courts and if need be then by appeal therefrom. What right have we to attempt to overawe them by dicta of ours obtained from us by this method? What right and authority legislative or judicial exists to interfere with the administration of justice according to the methods and the mode assigned by this organic law designed to guard and enforce the rights, obligations and duties of all concerned?\nThe questions coming thus for adjudication may involve the very existence of the corporate powers of those concerned and of many others in a like plight. What right have we to jeopardize their stability by expressing any opinion on an ex parte application, or where no right exists to command an appearance, and, as we have found possible, upon a perfunctory exposition of the law upon which we are asked to pass?\nWhat would be thought of a judge who had expressed to a private litigant an opinion more or less deliberate upon the questions upon the solving of which the determination of that litigant's rights must turn, sitting afterwards upon his case, hearing and adjudging it?\nThe thing thus put would (I am glad to believe) be an absolute impossibility. No such man sits upon the bench in our country.\nBut analyze the situation we are now presented with, and wherein lies the difference?\nThe controversy on some of these cases submitted seems to be one between the Dominion and the provinces, or some of them. The very questions may involve the solution of the exact point in some case now on its way here in a due, orderly and ordinary way; why forestall the rights of these suitors?\nIs there any difference in the last analysis between answering and advising the Dominion as a litigant as to its rights as against a province, and the case I have put of a private litigant? How can Ave when we have answered sit upon the appeal of a private litigant, either with a province intervening as under existing legislation is possible, or without, to decide the identical question upon which we have already given an ex parte opinion?\nThe constitution of this court was intended for the purpose of adjudicating by way of appeal or otherwise upon such questions as might be by it finally disposed of or authoritatively reviewed and finally disposed of by the Privy Council.\nIt was sought thereby to eliminate by such a system for the administration of justice a mass of appellate work which the growing demands then present and prospective required should be disposed of in this country and at the same time the way be kept open in the more important and far reaching judgments pronounced here and elsewhere for an appeal to an Imperial tribunal.\nIt never was intended by the creation of this court or the power given to create it to change the leading features of constitutional government expressly designed after the model of the British constitution as adopted and in use for a quarter of a century in a numbed of the provinces confederated by the \"British North America Act,\" and thereby (subject to the features of the federal system) intended to be continued by the Dominion and inferentially also by each of the provinces, so far as circumstances would permit.\nIt is therefore necessary in order to understand the full compass of what we are asked to undertake .and the full import of the challenge now made respecting the constitutional power of Parliament to impose upon us the duty of such an undertaking, that we should comprehend something of the constitutional limitations implied in the leading features of constitutional government to which I have adverted.\nIs there any parallel in that constitutional government for such an interrogation of the judiciary as to the meaning of a mass of acts as these inquiries embrace?\nIs it any answer to say that an inquiry may be made of the Privy Council, historically and by statute duly constituted by a plenary parliament a consultative as well as a judicial body? Is it any answer to say that at rare intervals in modern times there have been submissions to the judges by virtue of a survival of a part of a practice having an historical record traceable to times when the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial functions were not supposed to be as necessary, indeed speaking generally so cardinal a principle of modern constitutional government as modern thought has held necessary?\nIs it any answer to say that what might exist in an almost dormant condition in a state of society where the force of historic tradition and constitutional usages are a guarantee that cannot be supplied here, could be supposed proper to establish here and to have incorporated in such an Act as the British North America Act?\nThese considerations are submitted in answer to the suggestion that in some way I am unable to understand such vestiges or survivals existent in England might have been in the minds of men enacting expressly as section 101 does enact and may be implied therein as inherent in the power conferred to establish any additional courts.\nBut the language forbids the thought.\nIt is expressly confined to courts for administering the laws of Canada. What are the laws of Canada? Is it not obvious that they are the laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada? Is it not obvious that such a thing as administering the laws of the provinces is a thing beyond the literal meaning of the words, and in conflict with the exclusive power assigned to the provinces of constituting courts of justice for that very purpose.\nHow can it be supposed in the face of such an enactment and such a system as a whole that the Dominion could ever interfere?\nMoreover, the expression \"any law of Canada\" when used in an Act of Parliament dealing with a subject matter that might well have implied giving it the full remedial effect and measure of relief that seemed necessary and by its purview to incorporate the local laws therewith, this Court held itself bound by the phrase to limit the operation of that statute to an enactment of the Parliament of Canada.\nI refer to the case of Ryder v. The King[24], where it was attempted to be maintained that by force of the said expression in sub-section (d) of section 16, of the Exchequer Court Act, giving relief against the crown in the case of workmen entitled to compensation it covered the right in a local law. It was held it could not be so extended.\nWhen we thus eliminate from the operation of section 101 anything but that comprised in the laws of Canada, where is there any authority in Parliament to direct as it is claimed to have directed?\nMany of those reasons and considerations already assigned relative to the inquiry so far as relative to questions respecting the British North America Act and provincial laws, are applicable to, and I think effectively cover inquiries relative to the laws of Canada.\nIt is said, however, Parliament can enact relative to subjects beyond those specifically assigned when it deems it necessary for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nIn the first place I repeat the \"British North America Act\" has by section 101 impliedly exhausted the subject and covered everything of a judicial character possible to assign, when we have regard to section 92, sub-section 14. And thus as well by the application of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius as that by the inherent character of the subject-matter, having regard to what has already been said, everything directly involved herein has been disposed of.\nIn the next place the power given by the \"British North America Act\" in section 91, relative to peace, order and good government, expressly excludes the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. I am thus unable to find the power to direct claimed to have been conferred.\nLet the interpretation of the law of Canada now before us in section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" be considered here.\nI submit as to that, wide as some of its expressions are and possibly partially inoperative we must never, if we can help it, attribute to Parliament the purpose of intending to exceed or of even unintentionally exceeding its powers, and must give its enactments operation so far as not ultra vires.\nThe final paragraph declaring what is decided to be held a final judgment of the court binding on the parties for purposes of appeal implies that there must have been before the court parties concerned who can appeal. There can be no appeal unless parties of some kind are affected; no one can be heard to appeal who has not appeared.\nSomething it may be said so omitted we are to supply by nominating counsel.\nI prefer, if possible, assuming Parliament never intended such a submission as those respecting powers over which it has no control, or power to meddle with, and where no one will appear or can be brought forward to appear. I prefer assuming the legislation presupposed that the provinces would appear in accordance with the practice I have already adverted to; either willingly or by force of public opinion; or at all events that the jurisdiction is to be restricted in other cases to the classes of appeals such as involved in the Manitoba School Case[25], or relative to the laws of Canada, wherein no question of a conflict with a province or its exclusive rights and powers could be at all involved or anything relative thereto.\nLet us assume for the present that no appeal is taken from such expressions of our opinion. The nominating of counsel to appeal is unprovided for.\nLet us assume each of these questions answered in such \u00e0 way as to derogate from or deny the right of the provinces to legislate in a way they have long been accustomed to do, and thus cast doubt on the legal existence of \u00e0 vast number of corporate bodies and the legality of contracts innumerable.\nAre we to assume that our opinions no matter how much we may protest that they do not bind, will be treated as contemptible and of no effect? To do so would be to encourage a contempt for the highest court in the Dominion.\nLet us assume that our opinions are treated with the respect due to such a court, and we may shake to its foundation the commercial seats of business and interests of the country.\nWe may be thus placed by asserting jurisdiction between contempt on the one hand and disorder on the other.\nOr let us assume that an appeal is taken and the court above us has as heretofore refused to answer or to attempt to solve in that way mere speculative or theoretical issues. Where are we left? Where can we and how can we remedy the evil plight into which we have plunged our court or the commercial interests we have involved; or perhaps both.\nThis court has consistently and most properly said that when there is a doubt of our jurisdiction we must refuse to act or to presume we have it.\nI submit with respect that there is the gravest doubt of our jurisdiction.\nAs germane to what I have already said of the constitutional models and problems involved in the framing of the \"British North America Act,\" and the inherent improbabilities of such a thing being attempted as the creation of our court with such powers, I might be permitted to refer to the history of such references in the United States. In my opinion on the \"Lord's Day\" Case[26], I referred thereto, and now make the further reference to Black on Constitutional Law, p. 84, where a further collection of authorities may be found.\nThese all indicate that short of an express authority engrafted as it must in all such cases be in the State Constitution, and adopted by a direct vote of the people, such a thing is non-existent in that country and in a most restricted form even in the few cases permitted.\nWe know we are much indebted to the experience of that country for the form of government we in Canada enjoy. I think we can despite what may have been said to the contrary, in arriving at the true interpretation of our \"British North America Act\" (brought into being when civil war there had become an object lesson which bore fruit in the form of federation adopted by that Act) especially on questions of this kind, receive most useful lessons both of instruction and warning from the experience of that country and from many of its master-minds that have dealt with the solving of such problems as are now presented to us.\nWhen one has pondered over the constitutional problems they have been engaged with, the solution of and the long time it has taken to solve some such questions as propounded to us herein which we are expected to do within a few weeks, one must feel the wisdom of making haste slowly.\nOur Constitution like that of the United States, consists largely of enumerated subject-matters and powers to be exercised exclusively in respect of same without any attempt at definition of how or how far by federal or provincial authority respectively.\nI may be permitted in relation thereto to draw from one of the sources I have indicated an enunciation of principles that are worth considering.\nThat great judge, Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme Court, whose long life-work was taken up in a great part with solving problems arising out of such conditions, in one of his judgments in speaking relatively to this feature which is common to our \"British North America Act\" and the Constitution of the United States, said:\u2014\nA constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves. And speaking of the constitutional question then before him, he says:\u2014\nIn considering this question, then, we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding.\nIt has been said that it is quite competent for Parliament to impose upon this court any duty it sees fit, and the election case of Valin v. Langlois[27], (from which judgment leave to appeal was refused[28], is relied upon.\nI am quite unable to see any analogy, in some of these submissions to that case.\nThat case would go a long way to maintain the proposition that any judicial duty within the competence of Parliament to create might be imposed upon us but falls far short of what is involved in some of these questions submitted.\nCan Parliament constitute this court a tariff commission, a civil service commission, a conservation commission, a department for the management of any of the affairs of state, or an adjunct to any of the departments discharging such duties, or an advisory adjunct to the provincial courts?\nIt matters not to reply that these things are unlikely to be proposed.\nIt is a bare question of the power to impose any other than a judicial duty and that relative to the laws of Canada. When argument goes beyond that limit any one of these extreme questions is an apt answer to such a pretence.\nI do not deny for one moment the competence of Parliament to constitute a Board for any one of these suggested purposes or to annex thereto an advisory committee for purposes of inquiry into and answering questions of law.\nBut I do say that no such or the like duties can be imposed upon this court. And I most respectfully submit (if we bear in mind not only that it is a constitution we are expounding but one as clear as any thing can be, not entirely written in express words, but to be inferred from the nature of things as understood by the highest authorities and the language of the \"British North America Act\" itself), that it clearly would not be any more competent for Parliament to do so than to constitute the Minister of Justice the supreme court.\nThe legislative, executive and judicial functions of government must be kept separate if we are to maintain the principles of government we enjoy, and which it was intended we should enjoy.\nIf we degrade this court by imposing upon it duties that cannot be held judicial but merely advisory and especially in the wholesale way submitted herein, we destroy a fundamental principle of our government.\nI am speaking of jurisdiction. I am dealing with the power of Parliament relative to the constitution of a judicial tribunal.\nThe production of a thesis on such subjects as involved in some of the questions submitted, which can only be answered in some such form, might be a profitable mental exercise but seems beyond the scope and purview of anything permitted by the \"British North America Act\" as part of any judicial duty.\nTo any one who supposes all or any of these suggestions as to the duty we are asked to undertake as fanciful, let him turn to the hypothetical questions put, and some that are not so purely hypothetical, but all intended to be disposed of on an ex parte argument decisive of the right of nine provinces to legislate on a variety of subjects. Let him turn to the cases giving rise to some few of the many contentions involved, and having read them and considered, again read these questions.\nIs there not involved, in the very essence of what is attempted, the taking away of men's rights or liberties without due process of law?\nWas the doing of that not the fundamental reason that led to the remonstrances that brought about the granting of the great charter that such things should not thenceforth be done?\nIt seems to me so and in the highest sense there can never be supposed to have been or to be any implication justifying such a thing as possible within the powers to be used for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nThe Manitoba School Case[29], was relied upon.\nThat case and the legislation anticipating it of which section 60 is now the substitute in a more extended form was a disposition by this means of the discharge of a judicial duty or quasi appellate judicial duty, which was cast upon the Governor-General in Council by the \"British North America Act.\"\nParliament was held to have a right to delegate the discharge of part of that duty to this court. It was and is an entirely different question from what arises h\u00e8re.\nIt has no relation to what arises herein. If the mere statement of the legal facts relative to each of these two classes of cases cannot be grasped so that their distinction becomes thereby clear, it would, I fear be hopeless to make anything I have said understood.\nIn the one case we have a duty expressly cast by the \"British North America Act\" upon the authorities which have to deal with both the adjudication and the execution of the judgment, and these same authorities may well be implied to have inherently possessed the means of disposing of such an appeal to be resolved in some way. In the other there is not in the slightest way any express duty cast upon the Dominion to delimit the sphere of action of the provinces. And nothing in that regard is implied save by virtue of section 101. And there is nothing that can be reasonably implied therein of an extra-judicial nature. There is, therefore, nothing to rest upon as in the other case any shadow of excuse for claiming the like right or power relative to this court.\nAgain it is said that it need not be an ex parte argument for this court can designate some counsel to represent the provinces or any one concerned in spite of them and their resolve not to appear.\nI mention it lest my repeated reference to the ex parte nature of the kind of proceeding taken should lead any one to suppose I had overlooked this.\nIf any one thinks that or the exercise of that supposed power can render the proceeding any other than ex parte in every essential, then I most respectfully submit he has failed to grasp the nature of the problems to be solved.\nWhen the provinces have done their best and exercised the greatest care and study of the facts and the operation of the conditions to be understood if a right conclusion is to be reached one may well doubt if it is possible to find continuously existent that depth of insight into the future to reach right conclusions. A direct specific power of supervision by means of the veto is assigned to the Dominion as the corrective of any presumption on the part of any provincial legislature to exceed its powers. Does not that direct power exclude the adoption of any indirect method such as the expedient now in question? A workable conclusion can never be reached save by the slow methods that from time to time have been exercised to solve other questions of law and liberty by a treatment of concrete cases as the occasions arise.\nIn referring to the history of the \"British North America Act,\" the improbabilities that history suggests relative to its scope and purposes and the inconveniences and considerations of the possible consequences of any such mode of proceeding as now in question as proper to be had in view in arriving at the true interpretation of the powers it confers or fails to confer, I may be told this Act is a written instrument that must be construed by what it contains.\nI agree it is so to a certain extent and I think I have demonstrated from what it contains the absolute negation of any such power of interference with the exercise of the powers of the provinces as claimed herein. But beyond that when and where the terms of the instrument may be found ambiguous we must, I submit, approach its interpretation somewhat after the fashion or in the like manner in which we approach any other written instrument of ambiguous import and have as its surrounding circumstances, regard to its origin, its general character and purposes and then these considerations I have adverted to may well be borne in mind. When we turn our attention to the omission to define in detail the enumerated powers as already referred to and the omission of much more I have not referred to, the careful student will find much need for a knowledge of history and especially of constitutional history to aid him in the interpretation of this instrument.\nIn conclusion I hold that if we have jurisdiction we are in duty bound to answer so far as our knowledge and understanding enable us to.\nI hold further that if in our collective view it is held or if any of us in his individual view holds we have no jurisdiction to answer and Parliament no power to give that jurisdiction, we are and each of us is, in duty bound to say so, and abide by that position until the court above has on appeal decided otherwise.\nDuff J.\u2014The objection taken in limine by the provincial governments is that the questions in so far as they expressly call for an expression of opinion respecting the extent of the legislative powers of the provinces are such as Parliament has no authority to require or authorize this court to answer. I think it cannot be disputed that Parliament might constitute a body (whether described as a court or not) empowered to exercise a purely consultative jurisdiction in respect of questions touching the limitations imposed upon the legislative powers of the Dominion or the provinces in respect of any given subject. This authority would seem to be a necessary adjunct to the legislative authority with which Parliament is invested\u2014limited as it is (within the boundaries of Canada) by reference to the powers conferred upon the local legislatures. Subject to some limited exceptions ( with which we are not here concerned), full legislative authority within Canada is divided between Parliament and the provincial legislatures. All such authority as is not given to the legislatures is vested in Parliament. In most cases in which controversy arises respecting the limits of Dominion legislative authority the limits of provincial authority are to a greater or less extent involved. Very obviously, I should think, it must frequently be desirable if not absolutely essential that Parliament be in a position to inform itself as thoroughly as possible in advance of legislation upon any particular subject, not only how far its own powers extend in reference to that subject but what authority may be lawfully exercised by the provinces in relation to it. Parliament may desire in some cases to legislate to the full limit of its own powers. In other cases it may be desirable that as far as possible legislative action in given conditions should be left to the local legislatures. In all such cases the advantage of trustworthy legal advice respecting the constitutional authority of the Dominion and the provinces respectively must be evident. It seems, therefore, to be outside the range of dispute apart from any special provision that authority to take such steps must be regarded as involved in the grant of the legislative powers conferred upon Parliament. The substantial question presented by the appeal is whether there is anything in the character of this court as a \"general court of appeal for Canada\" established under section 101 of the \"British North America Act\" which is necessarily incompatible with the exercise of the functions that section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" professes to require the court to perform. In other words, is there anything in section 101 which by-necessary implication prohibits the exercise of such functions, by a court of general appeal for Canada established under it?\nI am not able to reach the conclusion that the constitution of a general court of appeal for Canada under this section would necessarily involve the exclusion of such a jurisdiction. The jurisdiction conferred by section 60 is consultative merely. The advice although expressed in the form of a judgment and given after argument, is not a judicial deliverance of this court as a court. It is consequently not binding on anybody\u2014neither upon the government asking for advice nor upon interested parties, who take part in the discussion. The opinions expressed do not, in my judgment, constitute judicial precedents by which this court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 101 can be bound or by which any court whose judgments are appealable to this court can be bound.\nI do not think that the connotation of the term \"general court of appeal for Canada\" involves any interdiction upon the exercise by that body of such extra-judicial functions. Under the constitution of the United Kingdom (and the first paragraph of the preamble of the \"British North America Act\" discloses the intention that the Constitution of Canada shall be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom) the business of judicature is and has always been performed by bodies and persons invested with other powers, legislative, administrative or consultative. The highest court of appeal in the United Kingdom is a legislative body. Some of the powers of the High Court of Justice are really administrative powers formerly exercised by the Lord Chancellor in his administrative capacity. Even habeas corpus seems to have been thought by an eminent judge (Lord Bramwell in Cox v. Hakes[30], at pages 525-6) not to be an act of judicature. The Lord Chancellor has been a member of the cabinet since cabinets existed, and has always exercised wide administrative powers. The common law judges have always been subject to be summoned by the peers to advise upon questions of law. The High Court of Justice in one instance at least (under section 29 of the \"Local Government Act\/' 1888), exercises a purely advisory jurisdiction, Ex parte County Council of Kent[31]. There is nothing then in the fact that this court is a court which according to traditional British notions is necessarily inconsistent with the exercise of such duties. Nor do I think there is anything in the circumstance that the court, as constituted under section 101, is a court of appeal. The \"Supreme Court Act\" confers or professes to confer upon the judges of this court jurisdiction in habeas corpus where the question involved relates to criminal proceedings under a statute of the Parliament of Canada; and I do not think the validity of this provision has ever been questioned. I have mentioned the Lord Chancellor,, and the House of Lords; and even the High Court of Justice now exercises appellate jurisdiction. In none of these cases, as I have pointed out, has the exercise of legislative administrative or advisory functions been regarded as incompatible with the judicial character of the body exercising those functions.\nThe objection to some extent is also rested upon section 92, sub-section 14, of the Act. I quite agree that if section\" 60 on its true construction required this court to do* any act directly affecting the action of the courts of any of the provinces in respect of such a question either by way of declaring a rule which those courts should be bound to follow or creating a judicial precedent binding upon them, or upon this court in its capacity as a court entertaining appeals from the provincial courts under section 101 or imposing on this court any duty incompatible with the due exercise of its jurisdiction in respect of such appeals\u2014such for example as pronouncing, ex parte, at the behest of the executive upon a question raised, inter partes, in such an appeal\u2014 I quite agree, I say, that if that were the effect of section 60 then the validity of that section might be open to objection as Dominion legislation professing to deal with the subject of the administration of justice in the provinces after a manner not justified by the \"British North America Act.\" But I do not think the submission (for advice) of questions relating to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces or the giving of such advice necessarily constitute such an interference with the administration of justice.\nI should, perhaps, add that I do not wish to be understood as expressing any opinion upon the propriety of the questions now before us. I confine myself to the precise point raised by Mr. Nesbitt.\nAnglin J.\u2014If the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to enact it depended solely upon section 101 of the \"British North America Act,\" I am not certain that section 60 of the \"Supreme. Court Act\" would be intra vires. The duties which it imposes do not appertain to the work of \"a general court of appeal for Canada\"; and the constitution of this court \"as an additional court for the better administration of the laws of Canada\" (Sup. Ct. Act, sec. 3), I incline to think, contemplates its having jurisdiction to interpret, apply, and carry out (administer) such laws rather than to act as the adviser of the executive, or of Parliament, or its component branches, upon questions of jurisdiction to enact prospective legislation (sec. 60 (d) ). It may be that, having regard to the preamble of the \"British North America Act,\" the power to create a court involves the right to impose upon it the duties prescribed by section 60 and that, ex vi termini, when constituted it is endowed with the powers necessary to enable it to discharge such duties. But such implied or inherent jurisdiction, whether legislative or judicial, is apt to prove, like public policy, \"a very unruly horse.\" Its limits are vague and ill-defined. It may become a specious pretext to cloak an unwarranted assumption of power. I prefer to rest my opinion that section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" is intra vires upon the provision of section 91 of the \"British North America Act,\" empowering Parliament\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nIn section 92, which deals with the \"exclusive powers of provincial legislatures,\" I find no subject enumerated with provincial jurisdiction over which anything in section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" could be deemed an interference. It has been argued that the administration of justice in the provinces[32] would be affected by the exercise by this court of the jurisdiction which section 60 purports to confer. If Parliament had attempted to give to opinions of this court thus obtained the effect of judgments inter partes, there would be much force in this contention, because, assuming the validity of the legislation, provincial courts might then properly deem themselves bound to regard such opinions as binding upon them. But the express declaration that, except for purposes of appeal to His Majesty in Council, the opinion of the court on any reference under section 60 is \"advisory only\" (sub-section 6), denudes it of all the other notes of a judgment of this court sitting as \"a general court of appeal for Canada,\" leaving this court itself and every other court throughout the Dominion\u2014inferior as well as superior\u2014free to disregard it. The views of members of this court upon the character and effect of their answers to questions referred to them under section 60 have been expressed in several cases:. Re Provincial Fisheries[33] at page 539; Re Sunday Labour Legislation[34]; In re Criminal Code[35]. I therefore fail to perceive in the impugned legislation any interference with \"the administration of justice in the provinces.\" On no other ground was it suggested that section 60 invaded the field of legislation exclusively assigned to the provinces.\nThe words of the \"British North America Act,\" empowering Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada,\nare apt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to. Riel v. The Queen[36], at page 678. Lord Chancellor Halsbury, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, further said that their Lord-ships were of the opinion that there is not the least colour for the contention\nthat if a court of law should come to the conclusion that a particular enactment was not calculated as matter of fact and policy to secure peace, order and good government that they would be entitled to regard any statute directed to those objects, which a court should think likely to fail of that effect, as ultra vires and beyond the competency of the Dominion Parliament to enact.\nParliament having the responsibility of legislating must be allowed to decide for itself what particular measures are calculated to promote peace, order and good government. If its legislation does not on the one hand trench upon the exclusive domain of provincial legislative jurisdiction and on the other does not overstep the restrictions necessarily flowing from the inherent condition of a dependency, or conflict with paramount Imperial legislation, no court may question its validity, because\nthe \"Federation Act\" exhausts the whole range of legislative power, and whatever is not thereby given to provincial legislatures rests with the Parliament. The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[37], at page 588;\nand \"when acting within the limits\" of its jurisdiction our Parliament\nhas and was intended to have plenary powers of legislation, as large and of the same nature as those of the (Imperial) Parliament itself. The Queen v. Burah[38], at page 904.\nThat Parliament could have provided for the creation of a body of law officers and have imposed upon it the duty of advising upon such questions (speaking generally) as are now propounded for our consideration admits of no doubt. I know of nothing to prevent its requiring the discharge of such duties by lawyers who happen to be members of this court. The wisdom of such legislation as a matter of policy Parliament and not this court must determine.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that we may not decline to entertain this reference on the ground that section 60 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is ultra vires of Parliament.\nI reserve consideration of whether and how far each of the several questions included in the present reference falls within the purview of section 60 and can be or should be answered, until we have had the advantage of argument and discussion upon them.\n[1] 26 Can.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Beck J. at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe plaintiff company brought the action to recover $5,185 and to enforce a lien, under the provisions of the \"Mechanics' Lien Act,\" 6 Edw. VII. c. 21 (Alta.), for the unpaid balance of the price of materials supplied during the months of August and September, 1907, to one Short, who was the contractor for the erection of a number of buildings for the appellant (defendant) on his land, in the City of Calgary, in Alberta. The plaintiffs had supplied materials to Short, during the construction of the buildings, up to the end of July and had been paid therefor. The contractor being unable to complete his contract, on or about the 1st of October the appellant, in order to save his property, took over the works and completed the buildings. No formal cancellation of the contract with Short was made, but the evidence shewed that it had been in fact so taken over by the appellant; that all subsequent payments made by him were necessary to complete the buildings and that, added to payments formerly made, the amount paid largely exceeded the contract price. It also appeared that, at the end of July, the payments made to Short and upon his order amounted to a sum in excess of what was then due and owing to the contractor for the works executed by him up to that date. All claims for work and materials supplied in connection with the buildings had been paid \"with the exception of the balance claimed by the plaintiffs. On 5th September Short gave his promissory notes to the plaintiffs for the full amount of their claim and these notes were discounted by them, but, being dishonoured\" by the maker at maturity, they were subsequently paid by the plaintiffs.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Beck dismissed the action and held that, under the circumstances of the case, there never having been any sum owing and payable to the contractor by the owner at the times when delivery of the materials were made by the plaintiffs in August and September, no lien attached. This judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, allowed the appeal with costs and restored the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nThe appellant appeared in person.\nChrysler K.C. and Clifford Jones for the respondents.\n[1] 2 Alta.

They had a right to renewal or compensation but not to both.\nAfter the original term expired the lessees remained in possession, paying the same rental as before, for a further term of 21 years, no formal lease therefor having been executed and none demanded or tendered for execution. Ten years after the expiration of this second term they were dispossessed and claimed compensation for .improvements by petition of right.\nHeld, that the rights of the lessees were the same as if the original term of 21 years had been formally continued, or renewed, for a further like term.\nHeld, per Idington J., Girouard J. contra, that the lessees having obtained a renewal their right to compensation was gone.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014The lease was probably not renewed within the meaning or the lessor's covenant, but there having been no proof of a demand for renewal and the lessees having remained in possession for the entire period for which they could have claimed a renewal, they can have no right to compensation for improvements. If they ever had such a right in default of obtaining a renewal it is barred by the Statute of Limitations.\n[Page 596 ]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada in favour of the suppliants.\nThe facts are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nDewart K. C. for the appellant. If the contention of the lessees as to the effect of the covenant for renewal is sound the lessees could claim renewal or compensation in perpetuity. This has always been discountenanced by the courts. See Lewis v. Stephenson[1]; Nudell v. Williams[2]; Sears v. City of St. John[3].\nTo provide for a perpetual right of renewal the covenant should contain such expressions as \"renewal for ever,\" \"renewable from time to time,\" or others equivalent to these terms. See Furnival v. Creio[4]; Clinch v. Pernette[5].\nMowat K.C. for the respondents. The lease must be construed most strongly against the appellants.\nThe word \"continue\" has been held in covenants similar to that in question here to involve perpetuity. See Furnival v. Crew4.\nIf the language is ambiguous evidence of surrounding circumstances can be relied on to explain it: Clinch v. Pernette5; and such evidence shews that the parties intended a succession of renewals.\nSee also Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), sec. 1198.\nDewart K. C. for the appellant.\nMowat K.C. for the respondents.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014I dissent for the reasons given in the court below. Davies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014In Hyde v. Skinner[6], (decided so long ago as A.D. 1723), which was the case of a claim by an executor of a lessee for a renewal of a lease, which the lessor had covenanted to renew at the same rent and on the same covenants upon the request of the lessee, who had laid out a considerable sum of money in improving the premises, and where the executor had within the term requested the lessor to make a new lease for fifty years, the court said\nthe meaning of this covenant was to the end the lessee might be reimbursed the money which he had laid out in improvements of the premises for which reason it is immaterial whether the testator or the executors required the renewal.\nAnd the court directed a renewal for the term of twenty-one years being a usual term, but held that though it had been covenanted that it was to contain the same covenants that could not extend to the inserting a covenant for another renewal.\nFrom that time to this the holding has been almost uniformly against the insertion in the renewal lease of such a covenant unless the language used in the contract expressly or by very clear implication shewed such was the intention of the parties.\nI have looked at all the cases upon which respondent relied in argument and a very great many more to see if there was authority for the contention of perpetuity or the more moderate claim, which I was inclined to think might appear, that-the renewal lease if executed would likely if settled by a court have been directed to have inserted therein the same as that in the lease in question and which I am about to quote,\nI can find no authority to support herein any such proposition as either I suggest.\nThe case of Swinburne v. Milbum[7], is illustrative of the modern way of looking at such a covenant and contains references to the leading authorities on the subject and indicates no material change of view from the old one I have referred to.\nThe lease in question herein was for twenty-one years \"renewable as hereinafter provided.\"\nThe only provision making any further reference to the subject is the following:\nAnd, it is further agreed by and between the parties to these presents, that after the end and term of twenty-one years as aforesaid, if the said Commissioners or their successors in office shall or do not continue the lease of the said water and works to the said parties of the second part or their assigns that they the said Commissioners or their successors in office shall pay the said parties of the second part, or their assigns or any person or persons making erections under them with their consent, the full amount of their expenditure, or the value of the same, for the construction of any race or water course, lands, mills and mill houses, or any other tenement with their machinery and appurtenances thereto in any wise belonging, the same to be determined by arbitrators mutually approved of, by the parties to these presents, each choosing one man and they the third, when the said parties of the second part and the parties making erections under them as aforesaid, or their assigns, shall upon receiving payment in full for the erections and appurtenances so arbitrated for as' above, assign and surrender to Her Majesty the Queen, or her heirs and successors, all their right, title and interest thereto, whether in lands, buildings or other erections.\nIt seems to me the utmost that can be made of this covenant illuminated if possible by the preceding phrase is a covenant for a single renewal and no more.\nThe authorities would not have carried the parties or committed them further. Such a renewal lease, I repeat, could not, against the will of the lessors, have the renewal of this covenant inserted therein.\nThere is thus no right to any relief by way of compensation for improvements made during the second term (if we are to hold there was in fact a second term as I think we may on the principle that equity looks on that as done which ought to have been done), or for the years since its expiry.\nThe lessees in short had a right to expect compensation if they did not enjoy a second term. If the lessors did not permit the enjoyment of the second term by way of compensation for the improvements theretofore made by the lessees they were to be compensated therefor.\nThe lessees continued in undisturbed possession of the property and paid the same rent which relatively speaking and having regard to lessor's expenditure on the premises was almost nominal.\nThe lessees or one of them says in a letter written the Department in charge, and put in without objection I infer, that he had some years previously asked orally for a renewal lease, but was told it could not be granted until the new canal line \"was definitely settled\" and would like some modification if and when made out. That was replied to as follows:\nJune 12th, 1880.\nSir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 8th ult. wherein you apply on behalf of the St. Catharines Hydraulic Company for a renewal of their lease bearing date 14th of May, 1851 (and numbered 1420), as modified by certain changes which you desire to make in the wording thereof, I am directed to inform you that before the terms of the present lease can be altered in any way, the proposed changes must first be submitted for the approval of and be settled by this Department; and if material in character may even require the sanction of an Order in Council. However, nothing can be done with reference to the matter until you have furnished for the information of the Department a statement of the changes required and the names of those at present entitled to hold under the said lease.\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) F. Braun,\nSecretary.\nEvery one seemed to assume the lessees not only had a right to renewal but were enjoying it.\nThat changes incidental to the projected changes in the canal which were referred to might have required modification is all that was said. No one ever refused them a renewal. They made no tender of a renewal lease. And wherein is there a breach of the covenant above quoted?\nOn what principle can the lessees receive anything?\nThe covenant was that if the lessors did \"not continue the lease of the said water and works,\" the lessors should pay for something described of which the value was to be fixed by and in the method specified and upon the terms specified.\nIt does not say how the lease was to continue. It does not say it shall be in writing so continued or how. It does not say whose duty it was to prepare or settle the said lease if presumed to have been intended to be in writing.\nAre damages for breach of this covenant to be awarded though the covenant never was broken?\nIt seems to me a singular sort of claim. The enjoyment of the lease for another term was the compensation the parties intended to be given. It is just as clear to my mind as the court found and expressed a hundred and eighty years ago in the case I first cited, though the idea of compensation being basis of claim to remuneration was not there reduced to such explicit terms as used here.\nThe reduction to writing of what the parties really were about should not alter the thing itself.\nIt is said this compensation is to be made for what was done nearly forty years ago and possibly sixty years ago.\nAnd why? Because the lessees relying on the honour of the lessors did not bother their heads to get a writing made out; and never specified the changes wanted, but doubtless enjoyed them all the same.\nThey have got what they contracted for and if for an instant they had supposed themselves in the slightest degree put in peril I do not think we would have found the files so barren of complaint as they seem when emptied into this case indiscriminately as it seems to have been done.\nBut why if there was a refusal and semblance of a foundation for what is now set up was there nothing done to bring about an arbitration? It was by means of an arbitration the amount to be paid was to have been fixed. It was only on the payment of that so arbitrated about that the lessees' possession could have been disturbed.\nThe chances are that if such a thing had ever been dreamed of as disturbing these lessees we would have some evidence of it.\nThere is not a shadow of such a thing. On the contrary after nearly sixteen years of this renewal term had run, the Government wanting to anticipate for some reason its expiry sent its officer to negotiate for the surrender of the term.\nIt is thus plainly written that no one thought of disturbing the lessees for a moment. It might pay to be rid of them for it turned out they were making a surplus of rents every year and by reason of the changes in the canal were getting a better bargain than they had anticipated, but as nothing was said when second term began could not be asked now for increased rent. See letter of Mr. Fissieault of 26th August, 1887.\nIt is urged that by reason of the term not having been fixed definitely the lessees have suffered. I find nothing to prove such a claim and have no doubt every one knew the term was as certain as if in writing.\nProvisionally $21,000 was fixed upon by the negotiations, but evidently either such a price was more than worth while giving or that the proposal could not stand fire in the House of Commons and had to be dropped.\nNow this incident is put forward as giving some sort of confidence in support of the claim made.\nTo my mind that story shews clearly enough all concerned knew the lease must run until the 1st January, 1893.\nThe utmost a renewal lease could have given bearing on the point of compensation would have been the insertion which I have shewn to be against authority of a covenant identical with the above. Assume it done, how could any action on such a covenant relate back to and indemnify for what had been done during a prior term?\nAre the lessees to be better off than if they had got a formally executed lease with such a covenant? Yet such is the effect of the judgment.\nNot only do they thereby get what such a second lease would have given, but after enjoying it they are to have added thereto the compensation they were to have got if they had not enjoyed it. And subject to what in such a case should go into the lease the rights of the parties should be so treated accordingly.\nIt is clear that the issue of specific performance at the time could have been foiled by relying upon the covenant which left only one escape and that was arbitration and compensation or specific performance.\nHow can those who omitted that, now claim on flimsy evidence relied on here, that there was a breach of the covenant?\nThe Statute of Limitations it seems to me ought to have been pleaded against such a stale claim.\nFor some good reason possibly, though not disclosed, it was not.\nIf for greater safety it is desired now to plead the Statute of Limitations, I think it ought to be permitted but on payment however of all costs since the filing of defence.\nBut for the reasons I have set forth I have failed to find that breach of covenant that alone can lay any foundation for any assessment of damages and the appeal should be allowed and action dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Upon my construction of the original lease \u2014 if the landlord elected not' to pay compensation for improvements at the end of the term\u2014the lessee thereupon became entitled to a renewed lease containing the covenants of the old lease including that respecting compensation for improvements. I am not at all in agreement with the assumption that the covenant now under consideration is (for the purpose of ascertaining what were to be the covenants of the renewed lease) to be treated as that of a simple covenant for renewal. The rule that such a covenant for renewal is not reproduced in the subsequent lease (under a general covenant that the subsequent lease shall contain all of the covenants of the original lease) has been put on various grounds. In Harnett v. Yielding[8] such a covenant (for renewal) was held by Lord Redesdale not to be a covenant incidental to the enjoyment which was said to be the test to be applied for determining whether a particular covenant was to be inserted in the renewed lease. In Iggulden v. May[9], the rule was put by Lord Ellenborough on the ground that if so extraordinary a thing as a right of perpetual renewal was to be granted the intention would have been marked by some unequivocal words as \"from time to time.\" In Lewis v. Stephenson[10] [Bruce J.] it is said that the rule may be put upon the ground that \"the renewal of a lease,\" in its strict literal terms, means the renewal of the same term for the same period. In Swinburne v. Milburn[11] the rule is put by Lord Blackburn on the ground that the perpetual right of renewal is so unusual that a heavy burden rests upon him who asserts a right to it; and much to the same effect are the views expressed by Lord Fitzgerald.\nI am unable to find one among these grounds applicable to the covenant under consideration. If we take the reasoning of Lord Redesdale, which perhaps is the true foundation of the rule, can it be fairly said that the payment of compensation is not incidental to the enjoyment as much as, let us say, the covenant to leave in good repair? Or that of Lord Blackburn or of Lord Ellenborough\u2014what unusual thing is there about such a covenant as that which we have before us? There is in this covenant nothing necessarily importing perpetuity: there is nothing remarkable, nothing out of keeping with the ordinary provisions of ordinary leases. And if the observation of Mr. Justice Bruce has any force as applied to a covenant to pay compensation, it seems equally applicable to many other covenants admittedly falling within the contemplation of such a covenant as that before us.\nThere remain some subsidiary points. It is too late \u2014 the Crown having with the lessees acted on the assumption of the existence of a second term\u2014to raise the question of want of authority. The Statute of Limitations cannot, I think, avail because it seems to me we must treat the situation as if a lease had actually been executed; and, moreover, I do not agree that it is a proper case for an amendment at this stage, no application having been made even on the hearing of the appeal. The Crown stands, therefore, in the same position as if at the end of a second term there had been improvements executed under a covenant in a lease for that term. Such a covenant in the same form as that in the original lease would not apply to improvements made during the first term; and the right of recovery must therefore be limited to compensation for improvements during the second term.\nThere should, I think, be judgment for the value of such improvements to be ascertained in the usual way if the plaintiff chooses to take the reference\u2014costs to be reserved.\nAnglin J.\u2014Having regard to the facts that the term demised to the respondents was for twenty-one years \"renewable as hereinafter provided,\" and that the only other reference to renewal in the lease is in the words, \"if the said Commissioners or their successors do not continue the lease of the said water and works,\" found in the clause respecting compensation, I am of opinion that the word \"continue\" was used as the equivalent of \"renew\" and must be given that meaning. The continuance contemplated was not indefinite, but was in the nature of. a renewal and, in the absence of a designation of any other period, for a further term of the same duration as that originally created \u2014 21 years. Price v. Assheton[12].\nI am further of opinion that the lessees would not have been entitled to the insertion in a renewal lease for such further term of an agreement for payment of compensation for improvements in default of a further renewal. The agreement in the original lease is that such compensation will be paid by the lessors, if they \"do not continue the lease\" \u2014 \"after the end and term of twenty-one years as aforesaid.\" That means that the lessees shall have either a renewal or compensation \u2014 not both, but one or the other. Upon a renewal being granted the right to compensation would be extinguished. It follows that if the lessees have had a renewal for a term of 21 years they have had all that they are entitled to and cannot have any valid claim for compensation.\nIf, on the other hand, the proper conclusion upon the evidence is that there was no renewal of the lease, two questions arise: The first, had the lessees, without a demand for renewal and refusal or neglect by the lessors to comply therewith, an enforceable claim for compensation for improvements; the second, if they had such a right of action, has it been barred by the Statute of Limitations?\nThe original term expired in 1872. In 1880 the lessees, having had no renewal lease, made application to the Crown for renewal, but with some modifications which they spoke of as \"trifling changes\" in the description of the leasehold property. No definite reply was made to their request for renewal; but they were informed that\nbefore the terms of the present lease can be altered in any way the proposed changes must first be submitted for the approval of and be settled by this Department; and if material in character may even require the sanction of an Order in Council. However, nothing can be done with reference to the matter until you have furnished for the information of the Department a statement of the changes required and the names of those at present entitled to hold under the said lease.\nSo far as appears by the correspondence in evidence, the lessees did not, otherwise than by the letter of 10th November, 1880, which was apparently not answered, specify \"the changes required.\" They were perhaps not called upon to prove tender of a formal lease for execution (Cantley v. Powell, 1876[13]); but, having asked for a renewal with modifications, they should not only have proved that they had complied with the lessors' request for a statement of the changes required \u2014 but they should also have established that these changes were such as they were entitled to ask for. In the absence of such evidence no proper demand for a renewal lease is shewn.\nThe provision for renewal or compensation in the alternative was for the benefit of the lessees. While the lessors had the right to elect either to renew or to compensate, the lessees, on the other hand, were not bound to take a renewal: rather than do so they might forego their claim to compensation. I am, therefore, of the opinion that, as a first step towards establishing a right to compensation from the lessors for improvements, the lessees should have shewn that they had demanded such a renewal lease as the lessors had agreed to give them if unwilling to pay compensation for improvements. Not only does the evidence not prove such a demand, it shews a request for a renewal with changes, which, prima facie, the lessees had not the right to ask, and, if anything, an unwillingness on their part to accept such a renewal as the lease provided for. I assume that in 1880 they were still entitled to demand a renewal lease for the remaining 13 years of the second term of 21 years. Buckland v. Papillon[14]; Moss v. Barton[15].\nThe correspondence indicates that the lessees dealt with their sub-lessees as if they had not obtained a renewal. In 1883 the assistant engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals reported against giving a renewal of the lease. A similar report was made by him in 1887. Inquiry being then made by the Department of its legal officer whether, if the lease were renewed, the rental could be increased, a reply was given that if a renewal should be sought after the 1st Jany., 1893 \u2014 when the second term of 21 years would expire\u2014an increased rental and other conditions might be imposed by the Crown. Whereupon, on the 15th Oct., 1887, the officers of the Department appear to have reached the conclusion, stated in a departmental memorandum, that \"the lease may continue to the end of the second 21 years * * * the lessees to be notified one year before the 1st Jany., 1893, that their lease will then mature and will cease after 1st Jany., 1893.\" There is no evidence that this conclusion was ever communicated to the lessees. They were, however, written on the 11th June, 1892, that their lease had been\ngranted for a term of 21 years renewable for a second term of 21 years which term will expire upon the 1st Jany., 1893. You are, therefore, hereby notified that this Department will not continue the said lease beyond the expiration of said term ending upon the 1st Jany., 1893.\nIn acknowledging this letter the lessees asked for the appointment of some suitable person to confer with them with a view of arranging compensation for improvements. The Department appointed Mr. Douglas for this purpose. As a result of negotiations which ensued a provisional agreement was arrived at \u2014 but, though recommended to Council for approval and apparently approved, that agreement was never carried out and, like an earlier similar agreement of 1888, seems to be unenforceable.\nThe lessees retained possession, paying rent according to the terms of the original lease of 1851, until dispossessed by the Crown on the 1st Jany., 1903.\nUpon the whole evidence I incline to the view that, as alleged by the petitioners in the 10th paragraph of their petition, \"the said lease * * * was never renewed or continued\" within the meaning of the phrase \"continue the lease\" in the compensation clause. They further allege that \"those under whom your suppliants claim thereupon became entitled to * * * the compensation provided for in the said lease.\" At bar in this court Mr. Mowat maintained that this was in fact the position. The compensation clause in the original lease had no application to the tenancy from year to year which probably subsisted after the 1st Jany., 1872. If without demand for a renewal a right to compensation could arise, it would have accrued at, or within a reasonable time after the expiry of the first term; the right of action, if any, accrued at the same time. In this aspect of the case the right of the respondents to compensation has long since become barred by the Statute of Limitations, the mere fact that they retained possession not preventing its running; and the Crown should not be precluded from setting up this meritorious defence.\nBut, for the reasons I have already indicated, I am, with respect, of the opinion that, in the absence of evidence of a demand for a renewal pursuant to the terms of the lease, the petitioners have failed to establish an enforceable claim.\nThis appeal should therefore be allowed and the petition should be dismissed with costs; but if the appellant desires to amend by setting up the Statute of Limitations, that may be done only on payment of all costs subsequent to delivery of the statement of defence.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

Shipments were to be made f.o.b. cars at various points in the Province of Quebec to the port of Saint John, N.B., and were to be subject to inspection and rejection at the ship's side there by government officials. Some of the hay was refused by the inspector, as deficient in quality, and some for short weight in the bales. In weighing, at Saint John, fractions of pounds were disregarded, both in respect to the hay refused and what was accepted; there was also a shrinkage in weight and in number of bales as compared with the way-bills. The hay so refused was sold by the Crown officials without notice to the suppliants, for less than the prices payable under the contract, and the amount received upon such sales was paid by the government to the suppliants. In making payment for hay accepted, deductions were made for shortage in weights shewn on the way-bills and invoices, and credit was not given for the discarded fractions.\nHeld, the Chief Justice and Davies J. dissenting, that the appellants were entitled to recover for so much of the amount claimed on the appeal as was deducted for shrinkage or shortage in the weight of the hay delivered on account of the government weighers disregarding fractions of pounds in the weight of that accepted and discharged from the cars at Saint John. Per Girouard, Idington and Duff JJ. The manner in which the government officials disposed of the hay so refused amounted to an acceptance which would render the Crown responsible for payment therefor at the contract price.\nJudgment appealed from (12 Ex. C.R. 198) allowed in part with costs, the Chief Justice and Davies J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], which dismissed the suppliants' petition of right with costs.\nThe case is stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014Towards the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 the petitioners entered into certain contracts, nine in number, for the sale of a large quantity of hay to the Canadian Department of Agriculture for account of the Imperial Government. The contracts are substantially similar, though not identical in form, and provide for the delivery of the hay f.o.b. cars at shipping points in the Province of Quebec, but subject to inspection and rejection at the ship's side at St. John, N.B. The hay was intended for shipment to South Africa for the use of the Imperial troops during the late war. in that country. The contracts specify in detail the quality of the hay and the size, weight and shape of each bale. The petitioners, by their petition of right, preferred a number of claims amounting to a large sum of money; but all were abandoned at the trial with the exception of two amounting respectively to the sum of $544.50 and $2,317.59. The first item was for hay alleged to have been improperly rejected by the Government inspectors and disposed of without notice to the owners; and the second for an alleged shortage resulting from the improper methods adopted in weighing the hay at St. John. The trial judge says:\n(1) The suppliants came forward with evidence of about as loose a character as could be possibly presented in support of their claim, and but for the production of information and evidence by the Grown it would have been almost impossible to arrive at the conclusion as to what they were claiming. The Crown has brought forward certain statements which shew the amount of hay rejected, and the reasons given for the rejection.\n(2) All the evidence amounts to is practically this, that the suppliants, no doubt, honestly intended to supply hay in accordance with the contract, and they took it for granted that the parties from whom they bought the hay were supplying them with hay of a quality and weight which would fill the requirements of the contract.\nIt is admitted, however, that a certain quantity of hay was rejected and afterwards sold without notice to the petitioners and that when weighed at St. John it was found that the weight of the hay did not correspond with the weight given on the way-bills.\nTwo questions are to be considered: First, was the hay properly rejected as of inferior quality to that called for by the contract? Secondly, was full credit given for all the hay actually received and shipped to South Africa? Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the contract read as follows:\n5. The hay to be subject to inspection and acceptance by the department alongside the steamship at St. John, New Brunswick. In case more than ten (10) bales in any carload are found not up to the specifications, the whole of such carload may be rejected; and the balance of the contract or contracts then unfilled may be cancelled in the case of any shipper from whom more than three carloads have been rejected in that way.\n6. The price to be fourteen dollars ($14.00) per ton of two thousand pounds f.o.b. cars, shipping point. 7. A number of bales in each car to be weighed at St. John by an inspector for the department; the weight of the carload to be determined on this basis, and any short-weight that may be found to be charged against the shipper.\nI am of opinion that under this contract made in the Province of Quebec the hay remained the property of the vendor until it was weighed after having been found to be on inspection up to the standard of quality called for. It appears that competent inspectors were sent to St. John and the uncontradicted evidence is that they carefully inspected the hay when it was taken from the cars and placed in the sheds on the wharves and, again, when removed from the sheds to the ships, and that none was rejected except that which was not up to the requirements of the contract; so that the title to that rejected hay never passed from the vendor to the vendee (1474 C.C.). It is admitted that the department sold the rejected hay of the various shippers for the best price obtainable, forwarded them a true and correct account of all such transactions and remitted the proceeds of all sales. The allegation is that it was necessary to sell the rejected hay because the wharves and railway sidings at St. John were so congested with excessive shipments that it became necessary to clear the premises. Admitting that the Government officials were not strictly entitled to dispose of petitioners' property in this way, there is no evidence that the appellants suffered any damage and for this technical misdoing on the part of the officials, I would not hold the Crown liable in the special circumstances of this case.\nIt has been argued, however, that by the sale of the rejected hay an active dominion was exercised over it which constituted acceptance. If the buyer deals as owner with goods sold and delivered to him subject to inspection before acceptance this may be received as evidence of an intention on his part to accept; but the act of dominion must be such as would justify a jury in finding that the vendee has accepted the goods. But where there is, as in this case, evidence of rejection after inspection, then a subsequent dealing with the goods, not as owner, but as trespasser, if you will, does not constitute acceptance, though the party who does it may be liable for a tort. There is no evidence here of the exercise of any dominion over the goods from which it is possible to infer that the Crown at any time dealt with the rejected hay as owner and there is evidence to justify the conclusion that the suppliants tacitly acquiesced in all that was done and accepted the cheque sent them with the account on 25th July, 1902, as a satisfactory settlement\u2014the present claim not having been brought forward for about three years after the hay was sent to South Africa and a considerable time after all the accounts had been closed between the Department of Agriculture and their principals, the Imperial authorities. I am also of opinion that paragraph 5 of the contract was intended to give and did give to the department the right to reject any carload of hay in which more than ten bales were not up to the specifications; but there was no obligation to do so, and it was in the discretion of the department to accept any portion of any carload that was up to the requirements of the contract and to reject that portion that was below those requirements.\nAs to the complaint with respect to the weight, Lieutenant Walker H. Bell says:\nMy instructions were to test each individual ear, and, during that time, I do not think that any one car escaped me. I flatter myself that it did not, at all events. It was customary to take ten bales from each car and they were not taken from any one particular spot in a car. As soon as the cars were broken open by the -stevedores, the man would go in and get the hay, and from the time the car door was broken open until the hay was tested, I would be around there all the time. The bales would be tested from different parts of the car. Some would be taken from the top, some from the middle and some from the bottom, as the hay was being taken out. Each separate bale was weighed and measured at the same time.\nHe adds that he took the exact weight of each bale and made correct returns to Ottawa, and upon those returns the accounts were finally rendered and the cheque for the balance ascertained to be due paid over.\nThis evidence, which was not contradicted, and as to which Lieutenant Bell was not even cross-examined, establishes that the requirements of section 7 above cited were complied with. The only evidence we have as to the weight to support the suppliants' case is, as found by the trial judge, that they took it for granted that the parties from whom they bought gave them the weights that they paid for. There is no evidence of the exact weights except that which is to be extracted from the returns made by the Government officials.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014I would allow this appeal entirely, because, under the contract, the Crown was not authorized to sell hay rejected. There is no voucher of the price which this sale realized nor of the party to whom it was made. The Crown should at least have been in a position to give this information when requested to do so in St. John, N.B. This is the principal reason why I would allow the full quantity of the hay which the witness Lucier says was shipped in good condition, deduction, of course, being made for what was received and paid for. The majority of this court does not share this view of the case. My brother Idington is also for allowing the appeal in toto; two of the other judges are for dismissing the appeal; and the fifth, Mr. Justice Anglin, is for allowing in part.\nNot being able to have my conclusion adopted, I declare myself in favour of the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin, who is to allow the appeal in part with costs before this court. This is the first time since I have had the honour of a seat on this Bench that the individual opinion of one judge became the judgment of the court.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur with the judgment of the Chief Justice, but desire to add a few words upon that part of the claim put forward for what was called \"shortage.\" I have read this evidence very carefully and concur with the trial judge in the statement that\nthe suppliants came forward with evidence of about as loose a character as could possibly be presented in support of their claim\na remark applicable to the entire case. But on the question of shortage the plaintiff's case rests entirely upon a remark or statement made by Macfarlane, one of the defendant's witnesses, when being cross-examined. He was, what he himself described, superintendent of the shipments of hay, but I cannot gather that he interfered in any way with its weighing or had any personal knowledge of that. Answering, however, the following question relating to the method of weighing:\nQ.\u2014Although the shipper had invoiced it (a bale of hay) at ninety-nine pounds if you found it to weigh only ninety-eight and three-quarters you stamped it at ninety-eight pounds.\nA.\u2014Yes, we could not give one-quarter of a pound. We could not take the odd fractions at all. That is not customary in weighing anything wholesale.\nAlthough this evidence is very general and seems only to have been given with reference to what the witness thought was a general custom, and not as to what actually occurred in this case, it might have been enough to found some kind of a claim for at least the quarter-pound discarded if not of all the odd fractions. But the claim on this head was not allowed by defendants to rest on this general and unsatisfactory statement of Macfarlane. Moore, who was in charge at Ottawa under Professor Robertson of the detail work in connection with the shipments of hay, explained very fully and minutely how the accounts had been made up, and that under the term \"shortage\" what was charged back to claimants was not the actual short weights only, but short number of bales delivered. He contended, in accordance with a letter he wrote claimants on 16th May, 1902, that\nthe greater part of the shortage was caused by the fact that the number of bales received at St. John was less than the number invoiced by you.\nThe remaining part of the shortage, therefore, as to which only there could be any question at all was caused by short weights in the bales. On this point claimants' contention, based on Macfarlane's statement, above quoted, was met by the evidence of Lieutenant Bell, the officer who was \"inspector of weights and general specifications of all storage contracts.\" He described with minuteness the manner and way in which he discharged his duties with respect to selection of the bales to be weighed and the manner of their weighing, and, after stating that \"each separate bale was weighed and measured at the same time,\" he was asked, \"Did you take the necessary time to get the exact weight and measurement of each bale,\" and answered, \"I consider that I did.\" Now Lieutenant Bell was not cross-examined except to prove that he had not taken any oath under the \"Inspection Act,\" His evidence was accepted by both parties and not a bit of evidence of any kind was given by suppliants to throw even doubt upon his truthfulness or accuracy. On this evidence, therefore, I cannot see that the learned trial judge could make any other finding on the point than the one he did.\nIdington J.\u2014The Dominion Government acting on behalf of the home Government undertook to buy immense quantities of hay for the South African War.\nThe department in charge of the business, by a memorandum of agreement which specified the terms and conditions of purchase, offered to buy from the appellants, at a named price per ton, a specified number of tons of hay compressed into small bales of which sizes and weights and shape and mode of tying appear to have been important things to observe. The appellant accepted by a memorandum of acceptance at the foot. In all there were nine such contracts with the appellant.\nThe hay was to be as described and \"to be shipped for St. John\" not later than a stated date, but from where does not appear, unless implied to be from the residence or place of business of appellants where they accepted the contract.\nThe price was fixed \"f.o.b. cars shipping point.\"\nThe provisions for inspection were as follows:\nThe hay to be subject to inspection and acceptance by the department alongside the steamship at St. John, New Brunswick. In case more than ten (10) bales in any carload are found not up to the specifications, the whole of such carload may be rejected; and the balance of the contracts then unfilled may be cancelled in the case of any shipper from whom more than three carloads have been rejected in that way.\nInspection of goods bought by sample or description is one of the purchaser's rights.\nThe time, place, opportunity and method thereof being unprovided for has time and again given rise to litigation.\nThe parties concerned here expressly provided for all these things as above.\nIf there had been no such provision the law would have bound the buyer to accept or reject the whole at the point where inspection could rightfully be exercised.\nThe vendee has no right of selection unless given it out of a vendor's tender at any one time,\nThe right was in no way modified by this provision beyond its exact terms,\nIts terms seem clear, simple and direct. The place for inspection is fixed. The vendee was not driven to the necessity of rejecting or accepting a whole train load. There was a limited power given as to each carload. The right as to that was accurately defined. If ten bales in a car, which was, be it noted, about two and a half per cent. of the whole car, fell short of what the specifications called for, the vendee had the right to reject that car. No right of selection within that limit was given. None could be in law implied any more than in respect of a tender of the whole at one time.\nIf three carloads fell short the right, and the only right, given was to rescind the whole contract. Surely the protection\u2014the unusual, but prudent, protection\u2014 thus given against imposition was ample. The vendee in any case in the absence of express provision has the legal right of action for damages for non-fulfilment of the contract if the goods are not up to description or sample.\nThe incidental right to resist full payment may also exist and to these rights I will presently refer.\nWhat the vendee's agents did in this case was to presume to make a selection which they were not entitled to either in law generally speaking or by the special terms of this contract.\nThe agents of the vendee thus not only without any right to do so, but of their own mere will took the goods and re-sold them.\nI am quite unable to understand how, in law, this assertion of dominion over the goods (in respect of which a supposed mental reservation is alleged to have been made) can be anything but an acceptance thereof. If a vendee takes the goods it does not matter to the vendor what his secret intention may be or what use he makes of them.\nThe law on the point seems settled in accordance with common sense by the case of Chapman v. Morton[2] and others of a like character.\nThe cases of an acceptance induced by deception when the acceptance may be withdrawn or of apparent acceptance resulting from mistake are entirely another matter.\nThe assertion and exercise of dominion was such as to leave a clear right of action to appellants in this case. They were not parties in any way to the selection or rejection or other imaginary name one chooses to call it.\nThe mere receipt of part payment, unacknowledged at the time or later, save as a fact at the trial, cannot affect the legal result.\nIt was certainly present to the minds of those framing the specifications that some bales would fall below the standard unless they assumed hay-dealers had reached a higher stage than the rest of humanity and would succeed in turning out only absolutely perfect work and ensure its being carried quite dry for hundreds of miles.\nIt was no doubt also present to the same minds that the event of slight failures should be provided for. This, I think, they did by reducing the possible default to a minimum and a very small percentage of the whole. In this case it would have turned out to be about one and a half per cent. of inferior, but not necessarily worthless hay.\nIf governments in their contracts could always reach so safe a line they would be doing well, and, indeed, better than ordinary business men.\nBut assuming, as I think we must, that a perfectly legal intention and method of action are to be imputed to the Crown, we find, I repeat, these goods accepted by reason of what was done.\nThe implied warranty there was, or right to the reduction of price for failure in quality may have been open to the respondent at the trial. But, in either case, the burthen of proof rested upon the respondent, and that has not been attempted.\nThe mere rendering of an account and making such a claim supported even by general evidence of the course of inspection and the results reached by the agents of the respondents is not alone sufficient.\nThe general evidence given by the appellants of their hay having been up to the standard displaces (and refutes, if refutation is needed) all that which at its best furnishes no presumption.\nAs the case stands I think appellants entitled to judgment on this branch of the case for $554.50 and interest from the date of last remittance.\nAnother matter more difficult to deal with is the actual weight of the hay.\nOn the one hand appellants have proved their weighing it and claim that is the only thing left to govern the rights of the parties.\nOn the other hand the contract specifies a mode of weighing and determining the quantity.\nThat was as follows:\nA number of bales in each car to be weighed at St. John by an inspector for the department; the weight of the carload to be determined on this basis, and any short weight that may be found, to be charged against the shipper.\nIn carrying this out the odd fractions of a pound were deducted from each bale weighed. Macfarlane says in evidence as follows:\nQ.\u2014Were you present frequently when they were weighing the hay ? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You weighed ten bales in each car ? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Supposing one bale was taken out and it was apparently ninety-nine pounds, and your weighers found it to weigh only ninety-eight and three-quarter pounds, the shipper only got credit for ninety-eight pounds? Isn't that right? Although the shipper had invoiced it at ninety-nine pounds, if you found it to weigh only ninety-eight and three-quarter pounds, you stamped it ninety-eight pounds? A.\u2014Yes. We could not give one-quarter of a pound. We could not take the odd fractions at all. That is not customary in weighing wholesale.\nQ.\u2014These bales that you have mentioned as being taken from each car, were weighed one at a time? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Individually? A.\u2014Yes.\nThis system adopted was clearly not that laid down by the contract. The contract said that a number of bales from each car were to be weighed and the weight of these bales was to determine the weight of the car.\nHowever excusable the docking of the fractional part of a pound in the total weight of ten bales as specified, or per car, might have been, this is not that, but a gross violation of the language of the contract.\nFor aught we know there might by this system be deducted nearly a pound per bale, and that as the bales had to be not less than 95, nor more than 105 pounds each, the loss or deduction might approximate one per cent. on the whole shipment.\nThe entire quantity was 10,106,733 lbs., and the half even of one per cent on this is not a trifle perhaps to appellants.\nThe half of that even which probably is nearer their actual loss on this score is at $14 a ton, something a frugal man should not despise.\nThen there are cases of short shippings, but of these we have only two cars specified and the identification in regard to them covers only sixteen bales or less than a ton.\nIf the respondent's agents had failed to weigh any, the weights proven to have been shipped would have to be rebutted.\nA weighing that is so obviously defective and against the contract does not rebut or stand for anything.\nI have no doubt a little patient investigation of the records kept will enable the department to clear these matters up, and it would be worth while for both parties to have this made.\nIf they cannot agree there should be a reference in regard to these items of short weights and short shippings. Duff J.\u2014With respect to shortage of weights and shipments I agree with the view of Mr. Justice Idington. On the remaining contention of the appellants\u2014that in the circumstances of the case the onus was upon the Crown to prove that the hay was below the standard prescribed by the contract, and that they failed to do so\u2014I think the appellants should succeed.\nThere was a right of inspection and consequently a right of rejection at St. John if the hay should not correspond with the description under which it was sold. Rejection means something more, however, than putting aside physically with the intention of rejecting. It means some unequivocal act on the part of the purchaser conclusively manifesting an election to reject\u2014 a return of the goods, an offer to return them, or notice signifying the purchaser's rejection and that the goods are held at the seller's risk. In Fisher v. Samuda[3] at p. 193, Lord Ellenborough states the rule in these words:\nIt was the duty of the purchaser of any commodity, immediately upon discovering that it was not according to order, and unfit for the purpose for which it was intended, to return it to the vendor, or to give him notice to take it back;\nand it will be found stated in the same terms in Cous-ton, Thomson & Co, v. Chapman[4] at pages 254, 256 and 257, and in Grimoldby v. Wells[5] at page 395. The reason of the rule is thus explained by Lord Ellenborough in Hopkins v. Appleby[6]:\nWhen an objection is made to an article of sale, common justice and honesty require that it should be returned at the earliest period, and before the commodity has been so changed as to render it impossible to ascertain, by proper tests, whether it is of the quality contracted for * * * . It was incumbent on the defendants to give the seller an opportunity of establishing his case by the opinion of intelligent men on the subject, and not throw a veil of obscurity over it, and debar the party from the fair means of ascertaining the quality * * * . The party who extinguishes the light, and precludes the other party from ascertaining the truth, ought to bear the loss.\nFailure on the part of the seller to notify the buyer within a reasonable time constitutes an election by the buyer against a rejection for the reasons Lord Ellenborough states. A fortiori any act of the buyer which in Lord Ellenborough's language precludes the purchaser from \"ascertaining by proper tests the condition of the property\" at the time of inspection and at the same time puts it out of the power of the purchaser to return the property must be treated as an election by the purchaser to accept. In this case both these conditions were present and the act of the agents of the Crown relied upon by the appellants \u2014 the sale of the goods \u2014 was, moreover, an act of dominion such as has been held to constitute in itself an acceptance. In the last edition of Benjamin on Sales, at page 752, the editors, referring to Chapman v. Morton[7], and Parker v. Palmer[8], make this comment upon those cases:\nThe two preceding cases shew that a resale by the buyer after he has had an opportunity of exercising an option either of accepting or of rejecting the goods delivered is an acceptance, for by reselling he is presumed to have determined his election.\nAt the argument I was disposed to take the view that the sale of these goods was an independent tortious act, and that this proceeding was an attempt to sue the Crown for a tort committed by its servants; but under the contract the Crown was bound, I think, to have at St. John somebody with authority to accept or reject the hay, and the acts of the departmental agents there having such authority must, I think, be taken as a whole. Taken as a whole, these acts must, on the principles above stated, be held as between the Crown and the appellants to constitute an election not to reject the hay.\nNor when one looks at the history of the rule do I think there is any foundation for a contention which at first sight appears to be susceptible of plausible statement, viz., that the rule in principle rests upon estoppel and, therefore, has no application to the Crown. It would be stretching the doctrine that estoppels in pais do not bind the Crown beyond, I think, all reasonable limits to hold that in cases of purchase of goods by the Crown the considerations upon which Lord Ellenborough bases the rule requiring prompt and unequivocal notice of rejection on the part of the purchaser, have no application. The rule, whatever its history, is now a substantive rule of law (it is embodied in section 35 of the \"Sales of Goods Act\") ; and there seems to be no satisfactory ground upon which it can be held that it does not apply to transactions between the CroAvn and a subject. The Crown was, therefore, liable for the price of the hay sold subject to any reduction that might properly be claimed (under the rule in Mondel v. Steel[9]) as representing the difference in value arising from the inferiority of its quality; and, on this latter issue, the onus was upon the Crown to shew that the hay sold did not conform to the description contained in the contract. This, I think, has not been satisfactorily proved.\nI should notice also the argument that the sale of these goods was justified by the course of business between the parties. A course of business may, no doubt, as effectually as express words, produce a modification of the legal incidents of a contract of sale. Here, if it had been proved that the sale of these goods took place conformably to an established course of business known to and acquiesced in by the appellants, I should have had no hesitation in holding that the departmental agents in effecting the sale were acting within their authority as the agents of the sellers; but I have not found such proof in the record.\nAnglin J.\u2014 The fifth clause of the contract, in my opinion, entitled the Government inspectors to reject every bale of hay which they found to be below standard. If the number of bales \"found not up to the specifications\" should exceed ten in any carload, they might\u2014they were not bound to\u2014reject the entire carload without further inspection. I do not read the contract as entitling the vendors to compel the acceptance of at least ten bales of inferior hay in every carload, or precluding the rejection of less than whole carloads.\nThe evidence supports the finding that the inspectors properly rejected the appellants hay, which was not shipped to South Africa. I cannot assent to the view that in the circumstances of this case the subsequent sale of this rejected hay, which encumbered the Government sheds, constituted in itself an acceptance or affords conclusive evidence of an acceptance of such hay. At the most it would be cogent evidence of acceptance. Benjamin on Sales (5 ed.) (1906), page 752. The facts that the destination of all accepted hay was shipment to South Africa and that this hay was not so shipped, taken with the evidence of the officials as to its actual rejection and the reasons for its subsequent sale, make it clear that there never was an intention to accept it, and, in my opinion, establish that there never was in law an acceptance.\nMoreover, while such an act as the re-sale in question might, in certain circumstances, be held to constitute an acceptance by estoppel, in the case of the Crown the acts of its servants or agents do not bind by estoppel. Bank of Montreal v. The King[10]. The re-sale of the hay may have been such a conversion of the appellant's property as would render an ordinary purchaser liable in damages. But for tortious acts of its servants the Crown may not be held responsible.\nI agree with the view expressed by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court as to the meaning which should be ascribed to the phrase \"f.o.b. cars\" in the sixth clause of the contract, and I am of opinion that for so much of the sum of $2,292.41, admittedly deducted for shrinkage or shortage in weight and for shortage in the number of bales delivered, as represents shortage in the number of bales delivered, the appellants cannot recover. Mr. Moore says that the greater part of the deduction of $2,292.41 was in respect of \"short shipments\"; but some part of it was made for deficiency in weight of bales, and in regard to this portion of the appellants' claim I think they are entitled to some relief, although the actual sum for which they should receive credit may be comparatively small. I concur in the comment of Mr. Justice Idington upon the evidence of the defence witness, Macfarlane, and in my learned brother's appreciation of the method of weighing described by that witness; and I do not find in the sketchy testimony of Lieutenant Bell anything which satisfactorily meets Macfarlane's statement. Bell was not cross-examined, it is true; but neither was Macfarlane re-examined in regard to the method of weighing the bales of hay as described by him in cross-examination. If not before, certainly after Macfarlane's evidence had been given, the burden was, in my opinion, upon the Crown to prove that whatever amount had been deducted for shortage in weight of bales had been rightly so deducted. This involved proving that the weight of the hay accepted for shipment had been ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the contract. This the Crown failed to do.\nUpon the evidence as it stands, a legitimate inference would seem to be that by reason of the disregard of all fractions of a pound in the weighing of each individual bale of the number of bales weighed to ascertain the average weight per bale in each carload, pursuant to clause 7 of the contract, a substantial deduction for shortage in weight has been unwarrantably made. The amount so deducted, the appellants are, I think, entitled to recover.\nUpon the present record it is impossible to determine what this amount is. Unless the parties can agree upon it, there should be a reference in the Exchequer Court to ascertain it, if the appellants so desire.\nShould the respondent admit an amount to be due on the basis of this judgment, which the appellants are willing to accept, they should have judgment for that amount; or, in default of agreement, for such amount as may be found due to them upon the reference, if they elect to take it. Their election should be notified to the respondents within one month from the date of this judgment. The appellants have failed upon a substantial part of their appeal, but only by an equal division of opinion in this court. They have succeeded in respect of a part of their appeal, which may or may not prove to be substantial. But they were compelled to come to this court for such relief as they have obtained. They should have their costs of this appeal. The costs of the action in the Exchequer Court, including the costs of the reference now directed, should be reserved to be disposed of by the judge of the Exchequer Court after the reference is had, if it be taken, and, otherwise, after the time for election by the appellant shall have elapsed.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Co. v. Brown (20 Can. S.C.R. 203) followed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was for the recovery of $1,133.53 claimed by the town corporation as the amount of an instalment of taxes extending over a period of twenty years (which, in gross, exceeded $2,000) imposed on the lands of the defendant as a special tax for the improvement of the highways of the municipality. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court, at the trial, and the appeal was asserted from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench affirming this decision. The questions raised on the argument of the motion are stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice now reported.\nL. H.

The defence is based on grounds that involve the liability of the respondent for the whole assessment, and the judgment appealed from is conclusive on the liability in any action for the other instalments. By the conclusion of the declaration the appellants have with much care limited the matter in controversy in this proceeding to the amount of the one instalment due ($1,133.53), and they could not, if successful, get judgment for more.

Ritchie (Defendant) Respondent\n1910: October 18, 19; 1910: November 2.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nContract\u2014Implied warranty\u2014Fitness of machinery\u2014New agreement \u2014Breaches prior to new contract\u2014Relinquishment of rights under former agreement. R. & N. purchased threshing machinery from the company, in Nov., 1906, under an agreement similar to that in part quoted below, and gave notes for the price. They dissolved their business connection, after using the machine for some time, and, in March, 1907, after the threshing season was over, N. was released from his obligations under the agreement, the notes signed by R. & N. were cancelled, and R. gave the company his own notes in their place and entered into a new agreement containing the following provisions: \"The said machinery is sold upon and subject to the following mutual and interdependent conditions, namely: It is warranted to be made of good material and durable with good care and with proper usage and skilful management to do as good work as any of the same size sold in Canada. If the purchasers after trial cannot make it satisfy the above warranty written notice shall within ten days after starting be given both to the company at Winnipeg and to the agent through whom purchased, stating wherein it fails to satisfy the warranty and reasonable time shall be given the company to remedy the difficulty, the purchasers rendering necessary and friendly assistance together with requisite men and horses; the company reserving the right to replace any defective part or parts; and if the machinery or any part of them cannot be made to satisfy the warranty it is to be returned by the purchaser free of charge to the place where received and another substituted therefor that shall satisfy the warranty or the money and notes immediately returned and this contract cancelled neither party in such case to have or make any claim against the other. And if both such notices are not given within such time that shall be conclusive evidence that said machinery is as warranted under this agreement and that the machinery is satisfactory to the purchasers. If the company shall at purchaser's request render assistance of any kind in operating said machinery or any part thereof or in remedying any defects such assistance shall in no case be deemed a waiver of any term or provision of this agreement or excuse for any failure of the purchasers to fully keep and perform the conditions of this warranty. When at the request of the purchasers a man is sent to operate the above machinery which is found to have been carelessly or improperly handled said company putting same in working order again the expenses incurred by the company shall be paid by said purchasers. This warranty does not apply to second-hand machinery. It is also agreed that the purchasers will employ competent men to operate said machinery. There are no other warranties or guarantees, promises or agreements than those contained herein. All warranties are to be inoperative and void in case the machinery is not settled for when delivered or if the printed language of the above warranty is changed whether by addition, erasure or waiver or if the purchasers shall in any respect have failed to comply herewith.\"\nSome defects in the machinery had given rise to complaints, during the previous threshing season, and had been rectified by the company before the execution of the second agreement; they also made further repairs during the Autumn of 1907 and then notified R. that future repairs must be at his own expense. R. paid the first installment of the price of the machinery, but, when subsequently sued on his other notes, contested the claim, pleaded breach of an implied warranty of fitness and counterclaimed for damages for this breach.\nHeld, that all claims for damages for breaches of any kind prior to the second agreement had been waived by that agreement and that the provision that there were no other warranties, guarantees, promises or agreements than those contained in the agreement excluded all implied warranties.\nHeld, further, that the condition requiring written notice of breach of warranty applied only to the warranty that \"with proper usage and skilful management\" the machinery would \"do as good work as any of the same size sold in Canada,\" and that it had no application to the warranties that the machinery was \"made of good materials\" and would be \"durable with good care.\"\nThe consideration for the release of N., and the acceptance of the sole liability of R. for the price of the machinery was the execution of the new notes and agreement which involved the relinquishment by both parties of all their rights under the first agreement. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the judgment of Beck J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained and the defendant's counterclaim was allowed for an amount equal to the plaintiffs' claim, one judgment being set off against the other and general costs allowed to the defendant.\nThe company brought the action to recover the balance due on the price of machinery sold, under the agreement mentioned in the head-note, and the defence and counterclaim set up that the plaintiffs had warranted the machinery sold as fit for the purposes for which it was manufactured and intended, that it did not fulfil the warranty and was defective in many respects and the defendant claimed damages for breach of the contract of warranty. At the trial, Beck J. entered judgment for the amount of the plaintiffs' claim, without costs, and awarded a similar amount to the defendant on the counterclaim, with costs, the defendant's judgment to be set off against the plaintiffs' judgment, pro tanto; the result being a judgment in favour of the defendant for the general costs of the action. This decision was affirmed by the judgment from which the present appeal was asserted.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nBennett K.C. for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree that this appeal should; be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. agreed in the opinion stated by Anglin J. IDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent and one Neuffel entered into a written contract agreeing to purchase a threshing machine and horse-power from the appellants and to give three promissory notes for the price and on delivery of these goods gave these notes for the price as agreed in December, 1906.\nThe machine was used for some time and then on account of some differences they came to an agreement between themselves whereby respondent was to acquire Neuffel's interest and assume the burden of paying the appellants and, thereupon, they abandoned their claims as against Neuffel and entered into a new agreement with respondent which ostensibly treated the transaction as a new bargain for the sale of these goods to respondent, who agreed thereby to purchase same from the company and give his notes for the price.\nThis latter agreement was upon one of the usual printed forms used by the appellants in the course of their business as manufacturers, as was the first bargain, and is dated 12th March, 1907.\nThe respondent before signing this, wrote, on the 4th March, 1907, a letter that complained of some things found unsatisfactory in the use or quality of the machine, but instead of refusing to. enter into the new agreement or trying to rescind the old agreement between the company and himself and Neuffel, he signed the new agreement and gave his notes.\nIn my view it is unnecessary to follow in detail all that was done with or in relation to the machines and the contract.\nSuffice it to say that the appellants sued respondent and besides pleading defences to the action he made a counterclaim for the breach of warranties (as I assume though by no means clear) express and implied by reason of damages he had suffered.\nThe learned trial judge found appellants entitled to judgment for the debt and this is not now questioned.\nHe besides found appellants liable for damages for breaches of warranties both express and implied relative to the machines. He found the machines in some respects not made of good material and in some parts badly constructed, neither of which are specified, and assessed the damages at such sum as equalled the appellants' claim in their action.\nThe learned trial judge then ordered judgment for plaintiffs' claim without costs and judgment for defendant, now respondent, on his counterclaim for a similar amount with costs and that the defendant's judgment be set off against the plaintiffs', pro tanto, leaving the costs to be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant.\nFrom this judgment the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court en banc claiming a reversal of the judgment for plaintiffs with costs. This appeal was dismissed with costs.\nThe only question of the many argued which I need, in my view of the case, refer to is whether or not there was any warranty either express or implied upon which the respondent can maintain his claim upon the counterclaim.\nThere seems to have existed throughout a strange misapprehension of the exact legal rights of the respondent.\nDamages seem to have been assessed for breach of the original warranties express and implied.\nHow can respondent claim any such damages here? That contract was one in which the obligation of the appellants, if any, was to Neuffel and Ritchie, and Neuffel is no party to these proceedings.\nBesides that contract was put an end to by what transpired. Another was entered into between the parties hereto making no reference to the previous contract, nor in any way transferring such claims, if any, as Neuffel and Ritchie had for breaches of the original contract.\nIndeed, even if such claims might have existed, they clearly were in law, and I think in fairness and justice also, extinguished.\nMoreover, the counterclaim rests expressly upon the later contract of the 12th March, 1907.\nThe language of this contract is evidently inappropriate to the business the parties had in hand. It contemplates a new machine had been ordered and had to be started which certainly was not the case.\nSome complaints, as I have already said, having been made by the respondent's letter of 4th March, I infer, led to appellants sending, though on the face of the transaction in no way bound to do so, a man to put the machines in proper condition in the following September.\nHow all this came about is not as clear as it might be, but no doubt appellants felt bound, by a due regard to their self-interest if nothing else, to pay heed to the respondent's complaints of the 4th of March, even if covered in law by his signing the contract of the 12th of March, to do something to satisfy him.\nThe repairs no doubt had been postponed by mutual convenience to the time a new harvest was in sight.\nHowever all this may be, a letter was written by appellants to respondent immediately after, to which no reply appears.\nAnd by the terms of that the respondent surely in good morals as well as law was bound then to object thereto or forever hold his peace. It would seem to be his misfortune and fate to have done neither.\nThe express warranty would seem as applied to the transaction unworkable and in* light of respondent's conduct a thing he cannot rely on.\nHe gave no notice as required by that, or protest against the terms of the letter.\nThen is there any implied warranty relative to this second sale ?\nI think not. It is impossible for me to say, whatever might have been said as to the original purchase in respect to which I express no opinion, that in regard to this second sale the respondent, in the language of section 16, sub-section 1, of the \"Sale of Goods Ordinance,\" was thereby giving an implied warranty or condition by implication to a buyer\nwho makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to shew that the buyer relies on the seller's skill and judgment, etc.\nIt is impossible to say he was so relying on the sellers' skill. The facts if nothing else exclude any such idea.\nNor does the language of sub-section 2 of the same section relative to sale by description help respondent. And other parts of the statute relied upon are still more irrelevant.\nMoreover, there is very much to be said in favour of the view that the express terms of the contract excluded reliance on any implied contract.\nI express, however, no opinion upon that for two good reasons; one that I am not called upon herein to do so, and the other that the party who chooses in an every day business dealing to employ vague and ambiguous language is not entitled to expect very much help from any court.\nAlthough the result must be to reverse the judgments of the court below and dismiss the counterclaim with costs on and up to and inclusive of the trial, I do not think I should interfere with the learned trial judge's judgment as to costs by altering the judgment for appellants so as to entitle them to costs of prosecuting their claim.\nOf course we never interfere to rectify a judgment as to costs only, but, when the appellants do in another substantial way succeed in appeal, the question of costs is also, I think, reviewable as a rule.\nThe ambiguous form of contract used I think has led to litigation herein.\nI do not agree in the learned trial judge's view of the respondent having been excused from trying to understand the writing. I must say, however, it is one I am quite sure should not be used and as to general costs of suit I would refuse them on that ground alone when there is reason to believe a frank, clear form of contract might have averted litigation.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs (appellants) brought this action upon promissory notes given by the defendant in payment of the price of an \"Eclipse\" thresher, a waggon-elevator for separator, and certain trucks. There was no defence to the plaintiffs' claim; but, by counterclaim, the defendant sought to recover damages for breach of a warranty that\nthe thresher and separator were fit for the purposes for which they were built and intended. The defendant and his then partner, or co-purchaser, one Neuffel, bought the separator and thresher from the plaintiffs in November, 1906. They then executed an agreement on the plaintiffs' usual form, similar to that executed at a later date by the defendant alone. They also gave their promissory notes for the price of the machinery. About the end of December, Ritchie and Neuffel determined to separate, and Ritchie agreed to take over Neuffel's interest in the threshing outfit. The agreement for the purchase of the trucks from the plaintiffs, dated the 3rd January, 1907, was accordingly made with Ritchie alone. On the advice of their agent that Ritchie was financially sound, the plaintiffs also agreed to accept his sole liability in lieu of that of himself and partner, for the separator and the thresher, stipulating, however, that Ritchie should execute a new agreement and should give new notes for the purchase money. Ritchie accordingly, on the 12th of March, executed a new agreement for the purchase of the thresher and separator from the plaintiffs and gave them the notes which are now sued upon. This agreement contains the following provisions:\u2014\nThe said machinery is sold upon and subject to the following mutual and interdependent conditions, namely:\u2014\nIt is warranted to be made of good material and durable with good care and with proper usage and skilful management to do as good work as any of the same size sold in Canada. If the purchasers after trial cannot make it satisfy the above warranty written notice shall within ten days after starting be given both to the company at Winnipeg and to the agent through whom purchased, stating wherein it fails to satisfy the warranty and reasonable time shall be given the company to remedy the difficulty, the purchasers rendering necessary and friendly assistance together with requisite men and horses; the company reserving the right to replace any defective part or parts; and if the machinery or any part of them cannot be made to satisfy the warranty it is to be returned by the purchaser free of charge to the place where received and another substituted there- for that shall satisfy the warranty or the money and notes immediately returned and this contract cancelled, neither party in such case to have or make any claim against the other. And if both such notices are not given within such time that shall be conclusive evidence that said machinery is as warranted under this agreement, and that the machinery is satisfactory to the purchasers. If the company shall at purchaser's request render assistance of any kind in operating said machinery or any part thereof or in remedying any defects such assistance shall in no case be deemed a waiver of any term or provision of this agreement or excuse for any failure of the purchasers to fully keep and perform the conditions of this warranty. When at the request of the purchasers a man is sent to operate the above machinery which is found to have been carelessly or improperly handled said company putting same in working order again the expenses incurred by the company shall be paid by said purchasers.\nThis warranty does not apply to second-hand machinery.\nIt is also agreed that the purchasers will employ competent men to operate said machinery.\nThere are no other warranties or guarantees, promises, or agreements than those contained herein. All warranties are to be inoperative and void in case the machinery is not settled for when delivered or if the printed language of the above warranty is changed whether by addition, erasure or waiver or if the purchasers shall in any respect have failed to comply herewith.\nIn addition to the warranty expressed in these provisions of the contract the defendant alleges that there was an implied warranty of fitness. His counterclaim as pleaded appears to be based solely upon this implied warranty and the judgment in his favour also rests upon it.\nThere would appear to have been a number of defects in the threshing machinery, which caused trouble and difficulty during the threshing season of 1906-7. This threshing season had come to an end before the execution of the agreement of the 12th of March, 1907. The plaintiffs had made good a number of these defects. In September, 1907, they made some further repairs to the machinery and then notified Ritchie that any future repairs must be at his own expense. Before signing the agreement of the 12th of March, 1907, Ritchie made complaint about the threshing outfit, alleging that it was a constant source of loss and worry on account of defects in material and workmanship, having broken down six times in the course of seven threshings during the winter of 1906-7. He paid the first installment of the purchase money under protest. The grain crop for the season of 1907-8 was a failure and there is no evidence that during that season the threshing outfit proved itself unfit for use. Only one or two small crops of grain were threshed and unsatisfactory results in that season may well be ascribed to the poor character of the grain itself.\nAssuming that the defendant is entitled, notwithstanding the terms of his contract above quoted, to set up and rely upon an implied warranty of fitness, the record contains no evidence to support a finding of breach of such a warranty subsequent to the 12th of March, 1907. Whatever breaches there may have been, prior to that date, of any warranty, express or implied, under the contract between the plaintiffs and Ritchie and Neuffel, were, in my opinion, waived when the contract of the 12th of March, 1907, was entered into. Moreover, I think the provision that\nthere are no other warranties or guarantees, promises or agreements than those contained herein\nexcludes all implied warranties. Upon this ground alone the defendant's counterclaim should fail inasmuch as it is based solely upon an implied warranty of fitness. But if, although he has not pleaded it, the defendant may, nevertheless, rely upon the express warranty above set forth, he is still confronted with insurmountable difficulties.\nUpon the proper construction of this warranty the provision requiring written notice of breach to be given to the company within ten days after starting, in my opinion, applies only to the warranty that\nwith proper usage and skilful management, the machinery will do as good work as any of the same size sold in Canada.\nIt has no application to the warranties that the machinery is \"made of good materials\" and will be \"durable with good care.\" The notice is to be given \"if the purchasers after trial cannot make it (the machinery) satisfy the above warranty.\" The purchasers had nothing to do with providing good material for the machinery or with making it durable. It was not their business to \"make\" it satisfy these warranties. It seems clear, therefore, that the provision as to notice can have no application to them.\nRitchie's failure to give the necessary written notice would preclude him from setting up breach of the warranty that\nthe. machine will do as good work as any of. the same size sold in Canada.\nBut as already stated, the evidence does not shew any breach of this warranty nor of the warranties as to good material and durability subsequent to the 12th of March, 1907. The consideration for the release of Neuffel by the company and their acceptance of the sole liability of Ritchie instead of that of Neuffel and Ritchie was the execution by Ritchie of the new agreement and his giving the new notes sued upon. The company expressly stipulated for both these things as conditions of Neuffel's release. Ritchie chose to assent to these terms. They involved the relinquishment by both parties of all their rights under the November agreement. The only agreement now in existence between Ritchie and the company is the agreement of the 12th of March, 1907. In order to succeed in his counterclaim he must, I think, prove breaches of warranty subsequent to that date. This he has failed to do.\nI am, therefore, with respect, of the opinion that the plaintiff's appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the full court of the Province of Alberta, and that the defendant's counterclaim should be dismissed with costs. The plaintiffs should also have their costs of the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n"}

Hislop (Defendant)\n1910: October 20; 1910: November 2.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nNegligence\u2014Injury on public work\u2014\"Public Works Health' Act\"\u2014Construction of statute\u2014R.S.C. 1906, c. 135, s. 3\u2014Regulations by order-in-council\u2014Breach of statutory duty\u2014Action\u2014Misjoinder. The provisions of section 3 of the \"Public Works Health Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 135, do not impose on a Government Department or a company constructing a public work the obligation to provide hospitals and surgical attendance for the treatment of personal injuries sustained by employees, whether of themselves or of their contractors or sub-contractors, in the construction of such work.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the judgment of Harvey J., at the trial, whereby the plaintiff's action was maintained as against the company, with costs, and dismissed in respect to the other defendant.\nThe plaintiff, a labourer employed by a firm of subcontractors engaged in the construction of a portion of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (a work being prosecuted under the control of the Parliament of Canada), while in the performance of his duties met with an accident by which his leg was broken. The injured limb was set and placed in a temporary splint at a local emergency hospital by the surgeon in charge, and the plaintiff was then transferred to the permanent hospital, at Edmonton, where he received treatment by Dr. Hislop, one of the defendants, until discharged from that hospital some weeks later. As a result of the injury the plaintiff's right leg remained shorter than the left and he lost the proper use of his right ankle. The action for damages was brought against the company and Dr. Hislop. The fault charged against the company was failure to provide proper surgical treatment and appliances, as required by the \"Public Works Health Act\" and the regulations made thereunder, by order-in-council, and it was also alleged that the medical attendant at the emergency hospital was not a properly qualified practitioner because he was not registered as such under the statute in force in the Province of Alberta. The other defendant, Hislop, was charged with malpractice. On an application, in Chambers, to compel the plaintiff to elect as to which of the defendants he would proceed against, Beck J.[1] held that these. causes of action might properly be joined, and, at the trial, the jury exonerated Hislop and found that the plaintiff's injury was the result of negligence on the part of the company in failing to provide \"a suitably equipped hospital, a duly authorized physician and attendants,\" in compliance with the terms of the \"Public Works Health Act.\" The action was dismissed in respect to Hislop and, on the findings of the jury, the trial judge ordered judg- ment to be entered against the company for the amount of damages assessed ($5,000), with costs of the action. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe issues in question on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nEwart K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed. The object of the Act is to provide for the protection of the public health, although the regulations apparently go beyond the statute. If the Act or the regulations in so far as they are within the statute have not been observed the duty of enforcing them lies with the Government inspector but in default of his doing his duty no action lies at the suit of a party injured against the company. The statute has not created a contractual relation between the company and the employee of a contractor who may have his recourse on his contract of hire or against the medical man; but as to this I express no opinion. I am quite clear, however, that there is no lien de droit between the respondent and the appellants; and the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin. IDINGTON J.\u2014The question is raised by this appeal of whether or not an action will lie upon the \"Public Works Health Act,\" being chapter 135 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, at the suit of one of the labourers upon a public work who in the course of his employment had some bones of his leg broken which, in consequence, required surgical skill and due care which it is found were not given.\nThe third section enacts as follows:\u2014\nFor the preservation of health, and the mitigation of disease amongst the persons employed in the construction of public works the Governor-General in Council may from time to time make regulations,\u2014\n(a) As to the extent and character of the accommodation to be afforded by the houses, tents, or other quarters occupied by the employees on the works;\n(b) For the inspection of such houses, tents, or other quarters, and the cleansing, purifying and disinfecting thereof when necessary;\n(c) As to the number of qualified medical men to be employed on the works;\n(d) For the provision of hospitals on the works, and as to the number, location and character of such hospitals;\n(e) For the isolation and care of persons suffering from contagious or infectious diseases;\n(f) As to such other matters or things as he may deem best adapted to attain the objects of this Act.\nThe sub-sections (c) and (d) standing alone might in some way have been given some operation applicable to such a case as the treatment of respondent's leg, but, clearly, the other sub-sections relate to subjects quite foreign thereto.\nNow, when we find these two sub-sections set in such a context and have regard to the primary and ordinary meaning of such phrases as\nthe preservation of health and the mitigation of disease,\ncoupled thus together introducing and furnishing the key-note of the whole it seems impossible to find there- in the purpose of providing an emergency hospital and surgery duly equipped for dealing with all that is involved in the product of accidents of any and every kind happening in the construction of great public works.\nThe subject-matter specified in sub-sections (c) and (d) must be held to relate to, and the regulations to be made thereunder to be such as to serve the obvious purposes of, the section as a whole.\nSome stress is laid by respondent's factum on expressions in the regulations adopted tending to lead one to believe a wider purpose was had in view.\nBut the regulations can add nothing to the objects of the statute.\nI need not say that, holding the opinion I express, it is unnecessary for me to give any opinion upon the important question of whether or not any liability to action can ever arise upon this statute.\nI may, however, be permitted to point out that if the statute had expressly provided for the deduction of a weekly fee from the workmen, as the regulations seem to provide for, it would have been easier to hold that it was within the purview of the statute that such an action should lie thereon.\nIt would also in such a case have been easier to have found some force in the argument put forward based on the hypothesis that such a fee was legally exacted.\nIts exaction seems to me bad both in law and in economics.\nAnd, inasmuch as the unfortunate plaintiff had not paid any such fee, I can find nothing in regard to it upon which to found this action.\nI regret to find no adequate legal machinery exists to enforce surgical and hospital provision to meet in a way that humane feelings dictate the necessities of the case of the ever-recurring accidents (inevitably attendant upon), the construction of public works.\nWhen they are carried on in the depths of the wilderness some such provision is needed.\nThe appeal must be allowed, and with costs if insisted on.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) was injured on the line of railway of the defendants, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, in course of construction between Edmonton and Pembina River. He sustained a fracture of the right leg. He admits that his injury was purely accidental. It is of his subsequent treatment that he complains. He was taken first to a temporary hospital distant about two miles from the place at which he was injured. His limb was there set and placed in a temporary wooden splint by the surgeon in charge, Dr. Culton, who is said not to be a duly qualified practitioner because his name does not appear upon the Medical Register of the Province of Alberta. He was then transferred to the hospital at Edmonton, a distance of sixty-five miles. The journey occupied nearly three days, being made partly in waggons and partly over the constructed line of railway. At the Edmonton Hospital he was. attended by the division surgeon of the railway company, the defendant Hislop, against whom he charges malpractice. After some weeks' treatment he left the hospital. His right leg is, as a result of his injury, now somewhat shorter than the left, and he has not proper use of his right ankle.\nThe action went to the jury against both defendants. In answer to the question Is the plaintiff's injury the result of any negligence on the part of the defendants ?\nthe jury replied \"Yes.\" And to the question\nIf so, in what did that negligence consist ?\nthey answered \u2014\nIn the failure of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company to comply with the terms of the \"Public Works Health Act\" regarding the providing of a suitably equipped hospital, a duly authorized physician and attendants.\nThis verdict involved a finding in favour of the defendant Hislop, against whom the action was dismissed. From that judgment no appeal has been taken. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company for the damages assessed, $5,000, and, on appeal, this judgment was confirmed by the full court of the Province of Alberta.\nAfter a careful perusal of the evidence I more than gravely doubt whether the permanent injuries sustained by the plaintiff are ascribable to the conditions found by the jury to constitute negligence on the part of the defendant railway company. Neither am I satisfied that, assuming the \"Public Works Health Act\" to require that the company should provide\na suitably equipped hospital and a duly authorized physician and attendants\nfor the care of employees, whether of themselves or of their contractors, injured during the construction of the railway, the evidence sufficiently establishes breaches of these duties. But, in the view I take of the purview of the statute, it is unnecessary to determine these questions.\nSection 3 of the \"Public Works Health Act\" reads as follows: 3. For the preservation of health and the mitigation of disease amongst persons employed in the construction of public works the Governor-General in Council may from time to time make regulations,\u2014\n(a) As to the extent and character of the accommodation to be afforded by the houses, tents, or other quarters occupied by the employees of the works;\n(b) For the inspection of such houses, tents, or other quarters and the cleansing, purifying and disinfecting thereof when necessary;\n(c) As to the number of qualified medical men to be employed on the works;\n(d) For the provision of hospitals on the works, and as to the number, location and character of such hospitals;\n(e) For the isolation and care of persons suffering from contagious or infectious diseases;\n(f) As to such other matters and things as he may deem best adapted to attain the objects of this Act.\n(2) Such regulations may be either general or special and may apply generally to all public works or specially to one or more public works or class of public works named therein.\nIn my opinion, the introductory words \"for the preservation of health and the mitigation of disease\" govern the construction of this entire section. These words exclude the idea that Parliament intended to impose upon persons and corporations in the position of the defendants an obligation to provide hospitals and medical attendance for employees injured in the construction of a public work as. defined in the statute. It is true that in the regulations passed by the Governor-General in Council under the statute there are several provisions which might, perhaps, indicate that in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council the Act was intended to apply to surgical cases of accident. But these provisions do not suffice to extend the obligations imposed by section 3. Assuming, therefore, that the defendants failed to provide a suitably equipped hospital and proper surgical attendance for the plaintiff, that would not constitute a breach of any statutory duty imposed on them by the \"Public Works Health Act.\"\nAssuming that it was sufficiently established that the plaintiff was liable under section 11 of the regulations to a deduction of fifty cents per month from his wages for medical attendance, and that the statute authorizes such a regulation, the medical attendance which this would oblige the defendants to furnish would probably be confined to that which the statute itself prescribes. But upon this branch the plaintiff has wholly failed to make out a case. He has neither shewn any actual deduction from his wages nor any agreement for such a deduction. He has not even shewn that such a deduction was contemplated or was actually made from the wages of other contractors' employees. Moreover, as already stated, I incline to the view that the evidence may not warrant a finding that the plaintiff's permanent injuries are due to any lack of hospital conveniences or of proper medical attendance.\nIt was further objected on the part of the appellants that the statutory cause of action against the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company was improperly joined with the common law cause of action against the defendant Hislop for alleged malpractice and that, as a result of such misjoinder, there had been a mistrial. Inasmuch as I would allow the defendants' appeal on the ground that it has not been established that they owed any statutory duty to the plaintiff, it is unnecessary to dispose of the question of misjoinder.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs in this court and in the Supreme Court of Alberta, and the action dismissed with costs. Appeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 2 Alta. L.R. 34.\n"}

I agree with Mr. Justice Perdue; the evidence leads us irresistibly to this alternative. Either there was no watchman in charge on the night of the fire, as there should have been; or, if there was, he failed to perform his duty. The conduct of those responsible for the safety of the ship is, in my opinion, inexplicable. No attempt was made to explain the origin of the fire or the failure to arouse the passengers in time to allow their escape and the only inference to be drawn from the silence of the defendant company is that they were grossly negligent.\nA question is raised on the pleadings which is not disposed of nor referred to in the courts below as to the effect of section 921 of chapter 113 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, the burned vessel being a ship within the meaning of that section. That section, in my opinion, has no application to the main issue which involves the liability of the defendants for damages resulting from the fire. That issue the courts below had undoubtedly jurisdiction to dispose of and with the judgments on that issue we are now exclusively concerned. Whether the defendants may limit their liability in a. proper proceeding instituted in another court to create a fund out of which the claims resulting from the fire are to be paid does not come before us for consideration now.

R. 641) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe defendants sublet a portion of their contract for the construction of a line of railway. In the execution of the work the sub-contractors made use of dynamite for the purpose of blasting rock excavations and, in this process the plaintiff sustained personal injury for which, in an action against them for damages, he recovered judgment, issued execution and, on the levy, the sheriff returned a writ of execution nulla bona, the result being that the judgment against the sub-contractors remained unsatisfied. Subsequently the plaintiff brought action against the present defendants to recover damages for the same injuries and, at the trial, his action was dismissed. This decision was affirmed by the judgment from which the appeal is now asserted.\nThe question at issue on the appeal sufficiently appear from the judgments now reported.\nA. G. Galt K.C. for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal involves the simple point as to whether or not a judgment against one of several joint tort-feasors is a bar to an action against the others, it being admitted that the injury complained of in both actions and the cause of such injury are identical. The facts are fully set forth in the judgment of the trial judge, Chief Justice Mathers, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, and I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given in that judgment.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014For the reasons given by Chief Justice Mathers in delivering judgment in the Court of King's Bench dismissing the action, and which judgement was concurred in by the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action brought by appellant against contractors for injuries caused to him by the negligence of a sub-contractor in the execution of a work requiring the use of explosives of a highly dangerous character in a place and under such circumstances that the subletting could not in law be held to have the effect of discharging the obligation to others from the observance of a duty to see that the said work was done with due care.\nThe appellant claims that the contractors and subcontractors cannot be held, by reason of the negligence complained of, to have been joint tort-feasors.\nHe claims each to have been severally liable. So is each tort-feasor in any case where a joint tort has been committed.\nThe negligent execution of the work is the basis of the right of action and all implicated therein are jointly liable.\nIt is admitted in the stated case that \"the injury complained of in both actions and the cause of such injury are identical.\"\nIt is clear also that the legal duty out of which springs the obligation to use that due care which would have avoided the cause of such injury is one and only one and not necessarily to be accomplished by the hands of either contractor or sub-contractor. It seems clear error to say that a declaration could not be properly framed alleging the duty as joint and the responsibility joint and ending with a prayer for relief against them jointly. It is idle to allege that because the evidence relative to the part each had taken of necessity must be different can make any difference in the legal substance of the cause of action or legal consequences thereof.\nIn every case of joint tort the identity of and relative parts taken by each defendant and the connective evidence shewing how each of them is to be held jointly liable with the other, clearly needs different statements or pieces of evidence much of which may be given as to one without naming the other.\nI assume as admitted each was liable, and pass no opinion upon the question of whether the contractor in fact fell within, the class of cases wherein he cannot free himself from liability by means of a sub-contract.\nI assume that to have been so as common ground between the parties.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J., dismissing this action on the ground that the defendants, principal contractors, were joint tort-feasors with their sub-contractors against whom the plaintiff recovered judgment in a former action.\nIn support of his contention that the cause of action against the sub-contractors differs from that against the principal contractors, Mr. Gait ingeniously urged that while in the former action it was not, in the present action it is, necessary for the plaintiff to aver that the work, which the sub-contractors were engaged to perform, was necessarily attended with risk.\nThe negligence in respect of which the plaintiff recovered in his action against the sub-contractors admittedly gave him a cause of action against the defendants as well. That is the case only because that negligence consisted in failure to take the care called for by what was in the circumstances the inherently dangerous nature of the work. The moment this fact is stated the identity of the plaintiff's cause of action against both the principal contractors and their subcontractors seems to me to be established. In order to prove his charge of negligence against either he must establish breach of a duty owing to him to take care; that duty ex hypothesi in each case alike arises out of and depends upon the fact that the very work which the sub-contractors were engaged to do was necessarily attended with risk; therefore in both cases an allegation of actionable negligence implies and involves the averment that the work was inherently dangerous and that it for that reason cast upon the defendants, whether contractors or sub-contractors, the duty to take precautions which they omitted and which, if taken, would have prevented injury to the plaintiff. It is apparent that although a formal and explicit statement of the inherently dangerous character of the work may have been unnecessary in the action against the sub-contractors it was so only because this averment was implied in the charge that they were negligent or in the allegation that it was their duty to take the omitted precautions.\nAnother ingenious suggestion is that the duty of the sub-contractors was themselves to take due care, whereas that of the principal contractors was to see that the sub-contractors took such care and therefore that the cause of action against the former differs from that against the latter. It is only necessary to point out that the same distinction exists in fact, if not in theory, between the responsibility of the master and that of the servant\u2014between the duty of the principal and that of the agent. Yet where such a tort as is here complained of has been committed by a servant or agent, that the master or the principal respectively is jointly liable, and in fact a joint tort-feasor with his servant or agent admits of no doubt. While a sub-contractor is not, even in carrying out work necessarily attended with risk, the alter ego of his principal contractor so as to make the latter liable for collateral negligence of the former, as he would be if the relation between them were that of master and servant, on the other hand where the work undertaken by a sub-contractor involves a duty on the part of the contractor from responsibility for the performance of which he cannot escape by delegation, the sub-contractor is in regard to that duty so identified with the principal contractor that his failure to perform it is the failure of the principal contractor himself. Quoad that duty he is in fact the alter ego of the principal contractor.\nIn my opinion the present defendants and their sub-contractors were joint tort-feasors against whom the plaintiff has an identical cause of action and his judgment recovered against the sub-contractors is a complete answer to this action.\nThe appeal therefore fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tapper, Galt, Tapper, Minty & McTavish.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fisher, Wilson, Battram & Hamilton.\n[1] 19 Man.

Proceedings on an originating summons issued by a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta on an application for cancellation of a license under section 57 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance,\" are judicial proceedings within the meaning of section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 139, and, consequently, the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta thereon.\nWhere the decisions of the provincial court shew that the judges of that court are equally divided in opinion as to the proper construction of a statute in force in the province and it appears to be desirable in the public interest that the question should be finally settled it is proper for the Supreme Court of Canada to exercise the discretion vested in, it for the granting of special leave to appeal under the provisions of section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Girouard J. dissented on the ground that the proceedings in question were intended to be summary and that, in these circumstances, the case was not one in which special leave to appeal should be granted.\nMOTION for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside an order by Harvey J., whereby a license for the sale of malt and spirituous liquors granted to the respondents had been cancelled. The proceedings in the case were instituted, on an application to a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, under section 57 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance\" in force in that province, for the cancellation of a license granted to the respondents for the sale, by retail, of malt, spirituous and other liquors in the Village of Ryley, Alberta, upon which Mr. Justice Harvey issued an originating summons. On the return of the summons the learned judge proceeded, in a summary manner, to hear and investigate the appellant's complaint against the issue of the license, adjudicated thereupon, and made an order directing the license to be cancelled. This order was set aside, on an appeal, by the Supreme Court of Alberta, in banco, and the complainant applied for special leave to appeal from the latter judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe questions raised on the application for special leave are set out in the judgment now reported.\nChrysler K.C. supported the application.\nEwart E.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta en banc, the highest court of final resort in the province. The two questions to be determined are: Have we jurisdiction to grant the application? and, Is this, assuming that we have jurisdiction, a proper case in which to grant the leave asked for ?\nThe \"Supreme Court Act,\" section 37, enacts that an appeal shall lie on special leave, to this court, from any judgment of the highest court of final resort in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta when the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding has not originated in a superior court. The proceedings here originated in an application made by Andrew Finseth, the appellant, before Mr. Justice Harvey in July, 1910, for the cancellation of a retail liquor license granted to the Ryley Hotel Company, Limited, under section 57 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance.\"\nThe first question to be decided is: Was this a judicial proceeding within the meaning of that section?\nThe sections of the Alberta Acts to be referred to are sub-section 15, section 2 of the interpretation clause of the \"Liquor License Ordinance\" and sections 1, 2 and 6 of chapter 7 of the statutes of 1908[1]. The judge to whom the application was made is the judge of the Supreme Court usually exercising jurisdiction in the judicial district in which the license district is situate, and the inquiry he was called upon to make was really a judicial inquiry. He could not properly exercise his discretion without hearing all the parties interested and he was obliged to bring to the performance of the duties assigned to him a judicial mind so as to determine what was fair and just in respect of the matter under consideration. Further the statute which provides for the enforcement of any order that may be made granting or refusing the application gives to the judge the same jurisdiction as a judge of the court to which he belongs; and his order, when made and filed in the office of the clerk of the court, becomes an order of the Supreme Court enforceable in like manner and by the like process, and from that order there is an appeal to the court en banc (section 1). I can entertain no doubt, therefore, that this is a judicial proceeding, gee per Lopes L.J., in Royal Aquarium and Summer and Winter Garden Society v. Parkinson[2].\nI am also of opinion that this is a proper case in which to grant leave. The appeal to the provincial court of appeal was limited to the question whether or not the judge to whom the application was made in the first instance had jurisdiction under section 57 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance'' to investigate and try the complaint. The majority of the court en banc delivered judgment allowing the appeal. The party moving here contends that the majority of the court overruled the unanimous judgment of three judges of the same court on the same point in another case. (In Re Richelieu Hotel License[3].) In view of this difference of opinion in the court below, we grant this motion, as it is desirable in the public interest that the point raised on this appeal should be definitely and finally settled.\nGIROUARD J.

The final judgment in the Superior Court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the action, but on appeal by the plaintiffs the Court of King's Bench maintained the action and made the injunction permanent. On a motion to quash an appeal by the hydro-electric company to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick.

(Davies J. contra).\u2014That, as the appeal was from the final judgment of the highest court of final resort in the Province of Quebec in an action instituted in a court of superior jurisdiction for the purpose of preventing the consummation of a contract for a consideration exceeding $2,000, the Supreme Court of Canada was competent to entertain the appeal under sections 36 and 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Per Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014That the controversy related merely to the validity of the by-law and did not involve the sum or value of $2,000, that the collateral or incidental effects of the judgment were not in question on the appeal, and that, therefore, the Supreme Court of Canada was not competent to entertain the appeal. The Bell Telephone Co. v. City of Quebec (20 Can. S.C.R. 230) followed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers, and maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was instituted against the Town of Shawinigan and the Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Company by the Shawinigan Water and Power Company and others, ratepayers of the Town of Shawinigan, for the purpose of setting aside a by-law of the town corporation authorizing it to purchase the electric power-house and electric plant of the hydro-electric company and certain lands of the company used in connection with these works and installations, for the sum of $40,750, and also for an injunction to prohibit the town corporation carrying into effect the contract in respect thereof made with the hydro-electric company. In the Superior Court, the final judgment dissolved the injunction and dismissed the plaintiffs' action with costs. On an appeal by the plaintiffs, the Court of King's Bench reversed the decision of the Superior Court, maintained the conclusions of the action and made the injunction permanent. The hydro-electric company then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The questions raised on the motion by the present respondents to quash the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nHolden supported the motion.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion, K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action brought by a ratepayer in the Superior Court, at Three Rivers, to set aside a by-law of the corporation of the Town of Shawinigan to which was joined an application for an interlocutory injunction. The action was dismissed by the first court; but on appeal to the Court of King's Bench that judgment was set aside, the bylaw was quashed and the interlocutory injunction declared absolute. On this appeal the respondents challenge our jurisdiction on the ground that in proceedings to quash or annul by-laws commenced by action in the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec there is no appeal here.\nA number of decisions of this court bearing on this question have been cited at bar, and others are to be found in Mr. Cameron's very useful book on the practice of this court. I confess that I find it difficult to reconcile all those decisions and so I am driven back upon the sections, of the statute which give an appeal to this court in cases arising in the Province of Quebec. Section 39, sub-section (e), gives an appeal\nin any case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule or order of court, or the rule or order to quash had been refused after argument.\nIn view of the fact that this section applies to all the provinces of Canada, I am of the opinion that the word \"quash\" should not receive a narrow interpretation and be held to apply only to proceedings by petition or motion without a writ, such as we find in the Province of Ontario, but must be read as synonymous with \"annul\" or \"make void.\" Whether this view be correct or not, an appeal is given by. section 36 of the Supreme Court Act\nfrom any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court.\nThe generality of this section is not restricted in the Province of Quebec where a municipal by-law is attacked because section 47 expressly provides that section 46, which places a limitation upon appeals from that province, shall not apply to appeals in cases of municipal by-laws.\nUnfortunately we have the case of The Bell Telephone Co. v. The City of Quebec[2], in which it was held that, in view of previous decisions, and more expressly of the ruling in The City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy[3], this court is without jurisdiction to hear, appeals in cases in which the validity of a by-law is attacked by direct action as in the present case; the judgment in such an action not being \"a rule or order\" quashing a by-law, within the meaning of section 39, sub-section (e). On examination, I find that The City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy3, upon the authority of which The Bell Telephone Co. v. The City of Quebec2 was decided, was an action to recover taxes due the plaintiff municipality under its bylaw, and there Ritchie C.J. says, at page 596: No question whatever as to quashing the by-law arises in this case;\nand Taschereau J. says, at page 597:\nThere is no by-law quashed by a rule or order here. In fact, there is none quashed at all by the judgment appealed from. We are all agreed on this point, I believe.\nIt is difficult, therefore, to see the relation between these two cases and how the latter could serve as a precedent for the former. In the case of Webster v. The City of Sherbrooke[4], where the validity of a by-law was attacked by petition, the question of jurisdiction was raised, the court dismissed the motion to quash and disposed of the proceeding on the merits. Strong C.J. said, at page 53:\nThis was an application to quash a by-law and not a case like the cases referred to and decided of the County of Verch\u00e8res v. The Village of Varennes[5]; The City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy[6]; and others decided in this court, as in all those cases it was in a private action that the by-laws were impugned and the proceedings were not to quash or annul the by-laws.\nSubsequently, in The City of St. Cun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon[7], a case in which the proceedings were initiated by petition under the provisions of the very same Act (The Town Corporations Act, R.S.Q. section 4389), as in Webster v. The City of Sherbrooke4, it was held:\nWhere the Court of Queen's Bench has quashed such an appeal for want of jurisdiction no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from its decision.\nSo that, if The Bell Telephone Co. v. The City of Quebec[8] and The City of St. Cun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon7 are well decided, there can be no appeal here in any proceedings in which a by-law is attacked in the Province of Quebec, whether by petition or by an ordinary writ of summons. The distinction made in Webster v. The City of Sherbrooke[9] by Taschereau J. between cases in which proceedings to set aside a by-law are commenced by petition and those in which the validity of a by-law is attacked by direct action by any party interested, with respect to the effect of the judgment, is, I respectfully submit, not founded. Under the Municipal Code, arts. 698 and 100, and under the \"Town Corporations Act,\" R.S.Q. section 4389, the validity of a by-law may be attacked by petition by a municipal elector; but this does not exclude the common law right to proceed by writ. Any person whose rights or property may be injuriously affected by the acts of a corporation can invoke the ordinary procedure of the courts to get redress for his grievances. County of Arthabaska v. Patoine[10]; Coriveau v. Corporation de St. Valier[11], at page 89; Farwell v. City of Sherbrooke[12]; B\u00e9langer v. Ville de Montmagny[13].\nAnd whether the proceeding is begun by petition or by writ, the result as to the validity of the by-law is the same. In either case if the action is maintained, the judgment annuls the by-law which ceases to have any force or effect thereafter; (arts. 461-462 Municipal Code). The only difference being that if the proceedings are begun by petition either under the Municipal Code or under the \"Town Corporations Act,\" there is no appeal to the provincial court of appeal, (art. 1077 Municipal Code and: section 4614 \"Town Corporations Act\") and, consequently, no appeal to this court. But in both cases the proceeding is disposed of by a judgment which I hold to be the equivalent of the rule or order mentioned in section 39 (e). Sub-section (d) of section 2 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" enacts that \"judgments\" when used with reference to the court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree, decretal order or sentence thereof, etc. In my opinion, therefore, Bell Telephone Co. v. City of Quebec[14] was decided on an erroneous impression of the effect of City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy[15] and the terms of the \"Supreme Court Act\" are broad enough to provide an appeal here in all proceedings to quash or annul a by-law when the right of appeal to the provincial court of last resort is not taken away by the provincial legislature. Vide per Strong C.J. in City of St. Cun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon[16] at page 83.\nI would dismiss motion with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014La Shawinigan Water and Power Co. demande par sa requ\u00eate \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, qu'un r\u00e8glement municipal de la corporation de la ville de Shawinigan Falls soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ill\u00e9gal, nul et de nul effet et qu'il soit annull\u00e9.

Dissidents, les honorables juges Lavergne et Archambault.\nLa Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co., \u00e0 son tour, inscrit en appel devant cette cour; et la compagnie qui a r\u00e9ussi devant la cour d'appel fait motion que l'appel devant nous soit cass\u00e9 faute de juridiction. Avons-nous juridiction? Voil\u00e0 toute la question.\nLa constitution de la cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs fois remodel\u00e9e et a \u00e9t\u00e9 le sujet d'un grand nombre de discussions devant nous, toujours au sujet de notre juridiction; bien qu'il ne semble pas que, sur le sujet qui nous occupe pr\u00e9sentement, la l\u00e9gislation a\u00eet vari\u00e9. La section 39, chapitre 139, paragraphe (e), sous le titre \"Loi concernant la cour supr\u00eame,\" d\u00e9clare qu'il y a appel \u00e0 la cour supr\u00eame dans tous les cas o\u00f9 un r\u00e8glement d'une corporation municipale a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9e par r\u00e8gle ou ordonnance d'une cour, ou que la r\u00e8gle ou l'ordonnance pour l'infirmer a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e apr\u00e8s audition.\nC'est \u00e0-peu-pr\u00e8s le langage du premier statut \u00e9tablis sant la cour supr\u00eame, 38 Viet. ch. 11, sec. 17. Cette disposition s'applique \u00e0 toutes les provinces, m\u00eame Qu\u00e9bec. Il est vrai que par les clauses 44, 45 et 46 certaines exceptions et restrictions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es en faveur de cette province; mais la section 47 d\u00e9clare qu'elles n'auront pas d'application dans le cas de r\u00e8glements municipaux.\nEn face d'un texte aussi positif, il est difficile de se rendre compte que la jurisprudence a\u00eet h\u00e9sit\u00e9 et ait m\u00eame varf\u00e9. On cite surtout quatre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents qui nient l'appel, dit-on.\nCity of Sherbrooke v. McManamy[17]; mais \u00e0 en juger par le rapport de la cause il ne para\u00eet pas qu'il s'agissait de la nullit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement, ni que la cour ne Pa\u00eet prononc\u00e9e.\nCounty of Verch\u00e9res v. Village of Varennes[18]; m\u00eame objection; il ne s'agissait pas ici d'un r\u00e8glement mais d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal.\nEgalement Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[19], que l'on cite contre notre juridiction, ne s'applique gu\u00e8re; car, en cette derni\u00e8re cause, il ne s'agissait pas d'un r\u00e8glement, mais d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal.\nBell Telephone Co. v. City of Quebec[20]; ici la cour d'appel refusa d'annuller un r\u00e8glement municipal pour des raisons que je ne puis appr\u00e9cier, car je ne puis comprendre que l'ordre ou jugement de la cour d'appel ne soit pas la \"r\u00e8gle ou ordonnance d'une cour\" dans le sens de la clause 39 de l'acte de la cour supr\u00eame. Autrement il faudrait d\u00e9cider qu'il ne peut jamais y avoir d'appel \u00e0 cette cour d'un r\u00e8glement municipal dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe code municipal et les chartes de plusieurs villes donnent \u00e0 tout contribuable un mode sommaire d'attaquer un r\u00e8glement municipal devant un tribunal sp\u00e9cial, le plus souvent la cour de circuit ou encore la cour du recorder, avec le droit d'appel \u00e0 une autre cour indiqu\u00e9e; et nous venons de d\u00e9cider dans la cause de Montreal Street Railway Co. v. City of Montreal (1909),[21], que dans des cas comme ceuxl\u00e0 il n'y a pas d'appel \u00e0 cette cour. A moins de donner le droit d'appel \u00e0 un int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans une action de droit commun institu\u00e9e, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce, en cour sup\u00e9rieure, un r\u00e8glement municipal ne pourrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 et revis\u00e9 par cette cour. Nous devons cependant donner effet \u00e0 la clause 39, par. (e), de l'acte de la cour supr\u00eame, qui ne distingue pas entre des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s en nullit\u00e9 de droit commun et ceux indiqu\u00e9s au code municipal; dans l'un comme dans l'autre cas, la clause 39 ne limite pas l'effet de la nullit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement municipal aux parties ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial et distinct de celui des contribuables ordinaires. Elle permet l'annullation d'un r\u00e8glement municipal sans restriction, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 toutes fins quelconques \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tout le monde.\nEnfin il ne manque pas de d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 cette cour a exerc\u00e9 juridiction dans des appels de jugements sur des r\u00e8glements municipaux : Webster v. City of Sherbrooke[22]; Longueuil Navigation Co. v. Gity of Montreal[23]; Town of Ghicoutimi v. Price[24].\nPour ces raisons je suis d'avis de renvoyer la motion de l'intim\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014If the question of our jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the Province of Quebec in a judgment such as the one in this case annulling and declaring void a by-law of a municipality was res integra, I would accept the reasoning and conclusion of the Chief Justice affirming that jurisdiction. Unfortunately there is the case of The Bell Telephone Co. v. The City of Quebec[25], which expressly decides the other way. Until that decision is overruled I feel it binding upon me.\nUpon the question whether the matter in controversy amounts to the sum of $2,000, I am unable to agree with the members of the court who hold that it does and dismiss the motion to quash on that ground. The real matter in controversy is the validity or invalidity of the by-law. With the collateral or incidental effect of a judgment upon that point one way or the other we are not concerned. Whether it results in affecting property over $2,000 or not is not the question. For these reasons I am constrained to allow the motion to quash.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the right of appeal exists by virtue of section 46 and sub-section (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe substance of the matter directly in controversy here is the validity of a contract plainly involving twenty times the measure of importance sub-section (c) assigns as one of the several tests thereof to be held sufficient for founding the jurisdiction of the court.\nMatters of quite as much importance may be often indirectly involved and yet not fall within the definition in question. This matter in controversy herein is directly (and plainly so) involved.\nThe incidental feature arising from the validity of the by-law being in question does not seem to me to affect the question any more than it might have done in Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[26], which involved J as a consequence of a rescission of the contractual relation, the rescission of a by-law.\nThe jurisdiction to hear was attacked in that case, and though the exact point here in question was not taken, it is hardly likely we would have heard the case if the incident that the validity of a by-law being involved should have made any difference.\nMoreover, suppose a municipality through its council had entered without any by-law at all, into some such contract, and a ratepayer, as here, had chosen to attack the transaction in the courts as invalid, and the third party concerned as well as the municipal authorities, were in course of such attack enjoined from acting under such contract merely because the court so enjoining held, perhaps erroneously, a by-law was needed. Could it be said that the third party whose rights were so adjudicated upon could have no relief or appeal, though his contention might be that no by-law was needed? If in truth no by-law was necessary in law in the case put, then, if this motion is founded on sound principle, the third party would be deprived of his rights (perhaps involving ten times the limit assigning a right of appeal) and of his right to maintain such a contention.\nI would dismiss the motion with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin. Anglin J.\u2014With profound respect for the opinions to the contrary of my Lord, the Chief Justice, and my brother Girouard, I incline to the view that we are constrained by the authorities in this court to hold this case to be not within section 39 (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Bell Telephone Co. v. City of Quebec[27]; Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[28]. But, without determining that question, I think it clear that the motion to quash should be dismissed because this appeal is from the \"final judgment of the highest court of final resort\" in the province in an action instituted in a superior court (section 36), of which the substantial purpose is to prevent the consummation of a contract for the sale of real estate at a price far exceeding $2,000. The real matter in controversy is the right of the appellants to compel the municipality to take the land which it has agreed to buy and to make payment to them of the purchase money. This the plaintiff seeks by injunction to prevent. Such is the direct \u2014 not merely the collateral or consequential \u2014 effect of a judgment for the plaintiff. It is in fact an integral part of the judgment itself. The matter directly in controversy, therefore, in my opinion, \"amounts to the sum or value of two thousand dollars,\" (section 46 (c)). This suffices to establish the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the appeal. Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[29], at page 49; Robinson, Little & Co. v. Scott & Son[30].\nThe special jurisdiction conferred by section 39 (e) is supplementary. It does not exclude the general appellate jurisdiction conferred by section 36 in a case otherwise appealable, although the validity of a municipal by-law may be brought in question in the action.\nThat the appellants, who were made defendants in this action and who are bound by the existing judgment declaring their contract with the municipality to be illegal and void, have sufficient interest to give them a right of appeal to this court, I entertain no doubt.\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Cusson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, Macpherson, Hague & Holden.\n[1] Q.R. 19 K.B. 546.\n[2] (1) 20 Can.

The writ of prohibition restrained the Magistrates' Court for the County of Terrebonne from further proceedings in a matter or cause pending before it in respect to the action of the council in regard to the certificates in question. The appeal did not involve any of the matters in respect of which provisions are made in the 46th section of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nCousineau for the motion.\nSurveyer, contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash, an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench affirming a judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Terrebonne, granting a writ of prohibition, on the ground that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from the Province of Quebec in any such case.\nIn Shannon v. The Montreal Park and Island Railway Co.[1], Taschereau J. gave the judgment of the court in which he held that the provisions of section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" formerly 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 55, sec. 2, gave an appeal in cases of prohibition from the Province of Quebec. I regret that it is impossible for me to concur in that judgment. That section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" applies to the whole Dominion is perfectly true, but the general jurisdiction conferred by that section is limited in so far as appeals from the Province of Quebec are concerned by the provisions of section 46. In other words, section 39 would seem to be a general section, like sections 36 and 38, which, notwithstanding the generality of their provisions, are subject to the special limitations provided by section 46, in Quebec, and by section 48 as to Ontario.\nThis motion must, therefore, be granted as this case does not come within any of the provisions of section 46, which determines the limits of our jurisdiction in appeals from Quebec.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Camille deMartigny.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bastien, Bergeron, Cousineau & Jasmin.\n[1] 28 Can.

This sub-contract was made in the defendant's name, but, on being shown to the plaintiffs, they consented that it should be so made. During the time that the defendant was building the bridges under this subcontract, he continued to draw his salary from the plaintiffs, but, on their completion, he claimed the amount due for this part of the work on the ground that he had undertaken the contract solely on his own behalf.\nThe Canadian White Co. applied for an interpleader order, and, on their application, affidavits were filed by both parties setting forth their respective claims, the money due was deposited in court, and an order was made for the trial of an issue to decide between the parties to this appeal as to whom they belonged. It was necessary for the decision of the issue to determine the relationship existing between the parties prior to the contract with the Canadian White Co. and the trial judge held that the defendant was the servant or agent of the plaintiffs, and that the contract in question had been made by him for the benefit of his employers. This decision was affirmed by the judgment appealed from.\nJ. Edward O'Connor for the appellant.\nC. P.

The trial judge who saw the witnesses and had opportunities to test the relative merits of the different versions of the facts, which we have not, came to the conclusion that McMillan's version was absolutely correct and finds as a fact that the contract was made by Weller for the respondent company and that they are entitled to the money in dispute.\nThe conclusion reached by the trial judge has the unanimous approval of the Court of Appeal, a matter not lightly to be disregarded.\nThe jurisprudence of this court is well settled; we will not interfere with the concurrent findings of two courts on a pure question of fact unless we are satisfied that the conclusion reached is absolutely wrong.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Morice & O'Connor.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aikins, Robson, Fullerton & Coyne.\n"}

Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nExpropriation of land\u2014Water lots\u2014Expectation of enhanced value \u2014Crown grant\u2014Statutory authority.\nLand in Halifax, N.S., including a lot extending into the harbour, was expropriated for the purposes of the Intercolonial Railway. The title to the water lot was originally by grant from the Government of Nova Scotia, but no statutory authority for making such grant was produced. The lot could have been made much more valuable by the erection of wharves and piers for which, however, as they would constitute an obstruction to navigation, a license from the Dominion Government would have to be obtained. $10,000 was tendered as the value of all the land expropriated and the owners, claiming much more, appealed from the judgment of the Exchequer Court allowing that amount.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the owners were not entitled to compensation based on the enhanced value that could be given to the water lot by the erection of wharves and piers and the expectation that a license would be granted therefor, and if they were the amount tendered was, in the circumstances, sufficient.\nQu\u0153re. Can a Crown grant of lands be made without statutory authority?\nHeld, per Duff J., that there was such authority in this case.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (12 Ex. C.R. 414) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], declaring the title to certain property of the defendants to be vested in His Majesty and the sum of $10,000 tendered in payment therefor to be sufficient.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nHarris K.C. for the appellants referred to Wood v. Esson[2]; Holman v. Green[3]; In re Lucas Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[4], at pages 25 and 31.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent, cited Coulson & Forbes on Water (2 ed.), p. 19; Chitty's Prerogatives of the Crown 145; Original Hartlepool Collieries Co. v. Gibb[5].\nHarris K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Girouard J. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. The substantive question to be determined was whether or not the sum of $ 10,000 awarded as damages by the Exchequer Court for the lands of the plaintiff expropriated by the respondent was sufficient. A careful examination of the evidence given has satisfied me that the sum allowed was a liberal one. The appellants, however, contended that the trial judge has erred in the construction he had put upon the decision of this court in Wood v. Esson2, and had refused, in assessing damages, to allow the appellant anything for the exclusive right he possessed as grantee from the Crown of the lands in question to obtain from the Dominion Government a license to construct wharves or piers in the waters of the harbour over the lands granted which might be an obstruction to navigation.\nI think the learned judge, if correctly reported, has not accurately stated the point decided in Wood v. Esson[6]. That point is, I think, substantially and correctly stated in the head-note to the report of that case, namely, that the Crown could not, without legislative sanction, grant the right to place in a public harbour below low-water-mark any obstruction or impediment which would prevent the full and free right of navigation. The decision goes no further than that.\nThe learned judge therefore probably did not consider and give weight to the appellant's right as grantee of the soil to apply for and possibly to obtain a license from the Dominion Government under the statutes authorizing such licenses to build out in the waters of the harbour over the lands within his grant even to the obstruction of navigation. But it is quite clear from his judgment that the learned judge allowed the appellant much more than the lands taken were, in his opinion, worth because of the offer of $10,000 made for them by the Crown. He gave judgment for this amount, not because he thought it fair value; it is evident he thought it excessive; but because the Crown bad fixed and tendered that amount.\nAfter carefully considering Mr. Harris's argument and the evidence, with special reference to the situation and surroundings of the land, I have concluded that this amount is full and liberal compensation for any right the appellant possessed in these lands, including any such contingent right as he claims the Exchequer Court had omitted to consider.\nUnder these circumstances I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants chose to present a case to the learned trial judge of a claim for compensation, and to rest the valuation thereof entirely upon the theory of their absolute right to the land to do therewith what they might see fit in the way of erecting docks and piers to accommodate shipping.\nThey now seek in appeal to set up an entirely new kind of case based upon an alleged exclusive right, under the Crown grant to their predecessor in title, to apply to the Crown or Parliament for leave to make such erections interfering with, or in the possible judgment of the Crown, represented by the Governor in Council, or of Parliament, likely to interfere with the public rights of navigation.\nThe claim presented proceeded entirely upon the assumption of the existence of a complete realization of such possible expectations, an entirely different thing from the unrealized and speculative kind of claim now presented to us.\nIn respect of this latter Claim I fail to see any evidence upon which any court could properly and intelligently proceed in the way of awarding any fixed sum by way of compensation therefor in excess of that sum tendered by respondent. If I were to try to estimate the value of the property in question on the assumption of an incomplete title, but yet carrying the right now claimed and make such allowance, as I understand might on the authority cited, if applicable, and in reason fairly to be considered, and have regard to all the evidence adduced, I would not be disposed to put a higher or perhaps as high a value as that tendered.\nI might well hold either of these views as sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nAppellants urge, however, that the learned judge erred in his view of the law bearing upon the grant by the Crown and the right created thereby.\nAssume for a moment he did. He did not in the slightest prevent the appellants from launching and making out a proper case. Indeed, at the outset he stated his view of the law and gave appellants every chance then to act as advised.\nIt was after the appellants' case was closed and duly answered, that they, finding the learned judge's view against them, sought in reply to set up another case, under pretext of meeting some evidence given by respondent's witnesses, as to the likelihood of obstruction to navigation by erections of a kind such as needed to render the property worth anything.\nAll that part of the evidence for respondent, though not objected to, can be treated as if never given and the case to my mind still stands in the result as I have stated.\nBut was the learned judge at all in error? Did any such error as is alleged affect his view of the matter?\nIt does not seem to me that the alleged error could have had from what he says any effect.\nMoreover, as to the alleged error as he says, it was conceded that there was no Act of the provincial legislature authorizing the Government to grant the water lot.\nAgain, counsel on this appeal had in his opening argument to say he was unable to shew any such statute, but later referred us to Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 3rd series, ch. 26, sec. 708, and the Nova Scotia Statutes of 1843.\nI would not be inclined from a consideration of these Acts to suppose the grant in question was within the purview of either of them.\nI am somewhat shaken in this by seeing (what we were not referred to) that an Act to amend the earlier Act refers to and specifically deals with grants of any water lot or portion of land covered with water or adjoining the shores of any of the bays, harbours, rivers or creeks of this province.\nThis Act was temporary and how the legislation ended is not clear.\nBut one thing is clear, that the words \"land\" and \"lands\" both by the \"Interpretation Act\" of the said Revised Statutes and by the use of such words in the Letters Patent making the grant in question, meant and were intended to mean, every interest in that land described therein that could possibly be conveyed.\nIt never was the purpose of anybody to convey merely what appellants now set up.\nIt possibly was intended by some one to give all, but this court long ago held such an attempt void. It clearly was an improvident attempt. I cannot see how if, for such reason, it failed of its purpose, as is practically conceded, it can now be set up and used for any other beneficial purpose than intended, merely because and if in law it may have had the technical effect of transferring the legal estate as Sir Henry Strong suggested in Wood v. Esson[7], at p. 243.\nThe matter has not been argued out so that we can definitely determine, with safety, either that the grant was so wholly illegal and void as to be treated as a nullity or as liable to be revoked by means of writ of scire facias, or writ of intrusion or information in Chancery or other appropriate legal procedure to put an end to what never should have been issued, or, as contended for, a grant to operate in a way never intended yet as of the exclusive right to apply for supplementary grants to complete what once was improperly intended should be done or given.\nIn any of these or other ways the matter may possibly be looked at, I can see no foundation for the pretension set up as resultant therefrom.\nThe cases of Alcock v. Cooke[8], and of Gledstanes v. Earl of Sandwich[9], may be referred to on the point, not taken in argument, of the intended nature and extent of the grant, failing to coincide with that limited claim now said to have passed.\nAs to the power of a colonial governor where representative institutions exist the argument in the case of Reg. v. Clarke[10], indicated it must in absence of specific instructions be restricted to that authorized by statute. The court did not adopt the theory put forward here.\nIt was pointed out to appellant's counsel on the argument that a search in the Archives here would disclose the instructions in question herein, but we have not heard of any having been discovered to support this grant.\nIn any event I fail to see how a claim as of right to compensation can be founded on such a title. Such equities, and other good reasons which may have moved the Grown to make the tender, are covered and protected by the judgment in allowing that sum.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The first question raised by this appeal touches the nature of the appellant's interest in the property expropriated. The property consists chiefly of about 12 acres of the bed of the harbour of Halifax; the appellant's title rests upon a grant of the year 1868 purporting to be made under the sanction of the Governor in Council of Nova Scotia. The learned trial judge, following, as it seemed to him, the decision of this court in Wood v. Esson[11], held this grant to be void. I do not agree with the learned judge's view of that case and I have no doubt that in 1865 the Governor in Council had power to authorize the grant in question. In the year 1849 an arrangement was made whereby \"all Her Majesty's casual and territorial revenues\" were placed under the control of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia, the Assembly in turn assuming the burden of the civil list of the province. The arrangement is recited in an Act of the Assembly which is chapter 1 of the statutes of that year, and the Act provides (by section 10) that the casual and territorial revenues vested in the control of the legislature should include (inter alia) all\nsums of money * * * arising * * * from * * * \"any grant\" of any of the Crown lands or Royalties of Her Majesty within the province \"of whatsoever nature or description\";\nand (by section 14) that the sale and management of Crown lands should, notwithstanding the Act, \"remain and be vested in such officers as Her Majesty\" should deem proper or as might \"be directed by any Act of the province.\" The statute referred to by Mr. Harris, chapter 26, R.S.N.S. 1864, appears (by sections 7 and 8) to vest in the Governor in Council full authority over the sale of \"ungranted lands\" of the Crown.\nIt is true that these sections do not deal nominatim with the subject of the disposal of lands forming part of the bed of an arm of the sea below low water mark; but the language is clearly broad enough to embrace such lands, and on its true construction must, I think, be held to do so. Such lands being within the territory of Nova Scotia were prim\u00e0 facie the property of the Crown, and to that extent were governed by the provisions of 12 Vict. ch. 1. It has never been doubted, so far as I know, that the Crown could at common law by matter of record convey such lands to a subject. The statute of 1702 by which the common law power of the Crown to dispose of the Crown lands was very much restricted may possibly have been carried into Nova Scotia with the general body of English law. Since the Treaty of Paris, 1763, and in consequence probably of article IV. of that Treaty Nova Scotia appears to have been regarded by the courts there as a colony acquired not by conquest or cession, but by settlement; Uniacke v. Dickson[12], 1848; but if that statute did originally apply to the Crown lands in Nova Scotia\u2014it is clear that its provisions (long before 1864) had by the effect of local legislation ceased to govern the disposal of them; 3 Vict. ch. 12; 6 Vict. ch. 45; 10 Vict, ch. 61; 9 Vict. ch. 6; U.S. ch. 28 (1859). In any case, whatever view might have been taken touching the scope of the sections 7 and 8 of the Act of 1864, when read by themselves, there is demonstrative evidence in an Act passed in 1843 (9 Vict. ch. 6) that the phrase \"Crown lands\" was as early as that date used in the legislation of Nova Scotia in a sense extending to the beds of navigable waters vested in the Crown within the territorial limits of the province, and in the absence of something restricting this the primary meaning of them we must give the words the same effect in the later Act.\nThe effect of a grant of such lands under proper authority is dealt with in two well-known passages which in view of the interpretation that has been put upon Wood v. Esson[13], may be worth quoting. First from Lord Westbury in Gann v. Free Fishers of Whitstable, in 1865[14], at pp. 207-8:\nThe bed of all navigable rivers where the tide flows and reflows, and of all estuaries or arms of the sea is by law vested in the Crown. But this ownership of the Crown is for the benefit of the subject, and cannot be used in any manner so as to derogate from, or interfere with the right of navigation, which belongs by law to the subjects of the realm. The right to anchor is a necessary part of the right of navigation, because it is essential for the full enjoyment of that right. If the Crown therefore grants part of the bed or soil of an estuary or navigable river, the grantee takes subject to the public right, and he cannot in respect of his ownership of the soil make any claim or demand, even if it be expressly granted to him, which in any way interferes with the enjoyment of the public right.\nAnd secondly, Lord Blackburn, in Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun[15], at pp. 861 and 862:\nI think it clear law in England that, except at the instance of a person (including the Crown) whose property is injured, or of the Crown in respect of an injury to a public right, there is no power to prevent a man making an erection on his own land, though covered with water, merely on a speculation that some change might occur that would render that piece of land, though not now part of the water way, at some future period available as part of it. I think that the land being covered by water is in such a case a mere accident, and that the defenders are as much at liberty to build on the bed of the river (if thereby they occasion no obstruction) as they would be to build on an island which might at some future period be swept away.\nSuch grants, that is to say, do not unless there is statutory authority for it, invest the grantee with any lawful right to obstruct the public in the exercise of the right of navigation with which, when vested in the Crown, the subject of the grant was burdened; but subject to that burden the grantee acquires whatever interest the grant professes to convey. I do not think there is anything in the decision of Wood v. Esson (1) which conflicts with this statement of the law. Some of the observations of Mr. Justice Henry are doubtless open to the meaning the learned trial judge attributes to them, but there seems to be nothing to support them in the judgments of the other members of the court and with respect they cannot, I think, be regarded as stating the rule by which we must be governed.\nThe next question is whether the learned trial judge having misdirected himself on the question already discussed the case should be remitted to the Court of Exchequer for a fresh consideration of the amount of compensation to be awarded. On this point I find myself in disagreement with my learned brothers. I think there is a substantial element of compensation in respect of which the learned trial judge, who has seen the witnesses, is in a much better position to form an opinion than Ave are; and that in justice to the parties concerned they should have an opportunity of taking that opinion.\nThe contention of the appellants is that this property affords special facilities for shipping on account of being adjacent on one side to the Intercolonial Railway and on the other to the harbour of Halifax, and that it is specially adapted for use as a site for a wharf or for other purposes in connection with which such facilities would be of great value. I think that contention is well founded, and I think, moreover, that it is not at all clear on the evidence that this element of value has been compensated for.\nThe points upon which the counsel for the respondent dwell as indicating that this element of value is largely fanciful or at all events greatly exaggerated are these: First, it is said that since the appellants have no right to cross the railway and no means of compelling the railway to provide shipping facilities for this property, the property must be taken as against the railway authorities to be inaccessible on the landward side. Then it is said that this property, in so far as it comprises a part of the bed of the harbour, is situated at a place where the harbour is very narrow and where the whole space is actually used and required to ensure safe and convenient navigation; and thirdly, it is said that the erection of a structure on the bed of the harbour there (since it would interfere Avith the exercise of the public right of navigation) would be a nuisance unless sanctioned by the Governor in Council in the manner provided for in the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" (ch. 115, R.S.C.); and that since the property is required by the Minister of Railways for public purposes, authority under that Act for such a purpose could never be obtained.\nAs to the first and third of these contentions they both appear to me to be quite unsound. One principle by which the courts have always governed themselves in estimating the compensation to be awarded for property taken under compulsory powers is this: you are to apply yourself to the consideration of the circumstances as if the scheme under which the compulsory powers are exercised had no existence. The proper application of that principle to chapter 143, R.S.C., seems to me to be this\u2014you are to estimate the value as if the property were not required for the public purpose to which the Minister, who is taking the proceedings, intends to devote it. The circumstance that it is so required is not to enter into the computation of value as either enhancing or diminishing it.\nOn this principle there appears to be no foundation for either of these two contentions. Whether means of communication to and from the landward side or shipping facilities over the railway on that side could be obtained is a question of fact for the tribunal assessing the compensation, but there is no \u00e0 priori probability that they could not be obtained, and. so far as I can see nothing in the evidence to suggest any reason to suppose the existence of any obstacle. So with the possibility of procuring the sanction required under chapter 115; that also is a question of fact and a question which must be examined on its merits apart from the purpose for which the Minister requires the property and just as if the compulsory powers were being exercised by some local authority having no sort of connection with the Governor in Council.\nThe second contention raises a question of substance. The argument as put before us appeared to rest upon the hypothesis that every structure raised upon the bed of a navigable water which might in any sensible degree restrict the area available for the purposes of navigation must be in law a public nuisance as constituting an invasion of the public right of navigation. That proposition does appear to receive some countenance from some observations of Strong C.J., in The Queen v. Moss,[16] at p. 332; but those observations were not necessary to the decision of the case, and, if they have the meaning attributed to them, then I must respectfully dissent from them. That the question whether a given structure so placed is or is not a public nuisance is a question of fact to be decided upon all the circumstances has long been settled. In Attorney-General v. Terry[17], Sir Geo. Jessel adopts as an accurate statement of the law a passage from the argument of Sir Wm. Follett in King v. Ward[18], at p. 395, in which that great lawyer stated the test for determining the question of nuisance or no nuisance where erections are made in a harbour below high water mark and in places where ships might perhaps have sailed, to be this\u2014\nwhether upon the whole they produce public benefit\u2014not giving the terms public benefit too extended a sense, but applying them to the public frequenting the port.\nThere is nothing in chapter 115, R.S.C., section 7, touching the erection of structures which do not offend against this rule; therefore I cannot accept the argument as it is put. It may, of course, be argued that on the evidence as it stands the proper conclusion is that the water lots in question could not be utilized in a commercial sense without offering an obstruction to the actual navigation of that part of the harbour as it is now used, and that there is no evidence whatever of any counterbalancing public benefit. On the whole, I think, that is the effect of the evidence, and although it would have been more satisfactory to have had the view of the trial judge upon it, I think the proper finding is that such structures as would be required to make the site productive of profit would constitute an unlawful, although probably very slight, interference with navigation unless authorized under the Act referred to.\nIn that view is any value to be attached to the possibility of obtaining such authority? The circumstance alone that such authority is required to legalize the structure would not appear to be entitled to much weight in determining the answer to this last question; and the evidence does not seem to indicate the probability of any such interference with navigation as would lead to a refusal of the necessary sanction if the scheme for which such sanction should be sought should appear\" to be likely to add materially to the public convenience in the use of the port. It is difficult to believe that the objection, the only objection suggested in the evidence, that schooners bound for Bedford Basin to discharge ballast beating against a head wind would find their passage impeded, is one which would present a serious obstacle to any plan designed to secure substantial improvement in the facilities for the use of the port as such. Upon this question I should have preferred to have the views of persons in a position to state the plans of the railway department respecting the use to which this property is to be put and respecting the expedients by which the suggested objection is to be overcome. In the absence of such evidence I am not disposed to attribute much weight to this objection. On the whole, I think the appraisal of this element of value which the learned judge has not considered had better be left to the Court of Exchequer and the case referred back for that purpose.\nAnglin J.\u2014Assuming that the grant of 1865 vested in the appellants the subsoil of the water lot therein described, it is clear that they did not acquire a right to use this property for purposes or in a manner that would interfere with navigation or obstruct navigable waters. So much is certainly decided by Wood v. Esson[19]. It may be that prior to the taking of the expropriation proceedings the appellants had some possibility\u2014great or slight\u2014of obtaining, under R.S.C. ch. 115, sec. 4, a Crown license to erect wharves upon the property in question, notwithstanding the interference with navigation which would be involved. That with such a right to build wharves and a right of access thereto across the Intercolonial Bail-way the interest of the appellants in their water-lot-property would be very valuable is clear upon the evidence. Its value without such rights, however, it is equally clear, is comparatively trifling.\nThe sum of $10,000 tendered by the Crown and awarded by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court is certainly in excess by many hundred dollars of the actual value of the property taken by the Crown if there were no possibility of the appellants securing the rights above mentioned. The learned judge allowed them this amount only because he did not see fit to allow a smaller compensation than that tendered by the Crown. The complaint of the appellants is that he refused to make them any allowance in respect of any increase in the value of the property because of the possibility of their obtaining from the Crown a right of access to it across the Intercolonial Railway, and a license to erect thereon wharves, etc.\nWe have before us in evidence the circumstances surrounding this property. We are in as good a position as the learned judge of the Exchequer Court was, or could be upon a reference back to him, to appreciate the chance of the appellants' obtaining these rights from the Crown, and to value that chance. The circumstances in evidence\u2014the narrowness of the channel opposite the appellants' lands and the requirements of the Intercolonial Railway owned by the Government of Canada\u2014make it practically certain that the Crown would refuse an application for these rights by the appellants or by any purchaser from them. No judge or arbitrator would, in my opinion, be justified in placing upon the possibility or chance of obtaining such rights more than a nominal value.\nAssuming that the learned judge erred in treating the grant to the appellants of the water lot in question as absolutely void, and that he was also technically wrong in declining to take into consideration the possibility or chance of their obtaining from the Crown rights of access over the Intercolonial and a license to erect wharves which would obstruct navigation; Re Lucas and The Chesterfield G as and Water Board[20]; Re Fitzpatrick and The Town of New Liskeard[21]; it is clear that if he had considered the appellants to be owners of the subsoil of the water-lot, and if he had made them an allowance for any interest which they could have in the property under the grant of 1865, if valid, and also for the chance or possibility of their obtaining rights of access over the railway and a Crown license to obstruct navigation, the amount of the judgment in their favour would certainly not have been increased.\nIt follows that no substantial wrong has been done the appellants and that no purpose would be served by remitting this case to the Exchequer Court in order that the value of the appellants' interest in the subsoil of the water lot and of the possibility of their obtaining rights and privileges from the Crown might be there estimated.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

R. 560) reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Mathers J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs action was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. B. Coyne for the appellant.\nG. W. Baker for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Girouard J. agreed in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the mortgagor (appellant) to set aside a foreclosure of mortgage made by the district registrar under the \"Real Property Act\" of Manitoba and to cancel the certificate of title given by the registrar after such foreclosure so as to enable the mortgagor to redeem.\nThe trial judge, Mathers J., was of the opinion that the circumstances proved entitled the mortgagor (plaintiff) to be allowed in to redeem if the right of redemption had not been taken away by the \"Real Property Act.\"\nHe reached the conclusion as he said with much regret that this Act did take away the right the mortgagor would otherwise have had and that he was powerless to grant the plaintiff (mortgagor) any relief.\nOn appeal the Court of Appeal was divided, Richards J. holding that the court had the jurisdiction to grant the relief asked, while Perdue and Cameron JJ. held with the trial judge that it had not, On the hearing of the appeal at bar Mr. Baker for the respondent, mortgagee, frankly, and I think properly, conceded that but for the statute the plaintiff would have had the right to redeem. This concession relieves us of the necessity of examining the facts and of determining whether under them the ordinary right to redeem existed in the plaintiff when she brought her action, and leaves as the only question for us to determine whether or not the statute has taken away the right.\nMr. Coyne in his able argument contended that under the true construction of the Act the district-registrar could not foreclose the mortgage without such notice to the mortgagor of his intention to do so as would put the latter on her guard and give her an opportunity of shewing cause against the final order issuing and that the making of the final order of foreclosure without such notice was contrary to natural justice.\nI incline to the opinion, however, that Mr. Baker was successful in shewing that the proceedings were in strict conformity with the Act, and that as a matter of fact they substantially followed the procedure of the old Court of Chancery in foreclosure cases.\nThe whole question before us, to my mind, turns upon the construction to be put upon the \"Real Property Act\" of Manitoba as it stood amended when the defendant (respondent) took his first step to foreclose under it.\nMr. Baker contended that these amendments affected a vested right his client possessed and being passed by the legislature after defendant became assignee of the mortgage would not be construed so as to affect that right. I am not able to accept this argument, as it seems to me the amendments do not so much affect vested rights as they do the mode and practice by and under which these rights can be given practical effect. The respondent became assignee of a mortgage and afterwards and while he was such assignee, and long before he had taken steps to foreclose, the legislature, it is contended, by the amendments to the \"Real Property Act\" made it clear that it was not the intention of that Act to take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court to foreclose or redeem statutory mortgages.\nThe question, therefore, is reduced to the meaning of these amendments. They are two in number, one to the 126th section of the Act and the other to the 108th section. The latter section was one declaring the statutory mortgagee's rights and remedies at law and in equity to be the same as if the legal estate had been vested in him and the amendment made evidently to set at rest any possible doubts added the words \"including the right to foreclose and sell in any competent court.\"\nThe 126th section as amended reads as follows, the words in italics following the words \"or over equitable interests therein\" constituting the amendment:\n126. Nothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of fraud or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land, or over equitable interests therein, or over mortgages, nor shall anything contained in this Act affect the right of the mortgagee to foreclose or sell through any competent court, which right it is hereby declared may be exercised in such court.\nNow what is the true meaning of these two amendments made in 1906? Are they practically inoperative to effect anything beyond giving an alternative remedy to the mortgagee to foreclose a statutory mortgage and sell through the courts in addition to the remedy of foreclosure and granting a certificate of title provided by the statute? In other language, must the words \"or over mortgages\" with which the amendment begins be read and construed as mere surplusage signifying nothing?\nA little attention to the provision of the Act as first enacted, the conditions then existing and which it had to meet and also those existing when the amendments were made will, it seems to me,, shew clearly that these words added to the 126th section \"or over mortgages\" were intended to have and legally do have a most important meaning and effect.\nThe 100th section of the statute enacts that\na mortgage or an incumbrance under the new system shall have effect as security, but shall not operate as a transfer of land thereby charged, or of any estate or interest therein.\nThe 126th section declared that\nnothing contained in the Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of fraud or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land or over equitable interests therein.\nSo that except upon one of these three grounds,\u2014 either that there was fraud or that there was a contract for the sale of land involved or that there were equitable interests to be protected or enforced,\u2014the jurisdiction of the courts to intervene or control the working of the Act by the district-registrar seemed to have been taken away.\nNow the 100th section, above quoted, had explicitly declared the statutory mortgage to be a charge upon the land only and not a transfer of any estate or interest therein. The mortgage, therefore, created a statutory charge upon the land and the way and manner in which it should be enforced together with the mortgagee's other rights and remedies were specifically pointed out and enacted; sections 106 to 114,\nThese included the right to have the mortgage foreclosed by the district-registrar and such an order when made by him was declared by section 114 to\nhave the effect of vesting in the mortgagee or his transferee the land mentioned in such order, free from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the owner, mortgagor or incumbrancer,\nor of any person claiming through or under him subsequently to the mortgage or incumbrance.\nThis section 114, declaring the effect of an order for foreclosure when made by the district-registrar, read together with section 71 making the certificate of title the registrar was authorized to issue conclusive evidence of title against all the world, subject to certain specific reservations and exceptions, of which fraud is one, may well have led to the conclusion that the mortgagee's right under the statutory mortgage was not such \"an equitable interest\" in the lands charged as entitled the mortgagee to ignore the enabling provisions of the Act providing for foreclosure before the district-registrar and go into the courts and foreclose his mortgage there.\nIt was, I take it, to remove this possible doubt that the amendments to sections 108 and 126 expressly conceding to the mortgagee the right to foreclose in any competent court were enacted. There may have been other reasons. Part of the lands of Manitoba had been brought under this \"new system\" provided by the \"Real Property Act\"; part had not. A mortgagee of lands which had not clearly could still resort to the courts to have his mortgage foreclosed. If that mortgage contained two plots of land, one of which had been brought under the \"new\" system\" and one of which had not, obvious difficulties arose with regard to foreclosure. The result was the specific declaration by the legislature, in 1906, of the right of any competent court, at the instance of the mortgagee, to exercise its jurisdiction respecting foreclosure over statutory mortgages.\nAn election on the part of the mortgagee, therefore, to invoke that jurisdiction involved necessarily a right to redeem on the part of the mortgagor. The mortgagee could not invoke the jurisdiction of the courts with respect to foreclosure without accepting that jurisdiction in full, involving the mortgagor's right of redemption in accordance with the ordinary practice and rules of the court.\nBut if those amendments giving the mortgagee his alternative remedy of foreclosure in the courts or in the district-registrar's office stood alone, where would the mortgagor stand? He certainly had no equitable interest in the land charged which would enable him, under the 126th section before it was amended, to invoke the equitable jurisdiction of the court and open up a statutory foreclosure. He was the owner of the land possessing the entire legal estate. He could not, therefore, invoke the aid of the courts to give him relief against an order of foreclosure made by the district-registrar unless he brought his case within the cases expressly excepted by the statute in which the district-registrar's order was not to be conclusive. The consequences would be that, with respect to statutory mortgages foreclosed before the district-registrar, the mortgagor would be in an anomalous position and might be powerless to have a great wrong remedied. He certainly could not have recourse against the insurance fund in such a case as this, and if the courts had not jurisdiction to grant him relief he would be without remedy.\nIt was just this condition of things, it seems to me, which was in the mind of the legislature when amending the \"Real Property Act\" in 1906, which induced the insertion of the words \"or over mortgages\" amongst the amendments to section 126 reserving to the courts their jurisdiction.\nThe words were intended to have, and in my judgment do have, an important meaning. They refer to statutory mortgages, not to mortgages outside the statute as to which there never was or could be any doubt as to the court's jurisdiction. They were inserted for the benefit of the statutory mortgagor who, not having any equitable interest in the lands mortgaged (section 100), had no remedy in the courts unless in cases of fraud to impeach an utterly unjust statutory foreclosure order. The district-registrar would, I conceive, have no right to open up such an order. He was functus officio when he had issued it, and the courts could not interfere.\nThe amendment, therefore, was made so that, in a proper case, the mortgagor might, even if there was no fraud, obtain relief. The jurisdiction of the courts was made clear. Section 126 as amended reads:\nNothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of fraud, or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land, or over equitable interests therein or over mortgages, etc.\nNo matter, therefore, how strong the language of the sections are declaring the effect of the order for foreclosure or the certificate of title they must be read as subject to section 126. Just as the courts retain by that section the right to re-open certificates of title on the ground of fraud, so they retain a similar right to re-open, in proper cases, such certificates and the orders for foreclosure on which they are founded, in the cases of statutory mortgages. And this they retain by virtue of the insertion of these amending words, \"or over mortgages,\" in the section.\nIt is idle to refer in construing these amendments to the decisions of the courts in New Zealand, or New South Wales, or elsewhere, upon their \"Real Property Acts,'' or to the appeals from those decisions to the Judicial Committee. I have carefully read all of these. Such sections as we have before us for construction were not in the Acts of these colonies. If section 126 bears the construction I have put upon it, then the 71st section of the Act, making the certificate of title conclusive evidence, and the 114th, declaring the effect of the order of foreclosure, must as between the parties to the mortgage and their transferees in actions to redeem by the mortgagor or his representatives be read and construed as subject to the 126th section.\nI need not say that this construction of the Act has nothing to do with the case of a bon\u00e0 fide purchaser for value. His title stands clear of any infirmities which as between the immediate parties, mortgagor and mortgagee and their representatives, the courts can investigate and, of course, cannot be attacked on the ground of any such infirmity existing prior to the certificate of title on the faith of which he is entitled in perfect confidence to buy or deal with the land, Such a case is not, however, before us now.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal with costs here and in the courts below, giving the plaintiff a reasonable time to be fixed by the prothonotary of the court within which to redeem.\nIdington J.\u2014If we would interpret correctly the meaning of any statute or other writing we must understand what those framing it were about, and the purpose it was intended to execute.\nThe \"Real Property Act\" of Manitoba, so far as it related to the adoption and application of the \"Torrens System,\" was as clearly as anything could well be intended to provide a registered title to which intending purchasers could resort with facility to ascertain the ownership and upon which they might rely with absolute safety in buying or acquiring any interest.\nThe primary purpose of the Act was not for the purpose of determining the right inter se or of quieting titles.\nThe \"Real Property Act\" provides machinery that may result in depriving men of their rights at common law or in equity.\nIts operation cannot be permitted to take away men's recognized rights beyond that which the statute expressly enacts.\nIngenious arguments are presented based upon the meaning of the word \"foreclosure\" and the application of the ordinary proceedings in equity, known or qualified by that term to the system of registration now in question.\nIn the first place this jurisdiction now invoked is for redemption. In the sense used in the amendment I am about to deal with, it has nothing to do with foreclosure. It is sought to be applied to open up a foreclosure. Quite true the suit for redemption might end by a foreclosure, so the suit for foreclosure might end in redemption.\nAll I am concerned with here is to shew they are neither interchangeable terms as definitions of a legal proceeding nor in any way to be treated as if they were so in construing this amended statute, and especially the amending part.\nMr. Justice Perdue explains that under this registration system the mortgagee never has vested in him the legal estate, never has and cannot get more than a charge upon the land, and then he suggests foreclosure never could exist as a method of procedure in regard to such a form of mortgage.\nI will assume that to be so without entering into that which is a wide field in some aspects of it, and certainly do not question the general principle. See the judgment of Sterling J. in Re Lloyd[2], at p. 397, speaking for the court.\nIts application to this case has, I respectfully submit, entirely different results from those Mr. Justice Perdue deduces therefrom as will presently appear.\nThese several observations and the legal consequences thereof also being borne in mind, let us turn to section 71 of the Act, which is its essentially operative clause. This case must be determined by the construction of that section and the amended section 126. Section 71 is as follows:\nEvery certificate of title hereafter or heretofore issued under this Act shall, so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled, be conclusive evidence at law and in equity as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever that the person named in such certificate is entitled to the land described therein for the estate or interest therein specified, subject, however, to the right of any person to shew that the land described in such certificate is subject to any of the exceptions or reservations mentioned in the seventieth or seventy-fourth sections of this Act, or to shew fraud wherein the registered owner, mortgagee or incumbrancee has participated or colluded and as against such registered owner, mortgagee or incumbrancee; but the onus of proving that such certificate is so subject, or of proving such fraud, shall be upon the person alleging the same.\nSection 126, as amended, is. as follows:\n126. Nothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of fraud, or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land, or over equitable interests therein, or over mortgages, nor shall anything contained in this Act affect the right of the mortgagee to foreclose or sell through any competent court, which right it is hereby declared may be exercised in such court.\nStress is laid by the respondent upon the operative words of section 71.\nWith great respect I may be permitted to say that so much has been the effect given to these strong words that the limiting words, \"so long as the same remain in force and uncancelled,\" have been entirely overlooked.\nDo these words not imply a possibility of the certificate of title being cancelled? And if cancelled by what power? And under what circumstances?\nWe have as a piece of great caution the exceptions made therein of the 70th and 74th sections and fraud added. Their repetition in the section does not add to or detract from what its operation would have been without such addition. It must have, in any case, been held, as regards the finality of title, to be subject to these express limitations in the other sections named. In like manner it also was always subject to the 126th section or its predecessor. And, as to fraud, everything is subject to be avoided by reason of fraud. It need not have been specified.\nBut who is to pronounce upon the fraud? Is it the registrar? How can he deal with it? I do not say he may not in some way act to defeat fraudulent devices that may have been practised upon him. But the possibilities of how far the fraud may have operated when the whole transaction is not involved must, of necessity, be relegated to the courts, if for no other reason than this, that fraud may be only voidable at the instance of some one complaining.\nThe rights arising under sections 70 and 74 might also have required the assistance of the courts to determine conflicting rights arising thereunder as against the certificate of title.\nSections 49 and 52 indicate clearly that the registrar and a judge of the Court of King's Bench have each powers independent of the other for the correction of error. The latter section anticipates and provides for the decree of a court being executed save as in the proviso that the issuing of a new certificate must have the registrar's approval in the case and way stated.\nThis 52nd section clearly contemplates such actions and, when we have regard to the purview of the Act, the results of such actions, as well as those section 126 reserves to the court, must be worked out by the court and given effect to by the registrar. At the same time by way of precaution for the protection of the rights of others (not parties to such litigation) which may have arisen, such rights are protected from being cut out by a new certificate until the registrar has had opportunity to see no harm can arise.\nThe decree of the court, signified by a judge's order, is as to all else to be obeyed and to determine the rights of the parties before it.\nLet us turn to section 126 and we find it gives the jurisdiction and is indeed the only effective jurisdiction given by the Act in respect of the subjects stated and had, as the section stood originally, the subjects of fraud, contracts for sale of such lands as dealt with, and equitable interests therein, all put on the same footing.\nThese subjects thus given did not impair in the slightest the efficiency of the \"Real Property Act\" for the purpose for which it was framed.\nIf any one bought on faith of a certificate he would be protected and the protection thus given him might limit the powers of the court to reach and effectively remedy a wrong. But short of that the court could as between him who got and still held the certificate by means of some wrong done in violation of duties had in view in said section enforce the rights of the parties arising out of the specified subject-matters and if need be direct the certificate to be cancelled; or by a more indirect method direct the wrongdoer holding the title to transfer it or such interest as demands of justice required, to the person or persons the court had found entitled.\nI cannot for a moment suppose as has been suggested that these subjects so added to that of fraud had ever the remotest relation to an action on covenant for price or anything collateral to the contract or trust that affected the land. It was only the land or interest therein that was being dealt with at all.\nSuch having been substantially the state of the law for many years the legislature saw fit to amend it by adding the like power \"over mortgages.\" Could anything be more comprehensive? If we bear all this in mind and then give the plain ordinary meaning to the words \"or over mortgages\" or the meaning of the interpretation clause of the last word of the phrase, equally wide we find thus conferred a jurisdiction that must comprehend all judicial powers relative to mortgages.\nOf these the most elementary, beneficial and far-reaching is the power to enforce redemption which is that now in question.\nUnless the express language is to be frittered away, that jurisdiction has been given to deal with such cases as this.\nThe courts of equity have repeatedly interfered to open up final orders of foreclosure, and permit redemption. They have not hesitated to deal with the exercise of powers of sale when not conducted in conformity with the principles of justice that the courts have approved of and enforced.\nWithout adopting in its entirety (unless connecting therewith the considerations I am about to present) the argument of Mr. Coyne, so well presented, when he contended that the act of the registrar being a judicial one he should have given or directed notice to be given, and hence his failure to do so rendered his action a nullity, I think the failure (when the property was shewn to him to be worth twice the sum the mortgage stood for) to do so or to direct a sale under his own supervision such as section 114 contemplates was an improvident proceeding and so oppressive that the court might now under the amendment well exercise its inherent powers respecting mortgages in the way desired.\nMoreover, it might well exercise its powers over the oppressor who thus abused the use of the powers of an inferior court, to direct that such abuse shall not avail him, but that he re-convey what he has so got thereby upon payment of what is due him.\nIt was conceded at the opening of the argument, and has been throughout in the court below assumed, that the case was one in which a court of equity would open up its own final order of foreclosure.\nThis proceeding given by the Act is but a statutory application of the ordinary power of sale in a mortgage, plus the power of final foreclosure, or rather statutory transfer of property.\nIt is a substitute for the ordinary bill of complaint, or like procedure appealing to equitable jurisdiction, of the mortgagee praying a sale and coupling with it a statutory alternative foreclosure.\nAnd when it is supplemented by the added power given the courts in the amendment as to mortgages and both read together as they must be, implies what is usual in foreclosure in the way of the limited right to redeem by opening a judicial order. I think it must now be implied under this amended section, and can be enforced as between the original parties. As will be seen presently I do not rest entirely upon this implication.\n'No harm, however, can follow this interpretation, for the mortgagee gets what he is entitled to, and it only deprives him of the fruits of oppression or fraud as the case may be.\nTo put another construction that would cut out this power of the courts relative to foreclosure or redemption proceedings would equally cut out fraud classed in the same amended section 126, of the Act as within the power \u00f4f the courts. It seems to me the New South Wales statute and the cases that have arisen on that or other like Acts are beside the question.\nNone of these statutes upon which such questions have been raised have conferred any jurisdiction upon the courts relative to mortgages and of the comprehensive character involved in the jurisdiction here given over mortgages.\nIn giving that jurisdiction I think something far beyond what is suggested in the court below has been intentionally given by these words, \"or over mortgages,\u201d to the courts. And I do not think it is to be restricted either to the limits of the mere matter of procedure, discarding the principles involved or to the cases of a foreclosure suit or incident thereto.\nThe grammatical construction of the language does not permit of its restriction to a foreclosure proceeding, for that is a distinct thing of itself as the language indicates and especially so when we have due regard to the distinction I have already adverted to between redemption and foreclosure.\nI prefer interpreting the amendment of a beneficent enactment so that the wrong to be redressed may be redressed, and so effectually that the principles upon which courts of equity have always acted become applicable to the like procedure under a somewhat different form when operated by means of an inferior jurisdiction merely having another name, but the real character of which is a substitution of one form of procedure for another.\nAmong the many considerations presented to my mind, though not noticed in the excellent arguments presented, as possibly worth noting was this, that it might be urged that at the time when the court's jurisdiction was invoked the security by virtue of the certificate and force of the Act ceased to be a mortgage and hence no mortgage upon which the courts could act.\nThe illustration Mr. Justice Richards has given relative to a mortgage by way of absolute deed or where the consideration had not been advanced (or I may add only in part) as among the evils to be remedied might all be cases wherein justice might be defeated by the technical interpretation I have suggested, convinced me it should not be applied.\nA question is raised that this new form of procedure is to be treated as a sale for taxes.\nI first answer, even sales for taxes when not conducted with due regard to the inherent rights of those concerned that a fair sale be had, have been set aside even when the statutory and, as it were, external forms have been literally observed, but injustice has been done.\nIn the next place we are dealing with a statute so amended as to rectify or furnish the means of rectifying the exercise of a power thus inferentially restricted to operate within the recognized principles of justice as administered in the courts of equity.\nNo question is raised in the factum submitted respecting the form of notice served on the appellant, upon which the alleged foreclosure is founded. However, it was pointed out from the bench that the notice does not, as usual in suits for foreclosure anticipating possible default on the part of the mortgagor or owner of the equity of redemption, make clear that in default of appearance the proceedings would be taken ex parte and without further notice.\nRespondent's counsel in answer to this pointed to and relied upon the first section of the notice after the demand gives notice that in default of payment within the time there specified the mortgagee would proceed\nwithout any further notice to enter into possession of the land and to receive and take the rents, issues and profits thereof,\nand to lease, etc.\nIt does not seem to me this notice fully supplies all it should. It rather seems to imply that the ulterior proceedings to be taken without further notice are limited to those above stated, i.e., the taking possession and reaping the fruits thereof.\nIt does not in regard to the later steps threatened, declare they or either of them, shall be taken without further notice.\nSuppose the mortgagee had gone into possession and so remained and obtained from the rents the greater part of his claim, and then without further notice, there being still default in completing the payment of the full sum due, offered the property for sale, and that the attempted sale proved abortive by reason of not reaching the reserved bid properly fixed, and a year or two later, without further notice, made his application to the registrar for a final order of foreclosure, and got it, he would, if respondent's position is correct, have barred forever the owner of the equity of redemption.\nAnd that would be supposed to have been the administration of justice.\nThe registrar is called and states there never has been an advertisement under section 114, and indicates pretty clearly the first part of the section is treated as if null.\nAnd, of course, no time or place is appointed for hearing or for payment of the amount due when the ulterior proceedings may be resorted to.\nOn the face of the proceedings an affidavit filed on the application for final order shews the amount due and the value of the property.\nThe value thus shewn is about double the indebtedness.\nThe affidavit of value was for the purpose of fixing the fees to go into the guarantee fund which the Act provides for.\nThe learned trial judge finds as a fact the property is worth five or six times the amount against it.\nMaking due allowances for the differences of opinion people may form as to values of real estate the affidavit fixing the value at f 4,000 and no more does not seem to have been a proper statement of fact.\nThe purpose for which it was made may, however, render the statement of no legal consequence in this connection. Yet it is illustrative of what the registrar conceives his duty to be under the Act when such facts appearing on an ex parte proceeding under the Act he does not think the power he had should be executed.\nAssuming for the moment his view and practice quite correct, but without passing upon it any opinion, the existence of such a practice and long continuance thereof rendered it doubly important that the original notice given by the respondent should be so clear and explicit that no one could mistake what it meant, and no one could ever suppose all threatened was to be done, without further notice.\nSection 109 enabling the proceeding by such a notice to sell, contemplates the possibility of the mortgagor being content with possession and its fruits but enables without defining more the giving in the same a notice for sale and the further notice for resorting to competent remedies.\nSection 110 seems to contemplate the directions of the registrar to fix the conditions. Nothing of the kind seems to have been done so far as the record discloses. The statement of claim merely challenges the service of notice under section 109 and does not make any point of the absence of the direction by the registrar. But even so its absence adds force to the contention set up generally that proceedings so far as the registrar was concerned and had power to direct, were judicial, and in absence of an opportunity having been given to be heard, are null.\nSection 113 imposes upon the mortgagee the burden of shewing that the lands\nhad been offered for sale at public auction after a notice of sale served as hereinbefore provided, etc.\nIt pre-supposes that the direction of the registrar in section 110, regarding such sale had been taken and acted upon.\nI repeat such not being shewn to the registrar it became on the material before him doubly his duty to see that the appellant's land was not taken from her without an opportunity to be heard.\nThe absence of notice to her under such circumstances rendered the proceedings null within the meaning of the numerous authorities collected by appellant and referred to in the factum so fully and carefully prepared.\nI do not think such a general notice as given by respondent in originating these proceedings is of such a character as to dispense with the later notice that the discharge of a judicial duty implies should be given. It seems to me such being the condition of things existent in the administration of justice it was high time there was a remedy applied.\nAnd I can give no limited meaning to the words \"or over mortgages\" which assigned expressly to the courts entire, if not exclusive, jurisdiction as a check upon such abuses. Much less can I read them out of the statute.\nI think, adopting the language used in Heydon's Case[3], that there appears here \"the true reason for the remedy,\" and that our duty is\nalways to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy and to suppress subtle inventions and evasion for the continuance of the mischief and pro privato commodo and to add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act pro bono publico.\nThe appellant's rights not having been taken away judicially she is entitled by virtue of the remedy given to the relief prayed for, and if need be to the cancellation of the certificate in question.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff (appellant) brings this action to open up foreclosure proceedings taken under sections 113 and 114 of the \"Real Property Act\" of Manitoba, R.S.M. (1902), ch. 148. Under these sections and those immediately preceding, provision is made for the foreclosure of \"new system\" mortgages without action.\nThe regularity of the defendant's proceedings is attacked by the plaintiff principally on the ground that, although he gave her notice under section 109 that he intended to enter into possession of the lands and to take the rents and profits thereof, that in default of payment he would proceed to sell the lands and that in the event of the attempted sale not realizing sufficient to satisfy the moneys secured by the mortgage and expenses he would, after six months' default, make application for foreclosure, she did not receive any further notice of the application for foreclosure or any notice whatever of the date fixed by the district-registrar under section 114, on or after which he would issue a final order of foreclosure. The provincial courts have held that the plaintiff was not entitled to such further notice. The question is not free from difficulty. But in the view which I take of section 126 and of other provisions of the statute, it need not be dealt with.\nSection 126, as amended in 1906, reads as follows, the amendment being italicized:\n126. Nothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of fraud, or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land, or over equitable interests therein, or over mortgages, nor shall anything contained in this Act affect the right of the mortgagee to foreclose or sell through any competent court, which right it is hereby declared may be exercised in such court.\nIn the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Perdue and Cameron JJ.A. took the view that the sole purpose of this amendment was to enable mortgagees who held mortgages taken under the \"new system\" (i.e., mortgages to which the foreclosure procedure provided by sections 113 and 114 is applicable) instead of proceeding under those sections, to bring an ordinary action of foreclosure. Richards J.A., who dissented, thought that in respect of the statutory foreclosures of mortgages under the new system, the amendment restored to the court (if it had been taken away) the jurisdiction which it has always undoubtedly possessed over ordinary foreclosure proceedings. With very great respect for the views of the majority in the Court of Appeal, I think that the construction which they have placed on section 126 involves reading out of it the words \"or over mortgages.\" To treat any part of a statute as ineffectual, or as mere surplusage, is never justifiable if any other construction be possible. The rejection or excision of a word or phrase is permissible only where it is impossible otherwise to reconcile or give effect to the provisions of the Act. I find no such difficulty in the Manitoba \"Real Property Act.\" I cannot see that giving full effect to the words \"or over mortgages\" does violence to any other provision of the statute.\nSection 71 of the Act deals with the effect of certificates of title and declares them to be \"conclusive evidence at law and in equity,\" except in certain specified cases, but only \"so long as the same remain in force and uncancelled.\u201d\nAs pointed out by Richards J.A., the present section 52, enabling a judge to order a district-registrar to issue, cancel, or correct certificates, etc., is the successor of section 128 of the \"Real Property Act\" of the revision of 1892. Section 128 of that Act, however, contained the following additional proviso, which is not found in the present section 52:\n(a) Provided that no certificate of title shall be cancelled or set aside except in the cases especially excepted in the fifty-seventh section of this Act.\nWhile this proviso remained in the statute the jurisdiction of the court to cancel certificates was confined to the cases specially mentioned by way of exception in section 71, the successor of former section 57. With this restriction upon the power given to the court to order the cancellation of certificates removed, and the provision that they shall be conclusive evidence, etc., only so long as they remain in force and uncancelled, the court, independently of the present section 126, would probably have jurisdiction in such an action as this, which in my opinion is not within section 76, upon equitable grounds other than those specially excepted in section 71, to order the cancellation of a certificate, at all events where rights of a third party holding the status of a bon\u00e0 fide purchaser for value have not intervened.\nBy section 52 the court is further enabled to require the district-registrar\nto do every such act and make every such entry as may be necessary io give effect to the judgment, order, or decree of the court.\nUnder this provision I am of the opinion that in a proper case the court may require that an order of foreclosure shall be removed from the register whether a certificate of title based upon it has or has not issued. I have not failed to note that by section 114 an order of foreclosure when entered in the register is declared to\nhave the effect of vesting in the mortgagee or his transferee the land mentioned in such order free from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the owner, mortgagor or incumbrancer,\nand that such an order is not expressly made subject to the provision, \"so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled,\" as are certificates of title under section 71. But section 114 proceeds to provide that upon entry of the order of foreclosure the mortgagee, incumbrancee or transferee'shall * * * be deemed a transferee of the land and be entitled to receive a certificate of title for the same.\nWhere a certificate of title issues it is the culmination of the proceedings for foreclosure. It cannot be that, although this certificate is subject to cancellation under the combined effect of sections 52 and 71, the order of foreclosure is so irrevocable and conclusive that it renders effective action by the courts impossible and the cancellation or vacating of the certificate based upon it entirely futile. It is true that on its face the language of section 114 is absolute and subject to no qualification. But reading this section in the light of sections 52 and 71, and having regard to the nature and the office of the certificate of title and its relation to the foreclosure proceedings, it is, I think, reasonably clear that an order for foreclosure under section 114 must be subject to the jurisdiction of the court at least to the same extent as a certificate of title and that such an order is an instrument with which the court is empowered by section 52 to require the registrar to deal as it may direct,\nRut I entertain no doubt that since the amendment to section 126, conferring upon the court, or declaring it to possess, in respect of mortgages, the jurisdiction which it would have if the \"Real Property Act\" had not been passed (probably enacted to remove doubts), the court has power to open up foreclosure proceedings taken under sections 113 and 114 of the \"Real Property Act\" in the same manner and upon the same grounds as it may open up a foreclosure decreed in an ordinary action. I express no opinion upon the existence or the exercise of this power in cases of statutory foreclosure where the rights of a bon\u00e0 fide purchaser for value have intervened. That case is not before us. But while the property still remains entirely in the control of the mortgagee, his statutory foreclosure under sections 113 and 114 is, in my opinion, clearly subject to the equitable jurisdiction of the court.\nIt was held by the learned trial judge, not dissented from in the Court of Appeal, and admitted at bar in this court, that if this foreclosure had been in an ordinary action the court would in the exercise of its discretion open it up and appoint a new day for redemption. This admission renders it unnecessary now to consider the sufficiency of the grounds on which the plaintiff claims relief.\nI merely desire to add that a perusal of the record has satisfied me that the view of the learned trial judge is abundantly supported and that the admission of counsel for the respondent was well advised. Platt v. Ashbridge[4]; Campbell v. Holyland[5], at page 172.\nThe plaintiff's appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the provincial Court of Appeal. In my opinion she is also entitled, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, to her costs of action. She should be declared entitled to redeem the mortgaged premises upon payment of the proper amount of redemption moneys to be fixed according to the usual practice in the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, which should also appoint a new day for redemption. In default of redemption under this judgment the plaintiff's appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, Fullerton, Coyne & Foley.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Baker & Young.\n[1] 19 Man.

VII. c. 74, s. 2, s.-s. 2(c) and 4, sch. 2, art. 4\u2014 Remedial legislation\u2014Refusal of damages\u2014Right of appeal\u2014 Evidence.\nIn an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia claiming damages under the ''Employers' Liability Act\" and, alternatively, under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" the plaintiff, at the trial, abandoned the claim under the former Act and, thereupon, the judge dealt with the case as a claim under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" found that the plaintiff's deceased husband came to his death solely in consequence of his own \"wilful and serious misconduct,\" and, therefore, under sub-section 2(c) of section 2 of the Act, held that she was precluded from obtaining compensation in consequence of his death.\nPer Davies, Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The right of appeal from a decision in the course of proceedings to which article 4 of the second schedule of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" applies is available only for questioning the determination of the court or judge upon some question of law. Decisions upon questions of fact in adjudicating upon a claim brought before the Supreme Court under sub-section 4 of section 2 of that Act are not subject to appeal. Whether or not there is any reasonable evidence to support a finding of wilful and serious misconduct is an appealable question.\nIn the circumstances of the case the court held, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that there was not reasonable evidence to support the finding of wilful and serious misconduct. The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (15 B.C. Rep. 198) was dismissed, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J. at the trial[2], and referring the case back to the trial judge for the assessment of compensation to the plaintiff.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nLaflevr K.C. for the appellants.\nCraig for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in an action for damages brought under the \"Employer's Liability Act,\" but disposed of by the trial judge as a claim under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" The reasonable inference from all the evidence as found by the trial judge, is that the deceased lost his life when in the employment of the defendants through an accident arising out of that employment. This finding having been accepted by both parties, the question, and the only question, the provincial appeal court was called upon to decide was: In the materials he had before him was there sufficient to justify the learned trial judge, when fixing the compensation to be assessed under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" for British Columbia, in dismissing the respondent's claim on the ground that the deceased had been guilty of serious and wilful misconduct to which the accident was solely attributable? That court found no evidence from which this conclusion could reasonably be drawn. It is now for us to say whether the finding of the appeal court is so clearly erroneous that we should reverse. No one saw what occurred and the real cause of the accident is left to conjecture and the evidence shews it could have happened in a variety of ways. The deceased was a foreigner with an imperfect knowledge of the English language. He was hired as a temporary man in the appellants' factory and his work brought him in contact with a lift or elevator used for the hoisting of goods and the conveyance of employees from one floor to another. No one was in charge of the lift which appears to have been slow going, of simple construction and easily managed. It was in fact set in motion by each one of the employees as he required to use it. After he had been at work for the best portion of the first day, the body of the deceased was found caught between the elevator and the archway at the ceiling.\nThe plaintiff (now respondent) having proved that she was dependent on the deceased and that he came to his death during his employment, the defendants (now appellants) to escape liability were required to prove that the injury was attributable solely to the serious and wilful misconduct or serious negligence of the deceased.\nHow can the appellants be held to have discharged this burden so long as the cause of the accident is admitted to be unknown? The deceased is not here to explain; and with all their witnesses available the appellants are obliged to admit that they cannot say how the body reached the place where it was found. The learned trial judge, it is quite true, drew this inference;\nthat on his way to the lavatory, he worked the lift in the wrong way and upon finding it ascending instead of descending, the deceased attempted to get out and was caught.\nI admit that where the evidence is contradictory one must proceed very cautiously in considering the weight to be given to inferences drawn by a judge when assessing damages in a proceeding under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\"; but here there is no dispute as to the facts. The only evidence of the occurrence is given by the employees of the defendants, and our duty is to decide whether the intermediate provincial court of appeal was absolutely in error when they held that the inference drawn by the trial judge from that evidence read and considered as a whole was wrong.\nIf the trial judge might fairly assume that the deceased met his death when using the elevator, this question remains: Was there any evidence to justify the further assumption that to have done so in the circumstances was such serious and wilful misconduct as to defeat the plaintiff's claim? The misconduct consisted, as the trial judge apparently found, in the deliberate breach of a rule and warning, in that the deceased used the elevator contrary to an order and that he was personally and specifically told not to use it. I agree with the Court of Appeal. There is no evidence to support these findings. Morgan, in his. evidence, states that Woodworth, the head foreman, said:\nI told Granick and Morgan both standing there not to let Granick use the elevator until he was acquainted with it. * * * I told him to leave it alone until he learned how to' run it. The only evidence of the rule relied upon by the trial judge is to be found in Morgan's deposition where he states the rule with respect to new men. He says that\nnew men were generally instructed not to use the elevator at all unless there was somebody running it.\nIn this case no such rule was ever made known to the deceased. He received, when entering upon his duties, the qualified instruction not to use the elevator until he knew how to run it, leaving it, therefore, by implication, to himself to decide when he could safely use it. Assuming, as inferred by the judge, that the deceased used the elevator when going to the lavatory, \u2014 what were the special instructions he received at that time? Being asked to give all the conversation that took place, Morgan says:\nI was in quite a hurry and I explained to him as well as I could where it was, pointed to the stairway.\nDoes this hurried instruction to a foreigner imperfectly acquainted with the English language imply a prohibition against using the elevator on his way to the lavatory? And, if he did use it, what evidence is there he had not learned to use it at that time? He had been employed previously in electric works in Winnipeg and as a blacksmith for the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. The elevator was easily worked. Is there a necessary and inevitable presumption that he did not then know how to use it? The previous warning given by Morgan, and so much relied on, was given some time in the forenoon. The accident was at No. 2 elevator, and the conversation with Morgan in the forenoon was at No. 1. To sum up my view I cannot agree that, because of the instructions given by Wood-worth in the early morning before work began, or by Morgan sometime in the forenoon, or again immediately before the accident when Granick started for the lavatory, to use the elevator, if the deceased did use it, was wilful wrongdoing and not mere thoughtlessness. No categorical rule applicable to those who used the elevator is proved to have been observed in the factory, or ever brought to the notice of the deceased; and to support the trial judge we must infer from the vague instructions given as to the use of the elevator in the forenoon, from the hurried explanation of the way to the lavatory given immediately before the fatal accident, that the deceased, if he used the elevator, was in so doing guilty of serious and wilful misconduct. I think the reasonable conclusion on all the evidence is that, the direct cause of the accident being admittedly unexplained, it must be classed among those known in the French law as accidents anonymes which apparently are almost inevitable in the operation of large industrial establishments and the burdens of which are made a charge directly upon the industry but indirectly on the public by the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" Planiol, Th\u00e8ses sur la responsibilit\u00e9 civile, vol. 34 ; Rev. Crit, de L\u00e9g., at p. 282.\nThe body was found between the elevator and the floor. How it got there, how the deceased was killed, is the secret of Providence. All, in so far as this record shews, is left to conjecture. I am fortified in my conclusion by the rule laid down in this court in Deniers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co.[3], where Taschereau J. said, at page 538, speaking for the court :\nFor it is settled law upon which we have often acted here, that where a judgment upon facts has been rendered by a court of first instance, and a first court of appeal has reversed that judgment, a second court of appeal should interfere with the judgment on the first appeal only if clearly satisfied that it is erroneous.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree that there is no general right of appeal from the decisions of a judge in assessing or refusing to assess damages under subsection 2 of section 4 of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of British Columbia. The only right of appeal given by the statute to the full court from any such decision is upon any question of law in respect of such assessment of damages.\nSuch being the case, the only question for the appeal court to decide was whether there was any evidence from which a reasonable man could find that the accident which caused the death of the deceased was solely attributable to the serious and wilful misconduct of the workman.\nI have reached the conclusion that there was such evidence and that the finding of the trial judge was right, but whether we agree or do not agree with his conclusions, we have no power to interfere if there is any evidence from which a reasonable man might find as he did.\nSome remarks of Lord Loreburn, in the case of Johnson v. Marshall Sons & Co.[4], at page 412, were relied upon as shewing that in his opinion the use of a lift contrary to orders or rules was not so dangerous as in itself to amount to serious misconduct. But I venture to think no such general conclusion should be drawn from his language, which was intended to be applied to the facts with which he was dealing only. In that case the lift was for use by workmen in charge of a load, forbidden to workmen not in charge of a load; as His Lordship there says:\nthe offence was not that the man used it., but that he used it without a load.\nUser by a workman entitled to use it when in charge of a load was not \"serious misconduct\"' on the same workman's part if used by him at a time when there was no load, because, though a breach of the orders, it was not such a breach as necessarily involved himself or others in danger.\nThe language of Lord Loreburn in my judgment lends no countenance to the conclusion that a workman not understanding how to use or control a lift and forbidden to operate it until he does understand it, is not guilty of \"serious and wilful misconduct\" if he attempts to use it in violation of his orders.\nIn a later case, George v. Glasgow Coal Co.[5], at page 128, Lord Loreburn says:\nIn my opinion it is not the province of a court to lay down that the breach of a rule is prima facie evidence of serious and wilful misconduct. That is a question purely of fact to be determined by the arbitrator as such. The arbitrator must decide for himself and ought not to be fettered by artificial presumptions of fact prescribed by a court of law.\nNow, in the case before us the judge, acting as arbitrator, found as a reasonable inference from all the facts that the deceased workman was guilty of serious and wilful misconduct in attempting, contrary to his explicit instructions, to use the elevator before he had learned how to use it, and we have no right as a court of appeal, to \"fetter by artificial presumptions of fact\" any such finding or to review it.\nAs to whether the use of an elevator contrary to express orders by a workman ignorant of how to use and control it is \"serious misconduct,\" I think the judgment of Lord Robertson, concurred in by Lord Collins in the case of George v. Glasgow Coal Co.[6] conclusive that it is. He says, at page 130:\nYou are to judge of the question of seriousness by reference to the subject-matter, if it touches life or limb.\nI Understand it is contended that as the deceased man's instructions were not to use the elevator until he had learned how to do so, he cannot be held guilty of wilful and serious misconduct in using it unless it is proved he had not at the moment of the accident learned how to do so. There is evidence, I think, beyond doubt, from which it may fairly be inferred that he did not know how to use the elevator when he was employed in the morning, and also that he had not learned how to use it at some time not fixed in the forenoon. It is obvious that such proof cannot be direct and positive and have relation to the man's knowledge at the very moment of the accident. From the very nature of the case the question whether he had learned to use the elevator or not must remain and be a question of fact to be found by the arbitrator by reasonable inference from all the proved facts.\nThe broad facts here are that the man was hired in the morning as a temporary hand during a rush of work. That the foreman instructed him to go to work with Morgan, one of the older hands, and told them both, Granick (the deceased) and Morgan, while standing together, that Granick was not to use the elevator until he was acquainted with it, and that\nMorgan was to send him up to open the trap doors and shut them again and come down the steps.\nHere we have one thing prohibited and other work prescribed. The foreman saw the man afterwards doing the work of opening and shutting the trap doors specially assigned to him.\nIt seems clear from Morgan's evidence that this division of work was maintained during the few hours between the hiring and the occurrence of the accident, Morgan operating the lift and Granick opening and closing the trap doors of the several floors, using the staircase while so doing. That once, during some part of the forenoon, the exact hour not being fixed, Granick went on the elevator ahead of Morgan and attempted to run it, but was promptly told \"to leave it alone till he knew how to run it.\" That after dinner and just before the fatal accident, the same division of labour continued. The elevator was on the third floor; Morgan and Granick were there and the former sent the latter down the staircase, as usual, to close the traps while he himself took two trucks down the elevator; and when he descended to the shipping or first floor he there met Granick, who had come down the staircase and who said he wanted to go to the toilet, whereupon he explained where it was and pointed to the stairway for him to go to it.\nMorgan further explained that he, Morgan, closed the doors of the elevator, left it standing at the first floor where he got out, and went to an adjoining shed for a few minutes to get something wanted; when returning, he found the elevator up against the bottom of No. 2 floor, and the body of Granick jammed between the elevator and the floor.\nThe inference which the trial judge drew as an arbitrator from this evidence was that\non his way to the lavatory he worked the lift in the wrong way and finding it ascending instead of descending, he attempted to get out and was killed.\nI think this a justifiable finding of fact under the evidence. The evidence may not be as strong as one could wish, but there is some and enough to enable the reasonable inference to be drawn which the arbitrator has drawn.\nGranick was forbidden when taken on as a temporary hand in the morning to use the elevator until he had learned how to do so. He was put with and under the charge of an experienced man who was to use the elevator and to employ Granick at other work, such as opening and closing the traps while the elevator was-being used in carrying loads. At some time in the morning hours before dinner, he went into the elevator ahead of Morgan and made an attempt to use it, but was promptly stopped and forbidden to do so until he knew how. Neither at that time nor when the foreman gave him his instructions at the hiring did he suggest that he knew how to use it. Immediately before the accident, at 2 p.m., he came down from the third floor by way of the staircase, attending to his special duty of opening and closing the trap doors while Morgan descended by the elevator. He asked for the toilet and was told to go by the staircase and evidently must, as soon as Morgan turned and went to the adjoining shed, have wilfully opened the door of the elevator and attempted, with fatal results, to use it. As I think there was evidence on which the arbitrator-judge could make his finding, and as in such case we have no right to review it, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent sued for damages arising from the death of her husband as result or an accident in appellants' factory claiming under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" and alternatively under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nShe failed under the former, but was entitled to have succeeded under the latter and have her damages assessed by the learned trial judge under and by virtue of sub-section 4 of section 2 of the said Act, unless her late husband's death had been the result of his own serious and wilful misconduct.\nThe learned trial judge held the husband had been so guilty and respondent had thereby become disentitled to recover at all.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversed this finding and referred the matter back to the learned trial judge to assess the damages.\nThe sole question thus raised for our decision is whether or not the deceased had been guilty of such misconduct.\nHe was found crushed in an elevator used in appellants' warehouse, and which it is alleged he was forbidden to use.\nIt is not by any means clear how deceased came into the place where his body was found. Whether it had been the result of its use solely by himself or by some other of the employees whom he had been helping is left in doubt.\nHe was only a casual hand hired by the day at so much an hour, coming on for the first time at seven a.m., and he was found dead at two p.m., in the elevator, crushed between its cage and the ceiling of one of the five or six flats served by this elevator.\nThe evidence is very meagre and, I agree with the learned Chief Justice below, could have been made clearer on many points by the appellants on whom the burden of proof lay.\nIt is contended that deceased violated a positive command not to use the elevator at all.\nBut there is not any proper evidence to maintain such a contention, and in any event I doubt if anything short thereof could avail appellant.\nThe foreman says as follows:\n17. Q. What conversation did you have with him then? A. I told Granick and Morgan, both standing there, to not let Granick use the elevator until he was acquainted with it, and send him up and open the trap doors and shut them again, and come down the steps.\n18. Q. You say you told Granick that? A. Well, Morgan and Granick together; I says to Morgan, I say you take the things up the elevator and bring them down again and let Granick open up the trap doors and close them again.\n19. Q. Do you know whether Granick understood you or not? A. He must have understood me, because he done as he was told, he shut the trap doors and opened them.\nThis foreman directing operations did not know whether the deceased could speak English or not, yet seeks to lead the court to infer from the man's doing things he had been directed to do that he must have understood English.\nI surmise, from the fact that the foreman's remarks were addressed to Morgan, enjoining him not to let Granick use the elevator till he was \"acquainted\" with its use, that the foreman had a pretty shrewd idea Granick was not possessed of an English tongue.\nMoreover, why was there any doubt left to exist on the point of this command being expressly and clearly understood if intended to insist upon its breach as misconduct of any kind?\nThe first thing done by Morgan and Granick was to use this or another elevator. Morgan ran it then.\nIf the Swede, or German, had the ordinary intelligence of his race and calling that ride alone probably enabled him to see how it was run.\nEven if he understood English only as imperfectly as appears, he might not so have grasped the purport of the words addressed to Morgan as to understand them in the sense that he was duly commanded to refrain from running the elevator.\nBut the man's command of English was most imperfect if we read the respondent's broken English in which she gave her evidence and believe her when she says :\nQ. And did he speak or understand English? A. He didn't speak very well, but he could understand enough if he got work any places.\nQ. He couldn't speak as well as you? A. No, not half so good.\nQ. How do you account for that; as a matter of fact he was in the country longer than you, had he not been? A. Yes, but he wasn't working with English people.\nQ. In Winnipeg he was working? A. He didn't work for English people.\nQ. How do you come to speak as well as you do? A. I come from the old country and went right straight working in one place two years.\nQ. (By the court): With English-speaking people? A. Yes.\nNo one questions her veracity.\nMorgan, who took him to shew him his work, says:\nQ. What did you say to him? A. We were talking about several things.\nQ. Did he understand English? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Well, or fairly well, or how? A. He understood it pretty good.\nQ. You hadn't any difficulty in understanding him? A. No.\nQ. Did he have any difficulty in understanding you? A. None. I venture to submit with respect, that any person who can find from this evidence, giving all of it due credence, that the deceased had any accurate idea of what the word \"acquainted\" as used by the foreman meant or implied, must, I fear, have little idea of the embarrassments that such a man as deceased has to endure in his struggle to understand the English tongue.\nIt seems to me that to infer, even if we are to assume, what is not proven, that the user of this elevator on the fatal occasion was solely an act of the deceased undirected or unaided by any one else, was a disobedient, wilful violation of this alleged command would be cruel indeed.\nTo treat it as serious and wilful misconduct is something never intended by the Act.\nBut reliance is also placed by appellants on another circumstance stated by Morgan as follows:\nQ. Was there any other circumstance connected with the accident; that is, you used some other elevator? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Did you have any conversation with him about the elevator? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. What was it; tell me? A. He went on the elevator ahead of me there over in No. 1 shed, and he wanted to run it, and I told him to leave it alone until he knew how to run it.\nQ. How long was this before the accident? A. That was some time in the forenoon.\nWhat is there in this? Or coupled with the foregoing, what do these suggestions amount to? The elevator was of a slow-running type and the description given of all one had to learn shews its operation to have been of the simplest kind.\nAny ordinary man who had been engaged as the deceased was in a Canadian Pacific Railway shop as blacksmith's helper, for nearly a year, must have been very stupid if he could not learn the running of such a machine by watching Morgan do it on the two occasions he was with him.\nBesides we have, as the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal points out, a half-day's work all over the place and what it implies, and no attempt to fix this latter incident later than it might have been, possibly the same hour as the first.\nThe very direction given by the foreman in regard to a man only hired for a day, implied the expectation that the man would learn through the day to use the elevator. His usefulness as a servant demanded that he should do so as soon as possible.\nThere is no evidence that he did not or from which it can be fairly inferred he did not.\nIn addition to all this I agree with the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice in the court below.\nMoreover, if I had any doubt it necessarily should be resolved in favour of the judgment appealed from.\nIn my view of the evidence I find no occasion for struggling with the problem of whether or not the learned trial judge is to be held as taking the place of and being held as an arbitrator. There is, I respectfully submit, no such evidence as would entitle, within the law as laid down in Johnson v. Marshall Sons & Co.[7], the learned judge to draw such inference of serious and wilful misconduct as to exonerate appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nI am not able to agree with the opinion of the court below that there is a general right of appeal against a refusal by a judge of the Supreme Court to assess compensation under section 2 (4) of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act, 1902.\" It seems to be clear that the right of appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in the course of proceedings to which article 4 of the second schedule applies is available only for the purpose of questioning the determination of that court upon some point of law. If decisions upon questions of fact in adjudicating upon a claim brought before the Supreme Court under sub-section 4 of section 2 are to be treated as decisions falling within the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" conferring a right of appeal from judgments and orders of the Supreme Court, then these provisions must also extend to decisions on points of law in any such adjudication; and if so what purpose is served by that part of article 4 which expressly gives a right of appeal from such last-mentioned decisions? That part of the enactment is upon the hypothesis suggested, entirely superfluous. The implication that the general right of appeal is excluded is palpable; and it is of much the same order as that which excludes the remedy by action for the infringement of a newly created statutory right where the enactment that constitutes the right at the same time provides another remedy for the violation of it. Here there is an authority vested for the first time in the Supreme Court to hear and determine claims under a new statutory provision and a right of appeal restricted to a special class of decisions given in the course of passing upon such claims. In the absence of something indicating a contrary intention the legislature must be taken to have intended that the claimant's statutory right should be vindicated in the manner prescribed as well in respect of appeals as of proceedings in' the first instance. This view finds in my judgment some confirmation when we consider that the frame of the statute indisputably shews that a most important feature of the scheme adopted was this limited character of the right of appeal given by article 4. The legislature intended obviously to provide a speedy and inexpensive means of dealing with claims under the Act. The importance of instituting some such procedure for determining the claims of the persons\u2014usually of very limited resources\u2014for whose benefit the scheme was designed, can hardly be exaggerated; and the last thing a legislature with such objects in view would be likely to sanction is a general right of appeal on facts as well as on law\u2014with all that such a right of appeal implies in a controversy between litigants of large resources and adversaries with- means inadequate to sustaining the burden of a protracted contest.\nThe questions which the learned trial judge had before him were: (1) Whether the deceased, Granick, lost his life through an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment: (2) Assuming the first question to be answered in the affirmative, whether the claim of the plaintiff must be rejected on the ground that the injury is attributable solely to the \"serious and wilful misconduct or serious neglect\" of Granick.\nBoth of these questions were decided by the learned trial judge in the affirmative and the claim was consequently rejected by him. The question before us is whether there was evidence before him on which such findings could reasonably be reached; and upon the admitted facts of this case I think the decision of the House of Lords in Moore v. The Manchester Liners[8] is conclusive in favour of the respondent upon the questions whether or not the learned trial judge had before him sufficient evidence to support his conclusion upon the first point.\nThe second question raises greater difficulties, but I have come to the conclusion, after careful examination of the evidence and the decision of the learned trial judge, that there was not before him evidence to support a finding against the plaintiff upon that point. In Johnson v. Marshall Sons & Co.[9], at page 412, Lord Loreburn, L.C., said:\nI cannot agree that a lift is an appliance so dangerous that the use of it, when believed to be in proper condition and intended for use, does in itself amount to serious misconduct. Certainly it is for the arbitrator under the Act to decide questions of fact; but when there is no evidence it is for the court to interpose.\nIn that case the workman had used the lift in disobedience to orders and it was held that that circumstance alone was not sufficient to support a finding bringing him. within the \"misconduct\" clause. In this case the learned trial judge has found that Granick was forbidden to use the lift until he should learn how to use it. This direction was given at 7 o'clock in the morning when Granick was first taken on by the appellants as a temporary hand. There is no evidence that between 7 o'clock in the morning and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when the accident occurred, Granick was not taught to use the lift. The learned Judge has found that Granick was inexperienced as regards lifts, but that is an observation, with great respect, which is not based on anything in the record. It is admitted that the lift was of the very simplest kind, and it seems to me to be too palpable for discussion that there is nothing in the evidence whatever to shew or upon which to base an interference that complete mastery of it could not be acquired by any man of ordinary intelligence within a very short time. There are suggestions in the evidence to the effect that there was a rule forbidding the employees to use the lift except for the purpose of carrying freight. That, however, has no bearing upon the issue the learned judge was called upon to decide because there is nothing whatever to shew that any such rule or practice was ever brought to Granick's attention.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The defendants appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment of Morrison J., who held that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for the death of her husband under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of British Columbia, chapter 74 of the statutes of 1902.\nThe plaintiff brought her action under the \"Employers' Liability Act\"; but, at the trial she was obliged to abandon her allegations of negligence against the defendants and the trial judge thereupon dealt with the case as a claim under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" He found that the death of the plaintiff's husband was due to his own \"wilful and serious misconduct,\" which precluded her claim for compensation. It was practically conceded at bar\u2014 and the authorities fully support the view\u2014that there can be no appeal upon any question of pure fact from the decision of an arbitrator in proceedings under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" Hoddinott v. Newton, Chambers & Co.[10], at page 68; George v. Glasgow Coal Co.[11]; Clover, Clayton & Co. v. Hughes[12]. Where, instead of proceeding under that Act, a plaintiff brings an action to recover damages independently of it and the court in which the action is tried finds him not entitled to recover in such action, but, nevertheless, entitled to compensation under the provisions of the statute, although it dismisses the action, the court, if the plaintiff so elects, may proceed to assess such compensation and its certificate of the compensation awarded \"shall have the force and effect of an award under this Act.\" (Section 2, sub-section 4.) If the trial judge had found the plaintiff entitled to compensation under the statute and had assessed such compensation his findings of fact would, in my opinion, be non-appealable, as are similar findings of an arbitrator made in a proceeding taken under the other provisions of the statute. Otherwise a plaintiff obtaining an award of compensation in this manner, although his recovery is absolutely the same, would be subject to an appeal essentially different from that given to the defendant where the plaintiff has proceeded and recovered compensation under the other provisions of the statute. I think the legislature did not intend that there should be such different rights of appeal under the same Act where the recoveries are substantially the same.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the full effect intended by the legislature can be given to the provision that a certificate under sub-section 4, of section 2, \"shall have the force and effect of an award under this Act,\" only by holding that where a plaintiff has obtained such a certificate the defendant's right of appeal is precisely the same as he would have had if there had been an award in his favour under the other provisions of the statute and questions of law had been dealt with by the judge on a submission by the arbitrator. This limited right of appeal appears to be given by section 4 of the second schedule \"in any case where (the judge) himself settles the matter.\" The right to compensation being purely statutory, the limited right of appeal specially conferred excludes any right of appeal, which might otherwise exist under legislation of general application.\nShould there be a broader right of appeal where, instead of awarding compensation, the judge has found the plaintiff disentitled to recover by reason of serious and willful misconduct? Had proceedings been taken under the other provisions of the statute there could not have been an appeal upon any question of fact. Where the trial judge, having found that there is no liability independently of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" also holds that there is no liability under that Act, the proceeding is not expressly within the terms of sub-section 4, of section 2, of the statute and the concluding provision as to the force and effect of a certificate of compensation may not be strictly applicable. Nevertheless, in dealing with the plaintiff's claim under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" and determining the question of the defendants' liability, the functions of the trial judge, in my opinion, were much the same as if there had been no action and he had been acting as an arbitrator in proceedings instituted in the first instance under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" except that it was superfluous for him to formally state questions of law involved for submission to himself, and for purposes of appeal he must be deemed to have dealt with such questions as if they had been so submitted. To hold otherwise, would, I think, be contrary to the spirit and the scope of the entire statute. Hoddinott v. Newton, Chambers & Co.[13], at page 59, per Lord Shand. This is a \"case where (the judge) himself settles the matter.\" (Section 4, Schedule 2.) The right of appeal under this provision is expressly confined to \"any question of law\" and is the same appeal which is given where the judge deals with a question of law submitted for his decision by an arbitrator acting under the statute. There is, in my opinion, no other right of appeal. I, therefore, think that the \u00abdefendants' right of appeal from the judgment of Morrison J. was confined to questions of law, or of mixed law and fact, and that the British Columbia Court of Appeal erred in dealing with this case as if the appeal were from a trial judge whose findings and inferences of fact were open to review.\nUpon a perusal of the record I am unable to say that there was not some evidence upon which an arbitrator might, reasonably base a finding that the plaintiff's husband had been guilty of wilful misconduct to which his injury was solely attributable. He was engaged on the morning of the clay on which he was killed. That he had then been forbidden to use the elevator is abundantly proved. Whether the prohibition was absolute, or only \"until he was acquainted with it\" may be open to question. There is evidence in support of either view. If the prohibition was unqualified, the finding that Granick deliberately disobeyed it can scarcely be challenged. If it was qualified, Granick's silent acquiescence in the direction given him affords some evidence of his inexperience. He was again told by his companion, Morgan, in the course of the morning \"to leave the elevator alone.\" His work kept him off the elevator. His duty was \"to open and shut trap doors.\" Only five minutes before the accident occurred he was directed by Morgan to use a stairway, although his destination would have been reached more directly by using the elevator. From these facts taken in conjunction with the circumstances of the accident itself, assuming that the burden rested on the defendants of shewing that Granick's unfitness to operate the elevator continued up to the moment of the accident, I think a jury might reasonably infer that, notwithstanding its simplicity, he was not yet \"acquainted with\" the elevator 'and was, therefore, still subject to the prohibition against its use. That he was injured while attempting to use it seems sufficiently clear. I, therefore, think there was some reasonable evidence upon which a finding that the death of Granick was due to his own wilful misconduct might be based. Upon the weight of that evidence it is not within the province of an appellate tribunal to pass.\nNeither am I prepared to hold that deliberate disobedience to a lawful instruction given by his employer involving danger to his life is not serious misconduct on the part of the workman. George v. Glasgow Coal Co.[14], at page 129\u2014if indeed this \"question purely of fact\" be open to review on appeal (ibid., at page 128). This is not a case merely of disobedience to a regulation of an employer designed to promote economy in the use of motive power or some convenience of management. Johnson v. Marshall Sons & Co., Ltd.[15]. It is a case of the breach of an express direction of which the subject-matter \"touches life and limb.\" George v. Glasgow Coal Co.[16], at page 130.\nI am, therefore, with great respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, the judgment of the Court of Appeal vacated with costs and that of Morrison J. restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPhillips & Tiffin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Burns & Walkem.\n[1] 15 B.C.

D. had leased lands on the banks of the river to the company which, it was alleged, included the property in dispute. The only evidence as to interruption of prescription consisted of a letter by the company to D. enclosing a cheque in payment for \"use of your interest in Cap Rouge River this year,\" with an indorsement by D. acknowledging receipt of the funds \"with the understanding that the navigation of the river is not to be prevented.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (13 Ex. C.R. 116), Girouard and Idington JJ. dissenting, that the memorandum was too vague to serve as an interruptive acknowledgment sufficient to defeat the title claimed by the company.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allotting to the respondents the sum of $800, with interest, from and out of the amount awarded as compensation for property expropriated by the Crown for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway.\nOn an information by the Attorney-General of Canada, on behalf of the Crown, against the parties to the present appeal to have the certain wharves, timber coves and riparian lots, including the lands in question, vested in the Crown and compensation therefor ascertained, the value of the whole property to be expropriated was fixed at $40,000 and, in the court below, the remaining question to be decided was whether or not the Duchesnay heirs were, at the date of the expropriation, in 1906, entitled to compensation in respect of six-tenths of an acre of the property forming part of the bed of the Cap Rouge River. The heirs claimed the property in dispute in virtue of a seignioral grant, in 1652; at high tide it was completely covered with water, but at low tides the area above mentioned was uncovered; the value was fixed at $800. The company claimed the property in dispute, having held possession of the whole area as owners since 1857, while it was contended by the heirs that it had been held by the company as tenants of their auteur under a lease which was still subsisting in 1877. On 21st June, 1877, the manager of the company wrote the following letter to the late Honourable A. J. Duchesnay: \"Enclosed please find cheque for $60 for use of your interest in Cap Rouge River this year. Can you oblige by letting me know, from old deeds or otherwise, where my line is between you arid the property I bought on the Cap Rouge Hill. I would be willing to make all the fence at my expense if you will be kind enough to have the lines hunted up.\" Written across this letter was the following, signed by A. J. Duchesnay: \"Received the sum of sixty dollars as mentioned in the note, with the understanding that the navigation of the river is not to be prevented. \u2014 Another receipt sent. \u2014 In a few days I shall be able to give you the description of the property which Messrs. Atkinson (former managers) had at Cap Rouge.\" The learned judge of the Exchequer Court held that the effect of this letter was to interrupt prescription in favour of the company and awarded the value of the lands in dispute ($800), to the Duchesnay heirs.\nThe material questions on this appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nFlynn K.C. and E. T. Paquet for the respondents.\nArthur Fitzpatrick for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons stated in the judgment of Anglin J.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated in the court below.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by my brother Anglin and that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I agree with Mr. Justice Cassels' reasoning. The test he applies to the effect of the receipt as a piece of evidence that would have answered any action brought to recover the premises in question is, to my mind, on this evidence as a whole unanswerable.\nThe evidence relied upon to furnish any answer does not go far enough and only gives rise to a suspicion that there may, after all, have been existent at the time some further explanation or evidence thereof lost through lapse of time. The onus of answering the case, the receipt shews, rested upon the respondents.\nDuff J.\u2014It is hardly disputed that the appellants entered into corporeal possession in 1857, or that the animus rem sibi habendi was sufficiently evidenced by the character of the occupation then assumed.\nThis state of facts is met by the respondents with an allegation that an interruption of this possession occurred in 1877. Since there was no rupture of the continuity of the appellants' physical occupation, the respondents, on this point, can only succeed by proving an express acknowledgment of title in them, or by adducing evidence unmistakably evincing an intention to recognize such a title. The evidence they produce is a letter addressed to M. Duchesnay by the appellants, dated the 21st June, 1877, containing this sentence:\nEnclosed please find cheque for $60, for use of your interest in Cap Rouge River this year.\nThis document does not appear to me to imply any admission respecting the extent of M. Duchesnay's interest; how then can it be said to contain an acknowledgment that within his interest was comprised the property in dispute? With that property the document does not connect itself; and it is, consequently, inefficacious for the purpose of establishing an interruption of the appellants' possession of it.\nAnglin J.\u2014Subject to an alleged interruption founded on a letter of their manager, dated the 21st of June, 1877, the evidence in the record, in my opinion, satisfactorily establishes the prescriptive title of the appellants to the property in question in the present appeal. This letter is, in part, as follows:\nHon. A. J. Duchesnay, Quebec, 21 June, 1877.\nQuebec.\nSir,\u2014Enclosed please find cheque for $60 for use of your interest in Cap Rouge River this year. * * *\nYours truly,\nJ. Bowen, Jr.\nWithout evidence that M. Duchesnay had no interest in the river other than that in question in this action the allusion in this letter to \"your interest in the Cap Rouge River\" is, in my opinion, too vague and indefinite to warrant ascribing it to the property now claimed by the appellants and, without more, treating their prescriptive title as defeated by \"interruptive acknowledgment.\"\nLes lettres ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 bien des contestations, parcequ'il est rare qu'elles aient la pr\u00e9cision requise en droit. Laurent, vol. 32, n. 128.\nBut when produced by the respondents, this letter bore upon it this memorandum, presumably in the . handwriting of the late M. Duchesnay:\nReceived the sum of sixty dollars as mentioned in this note; with the understanding that the navigation of the river is not to be prevented. 22 June, 1877.\nAnt. J. Duchesnay.\nAnother receipt sent.\nA. J. D. It has also been proved that the interests of the Hon. A. J. Duchesnay in Cap Rouge River were not confined to the property in issue. The appellants were, indeed, lessees of some of his other interests and paid him rental therefor. These latter facts alone, in my opinion, suffice, in the absence of any evidence that the appellants ever paid rent for the property now in question, to render it not improbable that the letter of the 21st of June referred to such other interests.\nBut the indorsement,\nwith the understanding that the navigation of the river is not to be prevented\u2014\nseems to me to make it still more doubtful that the \"interest in Cap Rouge River\" to which the writer of the letter of the 21st of June had reference was the property in question in this action. This wharf was of such a character that its use for legitimate wharfage purposes while necessarily involving some interference with navigation would not prevent it. As owner of interests in another part of the Cap Rouge River the seigneur Duchesnay leased to the appellants the right to boom or store logs. This right might be so exercised as to prevent navigation and the stipulation in the memorandum \"that the navigation of the river is not to be prevented\" indicates that the rental of which receipt is acknowledged was in respect of an interest of this character.\nIn my opinion the respondents have not satisfied the burden which was upon them to make out a case of interruptive acknowledgment.\nIt is, therefore, unnecessary to consider the other important and difficult question, to which so much argument was devoted at bar, viz., whether the fundus upon which the wharf in question is erected properly forms part of the bed of the Cap Rouge River, or should be regarded as part of the bed of the River St.\nLawrence.\nI am, with great respect, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that judgment should be entered in the Exchequer Court for the appellants also with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitor for the respondents: E.

L.R. 659) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, as County Crown Attorney and Clerk of the Peace for the County of Essex, applied for a mandamus to compel the municipality to provide him a proper office. In his statement of claim he set out the fact that Windsor is by far the most important place in the county, and that an office there instead of at Sandwich, the county town, would be the most convenient for the public; also that the office had been at Windsor for many years prior to 1908, when the County Council refused to continue it and provided and could provide none at Sandwich.\nAt the trial Falconbridge C.J. held that the allegations in the statement of claim were proved while those in the statement of defence were not; that suitable offices could not be provided at Sandwich; and that the plaintiff was entitled to a mandamus to compel the corporation to provide one at Windsor. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nWigle K.C. for the appellant. By the Ontario \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d certain officers of the county must reside in the county town. No such provision is made as to the County Crown Attorney and Clerk of the Peace, and the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius applies. See Morgan v. Crawshay[2].\nIf the corporation fails in its duty to provide a proper office for these officials they may do so themselves at its expense. Lees v. County of Carleton[3].\nA.H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given in the court below.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It is important that the records of which the Clerk of the Peace is custodian, should not only be safely kept from risks of fire but in such orderly manner as to be readily accessible to whom- soever their inspection may concern. For this purpose alone a vault in the court house would seem the best arrangement.\nIt is necessary also that offices in the court house should be available in connection therewith to serve the same officer as Clerk of the Peace and County Crown Attorney whilst discharging his duties in connection with the sittings of the several courts at which he must attend in the court house.\nUnder the peculiar conditions that have developed in Essex, where the largest city therein is two miles from the court house, it is not to be expected that any man, who would be a desirable incumbent of the office, should stay in the court house continuously.\nOn the one hand the people who wish to see him at other times than on the occasions of a court sitting, would have to travel two miles out of their usual business resort to transact a piece of business that may not require ten minutes of attendance.\nOn the other hand, the officer is generally a man in such active practice that he cannot afford to inconvenience his general clients and himself by staying two miles from the centre of business in the county.\nAn allowance for a share of office rent in Windsor to supplement the periodical use of some offices in the court house is not a very large item, and the refusal by respondent\u2019s council to do what had long been done for many years in that regard, is not to be commended.\nHowever regrettable it may be that the respondent\u2019s council have not seen their way to act otherwise, and in some such way as I have indicated as a reasonable solution of the difficulties, I do not see how we can help appellant.\nThe law does not seem to have been yet put in such shape as to enable us to interfere with the jurisdiction of the county council in the matter.\nIf we allowed the appeal and granted a mandamus the court could only execute it so far as to enforce the furnishing of accommodation in or near the court house, which has been offered and rejected.\nIt is not to be supposed that the council are acting in bad faith in the offer made and, though not as expressly continued in their pleadings as it might have been, I doubt if we should be justified in assuming as necessary a mandamus limited to an office in or near to the court house.\nThe sort of office so far provided in the court house is entirely inadequate.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant, Mr. Rodd, is the County Crown Attorney and Clerk of the Peace for the County of Essex, and the municipal corporation of that county is bound to provide him as the incumbent of these offices with proper office accommodation under section 506 of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d of Ontario.\nThe county town of Essex is Sandwich. Mr. Rodd resides and carries on the practice of his profession in Windsor. The County Council profess their willingness to provide office accommodation for Mr. Rodd at the court house in Sandwich. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, who tried the action, held that there is no place in the court house or in the county town which is suitable or which can be made suitable for the performance of the official duties of Mr. Rodd, who, indeed, before the commencement of the action, had informed the council that he would not occupy an office in Sandwich. I think the Court of Appeal rightly dismissed the action, because I do not think the evidence warrants the conclusion that the County Council might not in a reasonable exercise of their discretion decide that the plaintiff in his official capacities ought to be domiciled in the county town. That being so, it follows, of course, that a refusal to provide an office in Windsor accompanied by an offer to furnish accommodation at Sandwich does not necessarily amount to a refusal to perform the duty of providing \u201cproper offices\u201d in accordance with the enactment mentioned.\nIn view of the position taken by Mr. Rodd criticism of the accommodation actually furnished at Sandwich appears to be irrelevant. A mandatory order at the suit of the plaintiff directing something which the plaintiff has from the outset declared would be useless to him would involve a startling disregard of the considerations which govern the court in the exercise of its discretionary powers; and there can be no remedy in damages first because there has been no refusal to provide accommodation at Sandwich, and secondly, because if there had been, the plaintiff, whose action, if any, is an action on the case[4], cannot be said to have suffered any harm through the failure to furnish accommodation which admittedly he would not have used.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I agree in the view that, having regard to the provisions of section 506 of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act of Ontario,\u201d the selection of the place at which it shall provide an office for the Crown Attorney and the Clerk of the Peace rests with the County Council, and while the courts may compel the performance of the duty of making the selection, where a conscientious judgment has been exercised by the body to whom that duty is committed, the court will not substitute its sense of fitness for that of such body. Judicial interference might be warranted if it were shewn that the discretion of the County Council had not been exercised \u201cin a manner fair, candid and unprejudiced.\u201d Upon the evidence, such a case has not here been established. Having regard to the fact that some of his duties render it necessary that the Crown Attorney should have an office in the county court house, it is impossible to say that in determining that any office which it should provide must be in the court house, the conduct of the council was \u201carbitrary, capricious or biassed.\u201d Rex v. Askew[5].\nIt is not contended for the appellant that he is entitled to have two offices provided for him at the public expense. If it be necessary for the discharge of some of his duties, as is admitted, that the Crown Attorney should have an office in the court house, however desirable it may be that he should also have an office in Windsor, the statute does not, I think, impose on the County Council the duty of providing it.\nAlthough it would appear from their judgments that the learned judges of the Court of Appeal regarded the right of the appellant to an office in the City of Windsor, at the expense of the County of Essex, as the only substantial question in this action, it is now urged that the right of the appellant to a proper office in Sandwich, (which it has been found the County Council failed to furnish for him,) was also in issue. This right is asserted in the statement of claim, and is repeated in the reasons against appeal in the Court of Appeal. The prayer for relief covers it. The finding of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the office provided in the county court house was unsuitable and inadequate, is well supported by the evidence, and has been affirmed in appeal. The statutory duty of the council to provide a proper office, etc., is clear. If there were nothing more in the case, assuming that a private action for such relief might be maintained by the appellant, his prayer for a mandamus requiring the County Council to provide him with a proper office should perhaps be acceded to.\nBut mandamus is a discretionary remedy which will not be granted merely to enforce some abstract right so as to entail upon the defendant expense and trouble without any substantial benefit or advantage accruing therefrom to the plaintiff. To the remedy of mandamus the maxim lex neminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia peragenda applies. The King v. The Bishop of London[6]. Moreover, notwithstanding that an applicant may have made out a case of strict legal right, in the exercise of its discretionary power the court will consider his motives, and if not convinced of their propriety, will withhold relief. The Queen v. Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle-upon-Tyne Railway Co.[7] Antecedent demand and refusal must also be made clear.\nThe plaintiff gave the following evidence at the trial:\u2014\nI may say frankly that I told the County Council, I think in the June session a year ago, that it was not a proper place for me to perform the duties of my office, that I could not do it properly living in Sandwich, and it would be useless for them to provide any office here if they intended me to perform, if I was expected to perform, the duties of my office properly. I could not do it here at all; I would not come; that was the truth of the matter. I told them I would not come here and I would not do it for my own sake, and it would not be proper so far as my office is concerned. My presence in Windsor, so far as my duties are concerned, is imperative.\nIn view of this attitude of the plaintiff, the discretion of the court will, in my opinion, be properly exercised in refusing the mandamus for which he asks. His apparent failure to press this part of his claim before the Court of Appeal renders this course all the more proper.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wigle & Rodd.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Clarke, Bartlet & Bartlet.\n[1] 19 Ont.

A. Farlinger was a member of Valleyfield Lodge and, in January, 1894, entered into a contract of life assurance with the Order, for the benefit of his wife, for $2,000, on the assessment plan. In December, 1905, he applied, in accordance with the rules of the Order, for a \"clearance card\" or certificate which would entitle him to have his membership transferred to another lodge, known as the Longueuil Lodge. By the Constitution of the Order no such certificate could issue nor could such a transfer be effected unless the member requesting it was in good standing and had paid all dues and assessments up to and including those for the month in which his application was made. He received the necessary certificate from the defendant and, on the 2nd of June, 1906, applied for affiliation and was transferred to the Longueuil Lodge. He paid his dues and assessments to that lodge, from month to month, up to the time of his death on the 19th of November, 1906. The claim by his widow, the plaintiff, was resisted by the Order on the ground that at the time of the transfer, on 2nd June, 1906, Farlinger had not in fact been a member in good standing as he was then in arrears for dues and assessments which should have been paid to or through the lodge to which he had previously belonged; that he was under suspension at the time of his death, and, consequently, that, by the conditions of the policy, the Order was, relieved of obligation to pay the amount of the insurance. The plaintiff's action was dismissed at the trial in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, but that judgment was reversed on an appeal to the Superior Court sitting in review. The judgment now appealed from affirmed the judgment of the Court of Review.\nThe issues on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. T. P. Butler K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion Prion K.C. for the appellant.\nAtwater K.C. and J. Wilson Cook for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am disposed to agree with the trial judge that the October assessment was not paid and the deceased was not a member in good standing at the time of his death. I am confirmed in this impression by the failure of the respondent to produce the receipts for July, August, September and October, and the attempt to make a payment after her husband's death. The month for which each of these payments was made must have appeared on the face of these receipts. The presumption is that they were in the possession of the respondent with the policy, and, if not, their loss has not been accounted for nor explained satisfactorily. The highly technical nature of some of the features of the defence, such as the denial of liability on the contract because made in the first instance with the Ontario lodge, and the fact that the deceased is alleged secretly to have joined a lodge in that province, is calculated to prejudice one against the meritorious part of it. The evidence as to suspension in November, 1906, is not as satisfactory as it should be. On the whole I think the appeal should be allowed but do not dissent as the two intermediate courts of appeal have come, on this question of fact, to a contrary conclusion in which my learned brothers concur.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated in the court below. DAVIES J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be -dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The deceased, Farlinger, having received the letter of the 4th July, 1906, telling him he could \"forward the next and future assessments\" to the financier of Longueuil Lodge, and, in the same letter, a certificate of his transfer to said lodge which could only issue on the faith of all pending and past assessments having been paid, must be taken to have made such payments and to have relied thenceforward upon that and the direction as to the next assessments, unless it is established all this was clearly erroneous. The dates of his later payments are in accord therewith.\nIf we are to assume these dates are respectively applicable to prior months, then his insurance, at least twice if not three times, had so elapsed that he could have been reported as in default, yet that does not seem to have been done till the 9th of November, 1906.\nAnd, curiously enough, on the 20th of November, 1906, a postal card was addressed to him by the financier notwithstanding this reported default, reminding him his assessment No. 11, i.e., for 1st November, would be due on the 28th, and requesting him to pay \"before that date, in order to avoid suspension,\" when in fact, if report well founded, he was already under a suspension from which he could only be relieved by being able to satisfy onerous specified conditions.\nThe man died on the 19th of November. There is nothing in all this late report and the sequel thereto directly in law affecting the issues raised.\nBut, when we are asked to reject the strong case made by the facts above stated and upon which the courts below, other than the Superior Court, have rested judgment, we must ask ourselves if we can because, and simply because, the numbers of the assessments for which the same financier, making his grotesque mistakes just referred to, gave credits, can be held to overbear the case made. I think not. I may suspect that there being so many irregularities the affiliation of deceased with Longueuil Lodge was also founded on an irregularity. In fact, that is what is now in effect, though not admittedly so, claimed to have taken place.\nWe are asked to hear the evidence of the Grand Recorder to shew that a payment made in June was in respect of what was due for May, and thus leave a pending assessment, on the 1st of June, unpaid and outstanding at the time he was admitted to the Longueuil Lodge, notwithstanding the express prohibition apparent on the face of his clearance card against such a thing being done.\nIn answer to the motion to admit here and now such evidence, I do not think, even if we have the power to do so (relative to which I say nothing), it would be in accordance with the due administration of justice to exercise such a power.\nAnd, on the case as it stands, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014At the trial it was assumed, and on that basis argument before this court proceeded, that the Longueuil Lodge, in its reception of the deceased, John Augustus Farlinger, as a member, was governed by the provisions of article 188 of the constitution of the society. By the provisions of that article he could not become a member without first paying all the \"dues and assessments\" for, inter alfa, the month in which his application was made. It was admitted at the trial that his application was made on the 2nd of June; and, the fact of his election is, therefore, prima facie evidence that the June payments were made on that date at the latest. So far (as against the society) the presumption of regularity in their proceedings will carry us.\nThis prima facie case has not been met; and, as four subsequent payments were made, it follows that the last of them must be attributed to the month of October, and, consequently, that Farlinger was in good standing at the date of his death.\nANGLIN J.-At the opening of this appeal the appellants applied, under section 98 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" to be allowed to supplement the evidence in the record by a further examination of one Patterson, Grand Recorder of the Grand Lodge, A.O.U.W. of Quebec, who had given evidence at the trial. Assuming that section 98 confers power on this court, in a proper case, to entertain such an application \u2014 having regard to its history, its collocation and the cases in which it has been considered, I think it does not \u2014 in the exercise of a sound discretion the present motion should be refused.\nThe purposes of the proposed re-examination of the witness would be to establish that, when he was received into Longueuil Lodge on the 2nd or 4th of June, 1906, the deceased, Farlinger, still owed the assessment which fell due on the 1st of June. The materiality of this question was made apparent in the plaintiff's factum prepared for the Court of Review. The basis of the judgment of that court was its holding that Farlinger had paid this assessment before his admission into Longueuil Lodge. Again in the Court of King's Bench, the principal contest was about this point and the opinion of the judges of that court, confirming the judgment of the Superior Court in Review, proceed on the specific finding that Far-linger had paid the June assessment before his election to Longueuil Lodge. Either in Review or in the Court of King's Bench the appellants might have asked to be permitted to supplement their proof as they now -desire. Certainly in Review, and, I think, also in the\" Court of King's Bench, their application, if made, could have been entertained, and given effect to. Articles 1208 and 1248, C.P.Q. No such application was made. In these circumstances, if this court had the discretionary power which the appellants invoke, their application would be entirely too late. Moreover, the evidence which it is now sought to introduce might have been given at the trial. No sufficient excuse is made for the failure to adduce it then. Its materiality and importance upon the distinct issue raised by the fifth paragraph of the plaintiff's declaration \u2022 should have been apparent. For these reasons, if clothed with such a discretionary power as the appellant invokes, the court should refuse to exercise it on this appeal.\nThe ground on which the appellant resists the payment of the plaintiff's claim is that, at the time of his death, on the 19th November, 1906, Farlinger was properly under suspension for non-payment of the October assessment. He paid assessments to Longueuil Lodge on the 3rd July, the 2nd August, the 31st August, or the 6th September (it is not quite clear on which date this payment was actually made), and the 5th of October. If he had paid his June assessment before admission to the lodge his payment on the 3rd of July was of the assessment for the month of July ; and, in that case, his payment of the 5th of October was of the October assessment, and .he was not in default and was not legally suspended.\nAt bar, this case was treated as within article 188 of the Constitution of- the Grand Lodge of Quebec. I shall presently deal with the matter on the assumption that this article applies.\nFarliinger had been a member of Valleyfield Lodge, which had been dissolved. His transfer was effected not upon a card issued from this defunct lodge, but upon a clearance card issued by the Grand Recorder under article 213 which expressly provides for such a case. A perusal of articles 185-189 spews that article 188 is not in terms applicable. It deals only with the case of. a clearance card issued by the local lodge of which the applicant for election had been a member. It requires that before electing as a member a person so transferred the lodge to which he -has applied for admission shall ascertain by inquiry from the local lodge which granted his clearance card that\nall lodge dues and assessments have been paid by the brother holding the card up to and including the month in which the application is made.\nThe constitution contains no corresponding provision governing the case of the transfer of a member .of a defunct lodge under clearance card issued by the Grand Recorder. The card issued by that officer to Farlinger contained these clauses: That he must pay all assessments for which he is liable, to the Grand Recorder of the Grand Lodge of Quebec, A.O.U.\\AT., until he is elected a member of some subordinate lodge of the order.\nThat no lodge has any right to accept this card after it has expired, nor to elect the member holding this card until officially notified by the Grand Recorder, signing this card, that all pending and past assessments have been paid.\nThis latter provision is, I think, at least open to the construction that, before electing Farlinger as a member, Longueuil Lodge should have obtained from the Grand Recorder an official notice that he had paid all past .assessments and the assessment which was then, i.e., at the time of his election, \"pending.\" If so, the very fact of his 'election on the 2nd or 4th of June, which is conceded, raises a strong presumption \u2014conclusive in the absence of ,proof to the contrary\u2014that the June assessment had been duly paid before he was admitted to Longueuil Lodge.\nBut, assuming that, in the absence of any other corresponding provision in tile constitution governing Farlinger's case, article 188 applies and. that Longueuil Lodge, before electing him, was only required to satisfy itself that he had paid the assessment for the month \"in which his application \u2022was made\" and all prior assessments, upon the evidence in the record the result must be the same.\nThe Superior Court in Review and the Court of King's Bench have both found that Farlinger made application for admission to Longueuil Lodge on the 2nd of June. The evidence supports this conclusion. It includes the following letter:\nMONTREAL, June 4th, 1906.\nJ. A. Farlinger, Esq.,\nMorrisburg, Ont.\nDear Sir and Bro.:\nIn accordance with your letter of 2nd inst. I have arranged for your transfer to Longueuil Lodge, No. 21. The Financier of that Lodge is A. P. Pigeon, No. 1595 Ontario St., Montreal, to whom you can forward next and future assessments, also lodge dues of 40c. per month, which includes your capita tax.\nI enclose your receipt, also certificate indorsed as being transferred to Longueuil Lodge.\nYours fraternally,\nA. T. PATTERSON,\nGrand Recorder.\nOn examination, Mr. Patterson said:\nQ. Then the statement in paragraph number five of the plaintiff's declaration to the effect that on the 2nd of June, 1906, the said Farlinger requested that he be transferred to and made a member of the. Longueuil Lodge, Number 21, which said request was granted, and said transfer duly and properly made, is correct? A. Yes, as far as I know.\nThere is no other evidence in the record bearing upon the date of Farlinger's application for admission to Longueuil Lodge.\nFor the appellant it is contended that the provisions of the constitution cannot have been complied with if Farlinger was admitted on tile 2nd or 4th of June on an application made on the 2nd of June. They, therefore, maintain that it must be assumed that this application was in fact made in the month of May. No doubt, in the ordinary course of events, some days would elapse between the receipt by a lodge of an application for transfer and the election of the applicant. But, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Archambault, there .is nothing in the requirements of the constitution which would prevent an-election within a few hours of the receipt of the application, where the Grand Recorder's certificate that all assessments due, including that of the current month, have been paid by the applicant, is immediately available. In the present instance, Farlinger appears to have made his application through the Grand Recorder himself, who happened to be also a member of Longueuil Lodge. This would, no doubt, facilitate the taking of the requisite steps preliminary to a regular and valid election. We have no evidence of the actual procedure followed by Longueuil Lodge. The appellant had that evidence in its own hands and should have furnished it if it would have shewn an application by Farlinger earlier than in June. Since it is quite possible that making application on the 2nd of June Farlinger could have been duly elected on that day or on the 3rd or 4th of June without violation or disregard of any provision of the constitution, there is no ground for the conclusion, urged by the appellant, that his application must have been made in the month of May, notwithstanding the indication of Mr. Patter-son's letter and his oral testimony above quoted that it was made in June.\nNot only is it impossible on the evidence before us to say that the Superior Court in Review and the Court of King's Bench were clearly wrong in holding that the application of Farlinger was made on the 2nd of June\u2014as we must be prepared to do if we would reverse them: Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co.[1] ; on the contrary, from that evidence, in my opinion, no other conclusion can legitimately be drawn.\nIf article 188 of the constitution was applicable either by analogy, or by reason of some practice of the order, under the maxim omnia proesumuntur rite esse acta, it must be assumed that before electing Farlinger Longueuil Lodge ascertained that all dues and assessments had been paid by him up to and including the month in which his application was made. In the absence of convincing proof to the contrary (the record contains none at all) this suffices to establish that Farlinger had paid his June assessment before he became a member of Longueuil Lodge. If that be the case, his subsequent payments were applicable to the months in which they were respectively made\u2014treating that of the 31st August or the 6th of September as having been made in September. It follows that he duly paid his October assessment and that, at the time of his death, he was not in default and not under suspension, but was a member of the order in good standing.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T. P. Butler. Solicitors for the respondent: Cook & Magee.\n[1] 27 Can. S.C.R. 537.\n"}

He pleaded want of consideration and non-receipt of the stock. On the trial evidence was given of a resolution by the bank directors authorizing the allotment of the new issue to the then shareholders of whom M. was not one, and counsel for the bank admitted that there was no resolution alloting it to anybody else.

Claude Macdonell K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.M. McEvoy K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. agreed in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought upon a promissory note given by the defendant to the bank for $1,380 payable on demand.\nThe defendant pleaded amongst other defences want of consideration and that if any such note was given by him\nit was given conditionally for stock in the bank which he had never received, and that he was not to pay the said note.\nThe defence that he was not to pay the note arose out of a conversation, at the time of the giving of the note, between defendant and one Karn, a local manager of the bank, who had induced defendant to purchase the stock for which the note was given. Some general statements were made by Karn to Mclntyre at the time he signed the note to the effect that he never would be called upon to pay it, but the bank was no party to any such promise directly or indirectly, and knew nothing of it.\nAs a matter of fact, it appears that Karn and Mclntyre agreed to go into the purchase of this stock as a speculation, and Karn, who was urging Mclntyre to go into it, gave the assurance, which is not unusual in such cases, that if he gave the note he would never be called upon to pay. Both parties expected the stock to rise in price, in which case they intended to sell and take the profits. I only mention this defence and these facts because the impression made upon my mind from the reading of the evidence was that they constituted in Mclntyre\u2019s mind the real and only defence he had.\nThe defence relied upon in this appeal was that the necessary evidence to shew a right in the bank to sell these shares was wanting, and that under the circumstances the onus of such proof lay upon the bank.\nI am of the opinion, concurring with the trial judge, the Divisional Court and Mr. Justice Meredith of the Court of Appeal, that the onus of such proof lay entirely upon McIntyre and that nothing transpired to change that onus.\nIt seems clear to me that these shares sold to Mclntyre formed part of certain shares which had been allotted by the bank to its shareholders and not taken up by them. They were then held by the bank and might be at any time\noffered for subscription to the public in such manner and on such terms as the directors prescribed.\nSub-sec. 2 of sec. 34 of \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nI think it a fair inference from the correspondence and documents put in evidence that Karn had, acting on behalf of certain applicants in London for such shares, amongst them the defendant for ten shares, applied to the bank for them. The application itself is not forthcoming, but on the 19th April, 1906, Mr. Snyder, the inspector of the bank, wrote to Karn, the local manager at London, saying:\nWe are in receipt of yours of the 13th and have drawn on you to-day for $9,300 in payment of 67 shares at $140, distributed as follows.\nThen follow nine names with the number of shares stated for each name, amongst them D. McIntyre, defendant, ten shares.\nThe evidence leaves no doubt upon my mind whatever that McIntyre had agreed with Karn to pur- chase these ten shares; that Karn had, acting as his agent, applied to the bank for them at the rate of $140; that the application had been granted, the certificates for the shares forwarded, and that McIntyre had, after such certificate had been received, signed a note of hand for the amount of the purchase price of the stock which was afterwards renewed by the demand note for $1,380 sued on. A statement of McIntyre\u2019s current account with the bank from May, 1906, to September, 1908, was put in evidence by McIntyre and made part of his case. It shewed amongst other things that on 1st June, 1906, McIntyre was charged with $1,400 presumably, from his admission that he had no other dealings with the bank to which this debit could be attributed, the price of this stock, ten shares at $140, and that on July 14th, he was credited with $1,365.30 under the head of discount which it was shewn was the discount of the $1,380 note sued on. McIntyre had, on June 30th, $1,365.30 standing to his debit, he having been previously charged with the $1,400, and this discount exactly squared the account to that date.\nI mention these details and use the word \u201cpresumably\u201d because it was impossible to get any clear definite answer to any material question from Karn adverse to McIntyre\u2019s interest. In almost every case where he was asked questions as to facts which it seemed he should, as former local manager, have remembered, he fell back upon the time-honoured answer, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d It is needless to say that he has long since ceased to be an official of the bank and that he admitted being a friend of McIntyre\u2019s.\nNotwithstanding the sad loss of memory alike by Karn as by McIntyre, there is sufficient evidence of record in the books and correspondence to prove the material facts relating to the actual purchase of these shares.\nSubsequently to giving his note for the shares, the bank from time to time forwarded to the London agency cheques for the quarterly dividends declared on its stock. McIntyre received his dividend cheques, payable to his order, indorsed them, paid some into the agency of the bank in London where they were placed to his credit, and cashed others elsewhere, using the moneys for his own purposes. No less than five of these quarterly dividends were so received and disposed of by McIntyre. In the end, closing up this bank account of his which he himself put in evidence, he on September 28th, 1908, withdrew by cheque the small balance of $20.30 then standing to his credit.\nHis own evidence and admissions, coupled with the evidence reluctantly given by Karn, together with the bank books, convince me beyond any doubt that McIntyre did agree to purchase these ten shares for 140; that Karn as his agent applied to the head office of the bank to purchase them; that McIntyre knew of the receipt at the London agency of his scrip or certificate for such shares, that he gave his note in payment of the cost of the shares and for five successive quarters subsequently received his dividend cheques for the dividends payable in respect of the shares.\nI think the facts as proved and admitted on all these points quite inconsistent with the assumed ignorance of McIntyre respecting them, and that the real facts are that he bought the shares with full knowledge, hoping for a rise in their price and depending upon his friend Karn\u2019s assurance that he never would be called upon to pay his note.\nThere remains only the legal question as to which party the onus rested upon of proving that the bank did not hold any stock available for sale to McIntyre.\nOn this question I think the onus rested upon the defendant as the maker of the promissory note sued on given for the stock, and that he has not discharged it. He has not called any of the bank directors or given any evidence to shew that the shares purchased by him were not shares which were available for subscription by the public. The onus lay upon him of shewing that there were no such shares and that the directors had not prescribed the manner and terms on which they should be offered to the public. The certificate of the issue of the stock to the plaintiff, the evidence of Snyder, the inspector, the correspondence between the head office and the branch at London, all combine to shew that there was such available stock. If he wished to rely upon the absence of authority on the part of the directors for its sale to the public, surely the duty lay upon him of giving some evidence on the point.\nThen it is contended that the admission of the counsel for the bank at the trial that there was no resolution in the books specifically allotting these ten shares to McIntyre and that the allotment resolution was confined to shareholders, changed the onus of proof to the shoulders of the bank.\nI do not agree to any such proposition. Sub-section 2 of section 34 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d provides that\nany of such allotted stock not taken up by the shareholders to whom the allotment has been made within six months from time when notice of allotment was mailed to his address or which he declines to accept, may be offered for subscription to the public in such manner and on such terms as the directors prescribe.\nIt was not necessary under this section, in offering stock to the public, to go through the formal methods provided for in the Act for allotting new stock which the bank may issue pro rat\u00e2 amongst the shareholders. It was only necessary that the directors should prescribe generally the \u201cmanner and terms\u201d on which the stock not taken up by shareholders might be sold to the public. Once that was done and communicated to the proper officer of the bank a legal sale could be made.\nNo \u201callotment,\u201d in the sense in which the Act uses the term, was necessary to be made to the public purchasers of such stock and when the counsel used the language he did admitting there was no resolution allotting the ten shares to McIntyre, he did not admit that there had not been a bon\u00e2 fide sale of such shares made by the bank on the terms prescribed by the directors, and was evidently not so understood by the trial judge.\nEverything was done by the bank in its books, its stock ledger, its certificate of the issue of the stock, its enclosure of the same to the purchaser, its continuous payment of dividends to the purchasers, to shew that there had been a bon\u00e2 fide sale of ten shares of stock to him.\nIf McIntyre wished to shew that the directors had not given the necessary authority for such sale, the onus lay upon him of shewing it, and in my opinion that onus he has not discharged.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The only consideration pretended to have been given for the note sued on was the sale of ten shares of stock in the appellant bank.\nThere had been a written application made by respondent for that number of shares on terms rejected by appellant and thereby everything relative to that proposal is, so far as the present issue is concerned, eliminated.\nWhen we find that application had been so altered in the bank as to substitute in pencil the price now claimed for that entered originally and other evident irregularities existing relative to the dealings now in question we may suspect much as to the conduct and purposes of all concerned therein, but in the view I take all that may be put aside.\nIt is admitted that all the stock the appellant had to dispose of was, at a meeting of the directors on the 31st March, 1906, allotted to the shareholders of record on the books of the bank and to others in such a way that we have to consider all the provisions of section 34, but especially here sub-section 2 of section 34 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d to see how a sale of stock could become effectual to respondent who was not a shareholder. That sub-section is as follows:\n2. Any of such allotted stock which is not taken up by the shareholder to whom the allotment has been made, within six months from the time when notice of the allotment was mailed to his address, or which he declines to accept, may be offered for subscription to the public, in such manner and on such terms as the directors prescribe.\nIn the minutes of the directors\u2019 meetings we have a number of resolutions passed on the said date. But we have nothing passed by the directors then or at any time dealing with the question of stock not taken up by the shareholders to whom allotted, unless in what I will hereafter refer to.\nWe are told, and it is not contradicted, that the minute book was in court at the trial and resolutions extracted therefrom which I will hereafter refer to.\nDuring respondent\u2019s examination as a witness the following admission was made:\nQ. Did you ever get any notice that there was any stock allotted to you? A. No. Mr. McEvoy:\u2014I ask you now, Mr. McKillop, under the notice to produce, to let me have the resolution of the directors allotting this stock to Mr. McIntyre, if you have it; I asked you to produce it on the examination for discovery?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014There is a general resolution allotting it to the shareholders in proportion.\nHis Lordship:\u2014That you produce?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014Yes, my Lord.\nHis Lordship:\u2014It is admitted that there is no resolution allotting it to McIntyre?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014Yes, my Lord.\nMr. McEvoy:\u2014It is admitted there was no resolution allotting it to anybody but shareholders; that is the admission, Mr. McKillop?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014Yes.\nTo Mr. McEvoy:\u2014Q. You had nothing to do with that Sovereign Bank stock before this? A. No, I had not.\nMr. McEvoy:\u2014I ask you now to produce, under the notice to produce served, the acceptance book, shewing where Mr. McIntyre signed to accept those ten shares of Sovereign Bank stock; let me see the book, please, in which he signed?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014We cannot find either the power of attorney to accept, or the book.\nCounsel for appellant must be taken to have been as usual quite candid with the court. I at least am quite sure he was. His statements imply not only that there was no record of any allotment of stocks to respondent, either in the narrowest sense or in the wide sense in which the learned trial judge, the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal each refer to the possible transaction upon which to found the alleged consideration for the note in question.\nIt seems to me, therefore, quite clear that there never was anything done by the directors that would or could have supported a binding sale of the stock in question to the respondent.\nIt is as plainly enacted as words can make it, in the sub-section quoted, that any such sales as could have taken place of shares failing to be taken up by any of those to whom allotted could only have been made\nin such manner and on such terms as the directors prescribe. Not only is there the admission of counsel for appellants as to the non-existence of any such record of allotment, in the sense used by all concerned, but there appears on the stock register produced this entry of particulars relative to this very stock: \u201cNew stock allotted March 31, 1906.\u201d\nRespondent\u2019s title was thus made to appear on the stock register as that of an allotment on that date. This is not merely descriptive, for it is as it were the root of his title.\nBut besides this we have the allotment made by a resolution that fixed the prices to be paid at $130 for each share and the time given to pay the premium of thirty per cent. up to the tenth of April.\nAnd the letter of the 19th of April purporting to enclose certificates of stock of that date (of which that said to cover respondent\u2019s ten shares was one) refers to one of the 13th of April, as what is being answered.\nThe directors must, on the hypothesis of a valid foundation for this stock certificate, have prescribed sometime between the 31st of March and the date of the certificate \u201cthe manner and terms\u201d upon which it was to issue.\nAnd we are asked to presume not only that it was so done, but the improbable thing that it was done (if it could legally so be done, which I much doubt) before the tenth of April when the option to others had expired.\nAnd we are asked further to presume either that the bank directors transacted such important business without putting it in the minute book, or that such a record which must have been on the minute book (close after that extracted and put in this case) escaped the attention of all those engaged in the trial of this case. In other words, we are asked to presume that the very thing needed in law to maintain a contention, struggled for in many curious ways by appellants\u2019 counsel, was not resorted to though there at his hand.\nFor it is to be observed respondent\u2019s case was not left severely alone at the close thereof, when in its weakest state, as it might well have been, but appellants strove to shew its officers had done everything needed in law.\nNor does the story end here. The resolutions of the 31st March recite that the capital stock of two million dollars had been increased to four million dollars, that 16,250 shares had been issued and allotted, leaving 23,750 shares for allotment, of which 8,125 shares were then allotted to shareholders.\nAnd that business having been, in order to comply with the law, disposed of, it was resolved that the remaining 15,625 shares of the unissued shares should be allotted to the shareholders\nat the rate of one hundred and thirty ($130) per share, and further that any of said shares so allotted, which have been or shall hereafter be relinquished or refused by the shareholders entitled thereto, shall be issued and allotted to the Dresden Bank of Berlin, Germany, or its nominees, at the said price of one hundred and thirty ($130) dollars per share\npayable as specified.\nWhat does all this mean? This last clause seems to be a specific dealing with the shares relinquished and may be taken as an express prescribing within sub-section 2 above quoted.\nI am not concerned with the regularity or legality of the mode adopted for disposing of the business, or conclusively holding that the relinquished shares lastly dealt with related to all the allotments of that date.\nI am merely concerned with the creation thereby of a state of facts that rendered it unnecessary for respondent or his counsel to look further for evidence shifting the onus resting on his client.\nIt seems to me in the highest degree improbable in face of such a course of conduct and policy of the directors in relation to the business in hand, that it could all be reversed and another course of conduct and policy in accordance with the statute, have been so taken as to render the issue of share certificates on the 19th of April, to any but shareholders, legal.\nThe presumed celerity of action and reaction involved therein is too great even for stock gamblers, much less staid bank directors, as these must be presumed in absence of evidence to the contrary to have been.\nIt is, in face of this, rather absurd to rely on a bit of evidence given by the inspector of appellants as to shares having been relinquished at some time not specified, but possibly and probably months or so later than the 19th of April. It is absolutely inconceivable (if the statement was intended to refer to a date anterior to the 19th of April) that it was not so put and demonstrated. It is idle to say the demonstration did not rest on him, for it was what he was in fact attempting to do.\nThe conclusion I reach is not only that there is left no ground for such presumption as the learned trial judge proceeded upon, but that in fact no such foundation as the law requires ever existed for transferring to respondent any title to the shares alleged. to have been sold, and hence the whole ground for the alleged consideration for the note in question fails.\nOne cannot have much sympathy with the respondent, but it is of the highest importance that bank directors should discharge their duty according to law and in a satisfactory manner.\nSo far as I can see there never was legal foundation for the certificate issued in respondent\u2019s name, and there was an issuing of certificates of stock at one hundred and forty dollars ($140), concurrently with a pending proposition to another party to take all such at one hundred and thirty ($130).\nOf course this concurrent disparity or inequality did not necessarily exist if we assume everything in the business involved was all despatched within three days, i.e., between the 10th and the 13th of April. We must proceed upon the ordinary and not the miraculous when driven to draw inferences or rely on presumptions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. The onus is of course upon the respondent to establish the defence of want or failure of consideration. On this the controversy at once narrows itself to the point whether the professed allotment of shares evidenced by the entries of the 19th April in the stock register and the certificate of the same date was the act of the bank or merely that of some person acting without authority.\nTo summarize briefly in chronological order the admitted facts. There was an application by McIntyre for shares at $130 in January. In March the capital stock of the bank was increased to $4,000,000. On the 31st of that month there was an allotment to the shareholders of the whole of the unissued shares under section 34 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d On the 19th of April McIntyre\u2019s name was entered on the share register as the holder of ten shares; and a certificate was issued of the same date declaring him to be the holder of that number of fully paid-up shares, which, with others, was forwarded to Karn, the bank\u2019s agent at London, on the same day. Karn then debited the London branch in account with the head office with $1,400 as the price of these shares at $140 a share, and on the 1st of June this sum was charged against McIntyre in the books of the bank. On the 14th of July or thereabouts McIntyre gave his note for $1,400; and, as I think the evidence sufficiently shews, he both understood and intended it to be for the price of these shares.\nThe application of January was admittedly not acted on. The view of the facts put forward by the bank is that the letter of the 19th of April forwarding the share certificate to London was in response to an application made by Karn on behalf and with the authority of McIntyre for ten shares at $140; that this application was accepted and that McIntyre had notice of the acceptance and of the entry and certificate in his favour at the time he gave his note on the 14th of July. That, as I understand, was the case primarily made by Mr. Macdonell, with, however, the alternative, that in any event McIntyre had notice at the time of giving his note that these shares had been allotted to him and stood in his name and that the note was given for the purchase price of them. In either view if the officers of the bank acted without authority in accepting Mc- Intyre\u2019s offer on the one hand, or in appropriating shares to him by entry in the share ledger and by issue of the certificate, McIntyre\u2019s note was given without consideration and the appeal must fail. Upon this issue of authority or want of authority I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal in thinking that, though the onus was originally on McIntyre the evidence and the facts admitted at the trial was sufficient to shift the burden of evidence to the shoulders of the bank and that burden has not been sustained.\nThe nominal capital of the bank was originally $2,000,000 divided into shares of $100. Before the 31st of March, 1906, 16,250 of these shares had been allotted to shareholders and on that day resolutions were passed by the directors under the authority of section 34 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d allotting the residue (23,750 shares) of the bank\u2019s capital to the existing shareholders at $130 per share. McIntyre was not a shareholder and consequently could not participate in the benefit of this general allotment. Section 34, however, sub-section 2, contains a provision authorizing the directors to offer for public subscription any shares offered to shareholders under the authority of the section which may be refused or not accepted; and it is under the authority of this provision that the sale to McIntyre is said to have taken place.\nIt is said, and it may be conceded, that on the 19th of April, when McIntyre\u2019s name was entered in the share register as a holder of shares, there were some shares available for disposal under this provision. The directors, and the directors alone, however, had authority to offer these shares to the public. They and they alone had authority to fix the \u201cterms\u201d and the \u201cmanner\u201d of subscription. In the absence of measures taken by them prescribing the manner and terms of such disposal any attempt to sell them must be a mere nullity\u2014however regular in form and though evidenced by never so many certificates and entries in the stock registrar and payments of dividends; for the authority conferred upon the directors by section 34, sub-section 2, is one of that class of powers the exercise of which cannot be delegated. Howard\u2019s Case[1]; Cartmell\u2019s Case[2]; Re Pakenham Pork Packing Co.[3] The evidence bearing upon the point was, of course, entirely in the hands of the bank; and in view of the following passage extracted from the record I do not think it is open to the bank to contend that the authority of the directors had ever been given:\nMr. McEvoy:\u2014I ask you now, Mr. McKillop, under the notice to produce, to let me have the resolution of the directors allotting this stock to Mr. McIntyre, if you have it; I asked you to produce it on the examination for discovery?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014There is a general resolution allotting it to the shareholders in proportion.\nHis Lordship:\u2014That you produce?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014Yes, my Lord.\nHis Lordship:\u2014It is admitted that there is no resolution allotting it to McIntyre?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014Yes, my Lord.\nMr. McEvoy:\u2014It is admitted there was no resolution allotting it to anybody but shareholders; that is the admission, Mr. McKillop?\nMr. McKillop:\u2014Yes.\nTo Mr. McEvoy:\u2014Q. You had nothing to do with that Sovereign Bank stock before this? A. No, I had not.\nMr. Macdonell in his ingenious argument found it necessary to minimize the effect of this conversation, and his suggestion was that the whole sense of the passage is limited to this\u2014that the shares received by McIntyre were part of the totality of shares allotted to the shareholders by the resolutions of the 31st of March. In support of this view he mainly relies upon the suggestion that the words \u201callot\u201d and \u201callotment\u201d when applied to the disposal of its share capital by a bank subject to the \u201cBank Act\u201d are words of technical import which signify the operation of appropriating or offering shares to shareholders under the first part of section 34. These terms, it is argued, are meaningless as applied to the disposal of shares refused or not accepted by existing shareholders after such an appropriation or offer to them under section 34, and consequently could have no application to a transaction between the bank and McIntyre touching the acquisition by him of any shares returned or not accepted by shareholders to whom they had been allotted by the resolutions of the 31st of March.\nThere is here, I think, some error as to the common meaning of the terms in question as well as the sense in which they are employed in the \u201cBank Act.\u201d The terms \u201callot\u201d and \u201callotment\u201d are not technical terms. \u201cAn allotment of shares,\u201d says Stirling L.J. (then Stirling J.) in Spitzel v. The Chinese Corporation [4],\nBroadly speaking, is an appropriation by the directors or the managing body of the company of shares to a particular person. The legal effect of the appropriation depends on circumstances. Thus it may be an offer of shares to the allottee, or it may be an acceptance of an application for shares by the allottee; but of itself an allotment does not necessarily create the status of membership. The allotment may be, and probably generally is, such as to give a title to the shares the moment the allottee communicates his acceptance of it to the company whose directors make the allotment, but it seems to me that the allotment may be subject to a condition\u2014as, for example, that the allottee should not only indicate acceptance, but perform some other act, such as payment of a sum of money. In other words, I think that a company may offer specified shares to A.B. on the terms that the title of A.B. should not arise until he had paid a sum of money to the company, and, this being so, a contract may provide, as I think, that the allotment shall be subject to conditions.\nIt is in the sense indicated by the first sentence of this passage that the term \u201callot\u201d is used in the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d R.S.C. (1906) ch. 79, sec. 46, in articles 5974, sub-sec. 1, and 5976, R.S.Q.[5], and in the same sense it was used in section 26 of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d p. 10, R.S.O., 1897, ch. 191 (since repealed); that is also the meaning attached to the term when used in reference to the disposal of the shares of provincial companies governed by statutes modelled upon the English \u201cCompanies Act, 1862.\u201d\nIt does not appear to be open to doubt that this is the signification of the term in section 34 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d That section directs that when it is proposed to dispose of any of the\noriginal unsubscribed capital stock or of the increased stock of the bank\nthe shares shall first be offered to the shareholders. The existing shareholders are to have a pre-emption; the first step in the operation is to \u201callot\u201d or appropriate the shares to the shareholders, but it is plain that this is only a conditional appropriation and that no title passes until the offer has been accepted. The operation in other words is precisely the second of the two kinds to which Stirling L.J. refers. It does not, of course, follow that the term \u201callot\u201d is not equally to be applied to the act of the proper authority in accepting an application or in appropriating shares in response to a subscription. Parliament has applied the word to a transaction to which according to well understood usage among those conversant with the management of incorporated companies, it is properly applicable; but I should think it very far\u2011fetched to infer from the language of this section that there is anything unusual in employing the term\u2014in speaking of bank shares\u2014according to the whole of its commonly understood purport.\nIndeed, the record in this action affords us conclusive evidence that those responsible for the management of the bank in question understood the term to be applicable to the appropriation of shares to a purchaser or subscriber under the second sub-section. The second of the resolutions of the 31st of March expressly authorizes the disposition of shares under the second sub-section\u2014shares that is to say which should be \u201crefused\u201d or \u201cnot accepted\u201d by shareholders to whom they were allotted by that resolution\u2014in this phraseology:\nand further that any of said shares so allotted which have been or shall hereafter be relinquished or refused by the shareholders entitled thereto, shall be issued and allotted to the Dresden Bank of Berlin, Germany, or its nominees, at the said price of one hundred and thirty ($130) dollars per share, payable as follows.\nThere can be no question in face of this resolution that the advisers of this bank did not use the word \u201callot\u201d in the restricted sense it is now proposed to place upon it. Indeed, it is obvious from this document that in their view the apt word for describing the operation of appropriating surrendered shares under that sub-section was that very word.\nSuch then being the sense of this term in its ordinary signification and according to the usage of this bank what meaning is to be attributed in the passage from the record quoted above? In what sense was it used by counsel for McIntyre? In what sense was it understood by counsel for the bank? There can, of course, be no question that when counsel asked for the resolution allotting shares to McIntyre he had not in mind the resolution of the 31st of March which affected only existing shareholders of whom McIntyre to everybody\u2019s knowledge was not one; there can be as little doubt that counsel for the bank could not have so understood him; but the point is put beyond question by the last question and answer in which it is agreed that there is no resolution allotting shares to anybody but shareholders. We may put aside as pure subtlety the distinction between an allotment specifically made by the directors and one made under the authority of a general resolution passed by the Board; no such distinction was in anybody\u2019s mind. There was then no resolution giving authority for the entry of McIntyre\u2019s name in the register or the issue of the certificate of shares; none authorizing the acceptance of Karn\u2019s application on behalf of McIntyre if we proceed on the assumption that there was such an application. Mr. Justice Maclaren says, and with him the Chief Justice of Ontario agreed, that\nit was admitted at the trial that the only resolutions of the directors regarding the stock now in question were the two resolutions of the 31st March.\nThis, I think, is palpably involved unless we are to reduce the whole of this episode to mere fatuous trifling.\nThe bank\u2019s case appears also to have been put upon the ground that having accepted dividends McIntyre is estopped from disputing his status as a shareholder.\nEstoppel, where there is no record and no deed, which is the case here, is a rule of evidence by which a person whose words or conduct have misled another into acting to his prejudice upon the assumption of the existence of a non-existing state of facts is prevented in a court of justice from disputing the actuality of that state of facts. What conduct of McIntyre misled the bank? The bank knew the facts. McIntyre did not know them. McIntyre acted upon the representation that he was a shareholder and on that basis of fact accepted the dividends. I can only say that the contention is one which I do not understand.\nThen it is said that the bank could not dispute the status of McIntyre as a shareholder and consequently McIntyre must also be bound. I am not satisfied in view of section 34 that the bank could not set up the absence of authority from the directors. But conceding it could not, that could only be upon the ground that the bank had estopped itself from denying authority in fact. As the discretion of the directors under section 34(2) could not be delegated, the act of any officer assuming to perform the function of the directors would be incapable of ratification; Gibson v. Barton[6]; and there is indeed no suggestion of ratification in fact by any proved act of the board. Since estoppel is the only ground upon which the bank could be held notwithstanding want of authority in fact, one does not see how that can help the bank against McIntyre. The effect of the estoppel is simply to preclude the bank from proving the facts. That cannot prevent McIntyre from proving the facts. There is, of course, the widest possible distinction between a void contract or a nominal contract which for want of assent on one side is no contract, but the validity of which one of the parties is estopped from disputing and a contract which is voidable in the sense of being rescindable but valid until rescinded. Such transactions as those last mentioned may cease to be impeachable by a change of circumstances alone. Change of circumstances alone not involving a true consent could not produce a contract out of that which never was a contract because of want of consent by one of the nominal parties.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McKillop & Murphy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.M.

Rep. 70), Idington J. dissenting, that an award by arbitrators had not been made a condition precedent to recovery for the amount of any deficiency in the quantity of timber guaranteed to be upon the limits.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the decision of Mr. Justice Morrison, at the trial, and directing a new trial to be had between the parties.\nThe action was to recover $250,000 for deficiency in the amount of timber on certain lands under a guarantee contained in a written agreement between the parties for the sale by the defendant (appellant) to the plaintiffs (respondents), of timber limits, in British Columbia, wherein the defendant guaranteed that the quantity of timber thereon, as shewn by a statement annexed to the agreement, was true and accurate, it being made a condition of the contract that the timber should \"at least run in quantity to the number of feet shewn in the attached statement.\" In the clause of the contract, which immediately followed the clause containing the guarantee, it was provided:\u2014\n\"Fourth. Second parties (plaintiffs) are to have until September 1st, 1907, to cruise and verify the figures on the attached statement of April 30th, 1907, regarding the quantity of timber on said various tracts, and in event of all of the tracts, from a cruising or other verification, failing to reach the quantity represented in the attached statement, first party (defendant) is to repay second party in just proportion that the amount of shortage bears to the value of the total number of feet of timber estimated to be on said tracts as appears in said attached statement bearing date of April 30th, 1907.\n\"It is further agreed that in event second party fail to find the quantity of timber on said tracts represented by the statement of April 30th, 1907, attached hereto, and said first party fails to agree on a basis of settlement concerning such shortage, then and in that event an arbitration committee composed of three men, one named by each of the respective parties hereto, and the two thus named agreeing on and naming a third, which arbitration committee will and shall have full power to settle the matter regarding shortage, and whose action and decision in the matter shall be final.\n\"In event the two parties so named as the arbitration members fail for any reason to agree on or name a third party within thirty days after their appointment on the committee, then and in that event the judge of the District Court of New Westminster, District of British Columbia, shall name the third party, and decision by any two of said committee above referred to shall be considered and treated as the decision of the whole and accepted as final.\"\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the timber set out in the schedule to the agreement did not reach the quantity represented therein and claimed a refund in respect thereof. The defendant contended that the plaintiffs could claim no shortage until the matter went to arbitration and an award had been made according to the terms provided in the paragraph of said agreement above quoted.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Morrison considered that the settlement of the shortage by arbitration was a condition precedent and dismissed the action. On appeal by the defendant the Court of Appeal for British Columbia ordered a new trial, with costs in the Court of Appeal and all costs thrown away by the abortive trial in the court below. From this judgment the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nNesbitt K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given in the court below. Davies J.\u2014The question raised in the appeal is whether on a true construction of the contract made between the parties and sued upon in this action there arose a legal obligation on the defendant's part to pay plaintiffs certain monies, or whether the obligation or liability to pay was dependent upon an award first having been made in plaintiffs' favour under a clause in the agreement providing for a reference to arbitration.\nI agree generally in the reasoning and in the conclusions of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, as expressed by Mr. Justice Galliher.\nThe question resolves itself into a finding of the intention of the parties as expressed in their agreement.\nIs the true meaning of the agreement such that no liability or obligation to pay arose on the part of the defendant unless and until an arbitration had been held and an award made in plaintiffs' favour. In other words, was the finding of such an award a condition precedent.\nIt is unnecessary to refer to authorities from Scott v. Avery[2], down to date, as the answer to the question depends in each case upon the language the parties have used in their contract.\nThe rule cannot, I think, be better stated than it was by the Lord Chancellor Herschell in Caledonia Insurance Company v. Gilmour[3]:\nThe question is not whether, where a contract creates an obligation to pay a sum of money, it is a good answer to an action to recover it that disputes have arisen as to the liability to pay the sum and that the contract provides for the reference of such differences to arbitration, but whether, where the only obligation created is to pay a sum ascertained in a particular manner, where, in other words, such ascertainment is made a condition precedent to the obligation to pay, the courts can enforce an obligation without reference to such ascertainment.\nIn my judgment the obligation to pay under the first part of clause four was complete in itself and enforceable in the courts. The obligation of the defendant to pay for the shortage found on the cruising to exist was not made conditional on a finding of such shortage or other finding by the arbitrators. Such arbitration and award as is provided for was not made a condition precedent to the obligation to pay.\nThe latter part of section four providing for an arbitration in the double event of their being a shortage of timber and the defendant (vendor)\nfailing to agree on a basis of settlement concerning such shortage\nwhatever these words may mean, doubtless intended that there should be an arbitration between the parties in case of dispute which \"would settle the matter with regard to shortage,\" but the language used providing for such arbitration falls far short of making the arbitration and award a condition precedent to the defendant's obligation to pay for such shortage.\nNo express words either taking away the right to sue in the courts to recover the shortage or making the arbitration a condition precedent to such right are used, nor are any words used from which, in my judgment, it can be reasonably concluded that it was the intention of the parties to make the defendant's (vendor's) obligation to pay for the shortage conditional on there having been first an arbitration and an award under it.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant bought from respondents a block of shares in a saw mill company. The value of these shares depended on the assets of the company.\nThe assets consisted largely of timber limits of which there were five or six specified classes and an estimate based on such classification was set forth in a schedule annexed to the written contract the parties entered into for carrying out the bargain and sale of the said shares.\nThe total was accepted no doubt as basis of approximate value that the shares would have.\nIt might happen, however, that the estimate was too high.\nWhether it was or not in no way affected the stated terms of the bargain and sale which was concluded and made to appear in the first two paragraphs, as if quite independent of the right to abatement of price if justice demanded any on account of the estimates having been placed too high.\nThe agreement was set forth in a long written contract which was divided in the operative paragraphs into thirteen different paragraphs each intended as far as possible to deal with and dispose of its subject-matter as a whole.\nThe third paragraph states that the appellant was\nto give a satisfactory guarantee to second party that the quantity of timber on the different tracts of land as shewn by the statement of the Fraser River Saw Mills,, Ltd., corporation, under their statement of April 30th, 1907, copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, is true and accurate, it being the intention and made one of the conditions of this trade that the timber shall at least run equal in quantity to the number of feet shewn in the attached statement.\nThis paragraph almost does, but does not altogether give the guarantee.\nIt seems expressly to avoid giving any covenant or anything upon which an action might be founded\u2014 and why so ? It seems to me clear that the draftsman abstained because an action was not to be given or any chance thereof, unless and until the machinery in the following paragraphs provided had been first applied.\nI see with this introduction to the fourth paragraph declaring for a guarantee, but abstaining from giving it more clearly than I would from reading paragraph four by itself, that the fourth paragraph as a whole constituted the kind of guarantee that was to be given.\nIt was a most complex problem the parties had thus to have resolved for them if within the time named a shortage could reasonably be claimed.\nIt was clearly the honest purpose of both that the appellant's cruisers should produce for comparison if need be with the schedule a report of results of the cruising and then both sides, if need be, should attempt to agree, but failing agreement the reference provided was to take place and an award got before any liability to an action could arise.\nStress was laid by respondents on the fact that the first part of paragraph four shews the party of the first part is to repay the second part \"in just proportion, etc.\"\nBut surely what consequences had ultimately to flow from a shortage had to be stated some place, and when we find the principle of procedure pointed out in the next line, and in the very next sentence the procedure for fixing and settling \"the matter of shortage,\" it does seem to me that to hold the first part quite independent, and the next merely collateral and not necessarily interdependent, the true intention of the parties is frustrated.\nA consideration of the entire scope and purpose of paragraphs three and four, seem to me to point to a creation of a liability only when everything provided had been done to weigh and measure that liability. The action was, I think, for these reasons, properly dismissed.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMay I be permitted to add that decisions of other cases are of little help. But of the cases cited and distinguished by Mr. Justice Galliher's judgment, several seem to me, I say it with great respect, rather hard to reconcile with the result arrived at, if comparison of phraseology can ever serve one.\nDuff and Anglin JJ. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Davis, Marshall & Macneill.\n[1] 15 B.C.

VII. ch. 10, sec. 60, provides as follows:\u2014\n\u201c10. (1) Before it shall be lawful to run such engine over any highway whereon no tolls are levied, it shall be the duty of the person or persons proposing to run the same to strengthen, at his or their own expense, all bridges and culverts to be crossed by such engines, and to keep the same in repair so long as the highway is so used.\n\u201c(2) The costs of such repairs shall be borne by the owners of different engines in proportion to the number of engines run over such bridges or culverts.

VII. ch. 7, sec. 43; 4 Edw. VII. ch. 10, sec. 60.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (19 Ont. L.R. 188), Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard J. dissenting, that the strengthening of a bridge or laying of planks over it is a condition precedent to the right to run an engine over the same, and any engine crossing without observing such condition is unlawfully on the bridge and liable for injury resulting therefrom.\nHeld, also, Fitzpatrick C.J., and Girouard J. dissenting, that planks required by sub\u2011sec. 3 over a bridge or culvert were not intended merely to protect the surface from injury by contact with the wheels of the engine or machinery passing over it, but was also to guard against the danger of the flooring giving way.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court by which the verdict for the plaintiffs at the trial was maintained.\nThe issues raised for decision on the appeal are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nRobinette K.C. and J.M. Godfrey for the appellants.\nWilliam White K.C. and W.M. Douglas K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by Chief Justice Moss.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting) was of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought against the defendant municipality for damages sustained by reason of a traction engine less than 7 tons in weight be- longing to the plaintiff falling through a bridge of the appellant municipality which was alleged to have been so insufficiently constructed as not to have been able to carry such traction engine safely across.\nThe defendant municipality counterclaimed for damages caused to the bridge by the illegal and improper action of the plaintiff in attempting to take the engine across the bridge without complying with the statutory requirements in that regard.\nBoth here and in the Court of Appeal the case was argued upon the findings of facts of the trial judge which were accepted by both parties. These findings so far as they are necessary to refer to in the view I take of the case were that the stringers of the bridge were inadequate to carry the weight (about four tons) that would come upon them from the rear wheels of the engine in question, but that the use of planks as required by the statute when taking such an engine across the bridge would have added to the sustaining power of the stringers sufficiently to have enabled them to have carried the weight of the engine in safety.\nThe trial judge and a minority of the Court of Appeal held that the provisions of the statute were intended simply as a means for the protection of the surface of the bridge, and not for the purpose of strengthening its carrying capacity, and that failure to comply with these requirements in such a case as this did not relieve the municipality from what would otherwise be its responsibility.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was to the effect that compliance with the conditions set forth in the proviso of the statute was in the nature of a condition precedent to the user of the bridge by such traction engine, and that failure to comply with them before and when taking the traction engine across, made such user an unlawful one.\nThe statute referred to is chapter 242 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, as amended by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 7, sec. 43, and 4 Edw. VII. ch. 10, sec. 60.\nSection 10 of the said Act as amended provides as follows:\n10 (1) Before it shall be lawful to run such engines over any highway whereon no tolls are levied, it shall be the duty of the person or persons proposing to run the same to strengthen, at his or their own expense, all bridges and culverts to be crossed by such engines, and to keep the same in repair so long as the highway is so used.\n(2) The costs of such repairs shall be borne by the owners of different engines in proportion to the number of engines run over such bridges or culverts. R.S.O. 1887, ch. 200, sec. 10.\n(3) The two preceding sub-sections shall not apply to engines used for threshing purposes or for machinery in construction of roadways of less than eight tons in weight. Provided, however, that before crossing any such bridge or culvert it shall be the duty of the person or persons proposing to run any engine or machinery mentioned in any of the sub-sections of this section to lay down on such bridge or culvert planks of such sufficient width and thickness as may be necessary to fully protect the flooring or surface of such bridge or culvert from any injury that might otherwise result thereto from the contact of the wheels of such engine or machinery; and in default thereof the person in charge and his employer, if any, shall be liable to the municipality for all damages resulting to the flooring or surface of such bridge or culvert as aforesaid. 3 Edw. VII. ch. 7, sec. 43; 4 Edw. VII. ch. 10, sec. 60.\nThe conclusion I have reached is that the construction of the statute by the majority of the Court of Appeal was the right construction, that the provisions of sub-section 3 as to the precautions to be taken by the person in charge of the traction engine before taking it across the bridge were obligatory and a condition precedent to the right to take the engine across, and not having been observed the engine was on the bridge unlawfully.\nThe intention of the statute, so far as engines eight tons in weight and over are concerned, is clear beyond dispute. The persons in charge must, before crossing the bridges and culverts, strengthen them at their own expense to enable them to bear safely the weight of such engines. The third sub-section, while declaring that these provisions should not apply to engines used for threshing and other defined purposes of less than eight tons in weight, went on to provide other duties and obligations which were to be observed as well by these special classes of engines if they were taken across bridges or culverts as by any other engines. It says before crossing any such bridge or culvert it shall be the duty of the person in charge of the engine to lay down planks, etc. No language could be stronger or clearer. But it is contended that the object of this planking is further on clearly set out, that it has nothing to do with the strengthening of the bridge, and that its neglect in view of the finding of the trial judge with regard to the inadequacy of the stringers of this bridge to carry the weight which the rear wheels of the engine brought to bear on them is of no importance.\nThe argument is weighty and there is no doubt the language of the proviso is not as apt and clear as it might well have been.\nI do not agree, however, with the contention that the object of the proviso was simply and only the protection of the surface of the bridge from being injured. The proviso went much further than that, and was, to my mind, clearly intended to protect the planks of the bridge from being broken through by reason of the great weight (some four tons in the case of the engine in question), which the rear wheels, if they passed directly over the planks, would necessarily bring to bear on them with all the possible consequences which might follow, and so it stipulated as a condition of the crossing of the bridge by any such engine for the laying down of these longitudinal planks, along and over which the engine wheels should pass. The obvious effect of these longitudinal planks would be by distributing the weight carried not only to protect the surface of the flooring from being torn, worn or scratched, but to minimize the danger of the planks of the flooring being broken through by the enormous weight to which they would be subjected if the wheels passed over them in direct contact with them. These provisions and statutory obligations placed upon the engine driver before using the bridge were conditions precedent to the right of user, and were obligatory upon him. Their primary object may have been the protection of the surface of the flooring of the bridge or culvert from injury, but that was not their only object, as I have shewn. Compliance with these statutory conditions incidentally strengthened the bridge\u2019s carrying power and the special finding in the case before us is that if observed it would have so strengthened the bridge in question as to have prevented the accident.\nThe two findings must be read together. That which holds the stringers of the bridge to have been inadequate to bear the weight of the engine when carried over the bridge without compliance with the statutory conditions is neutralized by the holding that compliance with the conditions would have ensured safety.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am, with great respect, unable to comprehend how a man can recover damages suffered by him from doing that in an illegal manner which if done in a legal manner would have caused him no injury.\nThe finding of fact that if the bridge in question had had the planks laid upon it by appellant as required by the statute, it would have been of sufficient strength to have ensured safety, seems to me to be an impassable barrier to the appellant herein.\nI think the statute clearly prohibits any use of such bridges for the purpose attempted by appellant, unless and until the provisions of the statute are complied with. It seems idle to argue, as persistently pressed upon us, that the object of the legislature was merely to preserve to the municipality a right of action instead of preserving a bridge for the public use.\nSome practical men in the legislature understood quite well what they were about in this regard, even though it did take some time in a struggle extending over a great many years preceding the various amendments to the \u201cAct to authorize and regulate the use of traction engines on the highways,\u201d to get this indifferent expression of a duty that they well understood was needed to be imposed in prohibitory terms.\nThe amendment, it may be observed, relates to culverts as well as bridges. It would entail needless expense to make all these safe for an eight-ton load likely to be needed only once or twice a year, when a simple and not very burdensome measure of precaution on the part of those to be so served, at such rare intervals, might avoid that expense.\nI agree so fully with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Garrow that I need not enlarge further here, merely to repeat what is well stated.\nYet I may be permitted to add that it may be a question whether or not negligence, as American authorities have it, is as accurately descriptive of the legal barrier in appellant\u2019s way as to say simply that what was done being illegal, therefore appellants doing it directly led to its injury, and hence that there is no foundation for its action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the action should be dismissed because I think the findings of the learned trial judge shew that mishap was caused by the failure of the plaintiffs\u2019 servants to perform the conditions under which alone they were entitled to take the engine upon the bridge. The question presented turns, in my judgment, upon the effect to be given to the phrase \u201cflooring or surface\u201d in the context in which it is found. The view of the learned trial judge was that the object of the enactment was to provide protection for the surface of the platform constituting the travelled highway against injury by contact with the wheels of vehicles of the kind dealt with; and that in the phrase quoted \u201cflooring\u201d adds nothing to the meaning conveyed by \u201csurface.\u201d\nThe phraseology used to describe the injury which the bridge is to be protected against (\u201cinjury\u201d * * \u201cfrom the contact of the wheels\u201d) does undeniably suggest that the legislature had the protection of the surface very clearly in its view and desired to emphasize it. The question, however, at this point is: Can the object of the section be taken to be limited to that? Are we really justified in treating \u201cflooring or surface\u201d as equivalent to the surface of the flooring?\nThe construction put forward by the appellant mainly rests upon the words \u201ccaused by the contact with the wheels.\u201d But the statute is not making provi- sion against the effects of mere contiguity of the surface of the wheels with that of the floor; the contact contemplated is that of wheels resting or moving upon the bridge and carrying the weight of the engine; and it is every injury arising from contact in such circumstances that is provided against. Let us suppose boards broken by a smooth-wheeled engine; why is that a kind of injury not within this language? To hold so would effect the obliteration of the word \u201cflooring\u201d; are we justified in obliterating it? The legislature might be justly concerned with protecting the surface of such floors from defacement. But why not also in protecting the boards and the frame supporting them from breaking under the strain of a heavy load. One can quite understand the legislature assuming that the main superstructure of bridges would be sufficient to support such a weight; but the fact that they have done so affords no basis for presuming an intention to expose every bridge floor in the province to the same test. While, no doubt, the section presents an inviting field for controversy, I do not think the doubtful phrases relied upon afford a satisfactory ground for refusing to attribute their full significance to the concluding words \u201cfor all damage,\u201d etc.\nThe meaning of the word \u201cflooring\u201d as applied to a bridge is indicated clearly in the following passages and unquestionably in the absence of a controlling context includes such longitudinal joists as that which gave way in the accident in question here:\nThe timber frame-work of floors is called \u201cnaked flooring.\u201d It is of three kinds\u2014single, double and framed. Single flooring consists of a series of joists stretching across the whole void from wall to wall, without an intermediate support. The flooring boards are laid on the top of these, and the ceiling of the lower story fixed to the under side. Double flooring consists in laying binding joists across the floor about six feet apart, crossed above by bridging joists, and also crossed below by the ceiling joists. Framed flooring is provided with girders or beams in addition to the binding, bridging and ceiling joists. 3 Encyclop\u00e6dia Americana \u201cCarpentry.\u201d\nThe flooring is so arranged as to constitute a platform adapted to the character of the traffic carried over it, and forms a subsidiary part of the superstructure; but the main superstructure is that which carries the distributed weight of the floor and its load, transferring it to the supports on either side. 2 Nelson\u2019s Encyclop\u00e6dia, p. 287.\nDouble flooring (see Plate XXIV., fig. 8, Nos. 1 and 2, and Plate XXV., fig. 3) consists of three distinct series of joists, which are called binding, bridging and ceiling joists. The binders in this are the real support of the floor; they run from wall to wall, and carry the bridging joists above and the ceiling joists below them. Binders need not be less and should not be much more than 6 feet apart, that is, if the bridging or flooring joists are not inordinately weak. 4 Ency. Brit., p. 482.\nIn this view it is not necessary to consider many of the questions that occupied a good deal of attention at the argument.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cowan & Towers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.E.

It provides for the assessment being made in the year preceding that for which it is to become the basis for levying rates to meet the expenses of the city.\nThe duty is imposed on each owner or occupant of ratable property to give all information and if required by the assessor to deliver a written statement duly signed containing all the particulars required for the assessment roll.\nIt is the duty of the assessor to enter all ratable property at its cash value estimating separately the improvements and the land.\nThe City Council\nmay by by-law exempt from taxation, wholly or in part, any improvements, erections and buildings erected on any land within the city, notwithstanding that they may be part of the real estate.\nThe next section, 46, under the heading of \"Exemptions,\" declares\nall lands, real property, improvements thereon, machinery and plant being fixtures therein and thereon in the city shall be liable to taxation subject\nto exemptions specified in some five sub-sections.\nOf these sub-sections, the third specifies a great variety of educational or charitable institutions of whose buildings and grounds not otherwise used than for the purposes thereof, are declared exempt\nprovided, that such grounds shall not exceed in extent the amount actually necessary for the requirements of the institution. The question as to what amount of land is necessary shall be decided by the Court of Revision, whose decision shall be final.\nUnder the heading \"Court of Revision\" there appear a number of sections dealing with the functions of that body. The first of these is section 47, as follows: 47. The assessment roll of the city shall be annually revised, equalized and corrected by the council sitting as a Court of Revision, who may hold or adjourn the sittings of the Court of Revision as a majority of the members present may determine.\nThe next section provides for the council appoint- ing a \"time and place for the sitting of the Court of Revision,\" which is composed of the entire council,\nfor hearing all complaints against the assessment as made by the assessor.\nThe sections immediately following this are directed to the form of notice of appeal, the power entitled to give same, the ground thereof and the mode of procedure to be adopted.\nIt does not appear to me that there is either in these sections or in the later one providing for appeals to a judge, any right of appeal given to bodies or persons such as appellants herein, to make an appeal relative to the question of how the Court of Revision may have discharged the duty assigned to it by the sentence quoted above from sub-section 3 of section 46.\nAs illustrative of the scope and purpose of the Act I may refer to the power given by section 45, enabling the council to exempt buildings or a percentage of improvements from taxation and provision which is furnished after all this by section 54, for the members of the council constituting the Court of Revision equalizing the assessed value of land and improvements.\nThese powers are given in such terms as to indicate it is in one class of cases to be exercised upon an originating motion in the court and merely by a majority of all the members expressing their opinion, and in another class of cases without any judicial examination by way of hearing evidence or parties though in some cases upon complaint. Then section 55 declares the roll as revised or confirmed and passed by the Court of Revision\nshall, except in so far as the same may be further amended on an appeal to a judge of the Supreme Court, be valid and bind all parties, etc.\nThe appeal given to the judge as thus anticipated does not seem to apply to any such case as the one appellant raises, but is confined\nto the question of whether the assessment in respect of which the appeal is taken is or is not equal and ratable with the assessment of other similar property in the having equal advantage of situation against the assessment of which no appeal has been taken.\nThe first part of this is wide enough to cover such a class of subjects as that of the property of appellant as compared with others in like class, but these latter words seem to render it impossible to say an appeal would lie in either such a case as this or anything arising under the equalizing powers under section 54 above referred to.\nI present these various provisions I have referred to in order to illuminate the character and enable us to correctly understand the scope and purpose of the legislation in which is found the peculiar wording of a sentence upon which this appeal turns.\nIn short there is nothing in the language imposing the duty and giving the power to the Court of Revision which it has exercised and is now in question, that necessarily constitutes the duty one of a judicial character.\nIt is merely a delegation of a legislative or administrative power probably carrying with it a duty, but in neither way one can look at it implying the discharge of a judicial duty subject to review or supervision.\nAn omission to exercise the power would leave only a limited exemption, and who could complain? The assessor as in duty bound assesses what he deems ratable. If any error appears to have been made by him within the sphere of his authority, that might be appealed against on the ground of want of ratability. But that involves another view I will deal with presently. It has no relation to the duty of the Court of Revision relative to that which is prim\u00e0 facie ratable, and as to which the assessor's only duty is to assess.\nThe term \"Court of Revision\" in this connection means no more nor less than the council, for it is the same body under another name.\nThe statute by using this alternative name beyond doubt impliedly attaches to the execution of the power and discharge of implied duty a limit of time for its exercise; and in so doing also gives it a chance of being better exercised than if given at large during the entire year for which the council as such endures.\nIt seems to me appellant's claim herein is thus in this last suggestion entirely answered, for whether legislative, judicial or administrative, the time has long gone by for its exercise.\nThe time for its exercise had passed when these proceedings were had.\nIf the Court of Revision could ever have been enjoined or controlled in any way, it should in the very nature of its constitution have been exercised before it was discharged by the mere operation of the statute. Its function ceased with the certifying by the court of the roll as completed.\nIf the act done was merely legislative or administrative in its character, the name of the body doing it could not change that character.\nThe word \"court\" is a good old English term of such wide import as to cover as the context in which it appears may indicate duties of these several and respective characters and is of no peculiar signification in this connection.\nAgain let us see what is to be done. It is merely a question of policy that has to be decided.\nThe buildings and lands to be occupied thereby are exempt, and hence not ratable and presumably were not rated.\nWhether the city can or ought to afford more than this absolute necessity in law is a matter respecting which men might well differ in opinion.\nWhere to draw the line is left to the discretion\u2014I think, the absolute, unqualified discretion\u2014of a majority of the council sitting as a court of revision.\nIf an appeal from that discretion had been given, a different inference might have been drawn.\nIt might have been well argued in such case that the act was to be a judicial one.\nBut beyond all these things assuming the power exercised by the Court of Revision a judicial act and assuming (a pretty strong assumption upon this statute) a writ of certiorari ever could run to bring up the record of a court of revision constituted for working out the provisions of legislation no way dependent upon its being the development or amended method of imposing rates by or through a court, such as the Courts of Sessions, of which instances can be found, is there anything in this case that might warrant interference ?\nI, for the present, put aside all the considerations tending to shew it was a mere exercise of legislative or administrative power and duty. I will then assume that the question of the assessor's rating is subject to be complained of on the ground that he has not properly discharged his duty, but omitted to give due exemption to the extent prima facie claimable.\nWhat happened? An appeal was taken as if against the assessor's act.\nCounsel was heard for the appellant. No witnesses were tendered. No claim was made here that such should be heard and then a refusal to hear them. In such latter event I could understand how the court (discharging for the. moment a judicial duty) might be said to be acting without jurisdiction.\nNothing of the kind appears. Courts of revision are not bound of their own motion to call evidence. They may be entitled when the assessor's action is thus presented incidentally to hearing complaint against his ruling, to use their own judgment as men of affairs and often do so, as was done here to reduce the assessment.\nUnder this statute they are by section 54 expressly given such power quite independently of the general power.\nNow what this court did, when appellant failed to give evidence or claim to do so, was to assume, as entitled to assume, the \"assessor's rating presumably correct and quite well warranted by the statute, and then to exercise their power to reduce. It was either an exercise of the express power to exempt or fix exemption or of power, incidental to an appeal, to reduce. I think it was the former.\nThe strange complaint is made that they coupled all institutions of the classes the statute enables them to relieve together, and made a uniform reduction on a percentage basis. What is wrong with that? The court could have dismissed the complaint as unsupported by evidence.\nThe court might then, so far as the law goes, have ignored the appellant's complaint and in other cases upon evidence, have given more ample exemption. Yet what ground of complaint could appellant have?\nThe judgment and act of the assessor stood, and stands yet (subject to the power exercised not by way of determining the appeal, but executing their special power), by every presumption of law as correct.\nThe sole question, possible to be raised by this proceeding, if it lie at all, which I more than doubt, is whether jurisdiction existed or not.\nIt would be hard, I think, to find a clearer case of acting within jurisdiction.\nMoreover, the rules of British Columbia require that any case of certiorari the objection, whether of omission or mistake to be relied upon, must be specified in the order for the issue of the writ.\nNone appears on this order.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Under section 46, sub-section 3, chapter 54 of 64 Vict. (B.C.), the appellants are, I think, prim\u00e0 facie exempt from taxation in respect of \"the buildings and grounds attached and belonging to\" their institution in so far as such buildings and grounds are actually used and occupied by them for the purposes of that institution. The same sub-section confers upon the Court of Revision the power to limit this exemption. It is quite clear, I think, that the function thus vested in the Court of Revision is quasi judicial and must be exercised in each case with respect to the merits of that case alone; no administrative authority is conferred upon the Court of Revision empowering it to lay down a general rule based only upon general considerations. The principal contention of the appellants is that in this case the Court of Revision did not apply itself to the merits, but acted upon some such self-imposed general rule.\nI express no opinion upon the question whether had the appellants succeeded in establishing this, the substance of their contention, they might still have been successfully met by the objection that the case is not a proper one for certiorari; they fail, in my opinion, because on the whole of the evidence before us we are not entitled to conclude that the Court of Revision acted otherwise than in accordance with its legal duty. There is in evidence a minute of that body in these words:\nThat all charitable institutions mentioned in sub-section 3 of section 46 of \"Vancouver Incorporation Act\" be exempted from taxation to the extent of the area occupied by the buildings thereon and an additional amount of land equal to 25 per cent. of the area, and that the assessment roll for 1900, as amended, be confirmed.\nAnd that the court then adjourned sine die.\nAnd it is upon this minute that the appellants chiefly rely in support of the contention just indicated. The existence of this minute does not appear to me to be conclusive. In itself it is not incompatible with the view that the Court of Revision had examined each particular case falling within the enactment before deciding to act in the sense of this memorandum. We have no evidence as to the number of these institutions in Vancouver, and it is quite conceivable that in respect of all of them there is such a similarity of relevant circumstances that the direction contained in the minute would be a reasonable and proper direction in each individual case. We are bound, of course, to assume that this municipal body did, pursuant to its duty, examine each case until there is some solid reason for otherwise deciding. The presumption that they did so is strengthened by the circumstance that the appellants' solicitor being present on the occasion on which the appellants' case was considered, took no objection to the mode of procedure, and further by the additional circumstance that in his affidavit he refrains from saying that the case of the appellants was not discussed or considered on it's own merits.\nI should not wish to be understood as undervaluing in the least degree the importance of a proper observance by courts of revision and the like bodies of the broad rules of judicial conduct when exercising judicial functions; but it is just as important that misconduct should not be imputed to such bodies upon evidence so meagre and equivocal as that upon which this proceeding is based. I have the less hesitation in dismissing the appeal in that the material before us appears to indicate that if the charge of misconduct be well founded there was palpable abuse of the statutory authority vested in the council. Abuse is only one form of excess; and whether the circumstances of this case do or do not now preclude these appellants from bringing forward fresh evidence in another proceeding\u2014there seems to be no good reason for thinking that at an earlier stage (assuming the assessment to have been, on the true facts, vitiated by the council's alleged ultra vires proceeding) they were not without a complete and satisfactory remedy.\nAnglin J. agreed with Duff J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPhillips & Tiffin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

(1902) c. 87.\nBy the Manitoba \"Fire Insurance Policy Act\" (R.S.M. (1902) ch. 87, sch.), an insurance company insuring against loss by fire is not liable \"for loss or damage occurring while * * * gasoline * * * is stored or kept in the building insured or containing the property insured unless permission is given in writing by the company.\" Insurance was effected \"on stock consisting chiefly of illuminating and lubricating oils, etc., and all other goods kept by them for sale.\" A quantity of gasoline was in the building containing the stock when destroyed by fire.\nHeld, that gasoline, being an illuminating oil, was part of the stock insured and the above statutory condition could not be invoked to defeat the policy.\nHeld, per Anglin J., that if gasoline was not insured as an illuminating oil it was within the description of \"all other goods kept for sale.\" By section 2 of the Act \"where, by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in this province as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire have not been strictly complied with * * * or where from any other reason the court or judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions,\" the company shall not be discharged from liability.\nBy statutory condition 13(a) in the schedule to the Act every person entitled to make a claim \"is forthwith after loss to give notice in writing to the company.\"\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that the above clause applies to said condition and under it, in the circumstances of this case, the insurance should be held not to be forfeited by reason of the failure to give such notice.\nJudgment appealed from (19 Man. R. 720) reversed, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Metcalfe J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. B. Coyne and 8. Hart Green for the appellants.\nAffleck for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014Referring to the objection that the policy was void by reason of a breach of the statutory condition which exempts the insurer from liability for loss occurring where gasoline is kept upon the premises insured without permission in writing from the insurer, I agree absolutely in the conclusion reached by the majority of the court on this point. Insurance contracts are to be construed like ordinary contracts. The duty of the court is to seek the intention of the parties, which, in this case, is manifest; that is, it was, in my opinion, clearly intended to insure the stock in trade of the appellants, an oil company, which, to the knowledge of the respondents, dealt in gasoline and other petroleum products. The general agents of the company inspected the premises; saw gasoline there; and their knowledge was, in the circumstances of this, case, the knowledge of the company. Holdsworth. v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Ins. Co.[2]. To hold that because of some statutory condition the policy was rendered void if the insured kept and stored goods covered by the description in the body of the policy without the permission in writing of the insurer would be to assume that one of the parties may insert some condition in a contract which will avail on a possible construction of the whole instrument to defeat the right of the other. Let me test it in this way. When the contract was made, did the risk attach to any gasoline that might then be on the premises? This question must be answered affirmatively. The object of the insurance was\nthe stock, consisting chiefly of illuminating and lubricating oils,\nviz., those articles of commerce, including gasoline, which to the respondents' knowledge the appellant kept on the premises for sale. Further, can it be doubted that gasoline, which is well known to be one of the products obtained from the distillation of petroleum, and generally used for illuminating purposes, comes within the generic name and description of illuminating oil? Is it conceivable that the main object of the contract is defeated by a condition such as the one relied upon?\nI cannot add anything further to what has been said by my brothers Davies and Anglin, in all of which I concur.\nI regret, however, that it is impossible for me to accept their conclusion with respect to the breach of the statutory condition (sch. 13(a)), which imposes upon the insured the obligation forthwith after the loss to give notice in writing to the company. By the contract declared upon the appellants were insured by the respondent company to the amount stipulated against loss resulting from or occasioned by the happening of the event insured against\u2014fire. It is clearly a contract of indemnity and the payment of the amount for which the company is liable under the policy is made subject to certain conditions with respect\n1. To notice of loss;\n2. To proofs of loss.\nAnd the questions to be determined by us on this branch of the case are:\n1. Is the condition in this policy as to notice of loss so framed as to make a strict compliance with its requirements a condition precedent to the right to recover the amount of the policy?\n2. Are the provisions of the policy concerning notice of loss and proofs of loss severable and distinct?\nWhether the condition as to notice of loss is a condition precedent may not be free from doubt; but, on the whole, I agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge, based as it is upon what may be called the well-settled jurisprudence of this court. Accident Ins. Co. of North America v. Young[3]; Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation v. Taylor[4]; Home Life Association of Canada v. Randall[5], and Hyde v. Lefaivre[6]. See also Scott v. Ph\u0153nix Assurance Co.[7], decided in the Privy Council\nWhether the condition as to the notice is a condition precedent or not is, I admit, a question of construction in each case; but the obligation to give notice is clearly distinguishable from the obligation to produce proofs of loss. The imperfect compliance with the condition to provide full and complete proofs of loss may be remedied without injury to the company and is merely a directory provision. The purpose which proofs of loss are intended to serve, that is, to enable the company to determine the amount of its liability may be effected otherwise. But the failure to give notice of the loss cannot be remedied. The opportunity to inquire into the circumstances of the fire while the matter is still fresh is lost and this may be of great importance to the company. See In re, Coleman's Depositories and Life and Health Assurance Association[8], per Fletcher Moulton L.J., at page 807. Moreover, the policy is made and accepted subject to the conditions imposed by the legislature upon the insurance companies for the benefit presumably of the public and one of-those conditions, accepted by the insured, is that the amount of the claim is made payable sixty days after due notice of the loss has been given in writing and the condition cannot be waived unless the waiver is clearly expressed in writing, signed by an agent of the company.\nIf notice is not given, when does the amount become due and exigible?\nThe remaining question now is: Can section two of the Manitoba \"Fire Policy Act\" be held to vest this court with authority or jurisdiction to relieve the appellants against their failure to comply with the condition as to notice of loss?\nThat section is in these words:\nWhere by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in this province, as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire, have not been strictly complied with, or where, after a statement or proof of loss has been given in good faith or on behalf of the insured, in pursuance of any proviso or condition of such contract, the company, through its agent, or otherwise, objects to the loss upon such conditions, or does not, within a reasonable time after receiving such statement or proof, notify the insured in writing that such statement or proof is objected to and what are the particulars in which the same is alleged to be defective, and so from time to time, or where from any other reason the court or judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions, no objection to the sufficiency of such statement or proof or amended or supplemental statement or proof (as the case may be), shall, in any such case, be allowed as a discharge of the liability of the company on such contract of insurance wherever entered into. R.S.M. ch. 59, sec. 2, part.\nThe purpose of the statute was undoubtedly to protect persons insured who, by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, failed to comply strictly with the conditions of the policy as to the proof to be given to the company after the occurrence of the fire. This extraordinary power to relieve one of the parties to a contract from the consequences of a breach of its conditions, which is vested in the court, is limited to the proofs of loss and, in order to make it applicable to the present case, it is necessary to extend the scope of the statute so as to include the condition as to notice of loss. I cannot agree that the statute gives us power to make, practically, a new contract for the parties. If this condition is, as I hold, a condition precedent; and, as to this, I think we are bound by the cases decided in this court and mentioned above; failure to comply with that condition defeats the claim and we cannot, in this court, revive it. Moreover, as I said before, the section of the Act is intended to relieve against necessity, accident or mistake. Under which head can we give relief? There can be no suggestion of necessity. It is obvious that it is not a case of mistake or accident. To say that a man forgot to do something is not the same thing as saying that he was mistaken. It is not accident, in the sense in which that word is used in the Act, to say that a man omitted to do something which his contract required him to do. Johnston v. Dominion Guarantee and Accident Ins. Co.[9]. I may add that if I saw my way to find for the appellant, I would gladly do so, but the giving of the notice is a fundamental condition of recovery, a condition that goes to the root of the contract; and against the consequence of his failure to comply with the condition we cannot give relief.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nGirouard J. agreed with Anglin J.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought on a policy of insurance to recover a loss sustained by fire which destroyed the plaintiffs' goods alleged to have been insured under the policy.\nThe two main grounds set up by way of defence at the trial and afterwards in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba were that under the conditions of the policy the presence of gasoline kept or stored on the premises discharged the insurance company from all liability, and secondly, that under rule 13 it was a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' right to recover that he should forthwith after loss give notice in writing to the company, and that he had not done so.\nThe trial judge held the objection as to want of notice to be fatal and entered judgment for the defendant accordingly.\nOn appeal the four judges were divided as to the want of notice; Chief Justice Howell, with whom Perdue J. concurred, holding that the defendants had not in their defence distinctly set up the condition and its non-performance as required by rule 15A of the statute regulating the practice and pleading of the court, while Richards and Cameron JJ. held that there was a substantial compliance with the rule, and that the want of notice had been sufficiently pleaded and was fatal to plaintiffs' right to recover.\nThe Chief Justice and Perdue J. also held that under the circumstances of this case, and having regard to the special kind and character of the stock insured and the actual knowledge of the agent who issued the policy, that the insured did actually keep for limited times small quantities of gasoline on hand and that as such quantities were in the stock of the insured and seen by him at the time the policy issued, it might fairly be held that on a true construction of the policy the statutory condition F, prohibiting petroleum, coal oil, gasoline, etc., from being kept or stored on the premises insured was inapplicable to this particular insurance. On this point the other two judges, Richards and Cameron JJ., expressed no opinion.\nAs the appeal court was equally divided the judgment of the trial judge remained.\nAs the point was taken and argued before us that gasoline was stored or kept on the premises in violation of statutory condition F, it is necessary to consider the written part of the policy relating to the stock insured and determine whether statutory condition F is applicable to such an insurance policy.\nThat part reads as follows:\nOn stock consisting chiefly of illuminating and lubricating oils, greases, paints, varnishes, and all other goods kept by them for sale, manufactured and in process, including advertising matter and all materials used in the manufacture, packing and shipping of same, their own or held in trust, or on commission, or sold but not removed, while contained in the above described building or on platforms on ground within 100 feet of building.\nThe Prairie City Oil Company, which entered into the above insurance contract was, as its name indicates, a dealer in oils of all kinds. They formed, indeed, a large part of its stock in trade. The insurance agent who visited their place of business and filled up the insurance policy now sued on knew this. The fact was a patent and visible one. He embodied it in the above written description of the property insured by the policy. The insurance company in accepting such a policy from their agent and insuring a merchant's stock of the character described never could have intended that the statutory condition F now invoked to relieve them from liability should apply. The risk they expressly undertook in the written part of their policy to accept was in large part on the very class of articles prohibited at the risk of forfeiture from being kept or stored on the premises by such condition F. The stock insured, as described, and this statutory condition, were repugnant to and inconsistent with each other, and could not be harmonized or reconciled. One or other must be ignored, and it needs no argument to shew that in such cases the statutory printed form of condition being repugnant to the substantive part of the contract entered into in writing cannot be held to govern the contract. This contract can fairly be read and construed ignoring such statutory condition, so far as least as it is repugnant to the real contract of insurance entered into; otherwise the courts would be lending themselves to the carrying out of a fraud.\nAs to whether gasoline comes within the terms used in the written part of the policy \"illuminating oils\" there was little argument at bar and the evidence seems clear that it may be so classed. Smith, the insurance agent who issued the policy, said in answer to a question from the trial judge asking whether gasoline was considered an illuminating oil, that from his point of view, the insurance point, it would be, but he did not know how the trade would consider it. He said they got\npermits for it as an illuminating oil\u2014as a gasoline lighting system.\nMr. Lewis, the head of the plaintiff's firm, in answer to questions on this point, speaking from the trade point of view, said that gasoline was used largely for illuminating, that it was used in the city by half a dozen different companies who sold a system for lighting with gasoline, that of his own knowledge a large quantity of it was used for illuminating purposes and that he would, if asked to name the different illuminating oils, include gasoline. The fact seems to be that it cannot be used in the ordinary household or other burning lamps, but that it can be and is used in lamps and ways specially designed as an illuminant and as fuel.\nIn Webster's new unabridged dictionary it is described as being a product of petroleum and its uses are stated as \"solvent; fuel; illuminant.\"\nOther oils such as petroleum, rock oil, kerosene, coal oil, burning fluid, are classed together with gasoline in the condition F as being dangerous and are prohibited from being kept or stored on the insured premises without written permission. All of these are admitted as coming within the general words of the policy \"illuminating oils\" and under the evidence given I think gasoline should also in this contract be so included.\nThat being so, the words of condition F \"unless permission is given in writing by the company\" clearly apply. If the company have insured expressly the very articles prohibited by clause F, unless permission is granted to keep or store them, surely it is not open to argument that in such a case written permission has been given.\nThe other question raised as to the assured's noncompliance with the condition requiring him forthwith after loss to give notice in writing to the company gives rise to greater difficulties than the one I have already disposed of.\nI am not able to accept the reasoning of the learned judges below who held the telegram sent to the company by their local agent stating the facts of the fire and loss could under the circumstances be held as a compliance with the condition requiring written notice from the assured. The agent of the company was in no sense the agent of the assured when sending his telegram to his principals. I have, however, after a good deal of consideration reached the conclusion that this notice comes within section 2 of chapter 87 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, and that this section enables and justifies us in refusing to allow the objection as to the neglect of the insured to give the notice in question to be set up as a discharge of the liability of the company under the policy sued on.\nThat it was under the circumstances proved a most inequitable defence was found by the trial judge and hardly admits even of argument.\nThe only question remaining was whether that notice so required came within the terms of the enabling section above referred to.\nStrangely enough it does not appear to have been called to the attention either of the trial judge or of the Court of Appeal.\nThe statutory condition requiring the notice is No. 13. It reads:\nAny person entitled to make a claim under this policy is to observe the following conditions:\n(a) He is forthwith after loss to give notice in writing to the company.\nThis is followed by a number of other conditions, (b), (c), (d), and (e), relating to the proofs or particulars of loss which are subsequently to be delivered.\nThe question is whether the section of the statute I have above referred to is to be construed as limited to the requirements of statutory condition 13 relating to the particulars of loss as required by sub-sections (b), (c), (d), and (e), or whether it embraces and includes the requirement of sub-section (a) relating to the notice in writing to be given forthwith after the fire.\nThe question is one not free from doubt. The first part of the section reads:\nWhere by reason of necessity, accident, or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in this province, as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire, have not been strictly complied with, or where after a statement or proof of loss has been given in good faith or on behalf of the insured, etc.\nDo the words \"as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the fire\" embrace or exclude the notice in writing required by sub-section (a) of statutory condition 13.\nThe word \"proof as used here is inapt. In the latter part of the section it is used alternatively, but evidently synonymously with \"statement,\" and in this way \"no objection to the sufficiency of such statement or proof,\" etc.\nThe statutory condition 13 does not in itself use the word proof with reference either to this written notice of loss or with reference to what is called in it\nas particular account of the loss as the nature of the case admits of.\nThese are to embrace: 1. Statutory declarations; 2. Books of account, invoices and other vouchers, etc.; 3. A certificate under the hand of a magistrate or other specified official.\nThe condition 14 which follows refers to the \"above proofs of loss,\" but, of course, that may embrace as well the notice as the \"particular account of the loss\" the assured is required to deliver. These statements the assured is required to deliver are not, properly speaking, proofs, they are supposed to be and embrace the best evidence of the loss he can supply. In reason and equity there is no ground for putting the narrow construction upon the above section 2 of chapter 87 giving to the court or judge the power to prevent on the ground of it being inequitable any objection as to the sufficiency of \"such statement or proof\" required after the fire. Non-compliance with the condition required as to notice of the fire arising from mistake, accident or necessity from which the company was not prejudiced is just as inequitable a plea as non-compliance arising from the same causes and with the same innocuous results in respect to the fuller particulars which the assured is subsequently required to give.\nThe notice of the fire is required by the same statutory condition as the subsequent more particular statements or accounts. That they are called \"proof\" in one part of section and \"statements or proof\" in another part, satisfies me that the legislature intended the equitable jurisdiction it vested in the court or judge to extend to and cover as well the written notice required by sub-section (a) as to the fire having occurred as the more particular subsequent of the loss required by sub-sections (b), (c), (d), and (e).\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and judgment entered for the amount of the claim with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The learned trial judge held the appellants' action must fail by reason of the first paragraph in the list of conditions embraced in No. 13 of the statutory conditions indorsed on the policy sued upon.\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba dividing equally on an appeal against that decision, the appeal failed. In answer to the appeal here the respondent besides maintaining the contention upheld as above, urged as had been urged throughout, and I rather think had been its chief objection at the outset, that the condition on the policy forbidding the keeping of coal oil, gasoline and a number of other products of petroleum, had been violated.\nAs to this contention it was shewn that gasoline itself as well as other things kept, were in fact illuminating oils and thus within the very terms of the specific things that were described as what was insured. Moreover, the oral evidence was clear that the contention ought never to have been set up.\nTherefore, I need not argue that this contention is quite untenable.\nThe other contention I have referred to though one not to be favoured has not so much inherent absurdity in it.\nI think each one of a number of answers that appear hereunder may be held good.\nIt so happens that neither one of these helps the other. Each must stand or fall of its own strength or weakness.\nThe fire took place in Winnipeg where the oil business of appellants is carried on and where a firm engaged as the general agents of the respondents, live and represent it, by virtue of a power of attorney that seems comprehensive enough to sanction almost, yet not altogether, everything an insurance company may have to transact in the course of its business.\nIt was such as to attract both, the junior member of the firm of general agents and one or more members of the appellant firm to the spot whilst the insured property was being burned on the 13th November, 1908. The senior member of the firm of general agents also knew of it and immediately reported by wire to his company at its head office in Toronto, on the same day as the fire took place, the fact of the total loss.\nThe next day the company's manager, on the 14th November, wrote the general agents acknowledging this message and making remarks clearly indicative of liability to pay and expectation the company would pay.\nThe general agents acting within their powers engaged one Paterson, a professional or official adjuster of insurance losses.\nMr. Smith says\nwe instructed the adjuster to adjust the claim of the plaintiffs. * * We supplied him with the forms that the company supplied us with.\nThe papers contain statements of loss, declaration of one of the plaintiffs as to the fire and other insurances and valuation by the adjuster of the property burned and of the salvage.\nBut to my mind, in the view of the case that the question of estoppel gives rise to, the most important part is an apportionment of the loss between this company and five other insurance companies.\nThe amount of what would on such bases be payable to the appellants by the respondent company was thereby fixed at $3,532.70 and agreed to.\nThe whole mass of work and consideration to be given thereto lasted until the 27th November, when the papers having been completed were duly handed over by Paterson to the said general agents and by them forwarded to the company's head office on the 1st December.\nThe general agents write at same time requesting cheque within thirty days. In short they treat the whole business as closed except the payment within usual delays.\nNo answer or objection appears until January when Smith, at the head office, brought the matter under the notice of the president and the manager of the respondent, who replied they had the impression other companies concerned were resisting payment, and upon being told other companies were paying, the manager said he would recommend payment by his company also.\nNo such objection as now relied upon was ever made until the statement of defence shewed it amongst a great many other random shots.\nIt is in argument replied to this objection that the pleading does not, as the rules require, distinctly set up such a condition as now relied upon, (namely, the omission to give written notice), but one of a distinctly different nature, namely, of \"the alleged loss and damage.\" The want of its being in writing is not pleaded.\nI incline to think the objection is well taken. If the issue joined is looked to, then it may well be said that issue is to be found in the appellants' favour proven by oral notice to the general agents. It may be inferred from what transpired between them and the appellants.\nIt is the notice to the company at their office that is pleaded and their office, I think, for the purposes of the business in hand must be held to be that in Winnipeg conducted with such ample powers as the constitution thereof by the power of attorney to the general agents both expresses and implies.\nAgain the reason for the notice is that at the earliest practicable time after its receipt the company may have an opportunity to investigate and, if possible, adjust the damages. All the purposes which the notice could serve were served by the oral notice to the general agents. Suppose the case, not an unusual one, but a thing likely to arise daily, of an English company with an agency well-known and through which a policy was issued in this country, and a man, insured thereby, instead of directing his notice upon loss occurring to the office with which the business was transacted took it in his head for improper purposes desiring to defeat investigation to direct his notice to the head office in England.\nWhat would such a company say and the law hold relative to such conduct?\nI think notice was intended in such a case and in this case to be directed to the general agency in the province where the fire occurred. Such, undoubtedly, was what the company intended by this so-called condition.\nEven if, looking at the condition, oral evidence is not sufficient it is a complete answer to the plea as framed.\nLet us pass such technicality and get to the substance. Suppose a fire occurred next door to the head office of a company liable for the loss under a policy such as this.\nSuppose, further, the insured in half an hour called at the head office, saw the manager, explained the loss which had occurred and the manager wrote down in his books a record of the oral notice. Could the company plead in such a case want of written notice? Could not the insured point to the manager's own written record as a full answer? Suppose, following all that the happening of such dealings in relation to the loss as appear herein and the company had no other defence. I can hardly imagine such a defence successful. I certainly do not think the writing must of necessity be that of the insured or signed by him if framed so as to identify the parties concerned.\nThere is the purpose of the thing and reason for it to be considered.\nLet us consider further that the writing in this case was sent by wire. Is that sufficient? Can any one say if done by the appellants it was not in writing, but by wire, and the writing was not transmitted to the company? Where is the end to be of all such wretched subterfuges if we pass by the reason for the thing and the substantial purpose of the parties? I by no means wish to imply that there may not be cases of a writing being imperatively required by the hand of a named person as part of the contract.\nThe appellants claim the respondent estopped by reason of its inducing them to enter upon extensive and expensive inquiries and to an assent to the finding and apportionment of the loss implying thus a discharge pro tanto of each of the other companies. I think there is a great deal in the contention, but I doubt if the pleadings give the ground for either that or the claim of a binding adjustment or adjudication.\nAgain, can the appellants not be taken to have adopted the act of the agents and that adoption to relate back to the time the agents gave the written notice? I merely suggest that as a possibly fair inference from the facts knowing as matter of common knowledge how much the agents for insurance companies daily constitute themselves the agents of both parties for many things relative to the transaction of the business in hand. This point was not taken in argument and the appellants' case being well argued probably not enough in the evidence to maintain it. I, therefore, have not fully examined it.\nI think there is a complete answer to the whole contention furnished by section 2 of chapter 87 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, enabling the court to disallow such objection.\nThe section is identical with one in force in Ontario in whose legislature it originated as the result of a commission designed thirty-five years ago to put an end to the unjust advantages taken by virtue of such conditions as insurance companies saw fit to put upon their policies.\nThe fact that not a single case has arisen and been reported of such an attempt as this is pretty strong evidence that the profession and judges of that province and other provinces adopting the legislation have interpreted the section as a cure for such wrong as involved in permitting such a defence to prevail.\nNo such case has been cited and a diligent search by myself has not resulted in finding one.\nThe cases cited as decided in this court do not touch the point.\nThe statute in this second section is wide enough to cover any mistake of which this is one.\nMy only doubt has been as to its language relative to statement or proof of loss and that is wide enough when we have regard to the purview of the statute and especially the clauses of the condition relative to proofs of loss.\nI think No. 13 is intended to form a group of subject-matters designated by No. 14 as proofs of loss and so introduced by No. 12 on the same subject. It seems to me the remedial nature of the Act must also be borne in mind. Though this is a contract, it is one of which the Act in this regard has imposed the form and tried to limit its meaning.\nIts use is rendered imperative upon the companies and was designed to protect insurers, and hence requires we should interpret it as I have no doubt it has in practice and judicially been for a long time.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the courts below.\nAnglin J.\u2014To the appellants' claim to recover on an insurance policy for $4,000 on their stock, buildings and machinery the respondent company answers (a) that the policy was rendered void by the appellants' breach of statutory condition 10(f), exempting the insurers from liability for loss or damage occurring while gasoline is stored or kept on the premises without permission in writing from the insurers; and (6) that the appellants failed to give to the company the notice in writing required by statutory condition 13\nThe statutory conditions are found in the schedule to chapter 87 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902. They were printed on the policy issued to the appellants.\n(a) The appellants were an oil company and were notoriously dealers in gasoline and other petroleum products. This feature of their business was specially brought to the notice of the insurers through their agents at the time the risk was taken. If statutory condition 10(f) was applicable, and if the permission in writing of the company which it requires had not been obtained, it deprived the appellants of any insurance by the respondents, because the very keeping or storing of staple articles in which they dealt would exempt the insurers from all liability.\nThe description of the risk on the face of the policy contains the follow paragraph:\n$3,000. On stock, consisting chiefly of illuminating and lubricating oils, greases, paints, varnishes, and all other goods kept by them for sale, manufactured and in process, including advertising matter and all materials used in the manufacture, packing and shipping of same, their own or held in trust, or on commisssion, or sold but not removed, while contained in the above described building or on platforms on ground within 100 feet, or in cars within 100 feet of building.\nThe evidence, in my opinion (if indeed evidence of such a fact of common knowledge be necessary), establishes that gasoline is an illuminating oil within the meaning of that term in the above description. I think the words \"illuminating and lubricating\" should be read distributively, and that the insurance was not confined, as argued by counsel for the respondents, to such oils as were both illuminating and lubricating, but included all oils in the appellants' stock which were either illuminating or lubricating. But if gasoline was not within this part of the description it was undoubtedly within the other part, which reads,\nother goods kept by (the appellants) for sale, manufactured and in process.\nIt was part of the appellants' stock in trade when the general agents of the respondents, who prepared this description to insert in the policy, inspected the premises of the appellants for that purpose and, as already stated, their attention was then specially drawn to it. Unless we are to regard the policy as a nullity because of inconsistency between the description of the risk and condition 10(f), we must either discard that condition as voici for repugnancy\u2014something left in the document per incuriam\u2014or we must treat the policy containing this description as itself a permission in writing of the insurers for the insured to keep and store all goods covered by the description and a compliance with this requirement of condition 10(f). Because it does not involve the rejection of any part of the contract, I incline to think that the latter is the correct view.\nWhether on that ground or by rejecting the condition 10(f) for repugnancy, ut res magis valeat, we should uphold the policy and regard the insurance given by the appellants as real and not illusory. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the keeping and storing of gasoline on the appellants' premises did not exempt the insurers from liability. That was one of the very risks against which they insured the plaintiffs, and for which the policy itself embodied their written permission.\n(b) The appellants admittedly did not themselves give to the company notice of the loss in writing forthwith after the fire. The general agents of the company, however, immediately notified their principals of the loss by telegram. The company's adjuster on instructions from its agents at once prepared the particulars and other evidence of loss called for by articles (5) and (c) of the 13th condition and attended the insured and had them execute these documents and adjusted with them the amount of their claim. Until they delivered their statement of defence in this action no exception appears to have been taken by the company to these proofs or statements on the ground that the insured had failed to give the notice in writing called for by clause (a) of the 13th condition. It is, perhaps, doubtful whether they have in their plea set up want of notice in writing with the precision required by the Manitoba Judicature Rule 315(a). But in the view I take it becomes unnecessary to deal with this question of practice.\nOrdinarily I should not regard a notice such as is called for by clause (a) of the 13th condition as any part of the proofs of loss. But I find that other clauses of this 13th condition deal with what are unquestionably proofs of loss. Proofs of loss are first mentioned in clause 12 and the references to them are completed in clause 14. Clauses 12, 13 and 14 appear to be a fasciculus of provisions dealing with proofs of loss. Because of the collocation in which it is found, I have, though not without some hesitation, reached the conclusion that the requirement of a notice in writing under clause 13(a), is one of\nthe conditions * * ** as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire,\nreferred to in section 2 of the statute[10]. This is a case in which (in the language of section 2) after receiving a statement or proof of loss given in good faith by or on behalf of the insured in pursuance of a proviso or condition of the contract, the company has objected to the loss upon other grounds than for imperfect compliance with such conditions : it did not within a reasonable time after receiving such statement or proof notify the assured in writing that such statement or proof was objected to, giving the particulars of the alleged defects. Its officers had, through the telegram from its own agents, all the benefit which they could derive from a notice in writing given personally by the insured. They so conducted themselves that the insured may well have been lulled into the belief that the company would accept its agents' notification as a compliance with clause (a) of the 13th condition. The omission of the insured to give the notice in writing was obviously due to accident or mistake. This is, therefore, in my opinion, eminently a case in which it would be inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with the condition as to immediate notice in writing. The use in section 2 of the terms \"statement\" and \"proof\" indifferently and as interchangeable equivalents helps the conclusion that the notice in writing under clause 13(a) is part of the proof mentioned in section 2. It follows that the company's plea that the insured had failed to give this notice, assuming it to be formulated in compliance with rule 315(a) and to be proven, should not be deemed an answer to the plaintiff's claim. Section 2 of the statute renders the plea of want of notice in such circumstances ineffectual.\nOn these grounds I would, with respect, allow the plaintiffs' appeal with costs here and in the provincial Court of Appeal, and would direct the entry of judgment for them for the amount of their claim and costs of the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chapman & Green.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Richards, Affleck & Co.\n[1] 19 Man.

The company, pursuant to sections 158, 159 and 160 of the \"Railway Act,\" obtained from the Board of Railway Commissioners the approval of a plan, profile and book of reference, shewing the right-of-way as including part of the plaintiff's property, but at no point was the whole of the right-of- way upon this property; the greater part of it was on adjoining lands. The company caused the plan, etc., to be duly registered and, without resorting to arbitration, acquired the interest of plaintiff's landlord, and constructed their permanent way clear of that portion of the right-of-way which extended over the land in which the plaintiff was interested, keeping it upon the adjoining lands in which the plaintiff had no interest. The company consequently proposed to wait until the expiration of the plaintiff's lease before taking possession of the portion of the right-of-way in question and contended that they could not be compelled to make compensation for the portion of its right-of-way of which they had not actually taken possession, and that they were operating their railway without interfering with the plaintiff's enjoyment of his property. They gave no notice to treat and took no steps towards expropriating the plaintiff's rights. The property in question is situated in the townsite of Huntingdon, B.C., and, in virtue of permission to cross the highways granted by the Board of Railway Commissioners, the company constructed the railway across a public lane in rear of the plaintiff's property. The evidence shewed that, on one occasion, a projection from one of the company's trains damaged the fence and an outbuilding upon the plaintiff's property, the injury so caused being to the amount of $ 10.\nBy the judgment appealed from the plaintiff recovered judgment for $10 for the damages mentioned, and the company was directed forthwith to acquire the portion of the right-of-way shewn over the plaintiff's property and make compensation therefor under the provisions of the \"Railway Act. \"\nEwart K.C. for the appellants. The company is not bound immediately upon the filing, approval or registration of the plans, etc., to acquire, by purchase or expropriation, all the lands and interests in lands shewn to lie within the limits of the right-of-way. Unless they enter upon or injure the property they are not bound to take proceedings to acquire it or settle compensation under the \"Railway Act.\" They have constructed and are operating the railway without such entry or injury, they have done no wrong to the owner or occupant, and he cannot compel them to do him an injury in order that he may obtain compensation therefor. There is nothing to prevent the company permitting an owner or tenant remaining in possession of a portion of their right-of-way.\nThe \"Railway Act\" does not contemplate that a railway company should acquire a right-of-way of uniform width. See section 158. If it was contemplated that all the lands shewn on the plans should be acquired the provisions of section 164 requiring the filing of another plan when the railway is completed would be superfluous. See also 3 Edw. VII. ch. 58, sec. 128. The amendments, in 1909 (sec. 3), to subsection 2 of section 192 give the owner the remedy of forcing the company to take the lands and pay compensation whenever the plans have been filed.\nThe judgment appealed from is inconsistent with section 194 requiring an engineer's certificate that the land is necessary for the purposes of the railway, at the date of the certificate. There is nothing to shew that the lands in question in this case are so required; on the contrary, the fact that the railway is in operation without taking or interfering with these lands indicates that they are not required. If, under section 207, the company may decide not to take the lands mentioned in the notice, why may they not come to the same decision before any notice is given? We also refer to sections 151 and 155 as to alteration and discontinuance of works and the making of compensation. .By refraining from entering or interfering with the plaintiff's lands and allowing him to remain in possession for the unexpired term of his lease the company is carrying out the spirit of the Act.\nThere is no precedent for an action such as the present. The powers given to railway companies are permissive only and not compulsory. So long as the respondent remains in occupation, by lease or license, without injury to himself or to the public there can be no ground of complaint.\nWe rely upon the decisions in York and North Midland Railway Co. v. The Queen[1]; Scottish North Eastern Railway Co. v. Stewart[2]; The Queen v. Great Western Railway Co.[3].\nGeorge F. Martin for the respondent. We rely upon section 2, sub-sections 11 and 15, section 155 and section 237, sub-section 3, of the \"Railway Act.\" The cases of Corporation of Parkdale v. West[4], and Hendrie v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.[5], apply; and it is admitted that the lessee is in the same position as an owner of land.\nThe company have taken the lane in rear of the property and trespassed upon the property itself. The respondent is, therefore, entitled to compensation to be settled under the \"Railway Act.\" Section 158 of the Act does not contemplate the operation of a railway for years without acquiring the right-of-way. The company has acquired the fee from the owner, but insist that the tenant must await their pleasure. If the lease had 99 years to run, could they delay until it had expired?\nOn filing the plan mentioned in section 164 the company have the right to obtain forcible possession under sections 217 and 218. This clouds the title to the lands and prohibits improvements of a permanent nature or advantageous sale of the plaintiff's rights. When the company commenced the operation of the railway the right-of-way shewn on the plan must have been acquired; sections 192 and 193. The provisions of section 254, sub-section (a), are directory and must mean the whole right-of-way, not a zig-zag course. The railway fencing could not be done without interfering with the plaintiff's property. The amendment by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 3, was passed after the writ in this action was issued. Mandamus or direction to proceed to acquire the right-of-way is the proper remedy under the provisions of the \"Railway Act.\" Corporation of Parkdale v. West[6]; Bowen v. Canada Southern Railway Co.[7].\nEwart K.C. for the appellants.\nGeorge F. Martin for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by Sir Louis Davies. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014A very nice and difficult, question has been raised by the appellants in this case, namely, whether\" a railway company can at any time be compelled by law to have compensation assessed and paid to the owners of parcels of lands embraced within the \"located area\" of the approved plans deposited by them with the Railway Board and in the county registry offices and over or along which they have constructed their roadbed, when such construction does not physically cross or touch these parcels of lands.\nThe appellate court of British Columbia held in this case that under the circumstances existing at the time respondent made his application for a mandamus such a right existed in him with respect to his lands, they being embraced and included in the located area of the approved plans deposited with the Board and with the registrar of deeds for the county or district through which the line of railway passed, and the roadbed having been constructed and the road operated on the adjoining parcels of lands past plaintiff's lot within the railway \"located area.\"\nThe appellants contend that while they have the right to take the necessary proceedings to value any parcel of land embraced within the plans at any time after the latter's approval and registration has taken place, and the further right to take possession of any such lands upon payment or legal tender of the amount awarded, the right is purely optional, and that, with respect to lands within the located area not physically taken for the roadbed or touched by it, they cannot be forced or compelled to take the necessary proceedings to have compensation awarded whether their roadbed is completed past such lands or not. In other words, they contend that they can lay and run their railway along the lands embraced within their plans and can leave any one or more plots or parcels of land on either side of their rails and embankment, although within the area of the approved and filed plans, without taking the statutory steps to compensate the owner. They, of course, concede that they could not legally take physical possession of any part of any plot of land without first compensating the owner, but they contend that, if they can succeed in constructing their roadbed and laying their rails and running their road without touching any particular parcel of land within the located area, the owner of that parcel is powerless to compel them to take the compensation proceedings.\nThese propositions are, to say the least, a little startling. If the \"Railway Act\" permits a company to construct and run its road within and along a \"located area\" as to which their plans have been approved and registered, and compels them only to pay compensation to the owners of such plots of land within such located area as their roadbed has physically crossed, while permitting them to refuse compensation to the owners of such plots within such area as they have constructed their roadbed past, but have not physically touched, then a legislative wrong has been unintentionally committed. A cloud will have been placed on the owner's title; he will practically be unable to sell or utilize his lands as he might otherwise desire to do, and be helpless to have the wrong remedied. I cannot adopt such a construction of the statute.\nThe general scheme of the Act provides in section 157 for the fixing, subject to the approval of the Minister, of the general location of the proposed line of railway, shewing among other things the termini and the principal towns and places through which the railway is to pass.\nThen section 158 provides for the special and defined location and enacts that, when the provisions of section 157 are complied with, the\ncompany shall make a plan, profile and book of reference of the railway\nshewing a great many particulars, amongst them being\n(d) the property lines and owners' names; (e) the areas and length and width of land proposed to be taken, in figures, stating every change of width.\nSub-section 4 provides that\nthe book of reference shall describe the portion of land proposed to be taken in each lot to be traversed giving numbers of the lots and the area, length and width of the portion of each lot proposed to be taken, and the names of owners and occupiers so far as they can be ascertained.\nI take it as beyond doubt that the words \"traversed\" and \"taken\" apply in this sub-section to all the parcels of land within the located area, whether physically crossed by the company's roadbed or not. Sub-section 6 provides that\nthe plan, profile and book of reference may be of a section or sections of the railway.\nThe 159th and following sections provide for the sanction of the Board being given to such plan, profile and book of reference and for their deposit, when sanctioned, with the Board, and the deposit of copies in the offices of the registrars of deeds for the districts or counties through which the road passes; and the 168th section prohibits the commencement of construction until the plan, profile and book of reference have been so sanctioned by the Board and copies deposited with the registrars of deeds.\nThe practical effect of these sections is to delimit definitely the right-of-way of the company and to accurately fix and determine the areas, length and width of the lands proposed to be taken \"and the proportion of land proposed to be taken in each lot\" to be traversed and to give the company \"power to proceed at once with the construction of the railway.\"\nThe 191st section provides for a notice of the deposit of such plans being given and published after which the company may enter into voluntary agreements with any of the owners of the lands taken \"touching the same or the compensation to be paid therefore\"; and section 192 declares that the deposit of the plans, etc., and the notice of such deposit shall be deemed a general notice to all parties of the lands which will be required for the railway and works, and that the date of such deposit shall be the date with reference to which such compensation or damages shall be ascertained.\nAn amendment was made in 1909 to the latter part of section 192 providing that, if the company did not actually acquire title to the lands within one year from the date of such deposit, then the date of such acquisition should be the date with reference to which such compensation or damages should be ascertained.\nThis amendment does not, however, in my opinion, affect the question of the owner's right to compel the company in case the compensation cannot be voluntarily agreed upon to take the statutory steps to have it fixed by arbitration.\nThen follow sections 193 to 214 setting out the method or procedure with respect to the fixing of the compensation for the lands taken if not mutually agreed upon. The initiation of these proceedings lies with the company and, as I understand the argument submitted to us, it comes to this, that as the Act does not in the cases of disagreement as to the amount of compensation to be paid specifically confer on the owners of the lands taken power to initiate or bring about an arbitration to fix the damages, the company cannot be compelled to exercise its statutory powers of having an arbitration held for the purpose, and the owner, although his title had been clouded by the plan, profile and book of reference filed, and he himself practically denied the power of utilizing his lands for the purposes an owner may legitimately desire to do, must submit for just so long a time as the company determines. The argument is pressed in the case before us to the length of saying that even if the company by agreement or otherwise with some of the owners of these located lands is able to lay its rails along and across their lots past the lots of other owners, all being within the \"located area,\" and operate its railway on these rails, without encroaching upon the actual area of these latter parcels, the owners of these latter parcels within the \"located area\" must submit to go without compensation at the whim or caprice of the company, and are powerless to invoke the aid of the courts to compel the company to exercise its statutory powers of having the damages assessed. In short, the argument is that the lands within the \"located area\" are not necessarily to be compensated for, but only such lots or parcels as the roadbed physically touches. The 215th section declares that on payment or legal tender of the compensation or annual rent as awarded and agreed upon to the person entitled to receive it, the award or agreement shall vest in the company the power forthwith to take possession of the lands. I cannot, however, conceive it to be the true construction of the \"Railway Act\" to vest in the company the arbitrary powers of selecting which of the parcels of lands they have described in the located area for their railway right-of-way they shall have the compensation assessed for and which they can refuse unless they can get the lands on their own terms.\nThe depositing by the railway company of the approved plans with the Board and the registrars of the several counties through which the road is to pass, and the public notice given of such deposit vests a power in the company to take all the lands within the bounds of the located area of the right-of-way for the purposes of their road. It seems to me that if the company in the exercise of that power, either by agreement or arbitration, acquires the right to possession of some of the areas within their located right-of-way and then actually constructs their railway along and across those areas so acquired, their right to have compensation assessed as against the owners of other areas within the located area, which their railway has passed by but has escaped touching, at once ripens into a duty, which the injured owner can invoke the aid of the courts to have enforced.\nIf this is not so then it must be held that the company's caprice with regard to the parcels of land in the located area not physically crossed by their roadbed for which they must pay damages shall be the test of their liability to pay compensation, and that, although they have done everything required by the statute to delimit and fix the located area for their right-of-way, they can construct their roadbed in such way and manner that many parcels of land which they cannot obtain at their own price may be tied up in their owners' hands, the title clouded by the statutory action taken by the railway in placing the lands within the located area and the owners left without any remedy to compel a valuation and payment. Such a construction is, to say the least, very startling and would result in many cases in creating most grievous hardship. I have reached the conclusion that there is a stage in the progress of these statutory proceedings when the powers of the railway ripen into a duty and that the facts of the case now before us shew that .stage had been reached when the plaintiff began this action and entitled him to invoke the powers of the courts to compel the performance of that duty.\nIn the case now before us the determining factors are the approval in the first instance by the Minister of Railways of the general location of the defendant company's proposed line of railway. Secondly, the submitting by the company to the Board of Railway Commissioners of the plan, profile and book of reference of the located area. which included plaintiff's lands, and obtaining the Board's sanction to the same. Thirdly, the deposit with the Board of such approved plan, profile and book of reference, and of copies of the same in the offices of the registrars of deeds of the districts or counties through which the railway was to pass. Fourthly, the actual construction of such railway along the company's located right-of-way past and beyond but not touching physically plaintiff's lands.\nThe company's answer to the plaintiff's demand for compensation is that as it was able to construct its railway along its located right-of-way past the plaintiff's lot of land without physically touching his plot they cannot be compelled to initiate the compensation proceedings with respect to it.\nThese several acts by the defendant company, all of them done under the authority of the \"Railway Act,\" combine, in my judgment, to create a condition under which the defendant's statutory power to expropriate plaintiff's interest in the lands in question and have the compensation for such interest fixed by the arbitrators developed into a statutory duty of which the courts were competent to enjoin the performance. The language of the statute in conferring these powers, it is true, is not imperative, but the defendant's action may, in my opinion, at a certain stage make them so.\nWe have to choose between two interpretations of the statute, one leaving in the railway company an arbitrary discretion as to what lands within their located right-of-way they will pay compensation for, limited and controlled only by their ability so to construct their roadbed as to avoid trespassing physically upon areas or plots they do not desire to pay compensation for, or the interpretation I have adopted which is that, after the deposit of the approved plans with the Board and the registrars of the counties along the \"located right-of-way,\" and after the giving of the prescribed public notice of this having been done, and after the construction of the roadbed along and across such located area has actually taken place, the company can be compelled to take the statutory proceedings to have the damages assessed with respect to all lands within such located and approved right-of-way along and past which they have so constructed their roadbed, whether the roadbed physically touches any part of such lands or not. The statute is careful to guard against the railway being compelled to pay for the lands within the right-of-way before they are required, because it provides that the plans submitted to the Board for its approval may be of a section or sections of the railway only, and the construction of the Act I contend for as the correct one does not impose upon the company the duty of initiating the proceedings for compensation except with respect to lands within the located area of their right-of-way as far as they have constructed their roadbed.\nThe conclusion, therefore, I reach is that where construction has commenced and been carried on along the located line and to the extent to which such construction has been carried, there has been a statutory taking of all the lands within such located lines, and that all of the owners of such lands have by reason of such statutory taking become entitled to require proceedings to be taken for the assessment of their compensation or damages; that the option of paying one such owner and refusing to pay another is not vested in the company, and that the test is not whether an owner's lot within the located area has been physically touched by the constructed roadbed, but whether such roadbed has been constructed on the located area: past an owner's lot within such area. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant obtained an order from the Railway Commission approving under section 237 of the \"Railway Act\" of the plans filed by said company, and permitting construction in accordance therewith. It registered said plan and constructed said railway according thereto before this suit.\nThe right-of-way claimed by said plan and approved by said order covered part of the lands of which respondent was and is a lessee.\nThe appellant took no steps to acquire the title to said lands so leased, by giving notice to treat or obtaining an order for possession.\nThe railway track does not touch said lands, but passes so closely that a piece of timber on a passing car struck and damaged a fence or shed thereon.\nThe respondent sued for such damages and also to have a mandatory order issued directing the appellant to acquire said lands and compensate respondent therefor, so far as lying within the limits of said proposed right-of-way.\nThe case coming on for trial was disposed of, on statements of counsel as to the facts, by a judgment for ten dollars, to cover said damages, and ordering the appellant to proceed forthwith to acquire the right-of-way for their railway through and over lots 19 and 20, block 10, which includes the lands held by respondent as lessee, and pay him compensation he is entitled to by virtue of the \"Railway Act.\"\nOn appeal the Court of Appeal for British Columbia maintained the judgment and dismissed the appeal.\nI regret I cannot see my way to upholding the mandatory part of the said judgment.\nIt seems to me no legal relationship has arisen between the parties respecting said lands entitling any court to so direct as this judgment does, relative to the acquisition of said lands or compensation therefor.\nIn the absence of a notice to treat or any other basis in way of contract, there is no such contractual relation created as to warrant such interference.\nNor can I see any other obligation in law springing from what has transpired to form a basis of action for such adjudication.\nThe statute neither expressly nor impliedly asserts any such thing by way of creating a right in respondent.\nThe conduct of appellant, in refraining from living up to the spirit of what the Commission, in making the order permitting the construction, probably anticipated would be done, may be improper.\nIt may render the appellant liable to such proceedings as the Board of Railway Commissioners in discharge of their duties relative to public safety may see fit to take.\nIt does not, however, give to the respondent any special and personal right peculiar to him apart from the rest of the public.\nIt is, in a loose sort of way alleged, that the railway has been constructed along or across a lane in such a way as to injuriously affect the respondent's property.\nI am not able on the meagre facts presented relative to this branch of the case made by the pleadings to see how we can give any relief on that score.\nI am not sure that any relief in law is possible.\nSo far as it appears it may be that the appellant has acted entirely within its rights in law and injured no more than necessarily incidental to the exercise of its powers.\nIt may, on the other hand, have brought itself within the range of what is contemplated by section 155 of the \"Railway Act,\" which has not been passed upon by this court in any case I can find.\nSo far as judicial authority goes the railway company may in constructing and running its road, or at all events the latter, do much detrimental to others for which no compensation can be claimed.\nI am not prepared, however, to say, that no case can be made for claim to damages arising from obstructing and impeding the entrance to any part of an owner or lessee's property.\nProbably this part of the case of the lessee has merely been alleged in the pleading on the supposition that the claim for mandamus, if tenable, would cover the whole, and substantially give full relief.\nWithout expressing any opinion on the legal merits of such a claim or that our present judgment may be pleaded by way of res judicata thereto, I think, as the respondent may be justified in overlooking it under the circumstances, he ought to be given, if he desires it, the opportunity to strike it out of his pleading if he thinks our refusal to maintain the mandatory order can be treated as relative thereto res judicata.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct that the judgment be set aside and the claim for mandamus covered thereby be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the appeal should be allowed and for the reasons given by my brother Idington.\nAnglin J.\u2014Notwithstanding that the defendants appear to have used their statutory powers in a manner which I find it impossible to conceive that Parliament contemplated, I fear that the present action must fail. Apart from the injury to his fence, which is admitted and in respect of which he has been allowed $10 as damages, the plaintiff has not shewn that his lands have been \"injuriously affected\" by the construction of the defendants' railway. He has not established a case of interference with access to and from his property by the lane in question. He has not shewn that this lane has actually been taken by the company as part of its right-of-way. Without a specific order for the closing or diversion of a highway the mere approval of a location plan, which shews it to be included in the projected right-of-way, does not warrant its being closed to traffic by a railway company. If it were duly closed and were actually taken as part of the right-of-way it may well be that the company would be obliged to fence it off from the adjoining property under section 254(a). There is no evidence that it has been so closed or taken. The only order of the Railway Board produced, gives to the company merely a right to cross the lane\u2014not a right to close it or divert it. An order merely authorizing the crossing of a highway does not confer the right to close it or the right to fence it off or otherwise to interfere with the access to it of the public or of adjoining property owners. It has been held in many cases that the mere laying of a railway upon a public highway does not give a right to compensation to the property owners whose property adjoins such highway. Powell v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.[8].\nAssuming that the construction of the defendants' railway and its operation where it passes the plaintiff's property with a narrower right-of-way than that shewn upon the location plan and sanctioned by the Railway Board involved \"a change, alteration or deviation\" prohibited by section 168 of the Act, because the steps prescribed by section 167 had not been taken, and that such construction and operation were, therefore, illegal, the plaintiff has entirely failed to give evidence of any special damage such as he would have to prove to entitle him to an injunction restraining the operations of the defendants if he had in other respects made out a case for such relief. At the trial he tacitly disclaimed any special damage except as to the injury to his fence valued at $ 10 already referred to. Moreover, in his statement of claim he has not asked that the operation of the defendants' railway be enjoined as a nuisance, and at the opening of the trial his counsel defined his claim in these words:\nThis is an action to compel the railway company to take lots 19 and 20 in the town-site of Huntingdon.\nThe proceedings which followed, consisting merely of statements by the opposing counsel to the presiding judge, make it clear that the only relief sought by the plaintiff was a mandatory order requiring the defendants to take statutory steps for the expropriation of his interest in the portions of the above lots included in their right-of-way as shewn on their location plan and to make him compensation for the interest so to be taken. In order to grant the plaintiff any other relief his action must be entirely re-cast and inferences of the existence of certain conditions and of special damage must be drawn without evidence to support them. I think it impossible that this should be done at the present stage of the litigation.\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Idington I am of the opinion that the mandatory order granted to the plaintiff in the provincial courts cannot be maintained. However far the appellants may have departed from the spirit, and indeed from the letter, of the provisions of the \"Railway Act\"\u2014however grossly they may have abused their statutory powers, I find no basis on which to rest an adjudication that they have established between themselves and the plaintiff a relationship such that from it flows a duty on their part to acquire his interest in the property in question which the courts may enforce by mandamus. I reach this conclusion with regret, because the conduct of the defendants seems to me to have been high-handed and most objectionable.\nAlthough, in a proper case and upon proper evidence, it may be that the plaintiff would not be entirely without relief, the circumstances of this case appear to me to make it reasonably clear that legislation is desirable expressly empowering the Board of Railway Commissioners, when approving a location plan, to fix either a period within which the railway company must acquire or abandon the lands included in its right-of-way as shewn thereon, or after which the notices mentioned in section 193 shall be conclusively deemed to have been given, and, whether the Board has or has not fixed such a period when sanctioning the location plan, on the application of the owner of any such land at any time thereafter to fix such a period in respect of his property. The amendment of 1909 enabling the property owner, where notice to treat (section 193) has been given to him but has not been followed up by the company, himself to apply for the appointment of arbitrators, etc., does not provide for what is a case of real hardship, viz., the inclusion by a railway company in its projected right-of-way, as shewn upon a location plan, of lands in respect of which it unreasonably postpones the giving of notice to treat, although by the registration of the sanctioned location plan the owners of all lands within the located right-of-way are practically prevented from selling them or using them to any ad- vantage. Where the company has not only filed the location plan, but proceeds to construct and operate its lines without acquiring some of the land included in its right-of-way as shewn on the location plan the hardship to which the owner of such land is subjected is still greater. It may be that in the latter case the land-owner can obtain some indirect and not very satisfactory relief by way of injunction or otherwise; but in the former, under the present legislation, he appears to be entirely without relief.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacNeill, Bird, Macdonald & Bayfield.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George E.

VII. c. 21, ss. 4 and 11\u2014Building erected by lessee\u2014Liability of \"owner \" Section 4 of the \"Alberta Mechanics' Lien Act\" (6 Edw. VII. ch. 21) gives to any contractor or materialman furnishing labour or materials for a building at the request of the owner of the land a lien on such land for the. value of such labour or materials. Sub-section 4 of section 2 provides that the term \"owner\" shall extend to and include a person having any estate or interest \"in the land upon or in respect of which the \u03bbvork is done or materials are placed or furnished at whose request and upon whose credit or on whose behalf or with whose privity or consent or for whose direct benefit any such work is done, etc.\" By section 11 \"every building * * * mentioned in the fourth section of this Act, constructed upon any lands with the knowledge of the owner or of his authorized agent * * * shall be held to have been constructed at the request of such owner,\" unless the latter gives notice within three days after acquiring such knowledge that he will not be responsible.\nThe lessee of land, as permitted by his lease, had buildings thereon pulled down and proceeded to erect others in their place, but was obliged to abandon the work before it was finished. The owner of the land was aware of the work being done but gave no notice disclaiming responsibility therefor. Mechanics' liens having been filed under the Act:\nHeld, that the interest of the owner in the land was subject to such liens.\nJudgment appealed from, varying that at the trial (2 Alta. L.r. 109) in favour of the lienholders, affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, affirming, with some, variation, the judgment of Beck J.[1], at the trial, by which the respondents' action was maintained with costs.\nThe appellant was the registered owner of property used as a hotel in the Town of High River, Alta., which he leased to persons named Anderson and Skead for a term of years, giving the lessees an option to purchase the property within a time limited and granting them permission to remove certain buildings constructed on the land and build others in their stead. The lessees took possession of the premises and, pursuant to the terms of the lease, removed several of the buildings then on the land and proceeded to construct new ones, but, after they had been partially constructed the tenants failed in business, the building operations were discontinued and the appellant reentered the demised premises for breach of the covenant to pay rent. The respondents filed mechanics' liens against the property for work and labour done and materials furnished in constructing the new buildings and instituted actions against the owner and his lessees to enforce their liens, these actions being, subsequently, consolidated by order of a judge. The principal ground of defence urged by the appellant was that the liens claimed attached only to the interest of the lessees, which had determined, and that his interest as owner could not, in the circumstances, be affected by the charges sought to be imposed under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" of the Province of Alberta.\nAt the trial, Beck J. held that the appellant's title was affected to the extent to which the improvements made had benefited his property, and, by the judgment appealed from, the full court in effect affirmed the judgment of the trial judge but varied it by declaring that the estate of the owner was liable generally for the claims for which the liens were sought to be enforced.\nPerron E.C. for the appellant.\nBennett E.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reason that, as the trial judge found, the appellant, owner of the property, allowed the improvements in connection with which the mechanic's lien arises to be made without notice or protest.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Appeal Court of Alberta delivered by Mr. Justice Harvey, and to which I do not desire to add anything, I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014In this appeal arising out of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta to enforce mechanics' liens under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" of that province, otherwise known as chapter 21 of the statutes of that province for 1906, there is nothing involved but the construction of sections 4 and 11 of that Act.\nSub-section 4 of section 2 declares a lien in favour of every contractor and sub-contractor, and other named classes furnishing labour or material of the classes specified \"at the request of the owner of such land.\"\nSub-section 4 of that section declares that the terra \"owner\" shall extend to and include a person having any estate or interest, etc.,\nin the land upon or in respect of which the work is done or materials are placed or furnished at whose request and upon whose credit or on whose behalf or with whose priority or consent or for whose direct benefit any such work is done or materials are placed or furnished, etc.\nSection 11 declares\nevery building, etc., mentioned in the fourth section of this Act, constructed upon any lands with the knowledge of the owner or his authorized agent, or the person having or claiming any interest therein, shall be held to have been constructed at the request of such owner, etc., unless such owner, etc., shall within three days after he shall have obtained knowledge of the construction, alteration or repair give notice that he will not be responsible for the same,\nin manner specified.\nThe owner here in question is admitted to have known and to have omitted to give any such notice.\nI am unable to understand how on such clear and explicit language declaring he must in such case be held to have requested the construction for which a lien is created on certain things having been done, could ever have given rise to difficulty.\nThe proviso at the end of section four limiting the charge to the interest of the owner and the definition of the word \"owner\" have been made a source of confusion.\nNeither of these conflict with the plain, imperative language of the remaining parts of this section 4, and are left operative in proper cases to which they respectively may be applicable. The owner's interest has been herein properly reached.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The question for determination in this appeal is the liability of the interest of the owner of leased land to a mechanic's lien in favour of a contractor employed by the lessee. It is conceded that the work done upon the land is such as would entitle the plaintiff to a lien under section 4 of the Alberta \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" (6 Edw. VII. ch. 21), if done at the request of the owner. By section 11 it is provided that every such work if\nconstructed upon any lands with the knowledge of the owner or his authorized agent or the person having or claiming any interest therein, shall be held to have been constructed at the request of such owner or person having or claiming any interest therein,\nunless, within three days after obtaining knowledge of the construction, he gives notice that he will not be responsible for the same, etc.\nThe knowledge by the owner of the construction and his failure to give the statutory notice are admitted. The contention for the appellants is that the word \"owner\" in section 11 is subject to the defining provision contained in sub-section 4 of section 2. Apart from the fact that in this sub-section it is provided not that the word \"owner\" shall \"mean,\" but only that it shall \"extend to and include,\" a person, having any estate, etc., it is obvious from a mere perusal of section 11 that the definition of \"owner\" in sub-section 4 of section 2, as a person at whose request and upon whose credit, or on whose behalf, etc., work is done, can have no application to that section which provides that in certain circumstances a build- ing, not constructed at the request, etc., of the owner shall, nevertheless, be deemed to have been constructed at his request. The context in section 11 precludes the application to it of the definition of the word \"owner\" in section 2, sub-section 4. I have no doubt that section 11 was intended to provide for just such a case as the present.\nThe judgment in appeal was, in my opinion, entirely correct and should be affirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 2 Alta.

Save by statements and admissions which do appear of record we know nothing of it.\nThese make it, however, quite clear that the respondents never acquired any permanent rights of property in appellants' land; that the work of construction, so far as grading and ties, was either done by or at the expense of appellants, and the iron placed thereon at the expense of respondents; that the appellants pay a rental for the use of the iron; that the respondents had the right to shunt cars from their track over this siding; and that the whole arrangement is terminable at any time by either party.\nThe appellants gave the following letter to agents now alleged by some one, but not proven, to be part owners of land to which it is now proposed to extend said siding.\nMessrs. Berry & Bond, June 22, 1908.\nCity.\nDear Sirs,\u2014With reference to your application for right-of-way over our land, on the C.N.R. spur, we are perfectly willing to grant this.\nArrangements can be made later.\nYours very truly,\nThe Blackwood's Limited,\n(per N. W. B.). It was stated before the Board, and not denied, that the party who was about to buy at the time when this letter was written failed to complete the expected purchase.\nThe party who has since acquired the property and moved the respondents to make the application now in question, did so in 1909, sometime not exactly stated, but as result of negotiations begun in the early part of said year, 1909.\nThe Board made an order giving leave to extend the said siding or spur from the point where it ends on the appellants' property to another point on the said property, acquired as just stated and as shewn on a plan\nfor the purpose of furnishing railway facilities to the owner of the said last mentioned lot.\nThe appellants by leave appeal against said order on the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction to make the said order.\nThe Board finds as a fact that the party who bought last mentioned land as an industrial site and upon whose behalf or for whose benefit the application now in question was made, relied upon the said letter in making his purchase.\nIt is quite clear that the Board founds its jurisdiction upon that fact. Two clear implications spring from this.\nOne is that the siding or spur was not in the view of the Board part of the railway. If it had been, then the Board needed no such authority to provide for and direct an extension, but could and would have rested solely on the \"Railway Act.\"\nThe other is that but for the said letter the Board did not conceive it had, on the facts, any jurisdiction. The first implication just stated, is what I would have been inclined to infer, notwithstanding Mr. Chrysler's ingenious suggestion, that the siding being used by the respondents, must be taken or presumed to have been constructed under the Act and to have formed part of the railway.\nBut the first of said implications rebuts if necessary any such presumption and effectually disposes of its results.\nIn the second implication I cannot think that the Board had any jurisdiction over the parties to enforce specific performance, as it were, of rights springing from the letter, however much that might or might not bear upon the compensation to be fixed in case of expropriation.\nAs to this I am not to be supposed as expressing any view much less that the letter should affect that compensation. I merely wish to point out the only conceivable result the letter in any way can by any possibility have on the questions involved herein.\nThis brings me to the crucial test of authority in the Board to make the order. The order is made for the express purpose of furnishing facilities. It would be no facility if its operation ended at a point ninety feet within the appellant's grounds.\nThe order clearly implies the giving of authority to run over the appellants' siding.\nWith great respect, I cannot read the letter above quoted as having any such consequences as thus implied even if as fact found by the Board which I must observe the purchaser of an industrial site bought on faith thereof.\nHis buying on faith thereof cannot confer upon the respondents any right to construct and operate a branch railway or spur over a mere private siding to serve the rest of the industrial community.\nThe doing so would be clearly ultra vires.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The Blackwoods are owners of land adjoining the line of the Canadian Northern Railway Company at Winnipeg. In the year 1907, under an arrangement between them and the railway company, a spur-track was constructed upon their land connected with the railway; and by the terms of the agreement the railway company were to supply them and did supply them with facilities for receiving and delivering freight. The agreement is not in evidence, but from the uncontradicted statements made at the hearing it is clear that the expense of construction was borne by the Blackwoods with the exception of the actual laying of the rails which was borne by the railway company; that the railway company retained the ownership of the rails for which the Blackwoods pay an annual rental; that the spur was constructed for the purpose of providing facilities for the Black-woods and that the railway company acquired no permanent rights in the land, and, indeed, no rights in it of any kind except such as might be implied in their obligation to carry out the provisions of the agreement.\nIt was not disputed on the argument that the spur-track was constructed solely under the authority of this agreement, and I think that is the necessary result of what occurred at. the hearing. After the delivery of judgment it is true the Chief Commissioner stated that he would make no finding upon the question of fact whether in respect of this spur the provisions of section 222 of the \"Railway Act\" had been complied with, and he also expressly stated that he did not understand that any admission upon the point had been made. Since, however, the Blackwoods in their answer to the railway company's application expressly alleged the non-observance of the requirements of section 222 the onus of shewing that these requirements had been observed would appear to have been upon the railway company unless some presumption in their favour can be held to arise from the construction and use of the track since the year 1907. No such presumption does, in my opinion, arise because it appears to me to be clear that in such a case as this, reading sub-section 5 of section 317 with section 226, no warrant other than that of the arrangement between the parties themselves would be necessary to authorize the furnishing of such facilities as those provided under the agreement mentioned. Sub-section 5 indeed is perhaps little more than a confirmation by the legislature of the decision of this court in Canadian Northern Railway Co, v. Robinson[1], which affirmed the validity of such an arrangement in the absence of any special sanction by the Board of Railway Commissioners. Since, then, the authority of the Board under sections 221-223 was not in this case needed, there is no presumption arising from the construction and operation of the work that this authority was obtained. The spur-track upon the land of the Blackwoods is therefore to be treated as a private siding or private branch owned by them and worked so far as it is worked by the railway under the authority of a special agreement with the Blackwoods to provide them with shipping facilities. The question which on this state of facts comes before this court is this: Has the Board of Railway Commissioners the power to authorize the railway company to extend this spur-track from its present terminus on the Blackwoods's property into property situated beyond that of the Blackwoods for the purpose of providing others with the same sort of facilities as those which the Blackwoods enjoy without first acquiring, by expropriation or otherwise, from the Blackwoods the property or additional rights of user in the existing spur-track. The Board of Railway Commissioners has held the jurisdiction to exist and has exercised it. The assumed basis of jurisdiction is, I think, neatly put by the Chief Commissioner in the course of the discussion in these words: \"We are treating this spur as the railway.\" If this spur can properly be treated as part of the railway for all purposes within the meaning of sections 221, 222 and 226 there is jurisdiction unquestionably to make the order the Board has made. On the other hand it seems to be equally clear that it is a condition of the jurisdiction that the spur should appear to be of this character. I am not able, with great respect, to agree with the opinion of the Chief Commissioner, although the question is certainly not free from difficulty.\nThe strong point in favour of the Chief Commissioner's view appears to be that by sub-section 21 of section 2 of the \"Railway Act\"[2], \"railway\" is for the purpose of the Act defined in these terms:\n(21) \"Railway\" means any railway which the company has authority to construct or operate, and includes all branches, sidings, stations, depots, wharves, rolling stock, equipment, stores, property real or personal and works connected therewith, and also any railway bridge, tunnel, or other structure which the company is authorized to construct.\nIf we are to treat the word \"railway\" wherever it appears in the Act as always and for all purposes denoting the whole and every part of this definition then the argument is prim\u00e0 facie at all events a forcible one that this spur-track being a branch or siding connected with a \"railway which the company has authority to construct or operate\" is by the terms of this definition a part of the railway. The courts have often, however, taken occasion to observe that there is some danger that this method of applying an interpretation clause in an Act of Parliament dealing variously with a large range of subjects may lead to results out of conformity with the intention of the legislature and that the particular provision in respect of which it is proposed to apply the definition must be carefully examined to see whether such an application of it may not defeat the obvious purpose of the provision itself; and this is recognized in the main enacting clause of section 2. Coming to sections 221, 222 and 226, section 221 authorizes the construction of branch lines \"from the main line of the railway or from any branch thereof.\" It is not open to doubt that what this provision contemplates is the construction of lines which are not only physically connected with the main line of the railway, but which may be operated in connection with the main line. In this view there would appear to be very little difference between a branch line so called which should be wholly en l'air in reference to the main line or any of its branches, and a branch (so called) which should connect itself with the main line only through an intervening link of track over which the proprietors of the railway should have no rights to run their trains. Nor do I see any-substantial distinction between this latter case and the case in which, as in that before us, there are rights to use the intervening track for a limited purpose only which does not include that of passing traffic over it originating at or destined to points on the so-called branch. The same observations apply to section 226. In the absence of consent by the Blackwoods it follows from this that the authority needful to sustain the order is lacking, unless, indeed, we are entitled to act upon the theory that the Blackwoods's rights in this spur-track and in the land upon which it is constructed (which include, of course, the right to exclude from the use of it all persons who have no legal title to use it) may under the authority of the \"Railway Act\" be taken from them without compensation. The Chief Commissioner in his opinion expressly states that the Act confers upon the Board no authority to assess compensation in respect of the rights of user which the order assumes may be exercised by the railway company and the persons for whom the railway company desires to provide facilities. Among canons of statutory construction none, I think, is more important than that which declares the legislature to be presumed, not to intend to take away private rights without compensation; and I know of nothing in the \"Railway Act\" which excludes the application of it. It must, of course, yield where an intention to abrogate or limit the principle is clearly expressed or implied, but it may, I think, be taken to be a general principle of the \"Railway Act\" that a railway company governed by the Act can only acquire the property of private persons or rights of user in respect of such property either by putting in motion the machinery provided by the compulsory clauses of the Act or by agreement, and sections 222 and 224 seem to shew conclusively that this principle, as one would expect, applies to the construction and operation of branch lines as well as to the main line. I do not understand, therefore, on what principle it can be held that without proceeding under the compulsory clauses of the Act, and without the consent of the Blackwoods, the railway company can acquire the right to use this spur as a part of the proposed branch.\nIt is contended, however, and the contention has been accepted by the Board, that the Blackwoods are by reason of their conduct precluded from denying that rights of user over this spur have been acquired by Mr. Hugh Sutherland for whose benefit the proposed extension is now applied for. A certain letter written by the Blackwoods, on the 22nd of June, 1908, was held by the Chief Commissioner to have been reasonably relied upon by Mr. Sutherland as containing a representation by the Blackwoods of their willingness to permit the use of their spur for the purpose of affording the facilities desired and that Mr. Sutherland purchased the property in respect of which it is proposed to grant the facilities on the strength of this letter. It was held that the effect of this was to preclude the Blackwoods from objecting to the order applied for. In so far as this conclusion of the Chief Commissioner involves a finding of fact, I do not think it is open to be questioned in this court. In so far as it involves a conclusion upon a question of law which was made the foundation of the Board's jurisdiction it is, I think, subject to be reviewed; the Board can- not acquire jurisdiction through an erroneous decision upon a point of law. I am unable to agree with the Chief Commissioner that the legal effect of these findings of fact is such as to preclude the Blackwoods from opposing the application. I repeat that I take the findings to be that the letter in question was communicated to Mr. Sutherland and that he reasonably acted upon it in purchasing the property mentioned. The legal effect of this upon the position of the Blackwoods appears to me to be absolutely nil. The letter is not addressed to Mr. Sutherland, but I shall assume\u2014 as I think we must in view of the finding of the Board assume\u2014that it might reasonably be taken to have been given to the agents for the information of intending purchasers of the property.\nThe argument on this assumption is that this letter contains representations that the Blackwoods will not insist on their legal rights in respect of this spur and that these representations they are bound to make good to the person who acted on the faith of them. Now, that contention can only be sustained upon one of two views respecting the construction of the letter. One of these alternatives is that the letter contains some misrepresentation as to some state of facts alleged to exist at the time it was written upon which Mr. Sutherland acted. If such be the construction of the letter then equities in Mr. Sutherland's favour might arise. But where is the representation of fact? The only representation of fact actually existing relates to the then existing state of the Blackwoods's intentions. Nobody suggests that there is any misrepresentation here\u2014that is to say, nobody suggests that the Blackwoods in writing the letter did not sincerely express the state of their minds in the matter \u2014that in other words, they were committing a very stupid and motiveless fraud.\nWe may then put aside any suggestion that the appellants can rest upon estoppel or misrepresentation of fact. What is left? The construction put upon the document by the Board and by Mr. Sutherland was that it was a representation that the Black-woods \"were,\" to quote the words of the Chief Commissioner,\nperfectly willing to grant an application for the right-of-way for the extension of this spur.\nNow, that is a representation of intention de futuro which juridically can only take effect ex contract\u00fb. It is binding as a promise or not at all. I shall not labour the authorities which shew that the supposed equitable doctrine of making representations good has, apart from estoppel or contract, no place in English law. Jorden v. Money[3]; Maddison v. Alderson[4], at pages 472, 473, 487, 491, 492; Chadwick v. Manning[5].\nThe Board has not found a contract between the parties and there appear to be insuperable difficulties in the way of doing so. It is necessary in this connection to call attention to one point only. The letter plainly indicates that the terms of any arrangement entered into pursuant to it are to be left for further settlement; and there could, of course, be no completed vinculum juris until these terms had been agreed upon. I think, therefore, that this supposed foundation of the Board's jurisdiction fails in point of law. Anglin J.\u2014The material facts are fully stated in s the opinion of my brother Idington in whose conclusions I concur.\nUnless the order in appeal authorizes the use of the existing siding in connection with the extension of it. for which it provides the new construction would be merely of a detached piece of railway. At bar the order was treated (I think properly having regard to the statement that the extension authorized was \"for the purpose of furnishing railway facilities\" to the applicant) as involving the taking by the respondents for the purposes of their railway of the appellants' existing siding, without their consent and without expropriation or compensation.\nThe letter in evidence neither expresses nor implies a consent to this being done.\nIt has, I think, been clearly shewn that the existing siding is the private property of the appellants. Neither authority for its construction as part of, nor an order for its connection with, the respondents' railway has been produced. The case has proceeded on the assumption that no such authority or order exists.\nThe order in appeal is, in my opinion, beyond the jurisdiction of the Railway Board.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Elliott, Macneil & Deacon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Clark & Sweatman.\n[1] 37 Can.

J., at the trial, and maintaining the respondents' (plaintiffs') action with costs.\nOne Bennett purchased lands from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., on deferred payments, and received a contract from the company agreeing to convey the lands to him, on completion of the payments, with a proviso that no assignment of his interest should be effectual unless approved by the company. B. transferred the land in fee to the Sawyer & Massey Co., which applied to the railway company for the approval of the transfer, and the approval was refused on account of the conveyance not being of B.'s equitable interest only. J. D. McLeod, having knowledge of the transaction between B. and the S. & M. Co., subsequently procured an assignment of the same lands from B. to M. J. M., in proper form and, by fraudulent artifices and criminal acts, secured the approval thereto of the railway company. An action by the S. & M. Co. against all the other parties to set aside the conveyance to M. J. M. was dismissed at the trial, by Chief Justice Wetmore. By the judgment appealed from the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan reversed this decision, Lamont J. dissenting, and held that the clause in the agreement requiring the approval of the railway company affected only the position between the vendor and the purchaser, B., that the assignments by B., without such approval, created equitable estates or interests in the land in his assignees, which would result equally from a conveyance in fee; consequently, that the equities, as between the S. & M. Co. and M. J. M., being equal the approval of the railway company gave M. J. M. the better equitable estate. However, all the circumstances being taken into consideration, the approval fraudulently obtained could not give M. J. M. any better position in equity than if it had never been obtained; therefore, the S. & M. Co.'s equitable estate being first in point of time should prevail, and they had the right to question the means by which such approval was obtained and to shew that it was improperly obtained.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, the court reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAppeal dismissed with costs:\nChrysler K.C. and W.

The evidence showed that deceased was riding on the front platform of the car which was, at the time of the accident, running at the rate of three or four miles an hour; that, on approaching a switch, the car jolted and deceased was thrown off the platform underneath the wheels; that the doors of the car were open and were not protected by bars or other devices to secure the protection of passengers. The jury returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff and for $3,500 damages.\nThe trial judge set this verdict aside on the ground that no actionable negligence on the part of the company had been proved, and entered judgment dismissing the action.\nBy the judgment appealed from this judgment was reversed on the ground that there was some evidence before the jury to support their finding of negligence against the company and also their finding against contributory negligence.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of both parties on the appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment, and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellants.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. for the respondent.\n[1] 15 B.C. Rep. 429.\n"}

(Cf. \u201cRegina Rates Case,\" 44 Can. S.C.R. 328, where this case was followed by Anglin J., and 45 Can. S.C.R. at pp. 323 to 328.)\nAPPEAL by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, from an order of the board, dated 26th April, 1910, respecting the operation of the trains on the Gatineau Branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nOn the 26th of April, 1910, on the application of certain residents of the City of Ottawa residing for the Summer seasons at various points of the branch line of the railway in question, ordered that, during the period from the 1st of May to the 1st of October in each year, the company should operate all its passenger trains, both north-bound and south-bound, on its Gatineau Branch, from and to a point at or near Sappers' Bridge, in the City of Ottawa, and furnish adequate and suitable accommodation for receiving and delivering passengers at that point.\nOn an application by the railway company for leave to appeal from the order, upon questions of law, leave to appeal was granted by the board, subject to and upon terms that the appeal should be prosecuted with expedition, but the order granting such leave did not state a case in writing submitting for the opinion of the court any question which, in the opinion of the board, was a question of law.
