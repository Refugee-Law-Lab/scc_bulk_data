Farley\nCollection\nSupreme Court Judgments\nDate\n1968-01-23\nReport\n[1968] SCR 150\nJudges\nMartland, Ronald; Judson, Wilfred; Ritchie, Roland Almon; Hall, Emmett Matthew; Spence, Wishart Flett\nOn appeal from\nManitoba\nSubjects\nTorts\nDecision Content\nSupreme Court of Canada\nCity of Brandon v. Farley, [1968] S.C.R. 150\nDate: 1968-01-23\nThe City of Brandon (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nKimbell Russell Roy Farley (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1967: November 6; 1968: January 23.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nNegligence\u2014Invitor and invitee\u2014Plaintiff carrying on business of purchasing water from defendant for resale\u2014Accumulation of ice at doorway of defendant\u2019s premises resulting from spillage of water in freezing temperatures\u2014Plaintiff injured in fall\u2014Whether an unusual danger\u2014Knowledge of danger by plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, an invitee, brought an action for damages for injuries he sustained when he fell on the ice covered sills of a doorway leading into the east side of the defendant city\u2019s fire hall. The plaintiff had for many years carried on the business, along with a number of others, of purchasing water from the city for resale to farmers in the outlying districts, and for this he used a truck with a 500-gallon tank on it which he brought to the east side of the fire hall stopping it with its back opposite the doorway just south of which there was a pipe with a hose extension through which the water was delivered. The accident occurred on a day when the weather was cold and snow was blowing. Shortly before 4 p.m. the plaintiff backed his truck up according to his practice, inserted the hose into the tank and then entered the building through the doorway. As he came in he noticed that the sills were covered with an accumulation of ice which had gathered there from the spillage of water while filling the tanks. A few minutes later the plaintiff left through the door by which he had entered and in so doing he slipped on the ice and fell approximately 42 inches to the ground below suffering serious injuries to his left shoulder and thigh.\nThe trial judge found that the danger presented by the ice at the doorway was not an unusual one and that the plaintiff knew and fully appreciated it, but the Court of Appeal found the danger to be an unusual one and held that the defendant was negligent in failing to remove the ice and apply sand at the entrance. The Court of Appeal further found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence and assessed the liability to the extent of one-third against the plaintiff and two-thirds against the defendant, as a result of which damages were awarded to the plaintiff in the amount of $19,076.10. An appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nThe plaintiff was a member of a class whose business in obtaining water from the city exposed them to the hazard in winter-time created by ice accumulating on the door sills from the spillage of water. This danger was not an unusual one for persons of that class and indeed it was one which was to be expected by those engaged in the transfer of water in freezing temperatures. The plaintiff had knowledge of the actual danger at the place where he fell because he had entered and left through the doorway twice on the very day of the accident and had entered over the ice only five or six minutes before his fall.\nThe duty owed by an occupier to an invitee as defined by Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames (1866), L.R. 1 C.P. 274, is predicated upon the existence of an unusual danger on the occupier\u2019s premises and the finding that the damage in the present case was not caused by such a danger was a complete answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nCampbell v. Royal Bank of Canada, [1964] S.C.R. 85, distinguished; London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton, [1951] A.C. 737, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], setting aside a judgment rendered at trial by Hall J. Appeal allowed.\nF.O. Meighen, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nA.C. Hamilton, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1 which set aside a judgment rendered at trial by Mr. Justice Hall whereby he dismissed the respondent\u2019s action claiming damages for injuries which he sustained when he fell on the ice covered sills of a doorway leading into the east side of the City of Brandon fire hall. The learned judge found that the danger presented by the ice at the doorway was not an unusual one and that the respondent knew and fully appreciated it, but the Court of Appeal found the danger to be an unusual one and held that the appellant was negligent in failing to remove the ice and apply sand at the entrance. The Court of Appeal further found the respondent guilty of contributory negligence and assessed the liability to the extent of one-third against the respondent and two-thirds against the appellant, as a result of which damages were awarded to the respondent in the amount of $19,076.10.\nThe respondent had for many years carried on the business, along with a number of others, of purchasing water from the City of Brandon for resale to farmers in the outlying districts, and for this purpose he used a truck with a 500-gallon tank on it which he brought to the east side of the fire hall stopping it with its back opposite the doorway just south of which there was a pipe with a hose extension through which the water was delivered. The accident occurred at approximately 4 p.m. on January 4, 1965, which was a cold day with the snow blowing. The respondent had made two previous visits to the fire hall on that day on each of which he had entered through the doorway in question and observed the icy condition, and shortly before 4 o\u2019clock he backed his truck up according to his practice, removed the metal top from his tank, inserted the hose and then entered the building through the doorway stepping upon the concrete step and then on the concrete sill across the length of which on the inner side was a wooden sill measuring approximately 4 feet 1 inch. The distance from the top of the concrete sill to the ground below was approximately 42 inches and as he came in the respondent noticed that the sills were both covered with an accumulation of ice which had gathered there from the spillage of water while filling the tanks. Either the respondent or one of the firemen turned on the water from inside the building and in five or six minutes when the water would be nearing the capacity of the tank, the respondent left through the door by which he had entered and in so doing he slipped on the ice and fell to the ground below suffering serious injuries to his left shoulder and thigh. The respondent knew that in winter-time there was always ice on the top step and sill of the doorway which he used, he recognized that the situation was a dangerous one and was aware of the fact that he could have entered and left the building by the front entrance and that this was in fact done by some purchasers of water because it was safer than using the east side door. It is to be observed also that the respondent had entered the building only a few minutes before his fall by going over the very ice on which he fell. It is true that icy conditions and the dangers which they create may vary considerably from time to time, particularly under conditions of blowing and drifting snow such as there were on the day in question, and it is also true that the respondent stated that there was more of a film of snow when he left than when he entered, but I am quite unable to accept the suggestion which appears to have carried some weight with the Court of Appeal that there could have been any material change in the icy condition of the doorway during the time which it took to fill the 500\u2011gallon tank with water.\nThe relationship between the parties was correctly treated in both the Courts below as being that of an occupier and an invitee and the learned trial judge, in conformity with the decision of Mr. Justice Spence, speaking for the majority of this Court in Campbell v. Royal Bank of Canada[2], adopted the definition of the occupier\u2019s liability as it was stated by Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames[3], and the definition of \u201cunusual danger\u201d which is contained in the judgment given by Lord Porter in the House of Lords in London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton[4]. For greater clarity it appears to me to be desirable to restate these definitions. The outline of liability established by Mr. Justice Willes in his famous judgment is in the following terms:\nAnd, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knows or ought to know.\nand Lord Porter\u2019s definition of unusual danger reads as follows:\nI think \u2018unusual\u2019 is used in an objective sense and means such danger as is not usually found in carrying out the task or fulfilling the function which the invitee has in hand, though what is unusual will, of course, vary with the reasons for which the invitee enters the premises. Indeed, I do not think Phillimore L.J., in Norman v. Great Western Railway Co., [1915] 1 K.B. 584 at 596, is speaking of individuals as individuals but of individuals as members of a type, e.g. that class of persons such as stevedores or seamen who are accustomed to negotiate the difficulties which their occupation presents. A tall chimney is not an unusual difficulty for a steeplejack though it would be for a motor mechanic. But I do not think a lofty chimney presents a danger less unusual for the last-named because he is particularly active or untroubled by dizziness.\nIn the Campbell case, supra, at p. 93, Spence J. also made reference to Lord Normand\u2019s judgment in the Horton case, supra, at p. 752 where he said:\nI am of opinion that if the persons invited to the premises are a particular class of tradesman then the test is whether it is unusual danger for that class.\nIn the Campbell case Mr. Justice Spence was dealing with a situation where \u201cthe invitee was an ordinary customer of the bank but of no particular class\u201d and he reaffirmed the finding of the trial judge that the condition of the bank floor around the tellers\u2019 wickets was \u201cmore than mere moisture or dampness; it may have been less than actual puddles; but certainly there was at least a dangerous glaze or film of water under foot near the tellers\u2019 wickets\u201d, and the further finding \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge was not knowledge of the dangerous condition around the tellers\u2019 wickets. The conditions were worse there\u201d.\nFinally, Spence J. agreed with the dissenting opinion of Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal where he said:\nOne does not normally expect that bank premises, to which members of the public customarily resort in large numbers, will be wet and therefore hazardous.\nIn the result, Mr. Justice Spence found that the state of the floor in the bank on the afternoon in question constituted \u201can unusual danger\u201d.\nThe facts which form the basis of the decision of this Court in the Campbell case are, in my opinion, clearly distinguishable from those with which we are here concerned.\nThe respondent in the present case was one of a particular class of customers who bought water from the fire hall premises and who filled their trucks by bringing them to the eastern entrance where icy conditions existed on the door sills in winter-time occasioned in part by the fact that there was usually some spillage from the tanks in delivering water.\nIn holding that the icy condition constituted an \u201cunusual danger\u201d, the Court of Appeal relied on a finding that the appellant\u2019s officials had been negligent in not having removed the ice and applied sand, and Mr. Justice Freedman, whose reasons were adopted by the other members of the Court, applied to the circumstances here disclosed the following language employed by Mr. Justice Spence in the Campbell case at pp. 96 and 97:\nIt is perhaps a test of some value to determine whether a condition is one of unusual danger to investigate the ease by which the occupier might avoid it\u2026 If the danger could have been prevented by these economical and easy precautions then surely a member of the public\u2026 would have been entitled to expect such precautions or others equally effective, and their absence would tend to make the danger an \u2018unusual\u2019 one.\nIn making this statement, Mr. Justice Spence was commenting on the finding of the learned trial judge that a few strips of matting placed on the busy parts of the lobby of the bank \u201cwould have kept the floor nearly dry\u201d, and in dealing with the conditions which \u201ca member of the public frequenting such a busy place as this bank would have been entitled to expect\u201d, he found that failure to take the \u201ceasy precautions\u201d suggested by the trial judge \u201cwould tend to make the danger an \u2018unusual\u2019 one\u201d.\nAs has been indicated, the respondent in the present case was not \u201can ordinary customer\u2026 of no particular class\u201d like the plaintiff in the Campbell case. He was, on the other hand, a member of a class whose business in obtaining water from the city exposed them to the hazard in winter-time created by ice accumulating on the door sills from the spillage of water. This danger was not, in my opinion, an unusual one for persons of that class and indeed it was one which was to be expected by those engaged in the transfer of water in freezing temperatures and I do not think that under these circumstances the failure of the city to keep the doorway free of ice or to apply sand can be said to have made the danger \u201cunusual\u201d. It is also clear that unlike the plaintiff in the Campbell case, the respondent here had knowledge of the actual danger at the place where he fell because he had entered and left through the doorway twice on the very day of the accident and had entered over the ice only five or six minutes before his fall.\nI am in agreement with the learned trial judge when he says:\nI have come to the conclusion that the condition of the ice and snow was not an \u2018unusual danger\u2019. The Plaintiff was one of many customers who purchased water from the defendant. The ice condition was incident to that operation and existed in varying degrees during the whole of the winter season of 1964-65. It was a condition known experienced and fully appreciated by plaintiff not only on three occasions the same day but on many other occasions during that winter season.\nThe duty owed by an occupier to an invitee as defined by Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames, supra, is predicated upon the existence of an unusual danger on the occupier\u2019s premises and the finding that the damage in the present case was not caused by such a danger is in my view a complete answer to the respondent\u2019s claim. I would allow the present appeal on this ground.\nI have not overlooked the fact that the learned trial judge also found that even if the danger had been an unusual one the appellant would have been protected from liability because the respondent, although not volens, had full knowledge and appreciation of it, but I do not find it necessary to embark on a consideration of the cases which he cited in support of this proposition or to express any opinion in this regard because the question does not appear to me to arise and I do not think it arose in the case of Campbell v. The Royal Bank, supra, which was expressly based on a finding that the plaintiff did not have full knowledge and appreciation of the danger at the place where he fell.\nAs I have indicated, I would allow this appeal and dismiss the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Meighen, Stordy, Haddad, Alder & Mitchell, Brandon.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Hamilton, Hunt & Potter, Brandon.\n[1] (1966), 58 W.W.R. 538, 61 D.L.R.

H, a logging and sawmill operator, agreed to purchase certain standing timber and after having cut and removed the same he milled it into cants which he sold to A Co. On December 29, 1959, H obtained a loan from the plaintiff bank in the sum of $702.32 and as security for such advance he assigned to the bank all money due or to become due to him under the contract with A Co. H incurred indebtedness to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board in respect of assessments for 1958, 1959 and part of 1960. A Co., upon receiving conflicting claims from the Board and the bank for the money owing to H, took interpleader proceedings and paid the sum of $966.57 into Court. The trial judge held that the Board was entitled to enforce its lien, under s. 48 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 413, to the amount of $918.15 being assessments for the years 1958 and 1959. The bank appealed to the Court of Appeal which reversed the trial judge and awarded $702.32 of the money to the bank. With, leave, the Board then appealed to this Court to restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIn the absence of legislation specifically extending the lien to cover the proceeds of property that was subject to the lien, the Court agreed with the majority in the Court of Appeal that the proceeds of the sale of the cants did not constitute property, real or personal, within the meaning of s. 48 and that these proceeds were not impressed with a lien created in and by s. 48.

Appeal dismissed.\nC.C. Locke, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., and R.I.A. Smith, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from a judgment of that Court1 declaring that the Bank of Montreal was entitled to payment out of Court of the sum of $702.32 of the money paid into Court pursuant to the Order of Brown J. dated March 3, 1961, as the result of certain interpleader proceedings to determine the question of priority to the money in Court between the parties under s. 48 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 413. Section 48 reads as follows:\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, the amount due to the Board by an employer upon any assessment made under this Act, or in respect of any amount which the employer is required to pay to the Board under any of its provisions, or upon any judgment therefor, constitutes a lien in favour of the Board payable in priority over all liens, charges, or mortgages of every person, whenever created or to be created, with respect to the property, real, personal, or mixed, used in or in connection with or produced in or by the industry with respect to which the employer was assessed or the amount became payable, excepting liens for wages due to workmen by their employer, and such lien for the amount due the Board is valid and in force with respect to each assessment for a period of three years from the end of the calendar year for which the assessment was levied.\nThe litigation was conducted upon an agreed statement of facts as follows:\n1. Frank J. Huber agreed with one A.L. Bowes to purchase standing timber from Bowes, payment to be made as the timber was logged.\n2. Huber cut and removed the timber and milled the same into cants which he sold to Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. to deduct from the purchase price the amount owing to Mr. A.L. Bowes on the purchase of Timber as aforesaid and amounts due to the Forest Service of the Province of British Columbia in respect thereof.\n3. Huber delivered the said cants to Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. during the month of December, 1959 and the months of January and February, 1960, and in respect of such deliveries Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. by March 1st, 1960 was indebted to Huber in the sum of $966.57.\n4. On December 29th, 1959 Huber obtained a loan by way of overdraft from Bank of Montreal at Ashcroft in the sum of $702.32 and as security for such advance, Bank of Montreal obtained a valid assignment in writing from Huber whereby he assigned all his right, title and interest in and to all monies due or to become due to him from the Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. under his contract with Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. The whole of the said advance remains unpaid.\n5. Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. was given notice of the said assignment on December 30th, 1959.\n6. Huber was registered with Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board as an employer in the industry of logging and sawmill operations at all times material.\n7. Huber is liable to pay Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board the sum of $945.37 in respect of his said operations as set out in the Affidavit of James Alexander Downing sworn November 21st, 1962 and filed herein.\n8. On April 6th, 1960 Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board filed a certificate under Section 39(2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in respect of the said indebtedness and issued a Warrant of Execution against Huber on April 17th, 1960 which was returned by the Sheriff nulla bona on April 20th, 1960.\n9. Upon receiving conflicting claims from Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and Bank of Montreal, Ashcroft Lumber Co. Ltd. took interpleader proceedings and paid the sum of $966.57 into Court pursuant to the said Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Brown herein dated March 3rd, 1961.\nThe learned trial judge, Ruttan J., found one additional fact as follows:\nHuber was indebted to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board under assessment for the year 1958 in the sum of $678.12 and for the year 1959 in the sum of $240.03, and for the year 1960, $27.22.\nand he held that the appellant Board was entitled to enforce its lien to the amount of $918.15 being assessments for the years 1958 and 1959 due under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The Bank appealed to the Court of Appeal which reversed the trial judge and awarded $702.32 of the money to the Bank. The Board now appeals to this Court to restore the judgment of Ruttan J.\nThe issue is whether, by said s. 48, the amount payable by Ashcroft to Huber as set out in item 3 of the agreed statement of facts is \u2018property\u2026 produced in or by, or used in connection with the industry\u2026\u2019 The respondent Bank contends that the lien given by s. 48 of the Act is against \u2018property\u2019 so described and restricted; that the lien is not against all the property of the employer Huber, such as in this instance, accounts receivable.\nThe learned trial judge said: \u201cIf the lien would attach properly to the lumber I can see no reason why it cannot attach to the money which represents that lumber.\u201d and he relied on Re Clemenshaw (a Bankrupt), Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Credit Men\u2019s Trust Association Ltd. (No. 1)[2]. The judgment in Clemenshaw was based on the fact that since it had not been established by the Board that the moneys in the hands of the trustee represented the proceeds of the sale of property used in or produced by any industry, the Board in that case failed to prove that it had a lien on the fund there in question, but the judgment suggests that the proceeds could represent property within the meaning of the section so as to allow the lien created by the section to attach to the proceeds, and that if such proof had been forthcoming the result would have been different. It is of some importance, however, to note that in Clemenshaw the moneys said to be subject to the lien were from a sale of property made by the producer\u2019s trustee and the Board might on that basis have been entitled to receive the proceeds of the sale.\nThe appellant relied on Royal Bank of Canada v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of Nova Scotia[3], but the statute under review in that case provided that the Board should have a first lien on all the property, real, personal or mixed, used in or in connection with or produced in or by the industry with respect to which the employer was assessed though not owned by the employer, subject only to municipal taxes.\nThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Alberta, R.S.A. 1955, c. 370, also reads differently from the British Columbia statute. Section 77(4) of the Alberta Act, reading in part, \u201c\u2026is a charge upon the property of the employer, including moneys payable to, for, or on account of the employer, within the Province\u201d.\nBranca J.A., speaking for the majority in the Court of Appeal, said:\nThe Act enacts some very extraordinary rights and remedies in favour of the Board and had the Legislature intended to impress the lien which might be created by s. 48 of the Act upon the proceeds of the sale of property produced in and by the industry and thus grant further extraordinary rights to the Board, one would have expected clear words to that effect. In the absence of such words in the statute I am unable to subscribe to that interpretation.\nand after discussing the case of Dinning v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board[4],continued:\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the learned trial judge was in error in his finding that the lien created by s. 48 attached to money which represented the lumber.\nI am of the opinion that the proceeds of the sale of the cants do not constitute property real or personal produced in and by the industry with respect to which Huber was assessed, and that the monies therefore are not impressed with a lien created in and by s. 48 of the Act.\nIn the Dinning case, Dinning was a trustee in bankruptcy of Campbell River Mills Limited. A quantity of logs belonging to Campbell River Mills Limited was destroyed by fire and the proceeds of an insurance policy were paid to the trustee. The Board contested against alleged prior rights of other creditors, claiming an amount owing to the Board by the bankrupt company by way of unpaid assessments. The trial judge held that by virtue of s. 46 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the predecessor to the present s. 48, the Board had a lien upon the insurance money and was entitled, therefore, to the insurance funds. That judgment was reversed on appeal. Macdonald J.A., in construing s. 46 as it was, and which for practical purposes is almost identical in its language to s. 48 as it is at present, said:\nA lien or charge is created with respect to the property to which it attaches and extends no further unless moneys received from a defined source is mentioned. Priority under s. 46 is only given in respect to charges on the property or industry, not on other sources of income, e.g., an insurance contract. It is property \u201cused in\u201d or \u201cproduced by\u201d the industry e.g. manufactured products. It would be possible to enlarge the section to include such a fund but even a liberal construction of the words used would not permit such an extension. It should not be so construed as to defeat a registered charge conveying an estate to another unless clear words were employed indicating such an intention.\nIn the absence of legislation specifically extending the lien to cover the proceeds of property that was subject to the lien, I agree with Branca J.A. that the proceeds of the sale of the cants did not constitute property, real or personal, within the meaning of s. 48 and that these proceeds are not impressed with a lien created in and by s. 48.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Ladner, Downs, Ladner, Locke, Clark & Lenox, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1967), 58 W.W.R. 731, 60 D.L.R.

Minister of National Revenue, [1968] S.C.R. 193\nDate: 1968-01-23\nVina-Rug (Canada) Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1967: October 5, 6: 1968: January 23.\nPresent: Fauteux, Abbott, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Associated corporations\u2014Control by same group of persons\u2014More than one group in position to control\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 39(4)(b).\nThe issue in this case was whether the appellant company was \u201cassociated\u201d with a second company, Stradwick\u2019s Ltd., within the meaning of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and, therefore, was not entitled to the benefit of the lower tax rate on part of its income, on the ground that both corporations were controlled by the same group of persons. All the shares of Stradwick\u2019s Ltd. were owned by a father, as to 12, his two sons, as to 10 each and a fourth party, as to 8. On the other hand, the principal shareholders of the appellant company were the two sons and the same fourth party. The Minister contended that Stradwick\u2019s Ltd. was controlled by a group consisting of the two sons and the fourth party (it is common ground that, if that is so, the same group also controlled the appellant company). However, it is contended by the appellant company that Stradwick\u2019s Ltd. was controlled by a group consisting of the father and the two sons\u2014that group not being in a position to control the appellant company. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s contention that the two companies were associated. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nApplying the principles enunciated in M.N.R. v. Dworkin Furs Ltd., [1967] S.C.R. 223, once it is established that a group of shareholders owns a majority of the voting shares of a company, and the same group a majority of the voting shares of a second company, that fact is sufficient to constitute the two companies associated within the meaning of s. 39 of the Act. Moreover, in determining de jure control more than one group of persons can be aptly described as a \u201cgroup of persons\u201d within the meaning of s. 39(4)(b) of the Act. It is immaterial whether or not other combinations of shareholders may own a majority of voting shares in either company, provided each combination is in a position to control at least a majority of votes to be cast at a general meeting of shareholders.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Corporations associ\u00e9es\u2014Contr\u00f4le par le m\u00eame groupe de personnes\u2014Plus d\u2019un groupe en \u00e9tat d\u2019exercer le contr\u00f4le\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 39(4)(b).\nIl s\u2019agit dans cette cause de d\u00e9terminer si la compagnie appelante \u00e9tait \u00abassoci\u00e9e\u00bb \u00e0 une seconde compagnie, Stradwick\u2019s Ltd., dans le sens de l\u2019art. 39 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, et, en cons\u00e9quence, n\u2019ayant pas droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du taux d\u2019imp\u00f4t moindre sur une partie de son, revenu, pour le motif que les deux corporations \u00e9taient contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par le m\u00eame groupe de personnes.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nP.N. Thorsteinsson, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie and L.R. Olsson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant company was \u201cassociated\u201d during the 1961 and 1962 taxation years with a second company, Stradwick\u2019s Limited, within the meaning of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act, and as such not entitled to the lower tax rate on the first $35,000 of taxable income provided for in the section. Paragraph (b) of subs. (4) of s. 39 provides that two corporations are associated with each other in a taxation year, if they are controlled by the same group of persons. That subsection reads as follows:\n39. (4) For the purpose of this section, one corporation is associated with another in a taxation year, if, at any time in the year,\n* * *\n(b) both of the corporations were controlled by the same person or group of persons.\nIn the relevant periods, the shareholders of Stradwick\u2019s Limited and their respective shareholdings were:\nJohn Stradwick, Sr. ...................................................................\n12\nJohn Stradwick, Jr. ...................................................................\n10\nW.L. Stradwick ..........................................................................\n10\nH.D. McGilvery ..........................................................................\n8\nTotal issued shares ......................................................\n40\nThe shareholders of the appellant company and the respective shareholdings were:\nJohn Stradwick, Jr. ..........................................................\n6,133\nW.L. Stradwick .................................................................\n6,133\nH.D. McGilvery .................................................................\n6,133\nStradwick\u2019s Limited .........................................................\n5,250\nOthers ................................................................................\n16,351\nTotal issued shares .............................................\n40,000\nThe position of the respondent is that the group consisting of John Stradwick, Jr., W.L. Stradwick and H.D. McGilvery controlled Stradwick\u2019s Limited and it is common ground between the parties to the appeal that if this group controlled Stradwick\u2019s Limited, then it also controlled the appellant company. The appellant contends however that the said group did not control Stradwick\u2019s Limited and that Stradwick\u2019s Limited was controlled by a group consisting of John Stradwick, Sr., John Stradwick, Jr., and W.L. Stradwick. John Stradwick, Sr., is the father of John Stradwick, Jr., and W.L. Stradwick; H.D. McGilvery is a stranger in the tax sense. McGilvery became a shareholder in Stradwick\u2019s Limited in 1950, but, prior to that time, had become a shareholder, with the Stradwicks, in two other companies\u2014the tax status of which is not in issue in this appeal. All three companies were engaged in the manufacture, wholesaling or retailing of floor and wall tile.\nIn 1956, John Stradwick, Jr., W.L. Stradwick, H.D. McGilvery and Stradwick\u2019s Limited acquired control of a fourth company\u2014the appellant Vina-Rug (Canada) Limited\u2014which also manufactured floor coverings.\nDuring the 1961 and 1962 taxation years, there was a common management and administration for all the four companies referred to, and in each of those years the appellant company paid Stradwick\u2019s Limited $5,000 for administrative services performed on its behalf.\nJohn Stradwick, Jr., testified that the group of shareholders consisting of himself, his brother and his father in fact controlled Stradwick\u2019s Limited. It is perhaps not without significance that McGilvery attended and voted at all shareholders and directors\u2019 meetings of Stradwick\u2019s Limited, during the relevant periods, at which all resolutions were passed unanimously. However, in the view which I take of the issue in this appeal these facts are irrelevant.\nThe learned trial judge held that John Stradwick, Jr., W.L. Stradwick and H.D. McGilvery, who collectively owned more than 50 per cent of the shares of Stradwick\u2019s Limited, had at all material times a sufficient common connection as to be in a position to exercise control over Stradwick\u2019s Limited and therefore constituted a \u201cgroup of persons\u201d within the meaning of subs. (4) of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act. I am in agreement with that finding.\nThis Court considered the concept of \u201ccontrol\u201d in Minister of National Revenue v. Dworkin Furs Limited[2]. Hall J. in delivering the judgment of the Court said at p. 227:\nThe word controlled as used in this subsection was held by Jackett P. to mean de jure control and not de facto control and with this I agree. He said in Buckerfield\u2019s Limited et al. v. Minister of National Revenue: Many approaches might conceivably be adopted in applying the word \u201ccontrol\u201d in a statute such as the Income Tax Act to a corporation. It might, for example, refer to control by \u201cmanagement\u201d, where management and the Board of Directors are separate, or it might refer to control by the Board of Directors. The kind of control exercised by management officials or the Board of Directors is, however, clearly not intended by section 39 when it contemplates control of one corporation by another as well as control of a corporation by individuals (see subsection (6) of section 39). The word \u201ccontrol\u201d might conceivably refer to de facto control by one or more shareholders whether or not they hold a majority of shares. I am of the view, however, that, in section 39 of the Income Tax Act, the word \u201ccontrolled\u201d contemplates the right of control that rests in ownership of such a number of shares as carries with it the right to a majority of the votes in the election of the Board of Directors. See British American Tobacco Co. v. I.R.C. (1943) 1 A.E.R. 13 where Viscount Simon L.C., at p. 15 says:\nThe owners of the majority of the voting power in a company are the persons who are in effective control of its affairs and fortunes.\nApplying these principles, once it is established that a group of shareholders owns a majority of the voting shares of a company, and the same group a majority of the voting shares of a second company, that fact is sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute the two companies associated within the provisions of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act. Moreover, in determining de jure control more than one group of persons can be aptly described as a \u201cgroup of persons\u201d within the meaning of s. 39(4)(b). In my view, it is immaterial whether or not other combinations of share-holders may own a majority of voting shares in either company, provided each combination is in a position to control at least a majority of votes to be cast at a general meeting of shareholders.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.N. Thorsteinsson, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

An arbitrator awarded the appellant the sum of $770,000, which amount included $70,000 for business disturbance. On appeal the award was reduced to $143,500. This sum was made up of $100,000 for the land, $8,500 for additional maintenance during the construction period and $35,000 to cover inconvenience and disruption over a long period of time, including the possible additional expense of subfootings for any buildings which the college might erect over the subway in the future.\nThe notice of expropriation expropriated the fee simple in a strip of land through the centre of the college property. However, the Court of Appeal found that, as a result of negotiations, an agreement was reached that the municipality would take not the fee simple but a subsurface easement.\nFrom the order of the Court of Appeal the college appealed to this Court. The municipality cross-appealed on the award of $100,000 for the value of the land and also on the question of costs.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nAs held by the Court of Appeal, what was taken, pursuant to the agreement, was a permanent exclusive right under the surface of the land. The compensation to be awarded was for the value of what was taken and an amount to represent the diminution in value, if any, in the remaining lands. The Court of Appeal awarded $143,500 as full compensation for the lands taken, including all damage necessarily resulting from the expropriation of the land, plus interest. This Court was of opinion that it should not interfere with that award.\nAs to the cross-appeal on the question of costs, it was held that this Court should not interfere in a matter of costs with a disposition made in the Court of Appeal. The matter was one of discretion for them. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from and varying an arbitrator\u2019s award of compensation for expropriation.\nH.G. Chappell, Q.C., G.F. Henderson, Q.C., and June M. Bushell, for the appellant.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., George Mace and R.J. Rolls, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014An arbitrator awarded the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College the sum of $770,000 for the expropriation of a portion of its premises in the City of Toronto. The amount included $70,000 for business disturbance. On appeal the award was reduced to $143,500. This sum was made up of $100,000 for the land, $8,500 for additional maintenance cost during the construction period and $35,000 to cover inconvenience and disruption over a long period of time, including the possible additional expense of subfootings for any buildings which the college may erect over the subway in the future.\nThe by-law of the municipality was passed on April 21, 1959, for the purpose of the construction of an east-west subway by the Toronto Transit Commission. This subway runs through the middle of the college property.\nA brief description of this property is necessary. It has a frontage of approximately 70 feet on Bloor Street, by a depth of 217 feet. This property was acquired in 1955 for $55,000. There was an old three-storey building on the property at that time containing 37 rooms. It had been used as a rooming-house. Immediately after the acquisition of this property, at a cost of $159,650, the college constructed a building of brick veneer construction 60 feet by 90 feet in dimensions. This building was referred to throughout the proceedings as the Henderson Building, and it was in this building that the teaching was done. The old building was used for administration purposes.\nIn 1957, 1958 and 1959 the college purchased three old houses on Prince Arthur Avenue. These houses backed upon the original purchase on Bloor Street. The purchase prices were $19,600, $22,500 and $22,000, a total of $64,100. The result of these acquisitions was that in 1959, when the by-law was passed, the college owned a block of land having a frontage on the north side of Bloor Street of approximately 70 feet and on the south side of Prince Arthur Avenue of 61 feet 3 inches, and having an approximate depth of 385 feet. The total cost of the acquisition of all the lands and the cost of constructing the Henderson Building was $278,650. At the time of expropriation the Prince Arthur Avenue houses were not being used by the college. They had been purchased with an eye to expansion and they were rented at this time. The land expropriated was a strip approximately 80 feet in width through the centre of the land. It included the northerly 37 feet of the Henderson Building and the balance of the strip was vacant land behind the houses fronting on Prince Arthur Avenue.\nThe notice of expropriation expropriated the fee simple in this strip. The Court of Appeal, however, has found that, as a result of negotiations, an agreement was reached that the municipality would take not the fee simple but a subsurface easement. By an agreement in writing dated November 6, 1961, the college agreed to convey to the municipality a permanent subsurface easement for an amount to be determined by agreement or arbitration. The following are the terms of the agreement:\nBy Indenture dated the 6th day of November, 1961, duly executed by the College under its corporate seal and the signatures of its President and Secretary-Treasurer, the College agreed to grant a permanent sub-surface easement under the lands more particularly described therein, and below a place more particularly described therein, for an amount to be determined either by mutual agreement or by arbitration. The said grant contained, inter alia, the following terms and provisions:\nWHEREAS the Metropolitan Corporation requires a sub-surface easement under the lands hereinafter described; and\nWHEREAS the Metropolitan Corporation has agreed to pay the sum of $10,000.00 to the Grantor as part payment on account of the ultimate compensation which may be found to be payable for the easement as hereinafter mentioned.\nTHEREFORE the Grantor agrees to grant a permanent sub-surface easement under the said lands more particularly described as follows:\n\u2026 to The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto for an amount to be determined either by mutual agreement between the parties or by arbitration;\nThe said sum of $10,000 is to be paid to the Grantor by the Metropolitan Corporation upon the delivery of this Agreement to the Metropolitan Corporation as part payment on account of the ultimate compensation which may be found to be payable as aforesaid for the easement required by the Metropolitan Corporation under the said lands and the said sum of $10,000.00 shall be deducted from the ultimate compensation.\nThe balance of the said compensation shall be paid to the Grantor upon delivery to the Metropolitan Corporation of a transfer of the easement required including the consent of any parties who may have an interest in the said lands.\nThe municipality made payments on account from time to time totalling $50,000.\nThe Court of Appeal held, and with this I agree, that\nPursuant to the agreement what was taken was a permanent exclusive right under the surface of the land. The compensation to be awarded is for the value of what was taken and an amount to represent the diminution in value, if any, in the remaining lands.\nThe Court of Appeal put a value of $100,000 on the land taken and added to that the two items already mentioned totalling $43,500.\nThree witnesses connected with the college in an official capacity gave evidence of the figures that they would have paid to avoid the expropriation and its attendant frustration. These figures were: $900,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000. In the appellant\u2019s factum filed on this appeal, these figures were built up to $1,599,155.67. All these figures are meaningless. One big item in them is the claim for the demolition and rebuilding of the Henderson Building. Instead of the rear 37 feet of the Henderson Building being torn down, it was underpinned and the subway construction went on on that basis. The head of Cloke Construction Company, the firm that built the Henderson Building, said that the necessary repairs to the Henderson Building could be done at the cost of $9,029. Another contractor said it could be done for $9,780.\nIn any event, any claim for damage done during the course of construction of the subway was not before the arbitrator. This claim under the existing legislation could only be made against the Toronto Transit Commission. A writ was issued but no statement of claim was ever filed.\nIn spite of the length of the arbitration, on which I shall comment later, there was very little evidence given on the subject of the value of the lands expropriated. Mr. H. L. Croft, the appraiser called on behalf of the college, gave his opinion that the value of the lands expropriated by By-law No. 955 was $123,420 for the 82 foot strip. If the lands on either side of the subway were returned to the college after completion of the construction, Mr. Croft was of the opinion that the lands taken would have a value of $99,509. These amounts are based upon his definition of market value, and take into account the damage to the land from all causes including not only the value of the land actually taken but also injurious affection to the land remaining arising out of the expropriation.\nIt was argued by Metro that Mr. Croft\u2019s opinion was erroneous because he admitted that two of the comparable sales he used were in an area governed by zoning which permitted a greater use of the lands than the college\u2019s lands and further because he made no adjustments for depth in his comparables. He further assumed that the whole fee in the land was expropriated, whereas this was not the case, and he did not consider that the college could still enjoy the use of the lands over the subway structure.\nMr. P.J. Garton, an appraiser called by Metro, valued the loss of the permanent subsurface easement, including loss from all causes including damage to the remainder, at $44,100 plus the sum of $4,196 as the value of the temporary working easement, making a total of $48,296.\nBased on this evidence, the municipality has cross-appealed on the award of $100,000 for the value of the land. The submission is that the Court of Appeal erred in awarding to the college the sum of $100,000 as the value of the subsurface easement based on the market value of the fee of the lands as determined by its highest and best use. It may be that the Court of Appeal took a somewhat generous view of the evidence in favour of the college. Its award is $143,500 as full compensation for the lands taken, including all damage necessarily resulting from the expropriation of the land, plus interest at 5 per cent per annum on the unpaid balance of compensation from December 15, 1959, until the date of payment. I do not think that this Court should interfere with this award.\nThere is also a cross-appeal on the question of costs. The arbitration took 55 days to complete. Thirty-seven days were taken up with a consideration of damage to the Henderson Building. There are 52 volumes of evidence, comprising 6,920 pages. According to the calculation of counsel for Metro, 4,940 of these pages were taken up with this irrelevant evidence. Objections were made from time to time by counsel for Metro but were overruled. There are also eight volumes of exhibits, comprising 1,255 pages. The order of the Court of Appeal allows the appeal with costs but only allows Metro half the cost for the transcript of evidence and the preparation of the appeal books.\nThe college has been awarded its costs of the arbitration. It might well have been ordered to pay the costs for 37 days of this hearing or have been deprived of costs for those days. However, I do not think that we should interfere in a matter of costs with a disposition made in the Court of Appeal. The matter is one of discretion for them. But in view of the favourable disposition of costs in the Court of Appeal, I would not allow the college any costs of the cross-appeal, which, in any event, took but a short time in this Court.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs and I would also dismiss the cross-appeal but without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chappell, Walsh & Davidson, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.P.G. Joy, Toronto.\n"

In the course of carrying on a legal strike against the company, the union picketed its property at Skookumchuck, British Columbia, whereon a pulp mill was being constructed by Crestbrook through contractors and subcontractors including Flanders Installations Ltd. The employees of Flanders and those of its subcontractors refused to cross the picket line. Flanders commenced an action against the union and two of its officers, claiming damages and an injunction restraining the defendants from picketing the construction site. The Chambers judge, who was of opinion that Crestbrook\u2019s Skookumchuck property fell within the phrase \u201cthe employer\u2019s place of business, operations, or employment\u201d in s. 3(1) of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 384, dismissed the application for an interim injunction. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, Davey C.J.B.C. dissenting, allowed the appeal and granted an injunction until the trial of the action or further order. An application was made to this Court on behalf of the defendants for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from an order of Kirke Smith L.J.S.C. and granting an interlocutory injunction. Application dismissed.\nMaurice Wright, Q.C., and J.B. Varcoe, for the applicants.\nG.F. Henderson, Q.C., and M. Bray, contra.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the applicants the following judgment was delivered.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for the Court):\u2014Mr. Henderson, we do not find it necessary to call upon you.\nIt is only under exceptional circumstances that we grant leave to appeal to this Court from an interlocutory order. It is said that a point of law of general importance is raised but it is seldom found satisfactory to attempt to deal with such a point until the facts have been ascertained at a trial.\nIn this case the writ was issued on November 20, 1967; the application for an interlocutory injunction was disposed of by His Honour Judge Smith on November 24, 1967, and by the Court of Appeal on December 15, 1967. The order of the Court of Appeal contains the following paragraphs:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that either the Appellant or the Respondents be at liberty to apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that, without limiting the generality of the liberty to apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted herein, the Respondents may apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to dissolve this injunction if the Appellant fails to proceed with diligence to bring the case to trial at the earliest date that is reasonably possible.\nThere is nothing in the material to indicate that diligence has been used to bring the action to trial. There appears to be no reason that the action should not be tried before, in the ordinary course, this appeal would be heard here, if leave were granted.\nWe are all of opinion that the application should be refused and it is accordingly dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitor for the applicants: John B.

In 1955, both being well in their seventies, they incorporated the appellant company by letters patent. The stated object of the company was to carry on the business of farming, and its shareholders were trustees for other members of the family and charities. The company then purchased the land from Mr. L and his wife at an appraised value of $144,000 in return for debentures and promissory notes. The company continued to have the lands farmed under crop leases. During the next few years, the company received the proceeds from the forfeiture of several options to purchase parts of the land and from the sale of part of the land. These monies were used to pay off the debentures and promissory notes. The Minister assessed all the monies received by the appellant company as income. The appellant contended that the lands were acquired as a capital asset for the ultimate purpose of orderly and advantageous liquidation and that the receipts were capital gains. The Minister submitted that the profits were income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: It was clear on the evidence that the real purpose of the company was not to carry on the business of farming but to acquire the farm lands with a view to selling them. The company was not realizing or selling these properties for the benefit of prior owners or creditors of prior owners, but was selling on its own behalf to make a profit. The only way the company could produce anything for the shareholders was to produce a profit. The company was in business for this purpose and the profits were correctly taxed.\nPer Cartwright C.J., dissenting: On the evidence the appellant was not a trading company but a realization company. This realization was for the benefit of Mr. L and his wife and the relatives and charities. The company did not embark in a trade or a business. Its real function was simply to dispose of capital assets and to distribute the proceeds.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Gain de capital ou revenu\u2014Transactions immobili\u00e8res\u2014Compagnie priv\u00e9e cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour vendre une ferme\u2014Compagnie de placement ou compagnie faisant le commerce\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 3, 4, 139(1)(e).\nUn monsieur L et sa femme avaient acquis plusieurs terres qu\u2019ils faisaient cultiver par d\u2019autres. En 1955, ayant 77 et 78 ans respectivement, ils ont form\u00e9, par lettres patentes, la compagnie appelante, dont l\u2019objet d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019exploitation agricole et dont les actionnaires \u00e9taient des fiduciaires pour d\u2019autres membres de la famille et pour des charit\u00e9s. La compagnie appelante a alors achet\u00e9 la terre de monsieur L et de sa femme pour une somme de $144,000, valeur \u00e0 laquelle la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e, en retour de titres d\u2019obligations et de billets promissoires.

Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. dissenting.\nStuart Thom, Q.C., and T.E.J. McDonnell, for the appellant.\nM.A. Mogan and M.J. Bonner, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment1 of Cattanach J. dismissing an appeal from the income tax assessments of the appellant for the taxation years 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960.\nWhile the record is voluminous the facts are not complicated and the question raised for decision is a narrow one.\nThe relevant facts are summarized in the reasons of my brother Judson and I shall endeavour to avoid repetition.\nThe sole question appears to me to be whether the appellant was a trading company or a realization company. It is common ground that the farm lands which the late John and Minnie LePage transferred to the appellant in 1955 were capital assets in their hands. On the whole evidence the conclusion appears to me to be inescapable that the LePages decided to dispose of these assets as follows: (i) to have them sold in an orderly manner; (ii) out of the proceeds to retain for themselves $144,000 and (iii) to divide the balance of the proceeds among members of their family and certain charities. Had they carried out this intention without the intervention of the appellant there would be no basis for the suggestion that income tax would be payable. We are not concerned with the question whether the transactions would have attracted succession duty or gift tax. This, of course, does not dispose of the question. It is necessary to consider what the operations of the appellant in fact were.\nIf one looks at the Letters Patent the object of the appellant was to carry on the business of farming. If that were so the sale of its farm or farms would be the realization of a capital asset and would not attract income tax. However, the evidence makes it clear that it was intended to carry on farming operations for such a period only as would permit the orderly and advantageous sale of the farms. The mere fact that the sale of what is admittedly a capital asset is delayed in the expectation of obtaining a better price does not cause it to be transformed from an item of capital to one of inventory.\nIn Commissioner of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust Limited[2], Lord Dunedin said:\n\u2026The argument for the respondents can be stated in a single sentence. They say they were not a trading company but a realization company; that the realization was truly for the benefit of the original creditors of the three banks; that all shareholders in the company are either such original creditors or the assignees of such original creditors. If that is the true view of the situation their Lordships do not doubt that the argument must prevail.\nThis passage may, I think, be adapted to the circumstances of the case at bar as follows:\nThe appellant says that it is not a trading company but a realization company; that the realization was truly for the benefit of the LePages and the relatives and charities who were the objects of their bounty; that all shares in the company are held in trust for those relatives and charities. The argument so put is, in my view, in accordance with the evidence and is entitled to prevail. I do not find anything in the method used to give effect to the LePages\u2019 intention which requires or permits the Court to hold that the appellant was a company trading in lands.\nI am unable to distinguish the case at bar* from that of C.H. Rand v. The Alberni Land Company, Limited[3], in which, at p. 638, Rowlatt J. stated the question there raised as follows:\nNow the question is whether this Company has really only realised some property held as capital by those who became its shareholders, namely, the people entitled under the trust, or who started or founded the trust, or whether it has got to the point of embarking in a trade or business of which these receipts are the resulting profits.\nThe answer to such a question must depend on the facts of the particular case in which it arises. In the case at bar on the evidence taken as a whole it appears to me that it must be answered in favour of the appellant. The real function of the appellant was simply to dispose of capital assets and distribute the proceeds in accordance with the irrevocable direction of the original owners of those assets.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court and refer the assessments for the years in question to the respondent to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant, Balstone Farms Ltd., as a result of its sale of land and the granting and forfeiture of certain options for the sale of land, had taxable profits or whether the receipts were capital gains. The Exchequer Court[4] has held that the transactions give rise to taxable gains.\nI begin with the statement of the acquisition of certain lands by an elderly couple, John and Minnie LePage, from the year 1944 to 1953. These lands were acquired in five large parcels and they are just beyond the municipal boundary of the City of Winnipeg:\nDate\nAcreage\nPrice\nLocation\nPurchaser\nI. June 9, 1944\n106\n$ 4,500.00\nMun. of Assiniboia\nJohn LePage\nII. Dec. 14, 1944\n154\n$ 2,988.20\nNorth Kildonan\nJohn LePage\nIII. May 9, 1945\n149.7\n$ 6,680.00\nAssiniboia\nMinnie LePage\nIV. Nov. 19, 1950\n403\n$12,896.00\nNorth Kildonan\nJohn LePage\nV. Aug. 13, 1953\n218\n$15,000.00\nAssiniboia\nMinnie LePage\n1,030.7\nJohn LePage had been a broker and dealer in pulpwood. In 1954 he was 76 years of age and his wife was 77. In May of 1955, they incorporated Balstone Farms Ltd. Its objects as set out in Letters Patent were \u201cto carry on in any capacity the business of farming and raising animals for any purpose\u201d. It is clear on the evidence that the real purpose was not to carry on the business of farming but to acquire these farm lands purchased by Mr. and Mrs. LePage with a view to selling them.\nImmediately after incorporation, the company entered into an agreement with Mr. and Mrs. LePage to purchase the above listed land. The consideration received by John LePage was $83,000, made up of eight debentures of $10,000 each and a promissory note for $3,000. The consideration received by Minnie LePage was $61,000, made up of six debentures of $10,000 each and a promissory note for $1,000. To round out the acreage included in Parcel III above, the company purchased an additional 21.62 acres.\nMr. and Mrs. LePage received no shares in the company for the transfer of these lands. The sole consideration received by them was as above. They directed the shares of the company to be issued to four individuals in trust for members of the family and certain charities. The total share capital issued consisted of 100 fully paid common shares without par value. We are not concerned with the execution of these trusts. They were validly constituted and they do not affect the problem here. Mr. and Mrs. LePage had no interest whatever in these shares either legal or equitable. They had parted with their land at an appraised value of $144,000 and they had no further interest in the company except as creditors for this amount. The cost of acquisition to the company was $144,000. The company continued the policy of Mr. and Mrs. LePage by having the lands farmed under crop leases.\nIn March of 1956 the company decided to sell sufficient land to pay off the debentures and promissory notes. In the same month it advertised for sale 496 acres in one district and 557 acres in another. The following is a list of the transactions in relation to these lands which give rise to this appeal:\n(1) On April 13, 1956, it granted an option on 277 acres at $1,250 per acre. This option expired May 1, 1957 and the option payment of $15,000 was forfeited.\n(2) On January 3, 1957, it granted an option on 557 acres at $1,250 per acre. The option expired on December 1, 1958, and the option payment of $5,000 was forfeited.\n(3) On June 25, 1958, it entered into an agreement for the sale of 171 acres at a price of $1,700 per acre with a deposit of $5,000. The sale was not completed. Litigation followed and was eventually settled. As part of the settlement the company retained the deposit of $5,000.\n(4) On June 30, 1959, it granted an option on 106 acres at $2,000 per acre with a deposit of $10,000. The option was renewed on January 2, 1960, with a further deposit of $5,000. This option expired on May 31, 1960. The two option payments of $10,000 and $5,000 were forfeited.\n(5) On July 15, 1959, it granted an option to purchase 171 acres at $2,100 per acre. This option was exercised on May 30, 1960 and the purchase completed. The company realized a profit of $93,312.88 on this sale.\nOn reassessment, the Minister added Item I to the company\u2019s income for the 1957 taxation year; Items II and III to income for the 1958 taxation year; Items IV and V to income for the 1960 taxation year.\nThe first payments by the company to Mr. and Mrs. LePage on account of the debentures were made in September 1959 from the funds obtained from the forfeiture of the option payments above mentioned. The balance was paid in June 1961. The finding of the learned trial judge on these facts was as follows:\nHere the lands were purchased by the appellant with a view to their resale and any income received during the interval prior to their sale was incidental to that principal and acknowledged purpose. The lands in the hands of the appellant were its inventory rather than capital assets which is the direct opposite to the facts as found in the Glasgow Heritable Trust case.\nThe company\u2019s submission before the Exchequer Court and on appeal to this Court was that the lands were acquired as a capital asset for the ultimate purpose of orderly and advantageous liquidation and that the receipts were capital gains. The Minister submitted that the company\u2019s profits from the above mentioned transactions were profits from business and therefore income within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nThe appellant founded its argument essentially on three cases: Rand v. The Alberni Land Company, Limited[5]; Glasgow Heritable Trust, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[6]; and Commissioner of Taxes v. British Australia Wool Realization Association[7]. These cases were concerned with the realization of assets and the incorporation of a company to serve as machinery for this purpose. Their ratio is to be found in the statement of Rowlatt J. in Rand v. The Alberni Land Company Limited, at p. 639:\nI think that in this case the company has done no more than provide the machinery by which the private landowners were enabled, under the peculiar circumstances of their divided title, to properly realise the capital of the property they held in the lands in question, and that is not income or proceeds of trade,\u2026\nIn none of these realization cases was there an out and out transfer by former owners for a cash consideration. When this company was formed, Mr. and Mrs. LePage transferred properties which had cost them approximately $42,000 for a consideration of $144,000. At that point they made a profit of $102,000 and their interest in the land ceased. The company was not \u201crealizing\u201d or selling these properties for the benefit of prior owners or the creditors of prior owners. The facts speak for themselves and fully justify the finding of fact of the learned trial judge. The company was selling on its own behalf to make a profit and it is quite obvious from the facts and figures above quoted that the profit was there to be made. The only way the company could produce anything for those who were beneficially interested in the shares, i.e., the members of the family (excluding Mr. and Mrs. LePage) and charities, was to produce a profit. The company was in business for this purpose and the profits were correctly taxed by the Minister.\nI attach no importance to the fact that this company was incorporated by Letters Patent. A company incorporated by Memorandum of Association would be in exactly the same position if it did what this company did.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright C.J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Newman & McLean, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

The appellant was to be remunerated for its services by a commission. It was contended by the appellant that it was entitled to claim a capital cost allowance on the ground that it had acquired a depreciable property, i.e., a \u201cfranchise, concession or licence for a limited period in respect of property\u201d within the meaning of class 14 of schedule B of s. 1100(1)(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. The Exchequer Court held that the rights acquired could not be described as a franchise, concession or licence in respect of property. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge rightly adopted the view expressed in the Investors Group v. M.N.R., [1965] 2 Ex. C.R. 520, that the words \u201cfranchise, concession or licence\u201d in the statute were used to refer to some right, privilege or monopoly that enables the concessionnaire or franchise holder to carry on his business or that facilitates the carrying on of his business and that they were not used to refer to a contract under which a person was entitled to remuneration for the performance of specific services.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Co\u00fbt en capital \u00e0 titre d\u2019allocation\u2014Acquisition du droit de g\u00e9rer un fonds mutuel pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e\u2014\u00abFranchise, concession ou licence\u00bb\u2014Bien susceptible de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 11(1)(a)\u2014R\u00e8glements de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, art. 1100(1)(c), c\u00e9dule B, classe 14.\nEn 1959, la compagnie appelante a acquis pour un montant substantiel le droit de g\u00e9rer deux fonds de placement mutuels pour une p\u00e9riode de dix ans.

Appel rejet\u00e9. APPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nR. de Wolfe MacKay, Q.C., and C.C. Locke, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada1 pronounced on April 5, 1967, wherein he dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal against its 1960 assessment. The Minister had refused to permit the appellant, in computing its income, to deduct the sum of $191,466.50.\nBy indentures dated October 1, 1954, between a corporation known as Capital Management Corporation Limited and the Montreal Trust Company, the All Canadian Dividend Trust Fund and The All Canadian Compound Fund mutual fund operations were established. These agreements designated the Capital Management Corporation as the manager of the trust funds and the Montreal Trust as the custodian of the assets thereof. Under that agreement, the Capital Management Corporation was entitled to a fee of not less than one-tenth of one per cent and not more than one-fifth of one per cent of the capital of the trust fund payable quarterly. There was no limitation on the period of time during which the Capital Management Corporation Limited was entitled to act as manager of the fund and receive the said fee although it might retire upon notice.\nThe appellant company was incorporated under the provisions of the British Columbia Companies Act on October 23, 1959. On October 31, 1959, the appellant entered into an agreement with Capital Management Corporation Limited, i.e., the existing manager under the trust deeds, whereby it purchased from the latter all its rights under the said trust deeds of October 1, 1954. The conveyance of such rights in the agreement of October 31, 1959, appears in para. 1 thereof as follows:\n1. The Vendor hereby sells, transfers and assigns unto the Purchaser and the Purchaser hereby accepts the sale, transfer and assignment of all the vendor\u2019s exclusive right and concession under the Indentures for and in consideration of the price of one million, nine hundred and thirteen thousand and sixty dollars ($1,913,060) payable upon the execution hereof.\nImmediately prior to that agreement of sale between Capital Management Corporation Limited and the appellant, the former had entered into amending agreements with the Montreal Trust Company which agreements were approved by the unit holders in both the All Canadian Dividend Fund and the All Canadian Compound Fund. By the agreements which were made on October 16, 1959, the manager, i.e., at that time the Capital Management Corporation Limited, was given the exclusive right and concession to manage all moneys and securities held by the trustees subject to the terms of the trust agreement for the period from October 16, 1959, to October 15, 1969. Also by those agreements the fees which the manager was to receive from the trustees were fixed at one-eighth of one per cent of the capital, again payable quarterly. It is the contention of the appellant that it is entitled to claim a capital cost allowance of an amount equal to one-tenth of the purchase price of $1,913,060, as set out in para. 1 of the agreement quoted above under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and Regulations.\nSection 11(1) of the Income Tax Act provides:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for the taxation year:\n(a) such part of the capital cost to the taxpayer of property, or such amount in respect to the capital cost to the taxpayer of property, if any, as is allowed by regulation;\nRegulation 1100(1) of the Income Tax Regulations provides:\n(1) Under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11 of the Act, there is hereby allowed to a taxpayer, in computing his income from a business or property, as the case may be, deductions for each taxation year equal to\n* * * Patent, Franchise, Concession or Licence\n(c) Such amount as he may claim in respect of property of class 14 in Schedule B not exceeding the lesser of\n(i) the aggregate of the amounts for the year obtained by apportioning the capital cost to him of each property over the life of the property remaining at the time the cost was incurred, or\n(ii) the undepreciated capital cost to him as of the end of the taxation year (before making any deduction under this subsection for the taxation year) of property of the class;\n* * *\nClass 14 of Schedule B reads:\nProperty that is a patent, franchise, concession or licence for a limited period in respect of property but not including\n(the exclusions are irrelevant).\nThe parties agree that Gibson J. correctly stated that the determination of the issue as to whether the appellant is entitled to such capital costs deduction is dependent upon the answer to the question:\nAre the rights or obligations obtained and assumed by the appellant pursuant to the agreement between it and the Capital Management Corporation Ltd. dated October 31st, 1959, \u201cproperty that is a patent, franchise, concession or licence for a limited period in respect of property\u201d?\nOf course, such rights are not a patent so the question narrows down to whether they were a franchise, concession or licence, and also whether they were \u201cin respect of property\u201d.\nGibson J. held that the rights which the appellant received from its predecessor under the said agreement were essentially the right to act as a managing agent for a set fee and that such right could not be described as a franchise, concession or licence in relation to property, and he therefore dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal from the assessment made by the Minister.\nThe appellant in its submission to Gibson J. and to this Court emphasized that its rights under the trust agreements which it purchased on October 31, 1959, were much more than the rights to act as manager for a fee, in that it had the sole right to designate the brokers who could sell the units in the two funds and was entitled to an acquisition fee of 2 per cent of the proceeds of the sale of any of those units. In addition, the broker or selling agent was entitled to a commission of 6 per cent although sometimes less than 6 per cent was paid as discounts were given for large purchases.\nUnder the trust agreements, the appellant was entitled, in the words of article XVII, s. 5:\n5. The Manager or any company in or with which it or its stockholders may be interested or affiliated or any officer or director of the Manager or of any such company may buy, sell, hold, own or deal in any of the certificates with the same rights as other holders thereof.\nThe appellant never did buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the certificates but it did purchase all the shares of an existing corporation known as General Mutual Funds Ltd. and that entity then sold a large number of units and obtained the 6 per cent commission aforesaid. The appellant obtained the 2 per cent acquisition fee on the units sold by General Mutual Funds Ltd. as well as on the units sold by a very large number of brokers all of whom it had chosen under its power in the trust deed. It is the appellant\u2019s submission that these rights are, therefore, a \u201cfranchise, concession or licence\u201d within the aforesaid class 14 of regulation 1100.\nThe respondent submits that those words, \u201cfranchise, concession or licence in respect of the property\u201d must be interpreted in the sense used by ordinary businessmen on this continent. Counsel for the respondent agrees that the words extend not only to certain kinds of privileges or monopolies conferred by virtue of statutory enactment but may also extend to rights created by contract between private parties. The respondent, however, submits that the English authorities dealing with similar words when used in contracts in reference to property are not helpful in interpreting the words used in income tax legislation on this continent. Counsel for the respondent, therefore, cites American dictionaries, and, particularly, Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, 3rd ed., which, at p. 902, defines \u201cfranchise\u201d as:\n3 a: a right or privilege conferred by grant from a sovereign or a government and vested in an individual or a group; specif; a right to do business conferred by a government\u2014see FRANCHISE TAX b: a constitutional or statutory right or privilege; esp: the right to vote\u2014usu. used with the c(1): the right granted to an individual or group to market a company\u2019s goods or services in a particular territory (2): the territory involved in such a right d: a contract for public works or public services granted by a government to an individual or company e(1): the right of membership granted by certain professional sports leagues (2): such membership itself (3): a team and the professional organization operating it having such membership f: the right to present, broadcast, or televise the events put on by a sports league or organization\u2026\nAnd at p. 470 where \u201cconcession\u201d is defined as:\na: a grant of land or other property esp. from a government in return for services rendered or proposed or for a particular use; specif: a tract granted to a foreign power in a Chinese treaty port or other trading center and permitted rights of extraterritoriality and local self-government b: a usu. exclusive right to undertake and profit by a specified activity [a\u2014to build a canal] [conflicting\u2014s in the oil fields] c: a lease of premises or a portion of premises for a particular purpose, esp. for some purpose supplementary to another activity (as the storing of wraps of patrons of a theatre) or for providing entertainment; often: the premises covered by such a concession or the activities for which it is granted [it was reported that some of the\u2014s at the fair were not honest]\u2026\nAnd at p. 1304, where \u201clicence\u201d is defined as:\n3 a(1): a right or permission granted in accordance with law by a competent authority to engage in some business or occupation, to do some act, or to engage in some transaction which but for such licence would be unlawful [a\u2014to sell liquor] [a marriage]\u2014[a\u2014to practice medicine] (2): a document evidencing a licence granted\u2026\nThere seems to have been only one decision in Courts in Canada which has any direct application to the present situation: The Investors Group v. M.N.R.[2], where Jackett P. considered a like appeal and expressed the view that the words \u201cfranchise, concession or licence\u201d in the statute were used to refer to some right, privilege or monopoly that enables the concessionaire or franchise holder to carry on his business or that facilitates the carrying on of his business and that they were not used to refer to a contract under which a person was entitled to remuneration for the performance of specific services. Gibson J. adopted this view in dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal. Counsel for the appellant submits that the present case should be distinguished from Investors Group v. M.N.R. on the ground that in that case all the taxpayer obtained under the agreement was a power to procure and recommend salesmen with a duty to finance their expenditures and that there was nothing to show that such power was an exclusive power. It is true that in the report of the case in 18 Dominion Tax Cases at page 457, Mr. St. Onge dealt with those circumstances but I did not find that the learned President in considering the appeal in the Exchequer Court placed any reliance whatsoever upon them. On the other hand, he based his decision solely on a consideration of the proper interpretation to be given to the words \u201cfranchise, concession or licence\u201d in business practice on this continent.\nCounsel for the respondent submits that the appellant in relying on the power which it alleges it had to deal with the units and advancing that power as one reason in interpreting its rights as a franchise, is misconstruing the power granted to it in the two trust deeds. Counsel for the respondent points out that the trust deeds themselves carefully distinguished between shares and certificates for shares, so in the trust deed setting up the All Canadian Dividend Fund it is provided in article IV, para. 2, \u201cshares may be purchased by or through persons authorized by the manager\u201d, and in para. 3, \u201cupon receipt of the purchase price of a share or shares by the trustee, the trustee shall issue to each such purchaser of such share or shares a certificate representing the number of shares purchased by him\u201d, while in article XVII, para. 5, it is provided:\n5. The Manager or any company in or with which it or its stockholders may be interested or affiliated or any officer or director of the Manager or of any such company may buy, sell, hold, own or deal in any of the certificates with the same rights as other holders thereof.\n(The underlining is my own).\nAnd by article XVI, para. 2, the same exact right is given to the trustee. I am in agreement with this submission of counsel for the respondent that the power given to the manager and, as I have said, also to the trustee, to deal in certificates is not a power by which it may purchase shares from treasury, but merely a power permitting it to buy and sell on the market certificates for such shares once they have been issued, a power which, of course, is a very frequent one in contracts appointing trustees of a fund or managing agents of a fund when those trustees or managing agents are in the business of dealing in securities and holding investments. Once this interpretation is accepted then the position of the appellant is reduced to that of a managing agent with a right to designate selling agents and to obtain a 2 per cent acquisition fee on sales of all shares by such agents. It is difficult to distinguish between that position and the position of the appellant in Investors Group v. M.N.R., and I have already expressed my agreement with the view of the learned President in that decision.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. I, therefore, find it unnecessary to refer to another submission made by counsel for the respondent, i.e., that whether the rights of the appellant are or are not a \u201cfranchise, concession or licence\u201d they are not \u201cin respect of property\u201d. I prefer to express no opinion on that submission.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Duquet, MacKay, Weldon, Bronstetter, Willis & Johnston, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

In Canada, it carried on the business of a general agent or ship broker, and in relation to ships owned by it, performed the duties and functions which would normally be performed by a general agent or ship broker. It also carried on the business of stevedoring in Canada and, in relation to some ships owned by it, performed the duties and functions which would normally be performed by a stevedore. It also performed similar services as agent, ship broker or stevedore for ships owned by other companies, in many of which the appellant, as a shareholder, held either a majority or a minority interest. Two issues were raised in this case: (1) Whether the income earned in Canada by the appellant as general agent or stevedore was income \u201cearned in Canada from the operation of a ship\u201d within the meaning of s. 10(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act and Article V of the Canada\u2011U.K. Tax Agreement (1946), and (2) Whether income it earned in Canada in respect of servicing or stevedoring its own ships whilst in Canada was also that kind of income.\nThe Exchequer Court held: (1) that neither s. 10(1)(c) of the Act nor Article V of the Convention exempted earnings of the appellant from managing or agency or stevedoring services which it rendered in Canada to other corporations; (2) that the appellant was entitled to exemption under these provisions in respect of the portions of the amounts treated as income by the Minister which arose from entries of charges made by the branches for agency and stevedoring services to ships which were owned or chartered by the appellant and operated in its own service; (3) that the appellant was entitled to deduct, in computing its income from business carried on in Canada, that portion of general head office administration expenses properly chargeable to its operations in Canada.\nThe company appealed to this Court from the first finding and the Minister cross\u2011appealed as to the second. The third finding was not in issue.\nHeld: The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nNothing needed be added to the reasons for judgment delivered by the trial judge. However, no reliance was placed upon the French text of the Canada-U.K. Tax Agreement.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Compagnie de navigation\u2014Revenu provenant d\u2019une entreprise exerc\u00e9e au Canada par une compagnie non r\u00e9sidante\u2014Exploitation de navires\u2014Convention entre le Canada et le Royaume-Uni relative \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t (1946), Articles II, III, IV, V\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 2(2), (4), 10(1)(c), 31(1).\nL\u2019appelante, une compagnie de navigation, a re\u00e7u son incorporation au Royaume-Uni et \u00e9tait une r\u00e9sidente de ce pays mais non pas du Canada, o\u00f9 elle op\u00e9rait des succursales dans plusieurs ports. Au Canada, l\u2019appelante agissait comme agent g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou courtier maritime, et accomplissait, par rapport aux navires lui appartenant, les devoirs et charges qui sont normalement accomplis par un agent g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou courtier maritime. Elle s\u2019occupait aussi de l\u2019arrimage des navires au Canada et accomplissait, par rapport \u00e0 certains navires lui appartenant, les devoirs et charges qui sont normalement accomplis par un arrimeur. Elle agissait aussi comme agent, courtier maritime ou arrimeur pour des navires appartenant \u00e0 d\u2019autres compagnies et dont elle d\u00e9tenait, comme actionnaire, une majorit\u00e9 ou une minorit\u00e9 des actions. Deux questions se soul\u00e8vent dans cette cause: (1) Est-ce que le revenu gagn\u00e9 au Canada par l\u2019appelante comme agent g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou arrimeur \u00e9tait un revenu \u00abgagn\u00e9 au Canada par suite de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un navire\u00bb dans le sens de l\u2019art. 10(1) (c) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019Article V de la Convention entre le Canada et le Royaume-Uni relative \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t (1946), et (2) Est-ce que le revenu qu\u2019elle a gagn\u00e9 au Canada par suite des services d\u2019arrimage ou autres rendus \u00e0 ses propres navires alors qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient au Canada tombait aussi dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a statu\u00e9: (1) que ni l\u2019art. 10(1)(c) de la Loi et ni l\u2019Article V de la Convention n\u2019exemptaient les recettes provenant des services de g\u00e9rant ou d\u2019arrimeur que la compagnie a rendus au Canada \u00e0 d\u2019autres corporations; (2) que l\u2019appelante avait droit \u00e0 une exemption, en vertu de ces dispositions, quant \u00e0 la partie des montants, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Ministre comme \u00e9tant un revenu, provenant de charges soumises par les succursales pour des services d\u2019agence et d\u2019arrimage \u00e0 des navires lui appartenant ou affr\u00e9t\u00e9s par elle et affect\u00e9s \u00e0 ses propres services; (3) que l\u2019appelante avait droit de d\u00e9duire, en calculant le revenu lui provenant d\u2019une entreprise exerc\u00e9e au Canada, cette partie des d\u00e9penses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales provenant de l\u2019administration du bureau-chef, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 bon droit \u00e0 la charge des op\u00e9rations au Canada.\nLa compagnie en appela devant cette Cour \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la premi\u00e8re conclusion de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, et le Ministre produisit un contre-appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la deuxi\u00e8me conclusion.

Heward Stikeman, Q.C., W. David Angus and Peter F. Cumyn, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie and M.A. Mogan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal and cross-appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Thurlow of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, which allowed in part the appellant\u2019s appeal from income tax assessments made for its taxation years 1957 to 1963 inclusive. The principal issue on both the appeal and cross-appeal is the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase, \u201cincome\u2026 earned in Canada from the operation of a ship\u201d found in para. (c) of subs. (1) of s. 10 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and the phrase \u201cprofits which a resident\u2026 derives from operating ships\u201d found in Article V of the Tax Convention of June 5, 1946, between Canada and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Statutes of Canada 1946, c. 38.\nThis raises two questions, namely:\n(1) Whether income which the appellant earned in Canada in its character as a general agent or stevedore is \u201cincome\u2026 earned in Canada from the operation of a ship\u201d or \u201cprofits which\u2026 (the appellant) derives from operating ships\u201d; and\n(2) Whether income which the appellant earned in Canada in respect of servicing or stevedoring its own ships whilst in territorial waters in Canada is \u201cincome\u2026 earned in Canada from the operation of a ship\u201d or \u201cprofits which\u2026 (the appellant) derives from operating ships\u201d.\nSection 10(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act provides:\n10. (1) There shall not be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n(c) the income for the year of a non-resident person earned in Canada from the operation of a ship or aircraft owned or operated by him, if the country where that person resided grants substantially similar relief for the year to a person resident in Canada.\nArticle V of the Canada-U.K. Tax Convention provides:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Articles III and IV, profits which a resident of one of the territories derives from operating ships or aircraft shall be exempt from tax in the other territory.\nThere is no serious dispute between the parties as to the relevant facts. The appellant was incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom and has its registered office in London. It operates branch offices at various Canadian ports and its chief Canadian office is at Montreal. It is common ground that appellant is resident in the United Kingdom and is not resident in Canada.\nIn Canada, the appellant carries on the business of a general agent or ship-broker and, in relation to ships owned by it, performs the duties and functions which would normally be performed by a general agent or ship-broker. Also, the appellant carries on the business of stevedoring in Canada and, in relation to some ships owned by it, performs the duties and functions which would normally be performed by a stevedore. It also performs similar services as agent, ship-broker or stevedore for ships owned by other companies, in many of which appellant, as a shareholder, holds either a majority or minority interest.\nThe learned trial judge held:\n1. That neither s. 10(1) (c) of the Income Tax Act nor Article V of the Tax Convention exempts earnings of the appellant from managing or agency or stevedoring services which it renders in Canada to other corporations.\n2. That appellant is entitled to exemption under these provisions in respect of the portions of the amounts treated as income by the Minister, which arose from entries of charges made by the branches for \u201cagency\u201d and stevedoring services to ships which were owned or chartered by the appellant and were operated in its own service.\n3. That appellant is entitled to deduct, in computing its income from business carried on in Canada, that portion of general head office administration expenses properly chargeable to its operations in Canada.\nAppellant appealed to this Court from the first finding and the Minister cross-appealed as to the second. There is no cross-appeal from the third finding.\nThere is nothing that I can usefully add to the able and exhaustive reasons for judgment of Thurlow J., with which I am in agreement, and I am content to adopt them with one minor exception. In interpreting Article V of the Canada-U.K. Tax Convention, I do not rely upon the translation of the Convention, which appears as a Schedule to the French text of the Statutes of Canada 1946, c. 38.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman, Elliott, Tamaki, Mercier & Robb, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n[1] [1967] 1 Ex. C.R. 353, [1966] C.T.C. 482, 66 D.T.C. 5358.\n"

The 36-month taxation exemption period under s. 83(5) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, commenced on March 1, 1956, and ended on February 28, 1959. During that period the income derived from the operation of its mine was not included in computing the appellant\u2019s income for tax purposes. By 1957, the appellant was able to accumulate profits from the production of the mine at such a rate that they exceeded the requirements for the payment of interest on the debentures as well as the requirements for repayment of the said debentures. The company decided then to invest its profits in short term investments. In assessing the appellant, the Minister added to the taxable income of the appellant the income received from the short term investments for the years 1958, 1959 and 1960. The appellant submitted that, in accordance with recognized accounting practice, the interest paid on the debentures should be deducted from the interest received on the short term investments so as to report only the net amount as income. It argued that during the tax exempt period, the interest paid could be regarded as a cost of earning the non-exempt income received from the short term investments. It argued further that, following the tax exempt period, the interest paid on the debentures should not be deducted in computing its depletion base under s. 1201(2) of the Income Tax Regulations. The Exchequer Court affirmed the Minister\u2019s assessment. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe income from the short term investments was not income derived from the operation of the mine within the meaning of s. 83(5) of the Income Tax Act, but was income derived from the investment of the profits of the mine. That income could not be claimed as exempt under the Act.\nThe Minister rightly refused to allow a depletion allowance upon the income received from the short term investments. Such income could not be considered as profits for the taxation year reasonably attributable to the production of prime metal or industrial minerals, within the meaning of s. 1201(2) of the Regulations.

D\u00e8s l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1957, les profits provenant de la production de la mine s\u2019accumulaient \u00e0 un tel degr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils exc\u00e9daient les montants requis pour payer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les titres d\u2019obligations ainsi que pour faire les versements en vue du rachat de ces titres d\u2019obligations.

L\u2019appelante soutient que selon la pratique reconnue en comptabilit\u00e9, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pay\u00e9 sur les titres d\u2019obligations devait \u00eatre d\u00e9duit de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat provenant des investissements \u00e0 court terme pour que seul le montant net soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme revenu. Elle soutient que durant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019exemption de taxe, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019elle payait pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme\u2019 \u00e9tant une partie du co\u00fbt requis pour gagner le revenu non exempt provenant des investissements \u00e0 court terme.

Appel rejet\u00e9. APPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nR.M. Sedgewick, Q.C., and J.A. Langford, for the appellant.\nD.G.H. Bowman and Paul Dioguardi, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court1 delivered on September 30, 1965, which dismissed the appeal from the decision of the Tax Appeal Board delivered on September 24, 1963. By that decision the Tax Appeal Board had confirmed the assessment of the Minister as to the 1958, 1959 and 1960 income tax payable by the appellant.\nThe Minister in his assessment had added to the taxable income of the appellant income from short term investments received in each of the said years. The following were the circumstances.\nThe appellant, or perhaps one might more correctly say the appellant\u2019s predecessor Gunnar Mines Limited, was developing a very large uranium ore open pit mine at Beaver Lodge in the Lake Athabasca area of Saskatchewan. The ore had been sold to Eldorado Mining & Refining Limited under a contract providing for total payments of nearly $77,000,000. Gunnar Mines Limited determined to borrow on debenture a capital sum of $19,500,000 and for such purposes issued 5 per cent debentures in that sum. The Canada Permanent Trust Company was the trustee for the debenture holders and as such received the net proceeds of the sale of the debentures in the sum of $18,700,000. The said proceeds were held by the said trust company and paid out to Gunnar Mines Limited from time to time upon the latter\u2019s certificates as to the payment of the costs of construction of the proposed mine. Those parts of the proceeds of the debentures issued which were not immediately required by Gunnar Mines Limited for the purpose of expenditure upon the construction of the mine were kept invested by the trustee in short term securities and the income therefrom in the amount of $104,000 was used by Gunnar for construction purposes. That item of $104,000 was charged against the 5 per cent interest payable on the outstanding debentures. In making its 1954 and 1955 income tax returns, Gunnar divided the sum of $104,000 between these two taxation years and deducted the two amounts from the interest paid on the 5 per cent sinking fund debenture. That process was permitted by the Minister in the two years mentioned.\nThe mine was completed in October 1955 and all the proceeds of the debentures were paid out by the trustee to Gunnar on or before that time. The income tax authorities agreed to consider the period between October 1955 and February 28, 1956, as a run-in period and to take the following day, i.e., March 1, 1956, as the first day upon which production of the mine commenced. This was for the purpose of applying the 36-month taxation exemption under s. 83(5) of the Income Tax Act to which reference shall be made hereafter.\nProduction of uranium from the mine was so successful that the taxpayer was able to accumulate profits therefrom at such a rate that they exceeded the requirements for the payment of interest on the debentures and also the requirements for repayment in instalments of the said debentures. Under the trust deed, those debentures were to be redeemed as follows:\nOctober 1, 1956.............................................................................\n$ 2,500,000\nOctober 1, 1957.............................................................................\n4,250,000\nOctober 1, 1958.............................................................................\n4,250,000\nOctober 1, 1959.............................................................................\n4,250,000\nOctober 1, 1960.............................................................................\n4,250,000\nTotal.........................................................................................\n$19,500,000\nThe company, therefore, had to determine its course. It could use these funds to redeem the sinking fund debentures prior to their due date or the company could go out into the market and purchase for cancellation the said sinking fund debentures or it could invest its profits in such short term securities as would permit it to redeem the sinking fund debentures in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. Had the company called the sinking fund debentures for redemption prior to their due date it would have been required to pay a premium. It was informed by its financial advisers that if it sought to go into the market to purchase the said sinking fund debentures for cancellation the market would immediately react so that the price would increase to equal the premium for redemption prior to the due date and the company therefore determined to invest its profits in short term securities.\nIn the three years under consideration, i.e., 1958, 1959 and 1960, this resulted in the taxpayer receiving an income from the said short term securities as follows:\n1958..............................................................\n$231,197.94\n1959..............................................................\n412,852.85\n1960..............................................................\n504,763.64 (as adjusted by the Minister in his reassessment)\nDuring the same years, the liability for interest upon the 5 per cent sinking fund debentures of the taxpayer was in these amounts:\n1958..............................................................\n$485,878.00\n1959..............................................................\n263,092.00\n1960..............................................................\n114,603.00\nThe 36-month exemption period allowed by s. 83(5) to which I have referred above having commenced on March 1, 1956, ended on that day in 1959, and therefore the 1959 figures must be divided so that the first two months showed an income from short term investments, of $68,922.28 and the remaining ten months in the next exemption period showed an income from such short term investments of $343,950.57, while the interest payable on the 5 per cent sinking fund debentures in the first two months was $60,152 and in the remaining ten months, i.e., the non-exempt period, was $175,940. That the financial advisers\u2019 opinion was a sound one is demonstrated by the fact that during those three years the interest payable on the 5 per cent sinking fund debentures totalled $836,572.90 while the income received on the short term investments made by the company out of its profits in the same three years totalled $1,148,814.20, a credit of $312,241.30. Mr. Richard M. Parkinson, a chartered accountant, described before Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court the method used by the company in its accounting. His evidence is summarized by the learned Exchequer Court Judge as follows:\nThe evidence of Mr. Parkinson in brief was that it was proper from a commercial and business point of view for the Appellant, or indeed for any business, to differentiate in its statement of income and expenditures between what he refers to as \u201coperating items\u201d and \u201cnon-operating items\u201d.\nThe figure obtained by considering only operating items, this witness said, results in arriving at a figure of \u201coperating income\u201d. This is done by first obtaining the figure of gross sales less returns, allowances, etc., and subtracting from that sum the cost of sales to arrive at a figure for gross profit. From this figure is then deducted selling expenses and general and administrative expenses from which the figure of operating income is obtained.\nThen this witness said it is proper to consider the non-operating items in the business.\nThese non-operating items the witness said are categorized as \u201cother income\u201d, and include interest and dividends and miscellaneous items on the receipt side and also on the disbursement side; and from which there is computed the figure of income before federal and other taxes. Then the Witness said that it is proper to make a computation of federal and other taxes and subtract the figure so found from the figure of income above referred to, in order to obtain the figure of \u201cnet income\u201d of the business for the fiscal year.\nThe learned Exchequer Court Judge in his reasons said:\nI accept Mr. Parkinson\u2019s evidence in so far as it describes a method currently recommended as good practice and employed by many accountants in determining the profit or loss of a company from its business operations including miscellaneous revenues of investments of surplus cash. His method no doubt is not only good accounting practice, but is also acceptable as a method of determining the company\u2019s income for the purpose of the Income Tax Act for a fiscal year (when the Company is taxable on its income from all sources) in that it is not contrary to any particular statutory direction.\nIn the matter under appeal, however, what is being considered is not income for the year from all sources but income from a source other than the company\u2019s mining business, namely, the income from its short term investments.\n(The underlining is my own).\nI am in agreement with that comment.\nSection 83(5) of the Income Tax Act provides:\n83. (5) Subject to prescribed conditions, there shall not be included in computing the income of a corporation income, derived from the operation of a mine during the period of 36 months commencing with the day on which the mine came into production. Section 11(1) (c) of the said Income Tax Act provides:\n11. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year:\n(c) an amount paid in the year or payable in respect of the year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the taxpayer in computing his income), pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on\n(i) borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than borrowed money used to acquire property the income from which would be exempt),\n(ii) an amount payable for property acquired for the purpose of gaining or producing income therefrom or for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business (other than property the income from which would be exempt), or\n(iii) an amount paid to the taxpayer under \u2026\nThe appellant, therefore, was entitled under s. 11 of the Income Tax Act to deduct from its income the interest which it would be required by law to pay on the 5 per cent sinking fund debentures. That amount in the year 1958 was $485,878, in the year 1959 was $236,092, and in the year 1960 was $114,603.\nThe appellant did not deduct those amounts from its taxable income but in each year a smaller amount which resulted from crediting against that interest payable the income received from its short term investments. In fact in 1959 and 1960 that income far exceeded the interest payable. The result in the tax exempt period which covers the whole of the year 1958 and the first two months of 1959 was that those amounts of income from short term investments were thrown into the income from the operation of the mine and therefore claimed as exempt under s. 83(5) of the Income Tax Act. What is exempt under the latter section is \u201cincome derived from the operation of a mine\u201d. The income from the short term investments was not income derived from the operation of the mine but was income derived from the investment of the profits of the mine. This income from the short term investments cannot be regarded as incidental income in the operation of the mine any more than any other income gained from use of the profits of the mine could be so considered. As the learned member of the Tax Appeal Board noted in his reasons:\nEven if Gunnar had held the surplus revenue from its mine on deposit, the bank interest could not be said to be derived from the operation of its mine.\nCounsel of the appellant stressed the circumstance that in the tax exempt period the corporation also showed as incidental income rental which it received from the letting of certain houses at the mine property and argued that the income from the short term securities was just another form of income incidental to the mining operation. I do not think that the argument can be accepted. Those houses were built by the company so that its workers at the mine might reside therein. Certainly their construction and letting, and the receipt of rental therefrom, was incidental to the operation of the mine. To put it perhaps colloquially, during the tax exempt period the appellant was operating two businesses\u2014firstly, a mining business, and secondly, an investment business, and the fact that its purpose in operating the second business was so that it might accumulate funds in a readily realizable form with which it could pay off the 5 per cent sinking fund debentures if they became due makes it nonetheless the operation of a second business.\nIn my view, this is sufficient to dispose of the appellant\u2019s appeal in reference to the tax exempt period ending on February 28, 1959.\nThe appellant\u2019s appeal as to the non-exempt period being the last ten months of the year 1959 and the last eleven months of the year 1960 (the fiscal year having been altered to end on November 30) deals with the Minister\u2019s refusal to allow the quantum of the depletion allowance claimed by the appellant as authorized by regulation 1201(2) made under the Income Tax Act. The said regulation provides:\n1201. (2) Where a taxpayer operates one or more resources, the deduction allowed is 33\u2153% of\n(a) the aggregate of his profits for the taxation year reasonably attributable to the production of oil, gas, prime metal or industrial minerals from all of the resources operated by him\n* * * The appellant claimed a depletion allowance upon its total income including income from these short term investments. As the learned Exchequer Court Judge remarked:\nIn the matter under appeal, however, what is being considered is not income for the year from all sources but income from a source other than the company\u2019s mining business, namely, the income from its short term investments.,\nIt would seem that the income from such short term investments could not possibly be considered as \u201cprofits for the taxation year reasonably attributable to the production of \u2026prime metal or industrial minerals\u2026\u201d. I am, therefore, of the opinion, that the Minister\u2019s limitation on the depletion allowance as confirmed by the Income Tax Appeal Board\u2019 and the Exchequer Court was a proper one.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Miller, Thomson, Hicks, Sedgewick, Lewis & Healey, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

On the day he was sentenced and pursuant to s. 49(3) of the Penitentiary Act, he signed a written notice waiving all rights of appeal. Subsequently, he applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to appeal to that Court from his sentence. His application was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. He then applied to this Court for leave to appeal from that refusal.\nHeld: The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed. This would be a case to grant leave to appeal if this Court had jurisdiction to do so. However, such jurisdiction cannot be found either in the Criminal Code or in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. In Paul v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 452, this Court reached the view that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal in a criminal matter. A fortiori must a like view obtain in the case of an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing an extension of time for appealing in a criminal matter and, more particularly so, when the true question, sought to be brought for review ultimately, relates to sentence.\nDroit criminel\u2014Appels\u2014Juridiction\u2014Permission d\u2019appeler\u2014Rejet par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour \u00e9tendre les d\u00e9lais pour appeler devant elle d\u2019une sentence\u2014La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a-t-elle juridiction pour accorder la permission d\u2019appeler\u2014Loi sur les p\u00e9nitenciers, S.R.C. 1952, c. 206, art. 49(3)\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 41\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 697(l)(b).\nLe requ\u00e9rant a plaid\u00e9 coupable sur une accusation de vol qualifi\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emprisonnement pour dix ans. Le jour o\u00f9 la sentence fut prononc\u00e9e, et en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019art. 49(3) de la Loi sur les p\u00e9nitenciers, il a sign\u00e9 un avis \u00e9crit en vertu duquel il se d\u00e9sistait de tous ses droits d\u2019appel. Subs\u00e9quemment, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019Appel une requ\u00eate pour obtenir une extension des d\u00e9lais pour appeler devant elle de sa sentence. Sa requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019Appel. Il a alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate devant cette Cour pour obtenir la permission d\u2019en appeler de ce refus.\nArr\u00eat: La requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nIl s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un cas o\u00f9, si cette Cour avait juridiction de le faire, la permission d\u2019appeler devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Cependant, on ne peut pas trouver une telle juridiction ni dans le Code criminel ni dans l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame. Dans la cause de Paul v. The Queen, [1960] R.C.S. 452, cette Cour a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas la juridiction pour accorder une requ\u00eate demandant la permission d\u2019appeler d\u2019un jugement d\u2019une Cour d\u2019Appel ayant refus\u00e9 la permission d\u2019appeler dans une mati\u00e8re criminelle. Un point de vue semblable doit a fortiori pr\u00e9valoir dans le cas d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler d\u2019un jugement d\u2019une Cour d\u2019Appel refusant d\u2019\u00e9tendre les d\u00e9lais pour appeler dans une mati\u00e8re criminelle et, encore plus, lorsque la question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre en d\u00e9finitive concerne une sentence.\nREQU\u00caTE pour permission d\u2019appeler d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel de l\u2019Ontario, refusant d\u2019\u00e9tendre les d\u00e9lais pour appeler d\u2019une sentence. Requ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, refusing an extension of time to appeal from a sentence. Application dismissed.\nB.A. Crane, for the applicant.\nC. Meinhardt, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014Thomas William Hind applies for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed his application for an extension of time to appeal to that Court from a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, imposed upon him by His Honour Magistrate Kurata, upon a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery with violence.\nIn its reasons for judgment, the Court of Appeal relates the circumstances of this bank robbery, refers to the criminal record of the applicant and concludes that, having regard to his previous convictions and the nature of the offence of which he was convicted, there was no merit in the application. The Court also notes that the applicant had waived all rights of appeal. In fact, on the day he was sentenced, he gave a written notice to this effect, pursuant to s.49(3) of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 206, which provides, inter alia, that, upon such a notice, the time limited for appeal shall be deemed to have expired. With respect to this waiver, the circumstances attending its signature and the position taken by applicant in this regard, the Court of Appeal makes these observations:\nThe accused had signed a waiver while imprisoned at the Don Gaol and in his application for extension of time for appealing he stated that he had signed the waiver \u2018without being informed of and without realizing I was signing away my rights: The signing of the waiver took place late at night and I was caught unawares (sic) of what I was doing.\u2019 Mr. G.A. Taggart (an official of the Court of Appeal) communicated with the authorities at the Don Gaol and was advised that the accused had had his rights fully explained to him and that the waiver was signed not late at night but before six o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nThe grounds upon which the applicant is seeking leave to appeal to this Court are formulated as follows:\n(1) Had the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of the application in the absence of the accused, who was in custody, not represented by counsel, had submitted no written argument, had requested permission to argue his application in person, and was not notified of the date of the hearing of the application?\n(2) Had the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to adjudicate the question of fact surrounding the signing by the Applicant of a waiver of his right to appeal in the absence of legally admissible evidence regarding this issue? The criminal record of the applicant and the nature of the crime for which he was convicted may or may not justify, as a proper one, the sentence imposed upon him. This question is not before us and is not, furthermore, susceptible, in law, to be entertained by this Court: Goldhar v. The Queen[1]. We are here concerned with an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing an extension of time for appealing to that Court from a sentence.\nHaving considered the grounds raised in support of the application and the material, in the record, which is relevant to these grounds, I would be disposed to grant leave to appeal had this Court jurisdiction to do so, having regard to the nature of the judgment a quo. It is obvious that this Court has no jurisdiction to exercise a jurisdiction, over a Court of Appeal, similar to that which the High Court exercises over inferior tribunals, in certiorari proceedings. It is also clear that this Court can only deal with a judgment of a Court of Appeal, by way of appeal, if jurisdiction to do so can be found in some statutory enactment. Welch v. The King[2]; Okalta Oils Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue[3]; Chagnon v. Normand[4]; William Cully v. Fran\u00e7ois alias Francis Ferdais[5]. With respect to a judgment of the nature of the judgment a quo, such a jurisdiction cannot be found either in the Criminal Code or in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The provisions of s. 597(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, upon which the application purports to be made, have particularly no application in the matter. In Paul v. The Queen[6], this Court, having to consider whether it had jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal in a criminal matter, reached the view that it had none. A fortiori, in my opinion, must a like view obtain in the case of an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing an extension of time for appealing in a criminal matter and, more particularly so, when the true question, sought to be brought for review ultimately, relates to sentence: The Queen v. J. Alepin & Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e et al[7].\nI would refuse the application for lack of jurisdiction.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitors for the applicant: Croll, Borins & Goldberg, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] S.C.R. 60, 125 C.C.C. 209, 31 C.R. 374.\n[2] [1950] S.CR. 412 at 428, 97 C.C.C. 177, 10 C.R. 97, 3 D.L.R. 641.\n[3] [1955] S.C.R. 824 at 825, [1955] C.T.C. 271, 55 D.T.C. 1176, 5 D.L.R. 614.\n[4] (1889), 16 S.C.R. 661 at 662.\n[5] (1900), 30 S.C.R. 330 at 333.\n[6] [1960] S.C.R. 452, 127 C.C.C. 129, 34 CR. 110.\n[7] [1965] S.C.R. 359 at 364, 3 C.C.C. 1, 46 C.R. 113, 49 D.L.R.

Act, 1867, s. 91(2). The Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board was created as a corporation by the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Act, 1955-56 (Que.), c. 37, and was empowered, inter alia, to approve joint marketing plans. In 1957, it approved a joint marketing plan with respect to Carnation Company Limited and its suppliers of milk. The administration of the plan was entrusted to a Producers\u2019 Board which had power to negotiate with the buyer\u2014the appellant company\u2014for the marketing and sale to it of milk and dairy products from the farms of producers bound by the plan. The parties to the plan were unsuccessful in their attempts to reach agreement as to the purchase price of milk to be purchased by the appellant from the producers. The Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board, as it was authorized by law to do, intervened as arbitrator and determined the price that the appellant had to pay its producers for the milk it bought from them. The milk purchased by the appellant was processed by it and, as to a major portion of its product, exported from the province. The appellant company took the position that the orders of the Marketing Board\u2014approving the plan and determining the price to be paid by the appellant\u2014were invalid because they constituted the regulation of trade and commerce within the meaning of s. 91(2) of the B.N.A. Act, a field reserved to the Parliament of Canada. The validity of the orders in question was upheld by the Superior Court and by the Court of Appeal. The company was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General for Alberta were granted leave to intervene in the proceedings.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIn making these orders, the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board did not infringe on the exclusive legislative powers of Parliament under s. 91(2) of the B.N.A. Act to regulate trade and commerce. The purpose of these orders was to regulate, on behalf of a particular group of Quebec producers, their trade with the appellant for the sale to it, in Quebec, of their milk. The orders were not directed at the regulation of interprovincial trade. They did not purport directly to control or to restrict such trade. There was no evidence that, in fact, they did control or restrict it. The most that can be said of them is that they had some effect upon the cost of doing business in Quebec of a company engaged in interprovincial trade, and that, by itself, is not sufficient to make them invalid.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014R\u00e9gie des march\u00e9s agricoles du Qu\u00e9bec\u2014Validit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cisions prises par la R\u00e9gie\u2014D\u00e9cision approuvant un plan conjoint de mise en march\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 une compagnie de lait \u00e9vapor\u00e9\u2014D\u00e9cision \u00e9tablissant le prix d\u2019achat du lait devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par la compagnie aux producteurs\u2014La majeure partie des produits export\u00e9e\u2014Les d\u00e9cisions sont-elles ultra vires comme \u00e9tant la r\u00e9glementation du trafic et du commerce\u2014Loi des march\u00e9s agricoles du Qu\u00e9bec, 1955-56 (Que.), c. 37, telle que remplac\u00e9e par 1963 (Qu\u00e9.), c. 34\u2014Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867, art. 91(2) .\nLa R\u00e9gie des march\u00e9s agricoles du Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e comme corporation par la Loi des march\u00e9s agricoles du Qu\u00e9bec, 1955-56 (Qu\u00e9.), c. 37, et a re\u00e7u les pouvoirs, inter alia, d\u2019approuver des plans conjoints de mise en march\u00e9.

L\u2019administration du plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 un office de producteurs qui avait le pouvoir de n\u00e9gocier avec l\u2019acheteur\u2014la compagnie appelante\u2014relativement \u00e0 la mise sur le march\u00e9 et \u00e0 la vente du lait et des produits laitiers provenant des fermes appartenant aux producteurs li\u00e9s par le plan.

La R\u00e9gie des march\u00e9s agricoles du Qu\u00e9bec, ainsi qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e de le faire, est intervenue comme arbitre et a \u00e9tabli le prix que l\u2019appelante devait payer aux producteurs pour le lait qu\u2019elle achetait d\u2019eux. Le lait achet\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante est transform\u00e9 par elle et, quant \u00e0 la majeure partie de ses produits, elle l\u2019exportait en dehors de la province. La compagnie appelante pr\u00e9tend que les d\u00e9cisions de la R\u00e9gie\u2014approuvant le plan et \u00e9tablissant le prix devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante\u2014\u00e9taient invalides parce qu\u2019elles constituaient la r\u00e9glementation du trafic et du commerce dans le sens de l\u2019art. 91(2) de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, domaine qui est de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada.

Il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve que, en fait, elles contr\u00f4laient ou restreignaient ce commerce.

Crane, for the Attorney General for Alberta.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the Province of Quebec (Appeal Side)1, which confirmed the judgment given in the Superior Court, upholding the validity of three decisions of the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Marketing Board\u201d. The question in issue before this Court is as to whether, in making these orders, the Marketing Board had infringed on the exclusive legislative powers of Parliament under s. 91(2) of the British North America Act to regulate trade and commerce. Submissions on this issue were made on behalf of the Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorney-General of Alberta, in addition to those presented by the parties to the litigation.\nThe Marketing Board was created as a corporation by the provisions of the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Act, 4-5 Eliz. II, 1955-56 (Que.), c. 37. It was empowered, inter alia, to approve joint marketing plans, and to arbitrate any dispute arising in the course of carrying out a joint marketing plan. The Act provided that ten or more producers of agricultural products in any territory in Quebec could apply to the Marketing Board for approval of a joint plan for the marketing of one or more classes of farm products in such territory, if such plan was supported by a vote of at least 75 per cent in number and value of all producers concerned.\nOn July 25, 1957, the Marketing Board approved The Quebec Carnation Company Milk Producers\u2019 Plan. The administration of the Plan was entrusted to The Quebec Carnation Company Milk Producers\u2019 Board. The Plan bound all bona fide milk producers shipping milk and dairy products to any of the plants of the appellant in Quebec. The Producers\u2019 Board had power to negotiate with the buyer (the appellant) for the marketing and sale to it of milk and dairy products from the farms of producers bound by the Plan. The Plan provided for a board of arbitration, which might be the Marketing Board, to decide conflicts in the event of a failure to agree with the appellant in the negotiation or execution of a convention.\nAgreement was not reached as to the purchase price of milk to be purchased by the appellant from the producers, pursuant to the Plan. The matter was arbitrated by the Marketing Board which, after hearing evidence for both sides, wrote extensive reasons, and determined a price of $3.07 per hundred pounds, on December 18, 1958. Subsequently, on June 11, 1962, after a further arbitration, the Marketing Board decided on a price of $2.78 per hundred pounds.\nIt is these three orders of the Marketing Board, which approved the Plan, and which determined the price to be paid by the appellant for milk purchased from producers subject to the Plan, which are the subject of the appellant\u2019s attack.\nThe appellant was incorporated under the Canadian Companies Act, and has its head office in Toronto. It operates, in Quebec, an evaporated milk plant at Sherbrooke and a receiving station at Waterloo.\nDuring the period concerned, it purchased raw milk from approximately 2,000 farmers, situated mostly in the Eastern Townships. At the Sherbrooke plant it processes raw milk into evaporated milk. The major part of such production is shipped and sold outside Quebec. Milk received at the Waterloo receiving station, during the relevant period, was either sent to the Sherbrooke plant, for processing, or else, skimmed, the butterfat being sold to other manufacturers, and the skim milk being sent to appellant\u2019s plant at Alexandria, Ontario, to be processed into skim milk powder.\nThe appellant, during the relevant period, was the only evaporated milk manufacturer in Quebec, with the exception of the Granby Co-operative, which, as a co-operative, was not subject to the provisions of the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Act. The evidence showed that, since December 18, 1958, the date of the first arbitration award, prices paid by the appellant were about 10 to 25 cents per hundred pounds higher than those paid by other purchasers of raw milk in the same area.\nThe Quebec Agricultural Marketing Act was repealed in 1963 and replaced by a new Act, with the same title, 11-12 Eliz. II, 1963 (Que.), c. 34. Section 54 of the new Act provides that:\n54. The joint plans approved under the act 4-5 Elizabeth II, chapter 37, and in existence on the day of the coming into force of this act, as well as the agreements and decisions relating thereto, shall remain in force and shall be subject to the provisions of this act.\nSuch plans and the agreements and decisions relating thereto shall not be invalid by reason of the fact that they contemplate the marketing of a farm product in a territory other than that of the origin of such product, or the marketing of a farm product intended for a specified purpose or purchaser. This provision shall apply to pending cases except as to costs.\nThis provision met the objection which had originally been made by the appellant that the Marketing Plan was invalid because it did not fix a minimum price for milk to be paid by all buyers in a given territory and because it applied only to the appellant as a buyer.\nSection 18 of the first Act had provided:\n18. Ten or more producers in any territory of the Province may apply to the Provincial Board for the approval of a joint plan for the marketing of one or more classes of farm products within such territory.\nSection 19 of the new Act provides:\n19. Ten or more interested producers may apply to the Board for the approval of a joint plan for the marketing in the Province of a farm product derived from a designated territory or intended for a specified purpose or a particular purchaser.\nIt is clear that both these provisions relate to the marketing of milk only in the Province of Quebec.\nThe position taken by the appellant is that the three orders of the Marketing Board are invalid because they enable it to set a price to be paid by the appellant for a product the major portion of which, after processing, will be used by it for export out of Quebec. This, it is contended, constitutes the regulation of trade and commerce within the meaning of s. 91(2) of the British North America Act, a field reserved to the Parliament of Canada. The appellant, in support of this submission, relies upon the reasons of four of the judges of this Court in the Reference Respecting The Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950, Chapter 181, As Amended[2], which case is hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Ontario Reference\u201d.\nThis was a reference made to the Court by the Governor General in Council concerning: (i) the validity of s. 3(1) (I)of The Farm Products Marketing Act, (ii) of a regulation made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and three regulations made by the Farm Products Marketing Board, pursuant to the Act, (iii) of an order made by that Board, and (iv) of a proposed amendment to the Act, including the scope of authority of the Board under that amendment.\nFauteux J., at p. 248, summarized the provisions of the Act as follows:\nThe scheme of the Act may be summarily described as follows: Ten per cent. of the producers engaged, within a given area, in the production of a farm product, may propose the adoption of a compulsory scheme for marketing or regulating the farm product. If the scheme is approved by a certain majority of producers, the Farm Products Marketing Board, whose members are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in council, may recommend its adoption to the latter who may approve it with such variations as deemed proper and declare it in force. Marketing operations under the scheme are conducted by a local board in accordance with the terms of the scheme but the Board may also designate marketing agencies. The scheme may include a system of licensing of persons engaged in producing, marketing or processing the regulated product. This licensing is done under the regulations made by the Board which may prohibit persons from engaging in such operations, except under the authority of a licence. Licence fees, to be used by the local board for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the Act, the regulations and the scheme, may be authorized by the Board. The actual direction of the marketing is done by either the Board, a local board or a marketing agency which, appointed by and acting pursuant to the regulations of the Board, directs and controls the marketing of the product. The marketing agency may be authorized to conduct a pool for the distribution of all moneys received from sales of the product and having deducted its necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sales in such a manner that each person receives a share in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him. Violators of any provisions of the Act, of the regulations, of the schemes declared to be in force, or of any order or direction of the Board, local board or marketing agency, shall be guilty of an offence and liable to monetary penalties.\nSection 3(1) (l) of the Act authorized the provincial Farm Products Marketing Board to:\nauthorize any marketing agency appointed under a scheme to conduct a pool or pools for the distribution of all moneys received from the sale of the regulated product and requiring any such marketing agency, after deducting all necessary and proper disbursements and expenses, to distribute the proceeds of sale in such manner that each person receives a share of the total proceeds in relation to the amount, variety, size, grade and class of the regulated product delivered by him and to make an initial payment on delivery of the product and subsequent payments until the total net proceeds are distributed.\nThe first question on the Reference was:\nAssuming that the said Act applies only in the case of intra-provincial transactions, is clause (I) of subsection 1 of section 3 of The Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1950 chapter 131 as amended by Ontario Statutes 1951, chapter 25, 1953, chapter 36, 1954, chapter 29, 1955, chapter 21 ultra vires the Ontario Legislature?\nFour of the members of the Court, Kerwin C.J., Rand J., Locke J. and Nolan J., were of the view that a transaction might take place within a province and yet not constitute an \u201cintra\u2011provincial\u201d transaction which would be subject to provincial control. They sought to define transactions of this kind. Thus, Kerwin C.J., at p. 204, had this to say:\nIt seems plain that the Province may regulate a transaction of sale and purchase in Ontario between a resident of the Province and one who resides outside its limits; that is, if an individual in Quebec comes to Ontario and there buys a hog, or vegetables, or peaches, the mere fact that he has the intention to take them from Ontario to Quebec does not deprive the Legislature of its power to regulate the transaction, as is evidenced by such enactments as The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 345. That is a matter of the regulation of contracts and not of trade as trade and in that respect the intention of the purchaser is immaterial. However, if the hog be sold to a packing plant or the vegetables or peaches to a cannery, the products of those establishments in the course of trade may be dealt with by the Legislature or by Parliament depending, on the one hand, upon whether all the products are sold or intended for sale within the Province or, on the other, whether some of them are sold or intended for sale beyond Provincial limits. It is, I think, impossible to fix any minimum proportion of such last\u2011mentioned sales or intended sales as determining the jurisdiction of Parliament. This applies to the sale by the original owner. Once a statute aims at \u201cregulation of trade in matters of inter\u2011provincial concern\u201d (The Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons; The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons, (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96 at 113), it is beyond the competence of a Provincial Legislature.\nRand J., at p. 209, says:\nThe definitive statement of the scope of Dominion and Provincial jurisdiction was made by Duff C.J. in Re The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, (1936) S.C.R. 398 at 414 et seq., (1936) 3 D.L.R. 622, 66 C.C.C. 180, affirmed sub nom. Attorney\u2011General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada et al., (1937) A.C. 377, (1937) 1 D.L.R. 691, (1937) 1 W.W.R. 328, 67 C.C.C. 337. The regulation of particular trades confined to the Province lies exclusively with the Legislature subject, it may be, to Dominion general regulation affecting all trade, and to such incidental intrusion by the Dominion as may be necessary to prevent the defeat of Dominion regulation; interprovincial and foreign trade are correspondingly the exclusive concern of Parliament. That statement is to be read with the judgment of this Court in The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Company, (1925) S.C.R. 434, (1925) 3 D.L.R. 1, approved by the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada, supra, at p. 387, to the effect that Dominion regulation cannot embrace local trade merely because in undifferentiated subject matter the external interest is dominant. But neither the original statement nor its approval furnishes a clear guide to the demarcation of the two classes when we approach as here the origination, the first stages of trade, including certain aspects of manufacture and production.\nThat demarcation must observe this rule, that if in a trade activity, including manufacture or production, there is involved a matter of extra-provincial interest or concern its regulation thereafter in the aspect of trade is by that fact put beyond Provincial power. This is exemplified in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction, (1931) S.C.R. 357, (1931) 2 D.L.R. 193, where the Province purported to regulate the time and quantity of shipment, the shippers, the price and the transportation of fruit and vegetables in both unsegregated and segregated local and interprovincial trade movements.\nLocke J., with whom Nolan J. concurred, said, at p. 231, in dealing with the constitutional validity of s. 3(1) (l):\nIn answering this question I exclude sales of produce where the producer himself ships his product to other Provinces or countries for sale by any means of transport, or sells his product to a person who purchases the same for export. To illustrate, I exclude a shipment by a hog producer of his hogs, alive or dead, to the Province of Quebec and transactions between such producer and a buyer for a packing plant carrying on business in Hull who purchases the hog intending to ship it to Hull, either alive or dead, and transactions between a hog producer and a packing plant operating in Ontario purchasing the hog for the purpose of producing pork products from it and exporting them from the Province to the extent that the carcass is so used.\nThe passage from the judgment in Lawson\u2019s Case which is above quoted makes it clear that to attempt to control the manner in which traders in other Provinces will carry out their transactions with the Province, or to prohibit them from purchasing natural products for export, is not a matter of merely Provincial concern but also directly and substantially the concern of the other Provinces. I cannot think that from a constitutional standpoint the fact that the buyer for the packing house elects to have the hog killed before it is exported or cut up and, after treatment, exported as hams, bacon or other pork products, can affect the matter.\nFauteux J. was of the opinion that the regulation of the marketing of farm products within a province was within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature and not of Parliament. For this proposition he relied upon Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada et al.[3] and Shannon et al. v. Lower Mainland Products Board[4].\nAbbott J. was of the opinion that it was impracticable to attempt an abstract logical definition of what constitutes interprovincial or export trade. At p. 265 he says:\nWhat is regulated under these schemes is not the farm product itself but certain transactions involving that product, and the transaction which is regulated is completed before the product is consumed either in its original or in some processed form. Processing may take many forms and the original product may be changed out of all recognition. The place where the resulting product may be consumed, therefore, is not in my opinion conclusive, as a test to determine by what legislative authority a particular transaction involving such farm product may validly be regulated.\nAs I have stated, the fact that some, or all, of the resulting product, after processing, may subsequently enter into extraprovincial or export trade does not, in my view, alter the fact that the three schemes submitted in this reference, regulate particular businesses carried on entirely within Provincial legislative jurisdiction, and are therefore intra vires.\nTaschereau J. (as he then was) agreed with Fauteux J. and with Abbott J.\nOnly eight members of the Court sat on this reference, and the reasons of Cartwright J. (as he then was) do not deal with this particular issue.\nCounsel for the respondent points out that, as a result of the reference, there was no majority opinion as to what transactions, completed within a province, constituted interprovincial trade, and contends that the views expressed by the four judges were not in harmony with earlier decisions of this Court and of the Privy Council.\nThe meaning of the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d was considered by the Privy Council in Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[5]. At p. 113, Sir Montague Smith says:\nConstruing therefore the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d by the various aids to their interpretation above suggested, they would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of parliament, regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern, and it may be that they would include general regulation of trade affecting the whole dominion. Their Lordships abstain on the present occasion from any attempt to define the limits of the authority of the dominion parliament in this direction. It is enough for the decision of the present case to say that, in their view, its authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not comprehend the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade, such as the business of fire insurance in a single province, and therefore that its legislative authority does not in the present case conflict or compete with the power over property and civil rights assigned to the legislature of Ontario by No. 13 of sect. 92.\nThe validity of provincial legislation governing the marketing of agricultural products was before this Court in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction[6] which concerned the Produce Marketing Act of British Columbia, 1926-27 (B.C.), c. 54. In holding that Act to be ultra vires of the Legislature of British Columbia, Duff J. (as he then was) said, at p. 364:\nComing now to the first ground of attack, namely, that the statute constitutes an attempt to regulate trade within the meaning of head no. 2 of s. 91. To repeat the general language of s. 10(1), the functions of the Committee are\nfor the purpose of controlling and regulating the marketing of any product within its authority,\nand for that purpose the Committee is empowered\nto determine whether or not and at what time, and in what quantity and from and to what places and at what price and on what terms the product may be marketed and delivered.\nAs I have said, the respondent Committee has attempted (in professed exercise of this authority) and in this litigation asserts its right to do so\u2014to regulate the marketing of products into parts of Canada outside British Columbia. It claims the right under the statute to control (as in fact it does), the sale of such products for shipment into the prairie provinces as well as the shipment of them into those provinces for sale or storage. The moment his product reaches a state in which it becomes a possible article of commerce, the shipper is (under the Committee\u2019s interpretation of its powers), subject to the Committee\u2019s dictation as to the quantity of it which he may dispose of, as to the places from which, and the places to which he may ship, as to the route of transport, as to the price, as to all the terms of sale. I ought to refer also to the provision of the statute which prohibits anybody becoming a licensed shipper who has not, for six months immediately preceding his application for a licence, been a resident of the province, unless he is the registered owner of the land on which he carries on business as shipper. In a statute which deals with trade that is largely interprovincial, this is a significant feature. It is an attempt to control the manner in which traders in other provinces, who send their agents into British Columbia to make arrangements for the shipment of goods to their principals, shall carry out their interprovincial transactions. I am unable to convince myself that these matters are all, or chiefly, matters of merely British Columbia concern, in the sense that they are not also directly and substantially the concern of the other provinces, which constitute in fact the most extensive market for these products. In dictating the routes of shipment, the places to which shipment is to be made, the quantities allotted to each terminus ad quern, the Committee does, altogether apart from dictating the terms of contracts, exercise a large measure of direct and immediate control over the movement of trade in these commodities between British Columbia and the other provinces.\nIn 1936 this Court, in the Reference as to the Validity of The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, As Amended[7], considered the validity of the federal Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934. The following passages, at pp. 404 and 411, from the judgment of this Court, delivered by Duff C.J., define the issues involved and the reasons for its conclusion that the Act was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada:\nIn substance, we are concerned with sections 3, 4 and 5 of the statute.\nBy section 3, the Governor General is empowered to\nestablish a Board to be known as the Dominion Marketing Board to regulate the marketing of natural products as hereinafter provided.\nBy section 4(1) the Board is invested with power\n(a) to regulate the time and place at which, and to designate the agency through which the regulated product shall be marketed, to determine the manner of distribution, the quantity and quality, grade or class of the regulated product that shall be marketed by any person at any time, and to prohibit the marketing of any of the regulated product of any grade, quality or class;\n\u201cMarketed\u201d is used in an extended sense as embracing \u201cbuying and selling, shipping for sale or storage and offering for sale\u201d.\nThe Board is also empowered,\n(c) to conduct a pool for the equalization of returns received from the sale of the regulated product;\u2026\n(f) to require any or all persons engaged in the production or marketing of the regulated product to register their names, addresses and occupations with the Board, or to obtain a licence from the Board, and such licence shall be subject to cancellation by the Board for violation of any provision of this Act or regulation made thereunder;\nSection 5 contains provisions for marketing schemes under which the marketing of a natural product, to which the scheme applies, is regulated by a local board under the supervision of the Dominion Board.\n* * *\nIt does not seem to admit of serious dispute that, if, regards natural products, as defined by the Act, the provinces are destitute of the powers to regulate the dealing with natural products in respect of the matters designated in section 4(1) (a), the powers of the provinces are much more limited than they have generally been supposed to be. If this defect of power exists in relation to natural products it exists in relation to any- thing that may be the subject of trade. Furthermore, if the Dominion has power to enact section 4(1)(f), as a provision falling strictly within \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce,\u201d then the provinces are destitute of the power to regulate, by licensing persons engaged in the production, the buying and selling, the shipping for sale or storage and the offering for sale, in an exclusively local and provincial way of business of any commodity or commodities. The acceptance of this view of the powers of the provinces would seem to be inconsistent, not only with Hodge v. The Queen, (1883) 9 A.C. 117, but with the judgment in the Montreal Street Railway case, (1912) A.C. 33, as well as with the judgment in the Board of Commerce case, (1922) 1 A.C. 191. The judgment in this latter case seems very plainly to declare that in the absence of very special circumstances such as those indicated in the judgment of the Board, such matters as subjects of legislation fall within the jurisdiction of the provinces under section 92.\nThe enactments in question, therefore, in so far as they relate to matters which are in substance local and provincial are beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament. Parliament cannot acquire jurisdiction to deal in the sweeping way in which these enactments operate with such local and provincial matters by legislating at the same time respecting external and interprovincial trade and committing the regulation of external and inter\u2011provincial trade and the regulation of trade which is exclusively local and of traders and producers engaged in trade which is exclusively local to the same authority (King v. Eastern Terminal Elevators, (1925) S.C.R. 434).\nIt should also be observed that these enactments operate by way of the regulation of dealings in particular commodities and classes of commodities. The regulations contemplated are not general regulations of trade as a whole or regulations of general trade and commerce within the sense of the judgment in Parsons case.\nThe penultimate paragraph, above quoted, was adopted by the Privy Council[8]. Lord Atkin, at p. 396, before quoting this paragraph, said:\nThere can be no doubt that the provisions of the Act cover transactions in any natural product which are completed within the Province, and have no connection with inter\u2011Provincial or export trade. It is therefore plain that the Act purports to affect property and civil rights in the Province, and if not brought within one of the enumerated classes of subjects in s. 91 must be beyond the competence of the Dominion Legislature. It was sought to bring the Act within the class (2) of s. 91\u2014namely, The Regulation of Trade and Commerce. Emphasis was laid upon those parts of the Act which deal with inter-Provincial and export trade. But the regulation of trade and commerce does not permit the regulation of individual forms of trade or commerce confined to the Province.\nIn 1938, the Privy Council dealt with the validity of a British Columbia statute, The Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act, 1936, in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[9]. This Act enabled the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to set up a central British Columbia Marketing Board, to establish or approve schemes for the control and regulation within the Province of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of any natural products, to constitute Marketing Boards to administer such schemes, and to vest in those Boards any powers considered necessary or advisable to exercise those functions.\nIt was held that this statute was, in pith and substance, an Act to regulate particular businesses, entirely within the Province, and was intra vires of the Provincial Legislature under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act. In dealing with the contention that this Act encroached upon s. 91(2) of the British North America Act, Lord Atkin said, at p. 718:\nIt is sufficient to say upon the first ground that it is apparent that the legislation in question is confined to regulating transactions that take place wholly within the Province, and are therefore within the sovereign powers granted to the Legislature in that respect by s. 92 of the British North America Act. Their Lordships do not accept the view that natural products as defined in the Act are confined to natural products produced in British Columbia. There is no such restriction in the Act, and the limited construction would probably cause difficulty if it were sought at some future time to co-operate with a valid Dominion scheme. But the Act is clearly confined to dealings with such products as are situate within the Province. It was suggested that \u201ctransportation\u201d would cover the carriage of goods in transit from one Province to another, or overseas. The answer is that on the construction of the Act as a whole it is plain that \u201ctransportation\u201d is confined to the passage of goods whose transport begins within the Province to a destination also within the Province. It is now well settled that the enumeration in s. 91 of \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce\u201d as a class of subject over which the Dominion has exclusive legislative powers does not give the power to regulate for legitimate Provincial purposes particular trades or businesses so far as the trade or business is confined to the Province: Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons, 7 App. Cas. 96; Reference re The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, and Its Amending Act, 1935, (1936) Can. S.C.R. 398; (1937) A.C. 377. And it follows that to the extent that the Dominion is forbidden to regulate within the Province, the Province itself has the right under its legislative powers over property and civil rights within the Province.\nIt is now necessary to consider, in the light of these decisions, the validity of the three orders which are under attack in the present case. The first order, which created The Quebec Carnation Company Milk Producers\u2019 Board and empowered it to negotiate, on behalf of the milk producers, for the sale of their products to the appellant, is somewhat analogous to the creation of a collective bargaining agency in the field of labour relations. The purpose of the order was to regulate, on behalf of a particular group of Quebec producers, their trade with the appellant for the sale to it, in Quebec, of their milk. Its object was to improve their bargaining position.\nThe Producers\u2019 Board then undertook, with the appellant, negotiations for the sale to it of that milk. The order provided a machinery whereby the price of milk could be determined by arbitration if agreement could not be reached. In this respect it differs from most provincial legislation governing labour disputes, but there would seem to be no doubt that provincial labour legislation incorporating compulsory arbitration of disputes would be constitutional, unless objectionable on some other ground.\nThe two subsequent orders of the Marketing Board, under attack, contained the decisions which it reached in determining the proper price to be paid to the producers for milk purchased by the appellant.\nAre these orders invalid because the milk purchased by the appellant was processed by it and, as to a major portion of its product, exported from the province? Because of that fact, do they constitute an attempt to regulate trade in matters of interprovincial concern?\nThat the price determined by the orders may have a bearing upon the appellant\u2019s export trade is unquestionable. It affects the cost of doing business. But so, also, do labour costs affect the cost of doing business of any company which may be engaged in export trade and yet there would seem to be little doubt as to the power of a province to regulate wage rates payable within a province, save as to an undertaking falling within the exceptions listed in s. 92(10) of the British North America Act. It is not the possibility that these orders might \u201caffect\u201d the appellants interprovincial trade which should determine their validity, but, rather, whether they were made \u201cin relation to\u201d the regulation of trade and commerce. This was a test applied, in another connection, by Duff J. (as he then was) in Gold Seal Limited v. Attorney-General for Alberta[10].\nThus, as Kerwin C.J. said in the Ontario Reference, in the passage previously quoted: \u201cOnce a statute aims at \u2018regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern\u2019 it is beyond the competence of a Provincial Legislature.\u201d\nI am not prepared to agree that, in determining that aim, the fact that these orders may have some impact upon the appellant\u2019s interprovincial trade necessarily means that they constitute a regulation of trade and commerce within s. 91(2) and thus renders them invalid. The fact of such impact is a matter which may be relevant in determining their true aim and purpose, but it is not conclusive.\nIn the Lawson case, where the provincial legislation was found to be unconstitutional, the Committee created by the statute was enabled and purported to exercise a large measure of direct and immediate control over the movement of trade in commodities between a province and other provinces. That is not this case.\nOn the other hand, in the Shannon case the regulatory statute was upheld, as it was confined to the regulation of transactions taking place wholly within the province. It was held that s. 91(2) was not applicable to the regulation for legitimate provincial purposes of particular trades or businesses confined to the province.\nThe view of the four judges in the Ontario Reference was that the fact that a transaction took place wholly within a province did not necessarily mean that it was thereby subject solely to provincial control. The regulation of some such transactions relating to products destined for interprovincial trade could constitute a regulation of interprovincial trade and be beyond provincial control.\nWhile I agree with the view of the four judges in the Ontario Reference that a trade transaction, completed in a province, is not necessarily, by that fact alone, subject only to provincial control, I also hold the view that the fact that such a transaction incidentally has some effect upon a company engaged in interprovincial trade does not necessarily prevent its being subject to such control. I agree with the view of Abbott J., in the Ontario Reference, that each transaction and each regulation must be examined in relation to its own facts. In the present case, the orders under question were not, in my opinion, directed at the regulation of interprovincial trade. They did not purport directly to control or to restrict such trade. There was no evidence that, in fact, they did control or restrict it. The most that can be said of them is that they had some effect upon the cost of doing business in Quebec of a company engaged in interprovincial trade, and that, by itself, is not sufficient to make them invalid.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs. There should be no costs payable by or to the intervenants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellant: Desjardins, Ducharme, Des-jardins & Cordeau, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board and the mis-en-cause: Par\u00e9, Ferland, MacKay, Barbeau, Holden & Steinberg, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the Milk Producers\u2019 Board: Verschelden, Bourret, Lamontagne & L\u2019Heureux, Montreal.\nAttorney for the Attorney General of Canada: R.

The other grounds raised were also devoid of merit.\nAs to the application for leave to appeal from sentence, it is settled law that this Court is not competent to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for a criminal offence.\nAppels\u2014Travail\u2014Permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Injonction ordonnant aux officiers d\u2019une union d\u2019ordonner la suspension d\u2019une gr\u00e8ve\u2014Vote des membres pour d\u00e9cider si on devait ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 l\u2019injonction\u2014Condamnation pour m\u00e9pris de cour\u2014Demande de permission d\u2019appeler du verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 et de la sentence.\nAu cours d\u2019une gr\u00e8ve l\u00e9gale, les requ\u00e9rants\u2014l\u2019union en gr\u00e8ve et ses officiers\u2014ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s coupables de l\u2019offense criminelle de m\u00e9pris de cour parce qu\u2019ils avaient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9fi\u00e9 et provoqu\u00e9 la Cour en ordonnant que le vote des membres soit pris pour d\u00e9cider si on devait ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 une injonction qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise.

(Steve) Stavenes and Homer Stevens, guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court in that they had deliberately defied and challenged the Court by their conduct and sought to bring it into contempt. Proceeding then to pronounce the sentence, the learned judge imposed on the Union a fine of $25,000 and on Stavenes and Stevens, a sentence of imprisonment for a term of twelve months.\nThe applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 from their conviction and from their respective sentence. By a unanimous judgment rendered at Victoria, on November 7, 1967, the Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal from conviction and by a unanimous judgment rendered on November 21, 1967, it dismissed their appeal from sentence.\nThe applicants now seek to obtain leave to appeal to this Court from these two judgments.\nAs to the application to appeal from conviction:\u2014Virtually all the grounds, raised before us by applicants, are dealt with in the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Davey who rejected them, and in our view properly so, as ill-founded. With respect to the other points submitted to us by applicants, we are also of opinion that they are devoid of merit. Hence, the application for leave to appeal from conviction should be dismissed.\nAs to the application for leave to appeal from sentence:\u2014This application cannot be entertained, for, as decided in Goldhar v. The Queen[2], and consistently held ever since, as well as prior to that decision, this Court is not competent to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for a criminal offence.

The report of the magistrate to the Court of Appeal showed that of the 14 offences of which he found the appellant had been convicted previously, the first two were for vagrancy and the third, in 1947, was for breaking and entering and theft. All subsequent convictions were either for having possession of drugs (4 offences) or for petty theft (7 offences). The last conviction was in December 1962 and the punishment was a term of 6 months imprisonment. There had been a period of less than three months between the date of his release from prison, on May 5, 1963, and the commission of the substantive offence on July 31, 1963. The Court of Appeal found that it had not been shown that the magistrate had erred in principle in finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the sentence of preventive detention quashed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: There was no evidence that since his release early in May 1963, the appellant was leading a criminal life, persistently or otherwise, except the commission of the substantive offence on July 31, 1963. This was not a case where the commission of the substantive offence could in itself furnish sufficient evidence that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: It has been established that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life as required by s. 660(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. It is open to the Court to conclude that the accused is leading persistently a criminal life if he repeatedly commits the same kind of offence and if the time elapsing between the commission of the offence prior to the substantive offence and the commission of the substantive offence is short, without necessarily having to have evidence of criminal acts or associations during that short period. The pattern of conduct which has been established of the commission of thefts shortly after release from custody, coupled with the short lapse of time after release and prior to the commission of the substantive offence, was good evidence of persistence in leading a criminal life.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014L\u2019accus\u00e9 menait-il contin\u00fbment une vie criminelle\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 660(2)(a).\nAyant \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable du vol, commis le 31 juillet 1963, d\u2019un ouvre-bo\u00eetes d\u2019une valeur n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas $50, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 repris de justice et une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e.

Toutes les autres d\u00e9clarations subs\u00e9quentes de culpabilit\u00e9 sont soit pour possession de stup\u00e9fiants (4 infractions) ou pour larcin (7 infractions).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nT.R. Berger, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court on October 10, 1967, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 pronounced on April 20, 1965, dismissing an appeal against a sentence to preventive detention imposed on the appellant by His Worship Magistrate D.D. Hume at Vancouver on March 16, 1964, in lieu of the sentence of seven months imprisonment imposed on him by His Worship Magistrate Lorne H. Jackson on August 1, 1963, upon his conviction on that date on a charge that at the City of Vancouver on July 31, 1963, he committed theft of one can-opener, of a value not in excess of fifty dollars, the property of F.W. Woolworth Company Limited.\nOn October 23, 1963, while the appellant was in custody in Oakalla Prison Farm, he was served with a notice, pursuant to s. 662 of the Criminal Code, that an application to find him to be an habitual criminal and that it was therefore expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention would be made on Friday, November 8, 1963, to a magistrate other than Magistrate Lorne H. Jackson. This notice specified twenty-four convictions previous to the conviction on August 1, 1963, mentioned above and hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe substantive offence\u201d, and concluded as follows:\nB. Other Circumstances\n26) That you are an habitual associate of criminals.\n27) That you are a drug addict and an habitual associate of drug addicts.\n28) That during your periods of freedom you have not had regular gainful employment.\n29) That after brief periods of freedom you have consistently returned to your criminal way of life. The hearing before Magistrate Hume did not commence until March 13, 1964; by that time the appellant had been released from custody. It appeared that the appellant had received notice that the hearing would proceed on March 13, 1964, but he did not appear; counsel who had been representing him was given permission to withdraw and the hearing proceeded ex parte.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the learned Magistrate gave a brief oral judgment as follows:\nI find the accused is a habitual criminal and I sentence him to preventive detention. Issue a warrant for his arrest.\nAn appeal having been taken, the Magistrate furnished a report to the Court of Appeal. In paragraph 10 of this report it was stated that convictions of the three indictable offences for which the accused was liable to a term of five years or more were proved, that they were on charges of having possession of drugs and were those specified in paras. 15, 16 and 19 of the notice of application. On reference to that notice it appears that those convictions were as follows:\n(a) At Vancouver, on April 21, 1953; sentence, imprisonment for 3 years and a fine of $200.00 or a further term of 2 months;\n(b) At Vancouver, On October 2, 1956; sentence, imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months;\n(c) At Vancouver, on July 22, 1959; sentence, imprisonment for 2 years.\nParagraphs 11, 12 and 13 of the Magistrate\u2019s report are as follows:\n11. The convictions which were proved against the accused since 1945 are as follows:\u2014\n1947 Vagrancy A\n1947 Vagrancy A\n1947 Breaking and entering and theft\n1950 Drugs in possession\n1953 Drugs in possession\n1956 Drugs in possession\n1958 Theft under fifty dollars\n1959 Theft under fifty dollars\n1959 Drugs in possession\nJuly 1961 Theft under $50.00\u20142 months\nSeptember 1961 Theft under $50.00\u20142 months\nDecember 1961 Theft under $50.00\u20144 months\nMay 1962 Theft under $50.00\u20146 months\nDecember 1962 Theft under $50.00\u20146 months 12. Evidence presented by the Crown to substantiate paragraph \u2018B\u2019 of the Notice of Application, that is other circumstances, was given as follows:\u2014\nJune 1959\nSeen with Charles Codd, George Harrop, known drug addicts, at which time the accused admitted he was unemployed and had no funds.\nMarch 1961\nSeen by Constable Monk with Violet Young and Papenak, known drug addicts, at which time the accused admitted six drug convictions.\nJune 1961\nSeen by Constable Aitchison with Joseph Rawley, who admitted a criminal record.\nSeptember 16, 1961\nHe admitted to Constable Hoyle that he was at that time a drug addict.\nNovember 1961\nSeen by Constable Watt with Charles Allan, a person who admitted a criminal record and being a drug addict.\nMarch 1963\nSeen by Corporal Forgopa (RCMP) with Gordon Kravenia and Vance Lawson, known addicts.\n(It appears from the transcript, and was agreed by counsel before us, that this last item is an error. The date should read March 1953, not March 1963.)\n13. In view of the accused\u2019s lengthy record for drugs and his most recent convictions since 1961 for theft, I found that he was leading persistently a criminal life and was hence an habitual criminal, and that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention; and as he was not present in court I instructed the prosecutor to issue and have exercised a warrant for his arrest.\nIn the Court of Appeal the question which is now before us was dealt with in one sentence as follows:\nIn our view it has not been shown that the learned magistrate in the court below erred in principle which had been applied by him and approved in this court in many cases, either in the matter of the finding that the appellant is a habitual criminal, nor the conclusion drawn by the Magistrate that it is expedient in the interests of the public that this appellant be sentenced to preventive detention.\nThe remainder of the reasons given by the Court of Appeal deals with the question, which was not raised before us, whether the learned magistrate had the right to proceed with the hearing and give his decision in the absence of the accused.\nThe report of the learned magistrate shows that of the fourteen offences of which he found the appellant had been convicted the first two were for vagrancy and the third, in 1947, was for breaking and entering and theft (of two electric clippers and a quantity of cigarettes). All subsequent convictions were either for having possession of drugs (four offences) or for petty theft (seven offences). The last conviction was in December 1962 and the punishment was a term of 6 months imprisonment. According to the evidence of P.C. Needham the appellant was released about May 5, 1963. This witness testified that he \u201cchecked\u201d the appellant on May 12, 1963. He says:\nI have here 5:35 p.m. on May the 12th which is Sunday, May 12, 1963, I checked this man in the 100 East Hastings. At this time he told me he was living at Room 15 at the Colonial Hotel by himself. He was on Social Assistance. He had Fifty Cents in his pockets. He said he had been on Social Assistance for three or more years and at this time he admitted having been released from prison one week earlier having served a six months sentence.\nIt will be observed from paragraph 12 of the magistrate\u2019s report, quoted above, that the evidence of circumstances other than previous convictions upon which the magistrate relied related to occasions the latest of which was November 1961.\nIt has been held in a unanimous judgment of this Court in Kirkland v. The Queen[3] that the time at which the Crown must show that an accused is leading persistently a criminal life is the time of the commission of the substantive offence.\nIn the case at bar there is no evidence that since his release early in May 1963 the appellant was leading a criminal life, persistently or otherwise, except the commission of the substantive offence on July 31, 1963. In some circumstances the commission of the substantive offence may in itself furnish sufficient evidence that the accused is leading persistently a criminal life, but this is not one of such cases.\nP.C. Needham gave evidence in regard to the substantive offence. He told of going to the Manager\u2019s Office at F.W. Woolworth Company\u2019s store on West Hastings Street, at 5.10 p.m. on July 31, 1963, in response to a radio call and finding the accused there. The Manager charged the appellant with having stolen a can-opener of the value of two dollars and ninety-nine cents and the following day the appellant pleaded guilty to this charge. P. C. Needham testified as follows:\nAt the time of this arrest, he had a appearance of being mildly intoxicated but there was no smell of liquor on his breath and when questioned about this he admitted being\u2014having had goof balls earlier.\n* * *\nMR. MORRISON: NOW, you said something about a goof ball, Constable, what do you mean by that?\nA. Well, this is the term that\u2014well, we asked him if he had been drinking and\u2014\nTHE COURT: Who asked him?\nA. I did, your Worship, during the normal course of the primary investigation and he denied drinking and I suggested that\u2014by way of suggestion on my part that he had taken goof balls and he agreed.\nMR. MORRISON: What do you understand by the term, goof balls?\nA. It is some chemical preparation taken by persons addicted to drugs which they can obtain more easily and a lot less expense and the effect is similar. This is what I am made to understand.\nThe picture is of a man \u201cmildly intoxicated\u201d by \u201cgoof balls\u201d stealing a can-opener worth $2.99 rather than of one persisting in leading a criminal life. The facts are even more consistent with yielding to a sudden impulse than were those in. Kirkland\u2019s case, supra.\nNo doubt the record shows that the appellant has for years been addicted to the use of drugs and from time to time commits petty thefts. In my opinion, the evidence accepted by the learned magistrate fails to establish that the appellant was, at the time of committing the substantive offence, leading persistently a criminal life and this is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nAs is pointed out in the reasons of my brother Martland, it was also contended on behalf of the appellant that even if he could properly be found to be an habitual criminal, it was not proper to impose a sentence of preventive detention upon him but it is unnecessary to deal with that submission in these reasons.\nI would allow the appeal and quash the sentence of preventive detention.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[4], which dis- missed the appellant\u2019s appeal against a sentence for preventive detention which had been imposed upon him. The facts giving rise to this appeal are stated in the reasons of the Chief Justice. The Court of Appeal found that it had not been shown that the learned magistrate in the court below erred in principle in the matter of finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal.\nOn this issue, the main argument of the appellant was that it had not been established that he was \u201cleading persistently a criminal life\u201d, as required by s. 660(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, which is one of the necessary elements contained in the definition of an habitual criminal.\nThe evidence at trial established the following:\n1. A series of fifteen convictions (including that for the substantive offence on August 1, 1963) since the year 1945.\n2. He had been convicted in 1950, 1953, 1956 and 1959 of having drugs in his possession.\n3. Between 1958 and 1962 the appellant had been convicted seven times for theft of an article of a value of less than fifty dollars. The substantive offence, for which he was convicted on August 1, 1963, was of a similar nature.\n4. There had been a period of less than three months between the date of his release from prison, about May 5, 1963, and the commission of the substantive offence. When interviewed by a police officer about a week after that release from detention the appellant said that he was on Social Assistance and had been on such assistance for three or more years.\n5. Detective Devries, of the Vancouver City Police Force, who had observed the appellant, when he committed the last offence, prior to the substantive offence, on December 6, 1962, testified that he had known the appellant for ten years and that the appellant is a user of narcotics. Asked as to his character and reputation in the community, he said:\nWell, in my opinion, as far as he is concerned, he always hangs down around the 100 Block East Hastings and Skid Road and I have never known him to make any advance to employment or get out of the rut he is in. In answer to another question, he said:\nYes, I have been on the Drug Squad for a period of three years or more and also walk the beat in that area for a number of years and the 100 Block East Hastings is the main hangout for drug addicts and criminals.\nThe appellant contends that there was no evidence that the appellant was engaged in crime between the date of his release from custody and the commission of the substantive offence and submits that, without this, the appellant cannot be found to be an habitual criminal within the requirements of s. 660(2)(a).\nIn Kirkland v. The Queen[5], this Court agreed with the statement of Lord Reading L.C.J. in R. v. Jones[6], that:\nThe legislature never intended that a man should be convicted of being a habitual criminal merely because he had a number of previous convictions against him.\nThat statement was made in a case which involved the adequacy of a summation to the jury by the Chairman of a Quarter Sessions, which contained the statement:\nIf you think his record justifies this charge of being a habitual criminal it is your duty to find that he is a habitual criminal.\nWhile it is true that a criminal record alone does not necessarily involve a finding that at the time the substantive offence was committed, the accused is leading persistently a criminal life, if the accused repeatedly commits the same kind of offence, and if the time elapsing between the commission of the offence prior to the substantive offence and the commission of the substantive offence is short, in my opinion it is open to the court, considering the matter, to conclude that the accused is leading persistently a criminal life, without necessarily having to have evidence of criminal acts or associations during that short period.\nThe evidence in the present case establishes a clear pattern of conduct. In each case noted below the charge involved was theft.\nDate of Conviction\nSentence\nJuly, 1961....................................................................\n2 months\nSeptember, 1961.......................................................\n4 months\nMay, 1962....................................................................\n6 months\nDecember, 1962........................................................\n6 months Within three months of his release after the last of the above sentences, the appellant committed theft once again.\nIn the Kirkland case, it was said that there had been cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal in which the nature of the substantive offence viewed in the light of the previous record of the accused was in itself evidence that he was leading a persistently criminal life, but that the cases of this kind cited by counsel were all cases in which the substantive offence was of a nature which showed premeditation and careful preparation.\nThe fact of premeditation and careful preparation in relation to the substantive offence may certainly be evidence of persistence in leading a criminal life. In my opinion it is not the only kind of evidence, in cases of this kind, which can establish such persistence, and I do not regard the Kirkland case as laying this down as a matter of law. That case was decided upon its own facts, as this one must be. In my view the pattern of conduct which has been established of the commission of thefts shortly after release from custody, coupled with the short lapse of time after release and prior to the commission of the substantive offence, is equally good evidence of persistence in leading a criminal life. The case of R. v. Yates[7] is an example of this kind.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that Part XXI of the Criminal Code was not intended to apply in respect of the commission of the sort of crimes committed by the appellant in this case, which involved no violence and were not of a serious nature. In my opinion, if the application of Part XXI is to be restricted in this way, that is a matter for Parliament and not to be achieved by judicial decision. Section 660, in requiring, as a prerequisite of a person being found to be an habitual criminal, the commission of three indictable offences for which there is a liability to imprisonment for five years or more, has defined the nature of the crimes in respect of which Part XXI can apply. It was also contended, on behalf of the appellant, in the alternative, that, even if he could properly be found to be an habitual criminal, it was not proper to impose a sentence of preventive detention upon him. In view of the fact that the majority of this Court have decided that the evidence in this case fails to establish that the appellant was persistently leading a criminal life, a necessary requirement to his being found to be an habitual criminal within para. (a) of subs. (2) of s. 660 of the Criminal Code, it is unnecessary for me to deal with those submissions in these reasons.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nPIGEON J.:\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in this appeal. I concur in his view that there is no evidence that the appellant, since his release early in May 1963, was leading a criminal life, persistently or otherwise, except the commission of the substantive offence on July 31, 1963, and that this is not of itself sufficient evidence in the circumstances of this case. Therefore, I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence of preventive detention.\nAppeal allowed, FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.R.

D. Thompson Limited, [1968] S.C.R. 276\nDate: 1968-01-23\nMaxwell Freedman (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nD. Thompson Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1967: November 3; 1968: January 23.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nAgency\u2014Contract for electrical renovations to buildings entered into with agent of unnamed owner\u2014Agent at instigation of defendant requesting plaintiff not to file lien in respect of work\u2014Defendant falsely represented as owner\u2014Plaintiff acting on representation to its prejudice-Defendant estopped from denying that he was owner.\nBy identical offers to purchase, one K offered to purchase two apartment houses from the defendant F. Three days after the date of the said offers, which were accepted on the same day, K gave notice to F that he had assigned all his right in the offers to purchase to C Ltd. and on the following day F\u2019s solicitor, by letter to the solicitors for the said C Ltd., acknowledged receipt of the notice of assignment. Under a term in the offers to purchase, K was entitled to immediately attend on the premises to execute repairs and renovations and he thereby agreed to indemnify and save harmless the vendor from any and all D claims whatsoever and to provide the vendor with waivers of lien from all subcontractors and suppliers before any work was commenced.\nK was the operator of a partnership (BJ&L) which appeared to act as the agents for a series of companies including C Ltd. So soon as the offers to purchase had been accepted, BJ&L under the direction of K proceeded to enter the two apartment buildings and to carry out very extensive renovations thereto. The office manager of BJ&L requested the plaintiff company to make an estimate of the renovations necessary to the electrical work in the buildings and upon receipt of the said estimates he authorized the work to proceed on a cost plus basis. It was arranged that the accounts would be paid from the proceeds of the rent. The plaintiff was requested not to file a lien in respect of its work. A written document was presented to it at the instigation of the defendant embodying this agreement, which stated that the plaintiff\u2019s agreement was being made at the request of a proposed mortgagee, and at the request of F, the registered owner.\nIn an action brought against K, BJ&L and F to recover the balance owing for work done on the buildings, the plaintiff obtained judgment against F. The action was dismissed against K and BJ&L although F was given judgment against K for such amount as he was required to pay to the plaintiff. An appeal by F was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal. With leave, F then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Hall J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland J.: The plaintiff contracted with an agent to do the work for the owner. The defendant represented that he was the owner, and the plaintiff acted on that representation, to its own detriment. The defendant was estopped from denying that he was the owner.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: Before agreeing to proceed with the work it was represented to the plaintiff that BJ&L were only acting as agents for an unnamed owner who would, of course, be liable for payment. The plaintiff proceeding in its ordinary course acted on that representation and entered into the contract. But before it had commenced work on the contract the defendant, through his solicitor, made the further representation that he was the registered owner and enabled BJ&L to obtain the plaintiff\u2019s waiver of the right to claim a lien on the properties for the amount which would become due to it. This representation was false and the defendant knew he had already sold the properties and that C Ltd. was entitled to become the registered owner. The solicitor demonstrated his knowledge of the falsity and of the importance of the representation in a letter written by him to the solicitors for C Ltd. His representation and his knowledge were attributable to his client the defendant. The plaintiff acted on that representation to its prejudice, and the defendant accordingly incurred liability.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Hall J., dissenting: It was not pleaded that K ordered the plaintiff\u2019s work and services as agent of F, or that F agreed to pay for them. Apart from the provisions of the Mechanics Lien Act an owner does not become liable to pay for work done on his premises which he has not ordered and for which he has not agreed to pay. The fact that F sought and obtained waivers of the right to file liens did not create a liability in contract on his part.\nQuite apart from any question of the adequacy of the pleadings the plaintiff\u2019s claim based on estoppel could not succeed because the evidence of its responsible officer, read as a whole, negatived the suggestion that, assuming misrepresentations of fact were made by F, the plaintiff was induced thereby to alter its position.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Bastin J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall J. dissenting.\nWalter C. Newman, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nH. Sokolov, Q.C., and David Wolinsky, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Hall J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The circumstances out of which this appeal arises and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence and, as far as possible, I shall refrain from repetition.\nIt is first necessary to consider the nature of the cause of action pleaded by the respondent. The amended statement of claim alleges that from October 1, 1963, until March 14, 1964, the appellant was the registered owner and in possession of the Rozel Apartments and that from October 3, 1963, to May 5, 1964, he was the registered owner and in possession of the Windsor Apartments. This allegation is admitted in the statement of defence of the appellant.\nThe statement of claim continues:\n4. At all material times, the Defendant Paul Klass, in his personal capacity or as the representative of Baird, Johnson & Lee, was the manager of the afore-described properties, and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Defendant Maxwell Freedman, caused extensive improvements to be made thereto. The reason and purpose for such improvements was to increase the market value of the said properties, and the Defendant Maxwell Freedman, after such improvements had been effected, did sell and transfer said properties at amounts greatly in excess of the purchase prices paid by him.\n5. The Plaintiff contributed to such improvements by supplying electrical materials, work and services in the amount of $5,700.00 (later reduced to $4,275.00) to said Rozel Apartments, and in the amount of $990.00 to said Windsor Apartments. 6. The Plaintiff, also at the request of the Defendant Maxwell Freedman, while he was the registered owner, waived its rights to file Mechanics\u2019 Liens in respect of the improvements effected to the said properties and the Plaintiff claims and submits that said Defendant is estopped for denying his responsibility and liability to the Plaintiff for the payments of its accounts.\n7. The Defendant, Maxwell Freedman, as the owner of the aforedescribed properties, obtained advantage and benefit from the goods, materials and services supplied by the Plaintiff.\n8. The Plaintiff\u2019s accounts, as aforesaid, remain unpaid in whole or in part although demand for the same has been made by the Plaintiff.\nIt concludes with a claim for payment of the said sums of $4,275 and $990.\nThe allegations in the last sentence of para. 4 were not substantiated. The appellant sold both apartments to Klass on October 4, 1963, at profits of $4,750 and $4,000 respectively.\nIn my view, the statement of claim does not disclose any cause of action against the appellant. It is not pleaded that Klass ordered the respondent\u2019s work and services as agent of Freedman; it is not pleaded that Freedman agreed to pay for them. Apart from the provisions of the Mechanics\u2019 Liens Act an owner does not become liable to pay for work done on his premises which he has not ordered and for which he has not agreed to pay.\nIt is not necessary to consider whether the evidence supports the allegations in para. 7, of the statement of claim, since even if it does the fact of an owner being benefited by work done on his property does not, apart from some statutory provision, impose upon him a liability to pay for it in the absence of any agreement binding him to do so.\nIt may well be that Freedman would be estopped from denying that he was the owner of the two apartments at the time the respondent rendered its services but this in itself would not advance the respondent\u2019s case because simply qua owner, in the absence of contract, Freedman would not be liable.\nThe fact that Freedman sought and obtained waivers of the right to file liens does not create a liability in contract on his part. It would have been a simple matter for the respondent to exact from Freedman a personal promise to pay as a condition of signing the waivers.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that in the judgments below the matter has been dealt with as if the action were one for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation or for conspiracy to defraud the respondent. It is well settled that in such actions fraud must be both pleaded and proved. It has not been pleaded in this case.\nQuite apart from any question of the adequacy of the pleadings it appears to me that the respondent\u2019s claim based on estoppel could not succeed because the evidence of its responsible officer, Philip Kaplan, read as a whole, negatives the suggestion that, assuming misrepresentations of fact were made by Freedman, the respondent was induced thereby to alter its position.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons of my brother Spence.\nIn my opinion, the evidence establishes that the respondent undertook to do work on the two apartment buildings at the request of an employee of the firm of Baird, Johnson & Lee. Both that firm and the respondent knew that the firm was not making this arrangement as principal, but as agent for some other person. The respondent reasonably presumed that it was doing the work for the registered owner.\nThe respondent was requested to agree not to file a lien in respect of its work. A written document was presented to it at the instigation of the appellant embodying this agreement, which stated that the respondent\u2019s agreement was being made at the request of Hathaway Investments Ltd., as proposed mortgagee, and at the request of Maxwell Freedman, the registered owner. The agreement was being requested\nfor the purpose of inducing the mortgagee to advance moneys secured by a first mortgage on the said property; for the purpose of permitting the owner of the said property to pay the costs of constructing the building or buildings erected or now under construction \u2026\nI am of the opinion that this was a representation by the appellant that the respondent\u2019s work was being done for him. The respondent agreed not to file a lien on the basis of the representations made in that document. That is the way the document itself reads.\nIn short, the respondent contracted with an agent to do the work for the owner. The appellant represented that he was the owner, and the respondent acted on that representation, to its own detriment. The appellant is estopped from denying that he was the owner.\nI think that this claim is sufficiently pleaded by paras. 4, 5 and 6 of the amended statement of claim. Paragraphs 5 and 6 are quoted in the reasons of the Chief Justice. The relevant portion of para. 4 reads as follows:\n4. At all material times, the Defendant Paul Klass, in his personal capacity or as the representative of Baird, Johnson & Lee, was the manager of the aforedescribed properties, and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Defendant Maxwell Freedman, caused extensive improvements to be made thereto \u2026\nI would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Spence.\nThe judgment of Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba delivered on July 6, 1966, whereby that Court unanimously dismissed the appeal by the (defendant) appellant from the judgment of Mr. Justice Bastin pronounced on January 5, 1966. By the latter judgment the respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of $5,265 with costs.\nThe appellant had purchased an apartment house known as the Rozel Apartments in the City of Winnipeg from Messrs. Zlotnick and Goldin by means of an offer to purchase dated September 6, 1963, and had further purchased another apartment house in the City of Winnipeg known as the Windsor Apartments from a Mr. Popeski by an offer to purchase dated September 16, 1963.\nBy identical offers to purchase dated October 4, 1963, one Paul Klass offered to purchase these two apartments from the appellant Freedman. Paul Klass was a defendant in the action but the action of the respondent was dismissed against him and Messrs. Baird, Johnson and Lee at trial although the appellant was given judgment against the said Paul Klass for such amount as he was required to pay to the respondent.\nThe consideration in the agreement to purchase by the appellant as to the Rozel Apartments was $82,000, and the consideration in the agreement to purchase made by Paul Klass for the said apartment was $86,750. The considera- tion in the offer to purchase by the appellant as to the Windsor Apartments was $60,000 and the consideration in the offer to purchase the said apartment by Klass was $64,000. The two offers to purchase by Klass were made by him as an individual but he testified at trial that they were really made in his capacity as trustee of or agent for a limited company known as Confidence Enterprises Ltd.\nThree days after the date of the said offers, which were accepted on the same day, Paul Klass gave notice to the appellant that he had assigned all his right in the offers to purchase to the said Confidence Enterprises Ltd. and on the following day the appellant\u2019s solicitor, Mr. A.M. Zivot, by letter to Messrs. Pollock, Nurgitz and Bromley, solicitors for the said Confidence Enterprises Ltd., acknowledged receipt of the notice of assignment. Both of the offers to purchase made by Klass and assigned to Confidence Enterprises Ltd. contained as para. 12 the following term:\n12. The undersigned will be entitled to immediately attend on the premises to execute repairs and renovations and hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless the vendor from any and all claims of any nature whatsoever and provide the vendor with Waivers of Lien and Building Declaration before commencement of any repairs and renovations. The Waivers of Lien shall be from all sub-trades and material suppliers. The undersigned agrees to reimburse the vendor for any loss of rental suffered by the vendor on account of tenants being caused inconvenience or disturbance as a result of such repairs and renovations; the said repairs and renovations shall be conducted with a minimum of inconvenience and disturbance to the tenants.\nThe evidence at trial revealed that the said Paul Klass operated a partnership under the name of Baird, Johnson & Lee, no persons of any of those names being with the partnership at that time. Baird, Johnson & Lee appeared to act as the agents for a series of companies including Confidence Enterprises Ltd., Pacific Leaseholds Ltd., and Hathaway Investments Ltd. All of those companies had been incorporated by various members of the law firm of Pollock, Nurgitz and Bromley and the partners of that firm were some of the officers in the said companies. So soon as the offers to purchase had been accepted, Baird, Johnson & Lee under the direction of the said Paul Klass proceeded to enter the two apartment buildings, the tenants of which remained in possession, and to carry out very extensive renovations thereto. When this work had commenced, Mr. A.M. Zivot, the solicitor for the appellant, wrote in such capacity to Messrs. Pollock, Nurgitz & Bromley, his letter dated October 21, 1963, which reads as follows:\nOctober 21, 1963\nMessrs. Pollock, Nurgitz and Bromley,\nBarristers and Solicitors,\n209 Notre Dame Avenue,\nWinnipeg 2, Manitoba.\nAttention: Mr. G. Pollock\nDear Sirs:\nRe: Sale of Rozel Apartments; Freedman to Klass\nAs per the terms of the offer to Purchase, Mr. Klass was to supply Mr. Freedman with Waivers of Lien from all sub-contractors and suppliers before any work was to be done.\nMr. Freedman has advised the writer that Mr. Klass is now in the process of putting in a gas unit and that the window man and plumbers have started or will be starting work. In addition, there has been some lumber supplied on the building.\nWe would, therefore, ask you to please contact your client and obtain waivers from all the above mentioned parties immediately or we shall have no alternative but to write to these people advising them to cease work and we shall consider the offer null and void and at an end.\nWe are returning to you building declarations in duplicate re the Rozel Apartments and the Windsor Court with one copy of the Waiver of Lien for your client.\nThere has been an arrangement between Mr. Klass and Mr. Freedman, whereby Mr. Freedman would leave two suites in the Rozel Apartments, probably Suite 21 and Suite 5, vacant for Mr. Klass to use as storage, etc. In consideration of same, Mr. Klass has agreed to pay $50.00 per month for each suite or a total of $100.00, commencing from October 15th, 1963. Freedman could have rented one of these suites. However, Klass insisted no more leases be signed.\nWe would appreciate it if you would send us a letter confirming these rental arrangements between Klass and Freedman.\nYours truly,\nLAMONT, BURIAK & ZIVOT\nAZ:PJ\nEncls.\nper: A. ZIVOT\nThe office manager of Baird, Johnson & Lee was one Harold Kaplan and the said Harold Kaplan approached his brother, one Philip Kaplan, who was the office manager of the respondent, and requested that the respondent company make an estimate of the renovations necessary to the electrical work in both these apartments. Upon receipt of the said estimates the said Harold Kaplan authorized the work to proceed. Although the only contemporaneous document as to the contents seems to be the letter from Messrs. Baird, Johnson & Lee to the respondent dated November 5, 1963, which reads:\nThis is to verify the electrical work on the Rozel Apartments\u2014105 Clark Street to pursue on a cost plus basis, as per our conversation.\nTwo invoices were delivered later by the respondent. These two invoices are dated, respectively, March 16, 1964, as to the \u201cRozelle\u201d Apartments, and April 22, 1964, as to the Windsor Apartments. Both of those invoices show that the account was to be paid in twelve monthly instalments; that of the Rozel Apartments to commence on April 1, 1964, and that of the Windsor Apartments to commence on May 1, 1964.\nPhilip Kaplan testified at trial that these monthly payments were arranged so that the cost of the renovations to the electrical work could be paid out of the rentals received.\nMr. Zivot had written to Messrs. Pollock, Nurgitz & Bromley his letter of October 21, 1963, recited supra, demanding the waivers of lien. Prior to the respondent commencing any work on either of the apartments, the said Harold Kaplan had attended the respondent and requested such waivers of lien. The respondent had then prepared waivers of lien on its own forms as to one of the apartment buildings but upon submitting it to Messrs. Baird, Johnson & Lee, the document was said to be unsatisfactory; then waivers of lien were prepared by Messrs. Pollock, Nurgitz & Bromley. These waivers of lien were submitted to Mr. Zivot as solicitor for the appellant and in his aforesaid letter to Messrs. Pollock, Nurgitz & Bromley of October 21, 1963, he said:\nWe are returning to you building declarations in duplicate re the Rozel Apartments and the Windsor Court with one copy of the Waiver of Lien for your client.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nThe learned trial judge, with whom I agree, held that Mr. Zivot, therefore, would be aware of the terms of the waiver of lien and that his knowledge would be the knowledge of his client. The said waivers of lien, produced at trial as exhibits, both purported to be \u201cat the request of Hathaway Investments Ltd., the previous mortgagees, and at the request of Maxwell Freedman, the registered owner\u201d. (The italicizing is my own.) In his evidence, Philip Kaplan, the office manager of the respondent, testified that he had been informed by his brother Harold Kaplan of Messrs. Baird, Johnson & Lee that the latter were not the owners of the premises and that, therefore, he presumed that they were acting only as agents for the owner. Philip Kaplan also testified that at the time the respondent agreed to proceed with the work on a cost plus basis he had not inquired further as to the identity of the owner and that he had caused no searches to be made in the registry office. When, however, the waivers of lien were presented for execution by the respondent they did show that the registered owner was Maxwell Freedman, and Philip Kaplan has testified and Paul Klass has admitted, that at no time from then until after the work was completed and the monthly payments fell into arrears was the respondent ever informed that anyone but the said Maxwell Freedman had any title or interest in the property. Again I agree with the learned trial judge in his finding that this conduct by Maxwell Freedman through his solicitor constituted not only silence but a representation that he the appellant was the owner of the property and would be responsible for the payment of the account which would become due to the respondent for the work to be performed by it.\nIt is true that Philip Kaplan in giving evidence at trial for the respondent admitted that he did not ask his brother for whom Baird, Johnson & Lee were agents and that he did not care as his brother had assured him that the respondent\u2019s account would be paid out of the rents. He further testified that he authorized the execution of the waivers of lien so that the owner whoever he might be could borrow money with which to do the renovations. Philip Kaplan described this as the ordinary course of the respondent\u2019s business. He admitted that the first time that it came to his knowledge that the registered owner was Maxwell Freedman was when the waivers of lien were presented to him for execution, and that not only had he not caused any searches to be made in the registry office but that he did not know any Maxwell Freedman prior to that time. But when a question was put to him:\nQ. So far as you were concerned, the Maxwell Freedman that appeared on the waiver of mechanic\u2019s lien was not of much consequence? he replied:\nA. He was the registered owner.\nAnd further, Kaplan was questioned:\nQ. So you were really looking to the block as sort of a security were you?\nto which he replied:\nA. We were looking to the word of the agent of the owner that the moneys would be paid for the work done.\nThe view of the trial judge, with which I agree, would seem to be confirmed by several circumstances. Firstly, the arrangement that the accounts would be paid from the proceeds of the rent is a definite indication that the owner who would be in receipt of the said rents would be liable to pay the accounts and would pay them. Secondly, in his letter to Pollock, Nurgitz & Bromley of October 21, 1963, which I have quoted above, Mr. Zivot said, in part:\nWe would, therefore, ask you to please contact your client and obtain waivers from all the above mentioned parties immediately or we shall have no alternative but to write to these people advising them to cease work and we shall consider the offer null and void and at an end.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nIn my view, this constitutes an express statement of the solicitor that his client, the appellant, was responsible for the accounts and a threat that, unless he obtained the waivers of lien which he was demanding, the whole situation would be revealed to the contractors thereby making impossible Klass\u2019s method of operation. The waivers of lien, of course, would have no effect to discharge the owner\u2019s liability but would only prevent the contractor obtaining a security by registration of a lien in accordance with the provincial legislation.\nIt was the argument of the appellant before this Court that there could be no liability upon the appellant created by virtue of agency established by estoppel unless there had been a representation to the respondent upon which the respondent acted to its prejudice and further that the evidence did not establish any such estoppel because the respondent through its manager Philip Kaplan had agreed to proceed with the work without even knowing the identity of the owner or making any attempt to determine whether that owner were a responsible party. I think the answer to that contention is that although the respondent had at first agreed to proceed with the work without knowing the identity of the owner and, therefore, of course, without in any way checking the owner\u2019s financial ability, the respondent did know that Baird, Johnson & Lee were acting for the owner, and not in their own right. Mr. Harold Kaplan had so informed Philip Kaplan. The respondent at that time could rely on the owner\u2019s liability to pay the accounts incurred by his agent and upon its lien rights. Then before it abandoned its right to claim security in the property by way of lien the representation was made to it that Maxwell Freedman was the owner and upon that basis it acted to its prejudice in executing the waivers of lien. There may well have been no representation in making the contract in the first place other than the verbal and that Baird, Johnson & Lee were only acting as agents for an unnamed owner who would, of course, be liable for payment. The respondent proceeding in its ordinary course acted on that representation and entered into the contract. But before it had commenced work on the contract the appellant, through his solicitor, made the further representation that he was the registered owner and enabled Baird, Johnson & Lee to obtain the respondent\u2019s waiver of the right to claim a lien on the properties for the amount which would become due to it. This representation was false and the appellant knew he had already sold the properties and that Confidence Enterprises Limited were entitled to become the registered owner. The solicitor demonstrated his knowledge of the falsity and of the importance of the representation in his letter of October 21, 1963. His representation and his knowledge are attributable to his client the appellant. As I have said, the respondent acted on that representation to its prejudice.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and HALL J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Newman, MacLean and Associates, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Sokolov, Wolinsky and Sokolov, Winnipeg.\n"

The company\u2019s capital was invested in farmlands in Saskatchewan. Its charter was forfeited in 1932 and in 1933 the company was struck off the register in Saskatchewan, but the lands remained in the name of the company and as time went on became valuable and a source of profit. These lands were managed by one of the directors until his death in 1942 as though the company was still in existence and thereafter by another director until the appointment on December 18, 1964, of an interim receiver.\nSome time prior to December 6, 1921, three of the shareholders who were also directors of the company improperly withdrew from the company and converted to their own uses respectively funds which together totalled $73,082.21. The said directors later pledged their shares as security for the moneys so withdrawn. In an action brought to secure (a) appointment of a receiver of the property of Remick, Lloyd & Co., (b) realization of the assets of the company and payment of debts, and (c) distribution of the residue amongst those entitled thereto, the trial judge confirmed the appointment of Montreal Trust Company as receiver but refused to order forfeiture or foreclosure of the pledged shares. He ordered that interest should be assessed against the directors\u2019 withdrawals at the rate of 6 per cent for a period of six years. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the trial judge in so far as it dealt with forfeiture of the shares, but varied the judgment by ordering that interest should be charged on the withdrawals at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, not compounded, from December 6, 1921, to the date of judgment.\nOn the present appeal, at the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the Court directed that it was not necessary to hear from the respondents on the issue of forfeiture of the shares, the judgment of the Court of Appeal being upheld on this point. The appeal, accordingly, proceeded on the interest issue, the respondents contending that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied to limit interest to the six-year period fixed by the trial judge. The appellant contended that interest should run from December 6, 1921, as ordered by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The cross-appeal on the interest issue should also be dismissed.\nAlthough the delay here was of long duration, 43 years, that fact alone did not determine whether equitable relief should or should not be granted nor the extent to which in the instant case interest should be charged on the moneys improperly withdrawn in 1921. No colour of right, mistaken belief or other factors which might warrant some consideration in equity existed here. The three directors in question took the moneys and enjoyed the full benefits thereof since 1921. Their situation was analogous to that of a legatee who must bring into account even a statute barred debt before he can claim the legacy left to him in the testator\u2019s will.\nAccordingly, the Court agreed with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the contribution of the representatives of the three directors who improperly withdrew the moneys must be the amounts taken by each of them with interest thereon at 5 per cent per annum, not compounded, from December 6, 1921.\nErlanger v.

Coxworth, Q.C., for Wells estate.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in an action brought to secure (a) appointment of a receiver of the property of Remick, Lloyd & Co., (b) realization of the assets of the company and payment of debts; and (c) distribution of the residue amongst those entitled thereto. The facts are set out seriatim in the judgment of Maguire J.A.[2] and may be summarized as follows:\nRemick, Lloyd & Co. was incorporated in 1911 under the laws of West Virginia. The shareholders of the company were Reuban Lloyd, John Wells, Mary C Nash, Fred E. Roets and Edward C. Remick and they contributed to the capital of the company the sum of $100,000 as follows:\nRemick.............................................\n325 shares..........................\n$ 32,500.00\nLloyd.................................................\n325 shares..........................\n32,500.00\nRoets................................................\n200 shares..........................\n20,000.00\nWells.................................................\n100 shares..........................\n10,000.00\nNash..................................................\n50 shares............................\n5,000.00\n$100,000.00\nThe capital of the company was invested in farmlands in Saskatchewan where the company was until 1933 registered as a foreign corporation at which time it was struck off the register and never reinstated. The company\u2019s West Virginia charter provided that it should expire 50 years from the date of incorporation. The charter was forfeited by decree of the Court in West Virginia on May 27, 1932, for failure to pay its annual licence tax.\nSome time prior to December 6, 1921, three of the shareholders who were also directors of the company improperly withdrew from the company all cash resources held by it at that time and converted to their own uses respectively the following amounts:\nRemick.................................................................................................\n$61,329.46\nRoets....................................................................................................\n3,913.68\nLloyd.....................................................................................................\n7,838.97\nFor many years subsequent to 1921 and throughout the depression the affairs of the company were at a low ebb, accounting, no doubt, for the forfeiture of the charter in 1932 and the company being struck off the register in Saskatchewan in 1933, but the lands remained in the name of the company and as time went on became valuable and a source of profit. These lands were managed by Lloyd until his death in 1942 as though the company was still in existence and thereafter by Roets until the appointment on December 18, 1964, of an interim receiver after the commencement of this action. Remick died in 1958, Roets in 1965. At the time of the trial the lands were said to have a value in excess of $300,000 and in addition there was some $80,000 in cash.\nThe Attorney General for Saskatchewan on behalf of the Crown in the right of the Province claimed all the assets of the company, real and personal, under the provisions of The Escheats Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 81, or, alternatively, under the common law basing his claim on the fact that the company had been dissolved and had ceased to exist. The learned trial judge dismissed the claim of the Attorney General and no appeal was taken from that dismissal. The Attorney General has, therefore, no interest in the present appeal.\nThe appellant who was one of the defendants in the original proceeding contended that the shares of the three directors who had improperly withdrawn the funds of the company and who in 1928 had pledged their shares as security for the moneys so withdrawn should be deemed forfeited or foreclosed on the ground that the directors of the company as such were obligated to proceed against the three shareholders so improperly withdrawing moneys, and it also contended in the alternative that interest should be charged on the moneys so wrongfully taken from December 6, 1921.\nThe learned trial judge, MacPherson J.[3] confirmed the appointment of Montreal Trust Company as receiver but refused to order forfeiture or foreclosure of the shares in question. He ordered that interest should be assessed against the Remick, Lloyd and Roets withdrawals at the rate of 6 per cent for the period of six years. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan on both issues. No cross-appeal was filed. The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of MacPherson J. in so far as it dealt with forfeiture of the shares, but varied the judgment by ordering that interest should be charged on the withdrawals at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, not compounded, from December 6, 1921, to the date of judgment.\nThe appellant in the present appeal contended that the judgment as to forfeiture of the shares should be reversed and that an order to that effect should be made.\nThe respondents Canada Permanent Trust Company and Guaranty Trust Company of Canada gave notice of intention to vary, claiming that no interest should be chargeable on the moneys so withdrawn or, alternatively, that if any interest should be allowed it should be for the period of six years only as directed by the learned trial judge. The respondents Amanda Lloyd and Albert C. Lloyd gave notice of intention to vary, claiming that interest should be allowed on the moneys improperly withdrawn to a period not later than April 4, 1940. However, by notice of motion for leave to amend the notice to vary, these respondents asked for and were given leave to amend the notice to vary by claiming that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied by limiting recovery of interest to a period of six years.\nAt the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the Court directed that it was not necessary to hear from the respondents on the issue of forfeiture of the shares, the judgment of the Court of Appeal being upheld on this point.\nThe appeal, accordingly, proceeded on the interest issue, the respondents contending that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied to limit interest to the six-year period fixed by the learned trial judge. The appellant contended that interest should run from December 6, 1921, as ordered by the Court of Appeal. This issue was dealt with by MacPherson J. as follows:\nI think, in preparing my earlier judgment, I overlooked one factor which I should have considered. I decided to order no interest because the other parties had been guilty of laches. Laches does not start immediately upon the commencement of a cause of action. Laches is a defence only. Interest accrues from day to day and is therefore apportionable.\nIt seems to me that equity and justice would be served if I were to order the estates of Messrs. Remick, Lloyd and Roets to be charged, on distribution, with interest at six percent for six years. The law is clear that the awarding of full or only partial compensation by way of interest falls to be determined on the same equitable principles as govern a court in determining the just remedy to be granted in respect of the main claim. Lord Blackburn in Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company[4] summarized the principles involved at pp. 1279-80 as follows:\nIn Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Hurd [(1874), L.R. 5 P.C. 221, at 239, varying 17 Gr. 115], it is said: \u201cThe doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where, by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.\u201d I have looked in vain for any authority which gives a more distinct and definite rule than this; and I think, from the nature of the inquiry, it must always be a question of more or less, depending on the degree of diligence which might reasonably be required, and the degree of change which has occurred, whether the balance of justice or injustice is in favour of granting the remedy or withholding it. The determination of such a question must largely depend on the turn of mind of those who have to decide, and must therefore be subject to uncertainty; but that, I think, is inherent in the nature of the inquiry.\nRinfret J. (as he then was) dealt with the matter in Harris v. Lindeborg[5], as follows:\n\u2026 but the action is not barred by any statute of limitations and mere lapse of time is not sufficient to deprive the appellant of his equitable rights against the respondents. In order to decide whether the remedy should be granted or withheld, we must examine the nature of the acts done in the interval, the degree of change which has occurred, how far they have affected the parties and where lies the balance of justice and injustice.\nI agree with Maguire J.A. that though the delay here is of long duration, 43 years, that fact alone does not determine whether equitable relief should or should not be granted nor the extent to which in the instant case interest should be charged on the moneys improperly withdrawn in 1921. No colour of right, mistaken belief or other factors which might warrant some consideration in equity exist here. The three directors in question took the moneys and enjoyed the full benefits thereof since 1921. Their situation is analogous to that of a legatee who must bring into account even a statute barred debt before he can claim the legacy left to him in the testator\u2019s will. Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 2 at pp. 484-5 puts the proposition as follows:\n\u2026 but the principle applicable is that a person who owes money which would swell the mass of the deceased\u2019s estate is bound to make his contribution to the estate before taking a part share out of it\u2026.\nciting Cherry v. Boultbee[6] and Courtnay v. Williams[7].\nThe contribution which the representatives of the three directors who improperly withdrew the moneys must be the amounts taken by each of them with interest thereon at 5 per cent per annum, not compounded, from December 6, 1921. I agree with Maguire J.A. that the trial judgment should be varied by providing that in effecting distribution the receiver should add interest as aforesaid to the respective amounts chargeable against the Remick, Lloyd and Roets estates respectively. It follows that the cross-appeal on the interest issue should also be dismissed.\nIn the circumstances of this case and success in this Court being divided, the costs of all parties should be paid by the receiver out of funds in or coming into its hands.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: S.J.

The other car was owned by the defendant IW and was being driven by the defendant RW. On the trial of the action subsequently brought by the plaintiff, the jury found that there was negligence on the part of the defendant RW, which caused or contributed to the accident. They gave the following particulars of his negligence: 1. driving too fast in an unfamiliar area; 2. in view of driving and road conditions\u2014exercised poor judgment in passing a series of cars on a hill. The jury further found that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s husband.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s damages for her own injury were assessed at $2,500 and her claim for the death of her husband was assessed at $27,000. Judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff for the sums awarded together with costs. An appeal was taken by the defendants to the Court of Appeal. The whole Court found misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge with respect to damages. The majority of the Court found misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge with respect to the question of liability and a new trial was ordered with respect to both questions save only that the new trial directed as to damages was to be concerned only with the plaintiff\u2019s claim under The Fatal Accidents Act and there was to be no new assessment of her personal damages. The plaintiff appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored.\nThe Court rejected the position taken by the defendants that the trial judge \u201c\u2026failed to direct the jury that having regard for all the evidence there must have been some negligence on the part of the deceased, Basil Byron, which caused or contributed to the damages of the plaintiffs\u201d. The trial judge, in his charge to the jury, drew to the attention of the jury the obligations which the law imposes upon a driver entering a through street and no objection was taken to his charge in this respect, and having regard to the functions of an appellate court when dealing with the verdict of a jury which were stated by Duff C.J.C. in Canadian National Railways v. Muller, [1934] 1 D.L.R. 768, this Court was of the view that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that there was misdirection in respect of liability.\nAs to the objection that the trial judge had mentioned amounts which might be called both a ceiling and a floor in relation to the amount to be awarded, it was held that, having regard to all the evidence that was before the jury and the judge\u2019s charge in relation to quantum as a whole, there was no substantial misdirection here and certainly no error constituting a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of The Judicature Act.\nGray v. Alanco Developments Ltd. et al., [1967] 1 O.R. 597, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing an appeal from a judgment of Landreville J. and ordering a new trial in an action for damages for negligence. Appeal allowed.\nD.J. MacLennan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJohn J. Fitzpatrick, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Judson, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of Ontario which directed a new trial both as to liability and quantum following a trial before Landreville J. with a jury. The action arose out of a collision between two automobiles at the intersection of Royal York Road and Lawrence Avenue West in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto at approximately 11:50 p.m. on the night of December 25, 1963, in which the driver of one of the cars, Basil Joseph Byron, was killed. The other car, a yellow Vauxhall Cresta model, was owned by Isobel May Williams and then being driven by Roger Barry Williams. The following questions relating to Roger Barry Williams were put to the jury and answered as stated:\n1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant Roger Williams, which caused or contributed to the accident?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d\nAnswer: Yes. 2. If your answer to question 1 is \u201cyes\u201d of what did such negligence consist? Answer fully, specifying each act of negligence of the defendant, Roger Williams, which you find caused or contributed to the accident.\nAnswer: 1. Driving too fast in an unfamiliar area. 2. In view of driving and road conditions\u2014exercised poor judgment in passing a series of cars on a hill.\nA further question relating to the deceased, Basil Joseph Byron, was put to the jury to which the jury replied as shown:\n3. Was there any negligence on the part of the late Basil Byron?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d\nAnswer: No.\nThere was abundant evidence to justify the negligence found by the jury. The jury had heard Constable Downton, a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force who, on the night in question, was on car patrol in the area in question and who was in a marked police car observing traffic on Royal York Road south of Lawrence Avenue. He was parked in a position where he could observe traffic on Royal York Road, and as he sat there he saw the yellow Vauxhall Cresta model travelling northward on Royal York Road at a speed which he considered excessive and he immediately put his car in motion and took off after the Vauxhall. He describes the condition of Royal York Road at the time as being wet and greasy and the area somewhat poorly lighted. Royal York Road is hilly at this point, and as he proceeded to follow the Vauxhall he saw it overtake and pass four cars going in the same direction. He estimates the speed of the Vauxhall as it overtook and passed these four cars to be close to double the speed of the cars being overtaken and he estimates the speed of the cars being overtaken as being 30 to 35 miles per hour. The Vauxhall remained on the left side of the two-lane highway which was about 21 feet wide until it approached the crest of a hill in the road to the north of which lay the intersection with Lawrence Avenue. He did not actually see the collision as the intersection was over the crest of the hill. The constable also testified that south of the intersection and south of the crest of the hill there was a sign plainly visible on the east side of Royal York Road which said \u201cReduce Speed Dangerous Intersection\u201d.\nThe driver Williams in his testimony testified that he had been travelling at about 35 miles an hour. He admit- ted having overtaken the cars referred to by Constable Downton and said that when he was about 250 feet from the Lawrence Avenue intersection a car emerged from that intersection and proceeded southward on Royal York Road, and when he was about 100 feet from the intersection the Byron car emerged. It was stationary when he first saw it. He said he slammed on his brakes and \u201cthe car skidded on the wet road and into the side of the Byron vehicle\u201d which had reached the centre of the intersection. It is obvious that the jury did not accept Williams\u2019 testimony and disbelieved his statement that he was only going at 35 miles an hour and chose instead to accept the evidence of Constable Downton which indicated driving in a highly negligent manner.\nThe basis of the appeal in respect of liability was that the learned trial judge had\n\u2026failed to direct the jury that having regard for all the evidence there must have been some negligence on the part of the deceased, Basil Byron, which caused or contributed to the damages of the plaintiffs.\nand that was the position taken by the respondent in this Court.\nThe part of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to which the respondent objected and which found favour in the Court of Appeal reads:\nLikewise, the plaintiff comes in with a reply and the plaintiff says, \u201cLook, after all, you ran into the side of my car. I didn\u2019t run into you. I was broadside, and if I were in that intersection, and if you had good lights on your car, my car would have been visible to you, driver defendant, 200 feet away, for under the Highway Traffic Act, headlights must be able to light up an object at that distance, minimum. So either you had good lights, in which case you would have seen me, or else your lights were so weak and poor on the low beam, that you saw me through the lights of your car when you were 50-75 feet away, and too late because of your faulty lights.\u201d So, it is a dilemma that the plaintiff throws back to the defendant.\nImmediately before the extract just quoted from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge, he had dealt with the defendant\u2019s (Williams\u2019) case as follows:\nThe defendant says, \u201cWell now, why did you not wait there allowing me to pass to go by on the through street, and obey that Section 64.\u201d He says, \u201cThere are two things. Surely, I did not come out of a blue sky, and I must have been visible.\u201d Here the argument is twisted around to the advantage of the defendant, \u201cI must have been visible for 150 feet. If you blame me for not applying my brakes 150 feet away, I can say that you must have seen me 150 feet away, or 200 feet away. And if you did, you did not see me or see the car.\u201d He says, \u201cIt is a reasonable inference that you must have seen the reflection of my lights coming up the hill and, thus, you were under an obligation of waiting and not starting across the intersection for I hit you a second or two after you moved.\u201d\nThe defendant says, \u201cThere was nothing I could do in that circumstance.\u201d Because you might argue, and that argument hasn\u2019t been advanced, but you might argue that it might be one of logic, \u201cyour lights\u2014your car being sideways to me, I did not see your lights as they did not shine on me, but I was visible when you started moving sideways, and only my lights could pick up the side of your car, and when my lights picked them up, I did everything I could to avoid the accident and applied my brakes and skidded. It is your fault.\u201d\nSo there you have the strength, in essence, of the defendant\u2019s case. The defendant has a right, at law, to presume that other people will obey the law. And when you are driving down the street, and there is a stop sign, and you see a car approaching that stop sign and you are close to the intersection yourself, you don\u2019t have to stop. You have the right to presume that the other driver is going to stop, and if he disobeys that stop sign and comes in front of you, and that is clearly proven, then that other driver has failed in his duty.\nLikewise, if the driver has stopped and he starts off in front of you, when you are in that vicinity clearly visible, then he has no business coming across your path of travel, and it is his fault. Those are arguments which fall on the side of the defence.\nHe said later, in dealing with the plea of contributory negligence:\nI have entirely forgotten something in discussing the law. We were discussing the cause of this accident. Sometimes, in a given set of circumstances, while there may be a cause, another person has contributed to that as a cause to the accident, and this brings in the Negligence Act of Ontario.\nThe Negligence Act sets out that where you find an accident to have been caused by two persons, two drivers, and you say that one has contributed to the accident; in short, the analysis is of the question, first of all, to find out if the plaintiff, Basil Byron, was negligent\u2014excuse me, was the defendant negligent. And if you arrive at the conclusion that he wasn\u2019t\u2014let us assume that\u2014if you say he was not negligent, then the plaintiff\u2019s action fails.\nIf you find that the defendant driver was negligent, you go one step more and you say, \u201cNow, was the late Basil Byron also negligent? Was there something he could have done to avoid this accident? Was he alert? Was he cautious? Did he fail to advance sufficiently in the intersection to see if there were lights coming or cars, or anything?\u201d You analyze all the acts of Basil Byron, and if you arrive at the conclusion that there was some negligence on his part, then the Negligence Act applies, and you have the right to apportion the liability between the plaintiff and the defendant.\nIn my view the extract referred to in the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be read in the light of what the learned trial judge said immediately before, and when so read I am unable to see that there was any misdirection. McLennan J.A., in the Court of Appeal, while agreeing that there had been misdirection, went on to say:\nIn view of the clear position put to the jury that he is just offering them arguments that might be put forward and had previously made it clear elsewhere in his charge that it is entirely a question for them to decide, I do not think that constitutes any error constituting a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of the Judicature Act. The findings of the jury with respect to the negligence of the defendant are\u2014(1) driving too fast in an unfamiliar area, (2) in view of driving and road conditions, exercised poor judgment in passing a series of cars on a hill. There is nothing in the findings related to what is said to be misdirection.\nThe learned trial judge, in his charge to the jury, drew to the attention of the jury the obligations which the law imposes upon a driver entering a through street and no objection was taken to his charge in this respect, and having regard to the functions of an appellate court when dealing with the verdict of a jury which were succinctly stated by Duff C.J.C. in Canadian National Railways v. Muller[1] as follows:\nWe premise that it is not the function of this Court, as it was not the duty of the Court of Appeal, to review the findings of fact at which the jury arrived. Those findings are conclusive unless they are so wholly unreasonable as to show that the jury could not have been acting judicially;\nI am of the view that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that there was misdirection and I would allow the appeal in respect of liability.\nThe appellant also appealed on the damage issue alleging misdirection and in this regard all three members of the Court of Appeal which heard the appeal were of opinion that a new trial should be had on the question of quantum and ordered a new trial accordingly.\nIt is a question of whether there was evidence upon which the jury, properly instructed, could arrive at the amount awarded or whether the amount awarded was such that twelve sensible men could not have reasonably arrived at that sum.\nI think the amount awarded was reasonable in the circumstances and supported by the evidence. However, the respondents objected to the following statement by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury:\nWhen the actuary gives us how much money would be required to purchase a five and a quarter annuity to produce $1,000.00 each year, and he gives us a sum of $13,364.00, and then you jump to the figure of $3,000.00. Let us say he makes $3,500 a year. You multiply that by $3,500.00 and you would arrive at an amount close to $45,000.00. So now I want to tell you that do not be misled by the figures of the actuary in that respect. They are intended as a guide; but a guide that is very far off because they do not take into account a multitude of contingencies that might arise, if the man had lived, and any amount in that area, in my opinion, would be overly generous. Just as much as if you award this lady $5,000.00 or $10,000.00, I would say you are starting to be cheap and picayune on that score. So that there is a limit, but that I give you a very wide margin, depending on your appraisal of those facts, of these contingencies of which I have spoken, and then you can determine what might be a financial security for this woman, to replace the financial security which she had in her husband.\nIt is to be noted, however, that the statement objected to was preceded by the following:\nThe most important aspect of her claim is as of executrix of the estate. We have heard a considerable body of evidence as to her husband, Basil Byron. There is no doubt that starting with the basis of it, it is a shock for a woman to lose her husband, and it\u2019s the same matter for a man to lose his wife, but we are not here, and neither is it your function, to analyze and award damages for sentimentalities. You must not proceed out of sentiment for the plaintiff, or on sentiment of revenge against the defendant, if you find him liable.\nThe amount that must be fixed is based on the pecuniary loss, expectation of life, economic gain, security and stability of life, which this woman had when she had her husband, and which she has not now.\nYou are entitled to take into account the character of the man, and you must take into account that whether he was a good worker, because on that hinges stability, and also his habits, living habits, his relationship with his own wife.\nI can only summarize by saying that generally speaking, Basil Byron has been shown by the witnesses to be an ordinary, sound, good-living man, getting along reasonably well with his wife. There is a presumption that people, husband and wife, do get along, and not the contrary presumption that he was a man who carried certain complexes from his war service. That he appeared to be a good worker, according to the witnesses. I, unfortunately, and you might not view it with a great deal of understanding, those changes of jobs all the time. This may be explained that he wanted to improve his income and wanted to learn in a new field, but a rolling stone many times does not gather any moss. The man had been off work for some\u2014one employer said one month, and there was some evidence about three months. But be that as it may, over all their married life it is not substantial. You may take that into account\u2014the future of that man which would be reasonably expected.\nYou must not be generous, and you must not be picayune in awarding that amount, because there are all sorts of contingencies that may arise. Mrs. Byron might die, and we hope that that definitely isn\u2019t true. In a few years time, there may be a possibility that Mrs. Byron might marry, and that is a possibility, in the light of seeing her and how she has spoken to you, and how the medical reports are. These are things you are entitled to take into consideration.\nThe plaintiff has produced an actuary\u2019s testimony showing, on the basis of the average, on the given basis of the age of the wife, and on the basis of the age of the husband, what is the expectancy of life\u2014the expectancy of life, and that is 22.5 years. That is, again, a probability on the average, but it does not mean that it will be an actual fact that he would have lived to 22.5 years. One or the other may have died\u2014the male 28.1, and the female 29.5. You take it all into consideration, therefore, the probability and you have to analyze, and you are entitled to take and to consider that he was a man five feet, ten and 135 pounds in weight; his physical condition\u2014his reported health, his energy, his living habits\u2014these are the things to consider.\nThe objection is to the learned trial judge having mentioned amounts which might be called both a ceiling and a floor in relation to the amount to be awarded. It would have been better if the learned judge had not been as specific as he was in this instance, but the real question is whether what he did say was misdirection of a nature requiring a new trial on the issue of damages. Having regard to all the evidence that was before the jury and the judge\u2019s charge in relation to quantum as a whole, I am of opinion that there was no substantial misdirection here and certainly no error constituting a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of The Judicature Act.\nI have decided this case without reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Gray v. Alanco Developments Ltd. et al.[2] I have proceeded solely on the ground that in this particular case the assessment of the jury is, in my opinion, reasonable and one that ought to be supported. I would reserve Gray v. Alanco Developments Ltd. et al. for further consideration when the occasion arises.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment with costs here and below.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by my brother Hall with which I am in full accord, but I would like to say also that this case is in my view clearly distinguishable from that of Gray v. Alanco Developments Ltd. et al.2, to which reference was made by counsel for the respondents. The unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the latter case was rendered on the day after the decision was handed down in that Court in the present appeal and the Court there ordered a new trial limited to the assessment of general damages on the ground that the trial judge had expressed his personal view as to the upper and lower limits of damages to be awarded under this head in that case. I think it important to observe that the decision in that case was limited to precluding a trial judge from expressing his personal opinion based on figures awarded in other cases as to the proper quantum of damages to be awarded, for example, for pain and suffering or for loss of the amenities of life.\nThe limited effect of the decision in that case is disclosed in the following passage from the reasons for judgment at p. 603 where it is said:\nWhat has been stated is applicable to those headings of general damages where there can be no evidence as to the value in monetary terms of the loss sustained, for example damages, claimed for pain and suffering or the loss or diminution of the amenities of life.\nIn the present case the learned trial judge was commenting on the effect to be given to the evidence of an actuary as to life expectancy and the amount that would be required to purchase an annuity, and having pointed out to the jury that these figures were only intended as a guide, he went on to speak of the hazards of life which would have existed even if the husband had not been killed and which should be taken into consideration in making an award to the widow. In so doing he, in effect, indicated that the jury would be \u201coverly generous\u201d if they considered awarding an amount in the area of a figure based entirely on the actuarial tables and he also expressed the opinion that if they only awarded $5,000 or $10,000 they would, in his opinion, be starting to be \u201ccheap and picayune on that score\u201d.\nThese remarks of the trial judge in the present case do not appear to me to come within the category referred to in Gray v. Alanco Developments Ltd. et al., supra, and I agree with my brother Hall that reading the trial judge\u2019s charge as a whole, the mention of his opinion as to amounts to be awarded was in no way a fatal defect.\nAs I have indicated, I would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Hall.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: MacMillan, Rooke, MacLennan & Avery, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Gardiner, Roberts, Anderson, Conlin, Fitzpatrick, O\u2019Donohue & White, Toronto.\n[1] [1934] 1 D.L.R. 768.\n[2] [1967] 1 O.R. 597, 61 D.L.R.

The company maintained a register of transfers of shares in Montreal and also maintained branch registers in the United States, where the share certificates were physically situated. An assessment against the estate was not contested but the tax was not paid. A writ of fieri facias was issued out of the Exchequer Court, directed to the sheriff of the judicial district of Montreal. The seizure of the shares was then made. By a petition of right, the executors of the estate claimed that the seizure of the shares was invalid. The Exchequer Court dismissed the petition of right. The executors appealed to this Court where the sole question in issue was whether the shares were situated in Canada for the purposes of judicial execution.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The shares were validly seized. The true principles to be applied in this case were those set out in Braun v. The Custodian, [1944] S.C.R. 339. There was no valid reason why the same considerations should not apply to determine the situs of shares for the purpose of judicial execution as for the purpose of a dispute as to ownership. In both cases, the dominant consideration was the jurisdiction of the court to which the company was ultimately subject.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t successoral\u2014Situs des parts d\u2019une compagnie\u2014Non paiement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t successoral d\u2019un non r\u00e9sident\u2014Saisie des parts par un bref de fieri facias \u00e9manant de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier\u2014Compagnie constitu\u00e9e en corporation au Canada\u2014Situs des parts pour les fins de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution en justice\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98, art. 74\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, 1958 (Can.), c. 29, arts. 38(e), 47.\nLa succession d\u2019une dame H, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e en 1963 alors qu\u2019elle avait son domicile aux \u00c9tats-Unis et y \u00e9tait une r\u00e9sidente, comprenait un grand nombre de parts de Aluminium Limited, une compagnie constitu\u00e9e en corporation en vertu de la Loi sur les compagnies du Canada et ayant son si\u00e8ge social et son principal \u00e9tablissement dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, on a petition of right. Appeal dismissed. John de M. Marler, Q.C., and R.J. Cowling, for the appellants.\nD.S. Maxwell, Q.C., and D.G.H. Bowman, for the defendant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court1, rendered August 18, 1966, whereby it was declared that certain shares of Aluminium Limited were validly seized under a writ of fieri facias issued out of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe circumstances giving rise to the present dispute are set forth in a statement of facts, agreed to by the parties. The late Rachel McM. M. Hunt died in the City of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 22, 1963. At her death she was domiciled in, and a citizen of, the United States of America. The appellants were named as Executors under her will, and probate of her will was granted to them on March 18, 1963.\nAt the date of her death, the late Mrs. Hunt owned 43,560 shares in the capital stock of Aluminium Limited. Aluminium Limited is a company incorporated under the Companies Act of Canada, and at all relevant times had its head office and principal place of business in the City of Montreal. Almost all of the meetings of directors, and all meetings of shareholders of Aluminium Limited, are held at the company\u2019s head office in the City of Montreal and the central management of the company is located there. At the date of death of the deceased, the company maintained a register of transfers of shares in its capital stock and all books required to be kept by it pursuant to s. 107 of the Companies Act in the City of Montreal. It also maintained branch registers of transfers in Pittsburg, New York, London (England), Toronto and Vancouver. The shares of Aluminium Limited were listed on the Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Midwest, Pacific Coast, London, Paris, Basle, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich Stock Exchanges. At the date of death, the share certificates relating to the shares owned by the deceased were physically situated in the City of Pittsburg. On May 14, 1963, estate tax, in the amount of $156,620.73, was assessed pursuant to Part II of the Estate Tax Act, Statutes of Canada 1958, c. 29. Under that Part, there is imposed an estate tax of 15 per cent of the aggregate value of property situated in Canada of a person domiciled outside Canada. For the purposes of Part II of the Act, the situs of shares in a corporation is deemed by s. 38 of the Act to be the place where the corporation is incorporated. Accordingly for the purposes of Part II of the Estate Tax Act, the shares of Aluminium Limited were deemed to be situated in Canada. No objection to the assessment has been filed pursuant to s. 22 of the Estate Tax Act.\nOn May 14, 1963, the Deputy Minister of National Revenue issued a certificate, alleging that estate tax in the sum of $156,620.73 was due, owing and unpaid by the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, Executor of the Estate of Rachel McM. M. Hunt. This certificate was registered in the Exchequer Court. No objection is taken in this appeal to the issuance or registration of the said certificate which, under s. 41 of the Estate Tax Act, has the same force and effect as a judgment obtained in the Exchequer Court.\nOn May 14, 1963, a writ of fieri facias was issued out of the Exchequer Court and directed to the Sheriff of the Judicial District of Montreal who is, by virtue of s. 74 of the Exchequer Court Act, ex officio an officer of the said Court. The Sheriff took the steps appropriate to the seizure of the Hunt shares in accordance with the requirements of the writ.\nBy petition of right filed on June 6, 1963, and amended on June 21, 1963, the appellants claimed, inter alia, that the seizure of the said shares was invalid, and it is from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing the appellants\u2019 action, that this appeal is brought.\nBefore the Exchequer Court, the sole issue was whether the shares of Aluminium Limited were situated in Canada for the purposes of judicial execution under the processes of the Exchequer Court.\nFollowing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, counsel for appellants advised counsel for respondent of his intention to contend before this Court that, whatever might have been the situs of the shares, the writ of execution issued out of the Exchequer Court was not in the appropriate form and that it was therefore ineffective to seize the shares. At the argument before us, counsel for appellants was informed that, in the circumstances of this case, and applying the principles enunciated by Duff C.J. in Dominion Royalty Corporation Ltd. v. Goffatt[2] this point, as to procedure, cannot be entertained in this Court.\nThe sole question in issue before this Court is, therefore, whether the shares in question were property in Canada for the purposes of judicial execution. Three possible conclusions are open for consideration; either for purposes of execution (1) the shares were situate only in Canada or (2) they were situate in both Canada and Pennsylvania or (3) they were situate only in Pennsylvania.\nThe appellants can succeed only if they establish that the learned trial judge ought to have rejected the first two alternatives and adopted the third.\nCounsel for appellants put his case squarely on the familiar line of cases which established the rule that, for provincial succession duty purposes, shares have a situs where they can be effectively dealt with: Brassard v. Smith[3], Rex v. Williams[4] and Treasurer of Ontario v. Aberdein[5].\nAppellants\u2019 contention was that the situs of Mrs. Hunt\u2019s shares, for present purposes, was in the United States and particularly in Pittsburg, either because of the rule of situs laid down in Rex v. Williams and Ontario v. Aberdein or simply by reason of the physical location there of her share certificates.\nIn Brassard v. Smith, the shares in question there could be effectively dealt with only in Quebec. In the Williams case, as in the present case, the Court was faced with a situation where the shares could be validly transferred in more than one place. In Williams, the shares were validly transferable on registries in Ontario and in Buffalo, New York, so the problem arose that, for the purposes of provincial succession duty, one, and only one, local situs had to be chosen. At page 558, Viscount Maugham, referring to the decision of this Court in R. v. National Trust,[6] said:\nIn what their Lordships take leave to describe as a very luminous judgment of the Supreme Court Chief Justice Duff formulated as the result of the authorities certain propositions pertinent to the question of situs of property with which their Lordships agree. First, property, whether movable or immovable, can, for the purposes of determining situs as among the different provinces of Canada in relation to the incidence of a tax imposed by a provincial law upon property transmitted owing to death, have only one local situation. Secondly, situs in respect of intangible property must be determined by reference to some principle or coherent system of principles, and the courts appear to have acted on the assumption that the legislature in defining in part at all events by reference to the local situation of such property the authority of the province in relation to taxation, must be supposed to have had in view the principles deducible from the common law. Thirdly, a provincial legislature is not competent to prescribe the conditions fixing the situs of intangible property for the purpose of defining the subjects in respect of which its powers of taxation under s. 92, sub-s. 2, of the British North America Act may be put into effect.\nand at page 559,\nOne or other of the two possible places where the shares can be effectively transferred must therefore be selected on a rational ground.\nThe factor which impelled the Court to decide in favour of New York, rather than Ontario, was the existence in Buffalo, at the date of death, of certificates in the name of the testator endorsed in blank.\nThe passage which I have quoted makes it clear however that the rule followed to determine the situs of shares in issue in the Williams case does not necessarily apply to the situs of shares for the purposes of judicial execution. The Parliament of Canada can prescribe the situs of shares in federally incorporated companies. It has done so for estate tax purposes by the combined effect of s. 38(e), s. 47(1) and s. 47(4) of the Estate Tax Act.\nIn my opinion, the true principles to be applied in a case of the kind we are concerned with here are those set out in Braun v. The Custodian[7]. The question there was the situs of shares in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, for the purpose of determining a dispute as to their ownership as between a purchaser from an alien enemy, and the Custodian of Enemy Property. The share certificates stood in the names of alien enemies, and were bought by Braun on the Berlin Exchange in October 1919. The shares were on the New York register of the company and transfers were registrable only in New York. The certificates had transfers on the back endorsed in blank by the registered owners. In April 1919, the shares had been made the subject of a vesting order under the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy. In November 1919, Braun presented the certificates for registration in his name at the New York office. Registration was refused on the ground that the vesting order of April 1919 vested them in the Canadian Custodian. It was contended that the vesting order was a nullity on the ground that the situs of the shares was New York and that therefore no Canadian court could validly deal with them.\nThe Exchequer Court and this Court rejected this contention and held the shares to be situate in Canada.\nIn this Court, Kerwin J., as he then was, speaking for the Court said at p. 345:\nWhile ordinarily (in the present instance) the law of Germany would determine the effect of the contract to transfer the certificates, \u201cthe distinction\u201d, as Professor Beale points out in volume 1 of his Conflict of Laws, page 446, \u201cbetween the certificate of stock and the stock itself is an important one. The latter has its situs at the domicile of the corporation and there only\u201d.\n* * *\nHere the situs of the shares, as distinguished from that of the certificates, was in Canada and the New York Uniform Stock Transfer Law, relied upon by the appellant, has no bearing upon the question. The fact that the Railway Company was authorized to, and did in fact, establish a transfer office in the State of New York where, only, transfers of the shares in question were registrable, cannot make any difference. This was a mere matter of convenience and did not detract from the power of Canada to deal with the title to the shares of the Canadian company.\nThe appellant also relied on the decision of the Privy Council in Rex v. Williams (2). There the Province of Ontario attempted to collect succession duty upon shares of a mining company incorporated by letters patent under the Ontario Companies Act and which had two transfer offices, one in Toronto and the other in Buffalo, New York, at either of which shareholders might have their shares registered and transferred in the books of the company. The shares in question were those of a testator who died domiciled in New York and the share certificates themselves were physically located there. Viscount Maugham pointed out that \u201cOne or other of the two possible places where the shares can be effectively transferred must therefore be selected on a rational ground\u201d (p. 559); and further: \u201cIn a business sense the shares at the date of the death could effectively be dealt with in Buffalo and not in Ontario\u201d (p. 560). The considerations which apply to a discussion as to the situs of shares for provincial succession duty purposes where a provincial legislature is restricted to direct taxation within the province cannot affect the matter at present under review. I can see no valid reason why the same considerations should not apply, to determine the situs of shares for the purpose of judicial execution, as for the purpose of a dispute as to ownership. In both cases, the dominant consideration is the jurisdiction of the court to which the company is ultimately subject.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

Toronto Stock Exchange et al., [1968] S.C.R. 330\nDate: 1968-03-13\nWilfred M. Posluns (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange (Defendant) Respondent;\nand\nGeorge Gardiner (Defendant).\n1967: October 16, 17; 1968: March 13.\nPresent: Abbott, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAdministrative law\u2014Investigation by Board of Governors of Stock Exchange concerning certain option transactions by member company\u2014Representative of company fined and Board\u2019s approval of appellant\u2019s association with company withdrawn\u2014Whether Board in taking action against appellant exercised its jurisdiction legally and in accordance with rules of natural justice.\nThe Board of Governors of the Toronto Stock Exchange was informed that a member company was acting for both sides in certain option transactions and as a result four directors of the company, including the appellant, were interviewed by some members of the Board. In consequence of these discussions the Board decided to hold a meeting to investigate and consider the question of whether or not the member of the Exchange for the company was guilty of any offence under the by-laws or rulings of the Exchange. A notice was issued that an inquiry would be held to determine, inter alia, whether the member company, while acting as agent for a customer on one side of the transactions in question, had acted on the other side for a company in which the appellant had a one-sixth personal interest.\nOn the day before the meeting was to take place the appellant consulted the member firm\u2019s counsel as to whether he should have his own counsel at the hearing. He was advised that the hearing was to be with reference to the company and that his position was not particularly different from that of the other directors. The appellant was present at the hearing and was given an opportunity to explain his role in the matter. The Board found that the company was guilty and the maximum fine was imposed. The Board then went on to deal independently and additionally with the appellant and after some discussion it was resolved to terminate all prior consents given to the appellant as a director, officer and shareholder of the company.\nOn the day following the hearing, representations were made to the Board that there should be a rehearing with respect to the appellant\u2019s personal position. The Board having acceded to this request a rehearing was held at which a statement was read reviewing what had transpired at the original hearing in so far as it related to the appellant. Appellant\u2019s counsel was asked whether he wished to call any additional evidence and replied that there was no dispute about the evidence but only as to the interpretation to be placed upon it. Appellant\u2019s counsel then made full representations to the Board, following which the Board considered the matter and concluded that appellant\u2019s conduct was such to warrant the withdrawal of the Board\u2019s approval of his association with the member company, but they agreed to give him ten days in which to resign and withheld official publication of the resolution passed against him until that period had expired. The appellant, however, declined to resign and a letter was accordingly forwarded from the Board to the company giving formal notice of the resolution. The appellant was subsequently removed as a director and was discharged from his association with the firm.\nAn action brought by the appellant against the Exchange for substantial damages and for a declaration that the Board of Governors of the Exchange had acted illegally and contrary to the rules of natural justice in terminating all prior consents given by it for the appellant to act as a director, officer, shareholder or employee of the member company was dismissed by the trial judge and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court found that neither the good faith nor the mode of procedure of the Board had been successfully impugned. The appellant had been fully informed of what was alleged against him and was given an opportunity to present his version and explanation of the allegations. Russell v. Russell (1880), 14 Ch. D. 471; Board of Education v. Rice, [1911] A.C. 179, applied; Ridge v. Baldwin, [1964] A.C. 40, distinguished; Weinberger v. Inglis, [1919] A.C. 606, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Gale J. (now C.J.O.). Appeal dismissed.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and R.B. Tuer, for the plaintiff, appellant. A.S. Pattillo, Q.C., and J.F. Howard, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the judgment rendered at trial by Mr. Justice Gale (as he then was) whereby he dismissed the action which the appellant had brought against the Toronto Stock Exchange (hereinafter called the \u201cExchange\u201d) for substantial damages and for a declaration that the Board of Governors of the Exchange had acted illegally and contrary to the rules of natural justice in terminating all prior consents given by it for the appellant to act as a director, officer, shareholder or employee of R.A. Daly and Company Limited (hereafter called the \u201cDaly Company\u201d) a member corporation of the Exchange which was represented thereon by one of its directors, R.A. Daly, Jr. The result of the order which is challenged in these proceedings was that the appellant was removed as a director of the Daly Company and was discharged from his association with that firm where he had been an active partner and where the trial judge found that he had been engaged as a \u201ccustomers\u2019 man\u201d for the solicitation of commission business in securities listed on the Exchange.\nThe background of this case has been carefully and accurately described in the very full judgment of the learned trial judge which is reported in 46 D.L.R. (2d) at pp. 210 to 347 and which was confirmed by the Court of Appeal[2] so that I do not find it necessary to do more than present a summary of the circumstances which provided the immediate cause for the Board of Governors of the Exchange acting as they did.\nWhen the appellant became associated with the Daly Company in the year 1960, he had already become interested in the somewhat specialized field of dealing in the buying and selling of options on shares and he had acquired a one-sixth interest in a partnership under the name of Lido Investments which engaged in that business. During 1960 one of the appellant\u2019s clients, a Mr. Lynch who was a Peter- borough druggist, sold 570 options through the Daly Company acting as his agent and the Daly Company in turn purchased 313 of these options in its capacity as agent for Lido and in the same capacity sold most of these in New York at a price higher than the price received by Lynch. The Daly Company charged Lynch a commission of 5.5 per cent on the options sold to Lido and charged Lido 1.1 per cent on their purchase, but no commission charge was made to Lido on any of the sales made in New York. The appellant, as one of the owners of Lido, shared in the substantial profit which was made by that partnership through these transactions, and through his association with the Daly Company he also participated in the profits made on the other side of the transactions both through commissions and as a shareholder of that company.\nEarly in February 1961, it came to the attention of the Exchange that the Daly Company was acting for both sides in the Lynch-Lido option transactions and this was reported to the Board of Governors of the Exchange as a result of which four of the directors of the Daly Company, including the appellant, were interviewed by some members of the Board on February 15 when the appellant was questioned about the operations of Lido and his interest in it, and there was a discussion about the Daly Company\u2019s position in relation to the transactions. In consequence of these discussions the Board decided to hold a meeting on February 28 to investigate and consider the question of whether or not R.A. Daly, Jr., as a member of the Exchange and director of the Daly Company, was guilty of any offence under the by\u2011laws or rules of the Exchange. Pursuant to the provisions of its by-laws, the Board of Governors issued a notice on February 22 addressed to R.A. Daly, Jr., as an individual member of the Exchange and to the President of the Daly Company. In this notice the purpose of the meeting to be held on February 28 was stated to be:\n\u2026in connection with transactions in \u2018put and call\u2019 options conducted between January 1st, 1960, and January 31st, 1961, with its customer John T. Lynch by R.A. Daly & Co. Limited (herein referred to as \u2018Daly\u2019), a member corporation of which you are a shareholder and director, and through which you, as a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange, carry on business, and for the acts and omissions of the directors, officers and employees of which you as a member, are responsible: The first of the acts of omission into which the inquiry was to be held was specified in the notice in the following terms:\n(a) whether Daly, while acting as agent for the said Lynch on one side of such transactions, acted on the other side in such transactions, or some of them, for or with a company or partnership known as Lido Investments, in which Wilfred M. Posluns, a director of Daly, on his own admission, had a one-sixth personal interest.\nAs I have said, the appellant, as a director of the Daly Company, had been interviewed by members of the Board of Governors and discussed the subject-matter of the first act of omission and his role concerning it. On being advised of the notice for the February 28 meeting he postponed his holiday plans so as to be present there and on the day before it was to take place, he and his solicitor consulted Mr. Stapells, counsel for Daly and Company, as to whether he should have his own counsel at the hearing. It is true that Mr. Stapells advised him and his solicitor that the hearing was to be with reference to the Daly Company and that he did not think the appellant\u2019s position to be particularly different from that of the other directors, but in light of all the circumstances, it must I think, be accepted that he knew that his conduct was to be the subject of an inquiry which was to be held for the purpose of determining whether or not his firm should be penalized by the Exchange. I do not, however, think that the appellant was alerted to the fact that he might be personally penalized at the same meeting.\nThe appellant was present at the hearing of February 28 at which a statement was read reciting the facts known to the Board concerning the transactions in question and he was given an opportunity to explain his association with Lido. After considering the matter amongst themselves, the members of the Board called in the representatives of the Daly Company and announced that they were unanimously of the opinion that the Company was guilty of six of the seven acts of omission preferred against it, including the first. After representations had been made on the company\u2019s behalf with respect to penalty, the matter was again considered and it was decided to impose the maximum fine of $5,000 on R.A. Daly, Jr.\nThere then occurred what the trial judge referred to as \u201can unfortunate error\u201d because the Board, instead of accepting the fact that it had completed the inquiry with respect to the Daly Company upon which it had properly embarked, went on to deal independently and additionally with the appellant.\nThis new issue was introduced when the chairman said something to the effect \u201cWhat about the directors of Daly individually?\u201d and another governor then referred to Mr. Posluns as being the one who had caused all the trouble. After relatively little discussion, it was unanimously resolved that all prior consents given to the appellant as a director, officer and shareholder of the Daly Company be terminated forthwith and it was the general understanding that his association with the Daly firm was to be severed in all respects.\nAlthough the president of the Daly Company was informed of the resolution withdrawing the appellant\u2019s approvals, no action was at that time taken by the Board to put the terms of the resolution into effect and on the following day representations were made to the Board that there should be a rehearing with respect to Posluns\u2019 personal position. The Board acceded to this request and a rehearing was set for March 2 on which date the same members of the Board were present who had conducted the February 28 meeting and a statement was read reviewing what had transpired at the meeting in so far as it related to the appellant. The appellant was represented at this meeting by counsel who was asked whether he wished to call any additional evidence and replied that there was no dispute about the evidence but only as to the interpretation to be placed upon it. The appellant\u2019s counsel then made full representations to the Board and concluded with a plea in mitigation urging that the publication of the resolution withdrawing the approvals would do irreparable damage to the appellant and his family. There being no dispute as to the facts, the members of the Board adjourned to consider the matter in light of the interpretation placed on them by the appellant\u2019s counsel and in light of the submissions which he had made concerning the penalty to be imposed; in the result they concluded that the appellant\u2019s conduct was such as to warrant the withdrawal of the Board\u2019s approvals of his association with the Daly Company, but they agreed that the resolution directing that withdrawal passed at the meeting of February 28 would not be acted upon or published if the appellant resigned by March 10. The appellant, however, decided not to tender his resignation and a letter was accordingly forwarded from the Board to the Daly Company giving formal notice of the resolution.\nFor the reasons stated by the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal, I am satisfied that under the by-laws of the Exchange the Board of Governors had jurisdiction to take the action which they did against the appellant, but the question raised by this appeal is whether they exercised that jurisdiction legally and in accordance with the rules of natural justice.\nI do not find it necessary to review the considerable number of cases which discuss the meaning and effect to be given to the rules of natural justice because the trial judge has dealt extensively with all the leading authorities in that regard and it would be redundant for me to retrace the ground which has been so thoroughly covered.\nIt does, however, appear to. me to be desirable to mention the case of Russell v. Russell[3], in which Sir George Jessel M.R. made the following comment on the earlier case of Wood v. Wood[4]:\n\u2026it contains a very valuable statement by the Lord Chief Baron as to his view of the mode of administering justice by persons other than judges who have judicial functions to perform,\u2026 The passage I mean is this, referring to a committee:\nThey are bound, in the exercise of their functions, by the rule expressed in the maxim audi alteram partem, that no man should be condemned to consequences resulting from alleged misconduct unheard and without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals, but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals.\nThis language was quoted with approval by the Privy Council in Lapointe v. L\u2019Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la Police de Montr\u00e9al[5].\nAlthough the case of Board of Education v. Rice[6] has been referred to in the Courts below, I think it desirable to reiterate what was there said by Lord Loreburn at p. 182 where, speaking of the duty of the Board of Education in considering a complaint against a local education authority, he said:\nIn the present instance, as in many others, what comes for determination is sometimes a matter to be settled by discretion, involving no law. It will, I suppose, usually be of an administrative kind; but sometimes it will involve matter of law as well as matter of fact, or even depend upon matter of law alone. In such cases the Board of Education will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts. I need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything. But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as though it were a trial.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn light of the findings of the Courts below, I do not think that the good faith of the Board of Governors is open to question, but under the authorities they were also required, before taking any final action against the appellant, to inform him of what was alleged against him and to give him an opportunity to present his version and explanation of any such allegations.\nThe position as I interpret it, is that the appellant was fully informed at and before the meeting of February 28 that the Board of Governors disapproved of his conduct in relation to the Lynch-Lido-Daly transactions and he was given an opportunity to present and did present his explanation of that conduct at that meeting but, although he must have realized at that time that he was personally open to censure by the Board, he was not alerted to the fact that his own case was to be dealt with at the February meeting. It is now contended on behalf of the appellant that the February hearing was a nullity so far as he was concerned and that the second hearing of March 2 was in the nature of an appeal and did not afford him the new hearing to which he was entitled. The key submission made in the factum filed on behalf of the appellant is phrased as follows:\n2. It is submitted that the Appellant could not have had a fair hearing on March 2nd by reason of the state of mind of the Governors on that occasion in:\n(a) Failing to understand and accept the fact that the proceedings on February 28th had no legality and that they must consider the matter afresh;\n(b) By their failure to exercise their proper function as members of a tribunal determining the propriety of the Appellant\u2019s conduct for the first time rather than as members of an appellate board prepared to be convinced that their earlier decision was wrong.\nCounsel on behalf of the appellant relied in great measure on the decision of Lord Reid in the case of Ridge v. Baldwin[7], and particularly on the passage at p. 79 in which he commented on the two meetings held in that case by the \u201cwatch committee\u201d to consider the question of the dismissal of the Chief Constable of the Borough of Brighton. The passage in question reads as follows:\nNext comes the question whether the respondents\u2019 failure to follow the rules of natural justice on March 7 was made good by the meeting on March 18. I do not doubt that if an officer or body realizes that it has acted hastily and reconsiders the whole matter afresh, after affording to the person affected a proper opportunity to present his case, then its later decision will be valid. An example is De Verteuil v. Knaggs, [1918] A.C. 557. But here the appellant\u2019s solicitor was not fully informed of the charges against the appellant and the watch committee did not annul the decision which they had already published and proceed to make a new decision. In my judgment, what was done on that day was a very inadequate substitute for a full rehearing. Even so, three members of the committee changed their minds, and it is impossible to say what the decision of the committee would have been if there had been a full hearing after disclosure to the appellant of the whole case against him. I agree with those of your Lordships who hold that this meeting of March 18 cannot affect the result of this appeal.\nCounsel for the appellant sought to apply this language directly to the circumstances of the present case and it therefore becomes necessary to examine the facts in Ridge v. Baldwin so as to fully understand Lord Reid\u2019s reference to the two meetings. In that case the Chief Constable of Brighton was dismissed from office by a resolution of the watch committee passed at a meeting of which he had no notice and at which he was given no opportunity to be heard in his own defence. Following his dismissal, the chief constable\u2019s solicitor asked to be allowed to appear before the watch committee saying that he wished to be informed about the case against his client so that he could deal with it and furthermore, he submitted that the best way of dealing with the situation would be to allow his client to resign and take his pension.\nThe distinction between the two cases is, in my view, clearly apparent from a description of the initial meeting at which the chief constable was dismissed as contained in the judgment of Lord Morris at p. 113:\nThe watch committee were under a statutory obligation (see Police Act, 1919, s. 4(1)) to comply with the regulations made under the Act. They dismissed the appellant after finding that he had been negligent in the discharge of his duty. That was a finding of guilt of the offence of neglecting or omitting diligently to attend to or to carry out his duty. Yet they had preferred no charge against the appellant and gave him no notice. They gave him no opportunity to defend himself or to be heard. Though their good faith is in no way impugned, they completely disregarded the regulations and did not begin to comply with them. The meeting of March 18 to which reference is made in Lord Reid\u2019s judgment is briefly described by Lord Hodson at p. 129 of the same report where he made the following comment on the reception given to the appellant\u2019s solicitor, at that meeting:\nOn March 18 Mr. Bosley was given not only a full but a courteous hearing by the watch committee but received no indication of the nature of the charges which his client had to answer, notwithstanding his repeated statements that he did not know what they were. It is plain, therefore, that if there were a failure on March 7 to give justice to the appellant this was not cured on March 18 when the watch committee confirmed their previous decision. At this hearing it was made plain by Mr. Bosley that his client was not seeking reinstatement but only his pension rights of which he had been deprived by his dismissal. This position is maintained by the appellant through his counsel before your Lordships.\nI am in sympathy with the observations made by Lord Hodson later in his reasons for judgment at p. 133 where he said:\nIt may be that I must retreat to that last refuge of one confronted with as difficult a problem as this, namely, that each case depends on its own facts, and that here the deprivation of a pension without a hearing is on the face of it a denial of justice which cannot be justified on the language of the section under consideration.\nFrom the above recital of the facts it will be apparent that the circumstances in Ridge v. Baldwin were quite different from those in the present case. In Ridge v. Baldwin the appellant was never told of the case which he had to meet, whereas Mr. Posluns knew what was complained of in his conduct some days before the first hearing. In Ridge v. Baldwin the appellant was given no opportunity to be heard at either meeting, whereas Posluns gave evidence and had a full opportunity to explain himself at the first hearing and declined, through his counsel, to add anything at the second hearing to the evidence which had already been taken. In Ridge v. Baldwin the plea made by the chief constable\u2019s solicitor at the second hearing that his client should be permitted to resign was of no avail, whereas after listening to the submissions of Posluns\u2019 solicitor at the March 2 hearing, the Board of Governors gave him ten days in which to resign and withheld official publication of the resolution passed against him until that period had expired and Posluns had declined to resign.\nIn my opinion, the contention that the proceedings at the meeting of March 2 were in the nature of an appeal from the decision of February 28 rather than, a rehearing, leaves out of account the fact that the Board gave the appellant\u2019s solicitor full opportunity to call any evidence he pleased at the second hearing and that it was he and not the Board who made the election to abide by the evidence taken in February. He then reviewed all the circumstances afresh and advanced at every turn the construction of the facts which was most favourable to his client. In the result, although the Board of Governors did not change their ruling, they offered to withdraw it altogether if the appellant would resign. In my view also it is inconsistent to speak of the March 2 hearing as an appeal when the disputed resolution was not formally published until March 10.\nThe learned trial judge expressed the view that it was \u201can unfortunate error\u201d for the Board of Governors to have proceeded against the appellant personally at the first hearing. I do not find it necessary to express an opinion as to this because, in any event, the circumstances are governed by the general proposition stated in the paragraph above quoted from Lord Reid\u2019s reasons for judgment in Ridge v. Baldwin where he said:\nI do not doubt that if an officer or body realizes that it has acted hastily and reconsiders the whole matter afresh, after affording to the person affected a proper opportunity to present his case, then its later decision will be valid. An example is De Verteuil v. Knaggs, [1918] A.C. 557.\nThe case of Weinberger v. Inglis[8] was one in which the committee of the London Stock Exchange had refused reelection to a German member and their decision was challenged as having been reached without regard to the rules of natural justice. It appears to me that the language used by Lord Birkenhead in that case is directly applicable to the present appeal. He there said, at p. 617:\nThe Committee formed their opinion. It is conceded that they formed it honestly. They formed it in my opinion upon grounds which were made known to the appellant and which he had a chance of answering. The short answer, therefore, to the appellant\u2019s case is that the Committee did not deem him eligible to be a member of the Stock Exchange, and that neither their good faith nor their mode of procedure has been successfully impugned.\nI think that the Board of Governors in the present case is in the same position and I find, to use Lord Birkenhead\u2019s language, \u201cthat neither their good faith nor their mode of procedure has been successfully impugned\u201d.\nFor all these reasons, as well as for those contained in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Goodman & Goodman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 1 O.R. 285, 53 D.L.R.

He had been arrested on July 15, 1956. The three prior convictions upon which that sentence was founded were: (a) on November 8, 1946, for breaking and entering; (b) on February 13, 1952, for breaking and entering and (c) on October 16, 1956, for breaking and entering committed on July 1, 1956. The Court of Appeal affirmed the sentence of preventive detention and an application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed in October 1957. On an appeal from the refusal of a writ of habeas corpus, the appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court in June 1967. Three questions of law were raised by the appellant: (1) whether a conviction) recorded prior to the enactment in 1947 of the habitual criminal provisions should be considered in the application of s. 660(2)(a) of the Code; (2) whether a conviction entered after the commission of the primary offence should be considered as one of the three convictions contemplated in s. 660(2)(a) of the Code; and (3) whether the sentence imposed on the previous convictions must have been served when the habitual criminal proceedings are brought. Held (Cartwright C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Court was entitled to consider the conviction recorded in 1946. The word \u201cpreviously\u201d in s. 660(2)(a) of the Code takes in convictions before the enactment of legislation in relation to habitual criminals and that includes the conviction of 1946. The convictions which the Court may consider are convictions which have occurred since the accused reached the age of 18 years without regard to the date when the habitual criminal legislation was first passed.\nThe Court was entitled to consider the conviction dated October 16, 1956, as one of the three convictions. There is no basis for the contention that the three convictions must occur previous to the commission of the primary offence. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused has been convicted on three occasions previous to the conviction on the primary offence. The word \u201cpreviously\u201d must apply to any conviction which in point of time has occurred before the date of the hearing of the application and before the date of the conviction on the primary offence. The word does not mean \u201cpreviously to committing the substantive offence\u201d but \u201cpreviously to being convicted of the substantive offence\u201d. All that the Crown has to prove is that at the time of the conviction on the primary offence, there are three previous convictions and that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence, he was leading a \u201cpersistently criminal life\u201d.\nThere is no requirement that the sentence imposed must have been served in whole or in part. The statute in clear language requires only proof of a conviction of a certain kind. This language cannot be converted into a requirement that a sentence passed pursuant to such conviction must have been served. The serving of the sentence is not one of the conditions that must be met in order to establish that a person is an habitual criminal.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The Court was not entitled to consider the conviction, dated October 16, 1956, which was entered after the commission of the primary offence. The word \u201cpreviously\u201d in s. 660(2)(a) means previously to committing the substantive offence and not previously to being convicted of the substantive offence. The time at which the Crown must show that an accused is leading persistently a criminal life is the time of the commission of the substantive offence. The critical time contemplated by s. 660(2)(a) for the proof of the two matters required to be proved by the Crown must be the same for both. There is no evidence to suggest that after the date of the conviction for the third offence, he persistently led a criminal life as he had been in custody ever since. At the time the appellant committed the substantive offence he had been convicted of only two of the three offences set out in the notice given to him and consequently, the first of the conditions prescribed by s. 660(2)(a) had not been fulfilled.\nPer Pigeon J., dissenting: In order to limit the effect of the word \u201cpreviously\u201d in s. 660, which by itself takes in all time past without any distinction, it would be necessary to introduce into the section something which is not there. On the proper construction of the statute after consideration of the relevant authorities there was no reason in law for excluding from consideration the conviction recorded in 1946.\nThe trial judge was not entitled to consider the conviction entered after the commission of the primary offence. Grammatically the text of s. 660 does not support the contention that the word \u201cpreviously\u201d refers to the date of the commission of the primary offence. The word \u201coccasions\u201d means when an offender is apprehended, charged, convicted and sentenced. The word \u201cpersistently\u201d implies \u201cpersistently after being convicted on the required three separate and independent occasions\u201d. Therefore, when the appellant was convicted of the primary offence, he could not be said to have been previously convicted \u201con at least three separate and independent occasions\u201d when the last conviction was for an offence for which he was arrested and charged on the same occasion as the primary offence, and also because he could not be found to have been so convicted and to be leading persistently a criminal life when he had been convicted on the last occasion after being arrested for the primary offence.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014D\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014Doit-on consid\u00e9rer une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e avant la promulgation des dispositions visant les repris de justice\u2014Doit-on consid\u00e9rer une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la date de l\u2019infraction sur laquelle la sentence est bas\u00e9e\u2014Est-ce que la sentence impos\u00e9e doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 660(2)(a).\nLe 12 d\u00e9cembre 1956, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019une infraction, commise le 15 juillet 1956: entr\u00e9e par effraction et vol.

Les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 que la Cour peut consid\u00e9rer sont celles qui sont survenues depuis que l\u2019accus\u00e9 a atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 18 ans sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la date de la promulgation de la premi\u00e8re l\u00e9gislation relative aux repris de justice.\nLa Cour \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de consid\u00e9rer la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 du 16 octobre 1956, comme l\u2019une des trois d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019art. 660(2)(a). La pr\u00e9tention que les trois d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 doivent survenir avant que l\u2019accus\u00e9 commette l\u2019infraction sur laquelle la sentence est bas\u00e9e n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e. Il suffit que la Couronne prouve que l\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable en trois occasions avant d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de cette infraction.

Tout ce que la Couronne doit prouver est que lors de cette d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, il existait trois d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures de culpabilit\u00e9 et que lorsque l\u2019accus\u00e9 a commis l\u2019infraction, il menait avec persistance une vie criminelle.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la sentence impos\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e en tout ou en partie. Dans un langage clair, le statut n\u2019exige que la preuve d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un certain genre. On ne peut pas transformer ce langage pour lui faire dire qu\u2019une sentence prononc\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une telle d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e.

Le moment auquel la Couronne doit d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019accus\u00e9 m\u00e8ne avec persistance une vie criminelle est lorsque l\u2019accus\u00e9 commet cette infraction.

Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nT.R. Berger, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to an order made by this Court on June 19, 1967, extending the time for appealing and granting leave to appeal, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on September 20, 1957, dismissing an appeal from the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention upon the appellant by His Honour Judge Archibald on December 12, 1956.\nThe appeal comes before us under unusual circumstances.\nOn October 28, 1957, the appellant applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal mentioned above and his application was dismissed. The grounds of appeal on which counsel for the appellant chiefly relies in the appeal now before us were not raised before His Honour Judge Archibald or the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on the appeal to it in 1957 or on the application to this Court for leave to appeal in the same year.\nOn July 23, 1963, an application by the appellant for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus was refused by Judson J. and an appeal to the Court from such refusal was dismissed on November 12, 1963. On April 4, 1967, a further application by the appellant for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus was refused by Judson J. These refusals were clearly right as it is plain that the appellant is detained under a warrant of committal valid on its face, issued by a Court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe appellant appealed to this Court from the last mentioned refusal and was notified that his appeal would be heard on Monday, June 19, 1967. Prior to the hearing of the appeal a telegram was received by the Registrar of the Court from Mr. Thomas Berger stating that he had been asked to make representations to the Court on behalf of the appellant and requesting that no determination be made of the appeal until these reached the Court. Prior to the date of hearing a letter was received from Mr. Berger setting out grounds, to be referred to hereinafter, on which he submitted that the sentence of preventive detention had been unlawfully imposed.\nOn the appeal coming on to be heard, the Court informed counsel for the Attorney General that the decision of Judson J. refusing the issue of a writ of habeas corpus was clearly right and that the appeal therefrom must be dismissed but that Mr. Berger\u2019s letter appeared to raise a question of difficulty and importance which had not been placed before the Court of Appeal or this Court on any previous application by the appellant. After some discussion, and counsel for the Attorney General not objecting, the Court made the order granting leave to appeal and giving the necessary extensions of time as set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons.\nOn December 12, 1956, following trial without a jury which commenced on the previous day, the appellant was convicted on the charge that he\n\u2026on or about Sunday July 15th, A.D. 1956, at the City of Kelowna, County of Yale, Province of British Columbia, did unlawfully break and enter a place, to wit, the building of Gordon\u2019s Master Market Ltd. situated at 555 Bernard Avenue, Kelowna, British Columbia, and therein steal the sum of approximately $14,452.28 in cash and cheques, the property of Gordon\u2019s Master Market Ltd., contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.\nOn November 28, 1956, the appellant had been served with a notice dated November 28, 1956, in accordance with the provisions of s. 662 of the Criminal Code stating that if he should be convicted of the substantive charge an application would be made to the Court to impose a sentence of preventive detention upon the ground, inter alia, that\nsince attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions previous to the conviction of the crime charged and hereinbefore recited, you have been convicted of an indictable offence for which you were liable to imprisonment for five years or more, namely:\u2014\nThe three prior convictions are set out in complete detail; the particulars given may be summarized as follows:\n(a) Charge, breaking and entering at Victoria, on May 30, 1946; conviction, November 8, 1946; sentenced, November 25, 1946, to five years in B.C. Penitentiary.\n(b) Charge, breaking and entering at Haney, B.C., on February 26, 1951; conviction, February 13, 1952; sentenced to five years in B.C. Penitentiary.\n(c) Charge, breaking and entering at Vancouver on July 1, 1956; conviction, October 16, 1956; sentenced October 23, 1956, to five years in B.C. Penitentiary.\nThe hearing of the application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention proceeded immediately following the conviction of the substantive offence. It was proved that the appellant had been convicted on the three occasions as stated in the notice. It appears from the evidence of Acting-Sergeant Nuttall given at the hearing of the application that the appellant was arrested at Vancouver on July 15, 1956.\nThe grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant are set out in the appellant\u2019s factum as follows:\n1. The first conviction made against the appellant, in 1946, could not be used against him as one of three essential previous convictions, because there were no provisions in the Criminal Code for preventive detention of habitual criminals then, and the legislation should not be given retroactive application.\n2. At the time of the commission of the primary offence, the appellant had not previously been convicted on three separate and independent occasions of an indictable offence for which he was liable for imprisonment for five years or more., 3. There was no adequate legal foundation for a sentence of preventive detention, in view of the fact that although three previous convictions had been proved against the appellant, he had not served the sentence imposed on him on the third previous conviction when the proceedings were brought against him alleging that he was an habitual criminal and when the sentence of preventive detention was imposed on him.\nI find it necessary to deal only with the second of these grounds. Both counsel advised us that they had been unable to find any reported decision in which the question raised in this ground had been considered.\nOn December 12, 1956, s. 660 of the Criminal Code read as follows:\n660. (1) Where an accused is convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the offence of which he is convicted if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention.\nThe solution of the question before us depends primarily upon the true construction of s. 660, subs. (2)(a) and particularly upon the meaning of the word \u201cpreviously\u201d in the first line of clause (a). Does it mean previously to committing the substantive offence or previously to being convicted of the substantive offence? In my opinion it means the former. It has been held in a unanimous judgment of this Court that the time at which the Crown must show that an accused is leading persistently a criminal life is the time of the commission of the substantive offence: see Kirkland v. The Queen[1].\nIt appears to me that the critical time contemplated by clause (a) for the proof of the two matters required to be proved by the Crown must be the same for both. I arrive at this conclusion from a consideration of the words of the section. If the construction were doubtful it seems to me that the view which I think should be taken is greatly strengthened by a consideration of the history of the section and the judicial pronouncements on it and on the statutory provisions in England upon which it is, with some variations, modelled.\nIn R. v. Churchill[2], Lord Goddard L.C.J. said at p. 110:\nThe object of preventive detention is to protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history that they are a menace to society while they are at large. There comes a time when it is not a question of punishment, for that has been shown to be of no use, but of a necessity to put these offenders in confinement so that they can no longer prey upon the public.\nand at p. 112:\nIt is not a question of severity. As we have already said, when such sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has had no effect.\nThese passages indicate the view, which I think to be the right one, that Parliament intended the extraordinary sentence of preventive detention to be imposed only after it appeared that convictions on three separate and independent occasions had failed to deter the accused from committing the substantive offence.\nTo the same effect are the following words in the judgment of Lord Goddard in R. v. Rogers[3]:\nThe Criminal Justice Act was intended to deal with people who showed by their conduct that previous sentences had had no effect upon them and that, therefore, they were fit subjects for long detention for the protection of the public.\nat p. 207:\nThe principle is that if the prisoner shows that the sentences he has received at a particular court and also at two subsequent courts do not deter him from committing crime, then he is to be liable to preventive detention.\nand also at p. 207:\nI think on the whole that is giving effect to the intention of the Act, because it will then have shown that the three previous appearances in court and the sentences imposed on him on three separate occasions have not done the prisoner any good, and therefore the time has come to try a long sentence. Reference may also be made to the words of Sheppard J.A. in R. v. Charming[4]:\nThe Code does not expressly require that the accused lead persistently a criminal life of offences for which he is liable to imprisonment for 5 years or more. It is sufficient if he has been convicted on three occasions for three such offences and thereafter persistently led a criminal life, which may be of lesser crimes.\nThe most significant word in this passage is \u201cthereafter\u201d which I have italicized. In the case at bar at the time of his conviction for the third offence, the appellant had been in custody for some three months and has continued in custody ever since. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that after the date of that conviction he persistently led a criminal life.\nIt may be of use to consider the possible results of construing the section in accordance with the submission of counsel for the respondent by suggesting the following example. A person on separate days during the same month breaks into four different houses and steals some of the contents. He is apprehended on the fourth occasion. If separately indicted and convicted for each of the first three offences, he could following conviction on the fourth be sentenced to preventive detention. That such a situation is unlikely to arise may be conceded; but it appears to me to be even more unlikely that Parliament should have intended to render possible such a result. To so construe the section because the literal meaning of the words used would seem capable of bearing such a meaning would, in my opinion, be to disregard the well settled rule of construction which is succinctly stated in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 36, p. 416:\nFor a penalty to be enforced it must be quite clear that the case is within both the letter and the spirit of the statute.\nThis statement is supported by the authorities cited by the learned authors and there is nothing in the Interpretation Act, as in force at the time this case was dealt with in the Courts below (R.S.C. 1952, c. 158), which abrogates the rule. Section 15 of that Act does require every Act to be deemed remedial but concludes with the words:\n\u2026and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit. It is the commission of the substantive offence that creates the possibility of an inquiry as to whether the accused is an habitual criminal. It is, of course, necessary that he be convicted of that offence before it can be said judicially that he has committed it; but it is the commission and not the conviction which indicates what manner of man he is. The number of previous convictions chosen by Parliament as a condition precedent to the holding of an inquiry as to whether a person is an habitual criminal is three. Those convictions bring home to the convicted person on three separate occasions the knowledge of guilt and the punishment which it entails. It is the fact that he thereafter, with such knowledge, commits yet another indictable offence that Parliament has declared shall be a condition precedent to the inquiry as to whether he should be sentenced to preventive detention.\nAt the time the appellant in the case at bar committed the substantive offence he had been convicted of only two of the three offences set out in the notice given to him and, in my opinion, the first of the conditions prescribed by clause (a) of s. 660(2) had not been fulfilled; it follows that it was not open to the learned judge to impose a sentence of preventive detention.\nIt is obvious that for the reasons given above I would allow the appeal, but there remains for consideration a point raised by some members of the Court. It has been suggested that because this Court had, on October 28, 1957, refused the appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal it had no jurisdiction to make the order granting leave which it did make on June 19, 1967, and which was duly signed and entered.\nAs this point was not put to counsel during the argument, counsel were invited to submit written argument dealing with it and they have done so.\nIt now appears that the majority of the Court have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails on the merits. It therefore becomes unnecessary to deal with the question of jurisdiction. I am dealing with the appeal on the assumption that we have jurisdiction but, following the example of my brother Judson, I express no opinion on that question. I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the appellant.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014On December 12, 1956, the appellant, George Milton Paton, was sentenced to preventive detention. His appeal from this sentence to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed on September 20, 1957, and an application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed on October 28, 1957. Notwithstanding this last dismissal, in June of this year, at the same time that an application by way of appeal from the refusal of a writ of habeas corpus was dismissed, the Court granted leave to appeal from the above mentioned judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, dated September 20, 1957. The question of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear this appeal has been raised but also the appeal has been heard on the merits. I express no opinion on the question of jurisdiction because the appeal must fail on the merits.\nThe convictions upon which the sentence for preventive detention was founded are as follows:\nDate of Offence\nDate of Conviction\nOffence\nSentence\n1. Not stated\nNovember 8, 1946\nBreaking and entering\n5 years\n2. Not stated\nFebruary 13, 1952\nBreaking and entering\n5 years\n3. July 1, 1956\nOctober 16, 1956\nBreaking and entering\n5 years\n4. July 15, 1956\nDecember 12, 1956\nBreaking and entering\n8 years\n5. December 12, 1956\u2014sentence of preventive detention.\nI will deal now with the three points of law which were submitted to the Court on the argument of the appeal.\nI. Whether, under the provisions of Section 660(2)(a), the Court was entitled to consider a conviction in 1946 before the enactment of the Habitual Criminal provisions of the Criminal Code.\nThe submission is that if the Court does consider the conviction of 1946, it is giving a retroactive operation to the habitual criminal provisions of the Code. I do not think that this is correct. The purpose of the habitual criminal legislation is not to create a new offence nor to increase the penalties for offences with respect to which sentences have already been imposed. The purpose is crime prevention. The habitual criminal is not imprisoned for doing something, but rather for being something. The finding is simply a declaration of his status as an habitual criminal which is a matter determined in part by reference to his past record. This was decided in Brusch v. The King[5].\nLegislation in relation to habitual criminals was first enacted in Canada in 1947. (Statutes of Canada, 1947, 11 Geo. VI, vol. 1, c. 55, Part X(A)). Section 575c. (1) enacted under that part read:\n575c. (1) A person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on evidence,\n(a) that since attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years\u2019 imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life.\nOn December 12, 1956, the date of Paton\u2019s sentence to preventive detention, s. 660 had taken the place of s. 575c. (1). Section 660 came in with the new Criminal Code enacted by 2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51, and came into force on April 1, 1955. It read:\n660. (1) Where an accused is convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the offence of which he is convicted if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention. In the original enactment of 1947, the words \u201cwhether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part\u201d make it clear that the Court was entitled to take into account the conviction in 1946, No. 1 on the above list.\nOn December 12, 1956, when the accused was found to be an habitual criminal, these words had been omitted and the arrangement of the words slightly altered. But there was no change in the meaning. \u201cPreviously\u201d takes in convictions before the enactment of legislation in relation to habitual criminals. It includes the conviction of 1946. The convictions which the Court may consider are convictions which have occurred since the accused reached the age of eighteen years without regard to the date when the habitual criminal legislation was first passed.\nThe alternatives are the elimination of two classes of convictions\n(a) those before April 1, 1955, when s. 660 came into force,\nOr\n(b) those before 1947, when s. 575c. (1) came into force.\nIn my opinion the use of the word \u201cpreviously\u201d shuts out these alternatives.\nII. Whether the learned trial judge, in finding the appellant to be an habitual criminal, was entitled to consider the conviction dated October 16th, 1956, as one of the three convictions described in section 660(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.\nOn reference back to the above table, it will be seen that the conviction of October 16, 1956, based on the offence of July 1, 1956, was subsequent to the commission of the primary or substantive offence on July 15, 1956. The appellant\u2019s submission on this appeal is that the three convictions, in order to comply with s. 660, must occur previous to the commission of the primary or substantive offence. The Crown, on the other hand, submits that there is no basis for such a contention and that it is sufficient for the Crown to prove at the hearing of an application under s. 660 that the accused has been convicted on three occasions previous to the conviction on the primary or substantive offence. In this case, on December 12, 1956, when this accused was convicted of the primary or substantive offence which he had committed on July 15, 1956, there were three convictions against him: November 8, 1946, February 13, 1952, and October 16, 1956. When the application to have him sentenced to preventive detention was made on the same date, December 12, 1956, the Court was required to decide at that point of time whether previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on three separate and independent occasions, the appellant had been convicted. The word \u201cpreviously\u201d in such circumstances must apply to any conviction which in point of time has occurred before the date of the hearing of the application and before the date of the conviction on the primary or substantive offence.\nTo go back to s. 575c., the original enactment of 1947, the words read: \u201cpreviously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment\u201d. In the present section, 660(2)(a), the words italicized in s. 575c. (1) have been omitted. The word \u201cpreviously\u201d is sufficient. The italicized words were redundant. The two sections mean exactly the same. It was a case of omitting in the revision redundant words. See: C.P.R. v. The King[6].\nI cannot accept the conclusion of the Chief Justice that \u201cpreviously\u201d means \u201cpreviously to committing the substantive offence\u201d and not \u201cpreviously to being convicted of the substantive offence\u201d. This is not what the section says. I do not think that it follows from Kirkland v. The Queen[7] that at the time of commission of the primary or substantive offence it must be shown that the accused had three previous convictions. One thing that Kirkland v. The Queen does decide is that it must be shown on the application to have the accused declared an habitual criminal that he is leading \u201cpersistently\u201d a criminal life, and that on this branch of the case the date to be taken is the date of the commission of the primary or substantive offence.\nI do not think that the history of the legislation in England or the dicta of Lord Goddard in Rex v. Churchill[8] and in Rex v. Rogers[9] have any bearing upon the interpretation of this section. In other words, all that the Crown has to prove is that at the time of the fourth conviction, i.e., on the primary or substantive offence, there are three previous convictions and that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence, he was leading a \u201cpersistently criminal life\u201d. To prove the second point does not involve the necessity of holding that when he committed the third of these offences, it cannot be said that he was leading a persistently criminal life because he had not then been convicted.\nNor can I accept the illustration given in the reasons of the Chief Justice [ante p. 350] in the circumstances there outlined\u2014four different offences on four consecutive days; four separate indictments and four convictions. An accused could not necessarily be found to be an habitual criminal after conviction on the fourth indictment. It would still have to be proved that he was leading a persistently criminal life and that terminology does not apply to the facts of the illustration. Without more, the illustration is one of a spasmodic outburst and not of a persistently criminal life.\nFurther, the Interpretation Act, which is appealed to in support of this view, cannot possibly apply when the meaning of the section to be interpreted is plain on its face. Our task is to give effect to the plain meaning of the section.\nIII. There was no adequate legal foundation for a sentence of preventive detention, in view of the fact that although three previous convictions had been proved against the appellant, he had not served the sentence imposed on him on the third previous conviction when the proceedings were brought against him alleging that he was an habitual criminal and when the sentence of preventive detention was imposed on him.\nThere is no merit in this submission. To repeat what I have already said, what must be proved is that at the time of the application there are three convictions against the accused \u201cof an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment of five years or more\u201d. The statute in clear language requires only proof of a conviction of a kind carrying a liability for a five-year sentence. This language cannot be converted into a requirement that a sentence passed pursuant to such conviction must have been served. The language is \u201cconvicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more\u201d and not \u201cconvicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and which he has served\u201d. The serving of the sentence is not one of the conditions that must be met in order to establish that a person is an habitual criminal. The King v. Robinson[10] is against any such submission. See: Per Fauteux J. at p. 526:\nThe offences are not identified by names or by references to sections describing them, but by the measure of punishment \u2026 which the offender is exposed to suffer.\nand per Cartwright J. at p. 534:\nThe controversy is as to the proper construction of the words \u201cbeen convicted of an offence for which he was liable to at least five years\u2019 imprisonment\u201d.\n* * *\nThe solution of the question depends upon the meaning to be given to the words \u201cliable to\u201d. Their ordinary and natural meaning is, I think, \u201cexposed to\u201d. The intention of Parliament as disclosed in the words of the section seems to me to be to describe a class of indictable offences, and to require as one of the conditions of a person being found to be a habitual criminal that he shall at least three times have been convicted of an offence comprised in such class. The offences of which the class is composed are described by reference to the penalty which the law permits to be inflicted on a person convicted thereof, that is to say, the penalty to which he is exposed, which he runs the risk of suffering, which he is subject to the possibility of undergoing, not the penalty which he must suffer.\nIt is the measure of punishment that is referred to in the section. Conviction satisfies the condition imposed without any requirement that the sentence imposed be served in whole or in part.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nPIGEON J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts of this case are stated by the Chief Justice. Because, in the opinion of the majority, the appeal fails on the merit I will, as he does, deal with it without expressing any opinion on the question of jurisdiction.\nThe first question of law raised by the appellant is whether a conviction recorded prior to the enactment of habitual criminal provisions, is to be considered in the application of this legislation. Appellant\u2019s first conviction was entered in 1946 while the original enactment dates from 1947. In that first text (Criminal Code s. 575c) the words \u201cwhether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part\u201d were inserted to dispel any doubt, but they do not appear in the corresponding provision of the revised Criminal Code enacted in 1954 (2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51, in force April 1, 1955). The question is therefore whether those words were surplusage or, on the contrary, necessary to prevent the application of the presumption against retrospective operation.\nIt must be stressed that, in Canada, this presumption is not a rule of law but a rule of construction only. There is therefore no requirement that the intention to displace it be explicit. It is sufficient that the wording of the enactment be such as not to leave it open fairly to any other construction. In s. 660 of the present Criminal Code, the word \u201cpreviously\u201d by itself takes in all time past without any distinction. In order to limit its effect, it would be necessary to introduce into the enactment something which is not there.\nWhen the cases in which the rule against retrospective operation are reviewed, it becomes apparent that, usually, the real basis for its application is the explicit or implicit provision fixing the date of the commencement of the Act. This date is an essential part of every statute. It is by reference to it that the courts must decide what are the situations governed by the new enactment and what are those that are not. For instance, when an enactment deals with a right of appeal, the situations affected are future cases only, pending cases are not taken in: Taylor v. The Queen[11]; William v. Irvine[12]; Hyde v. Lindsay[13]; Flemming v. Atkinson[14]; Ville de Jacques-Cartier v. Lamarre[15]. The offence of which the appellant was convicted and following the conviction for which he was sentenced to preventive detention, was committed after the coming into force of the present Criminal Code and, therefore, that offence, as well as the proceedings leading up to the conviction and to the sentence of preventive detention, was governed by its provisions.\nAppellant says that when a person is accused of an offence created by an Act of Parliament, all the ingredients of such offence must have taken place after the date on which the Act came into operation and, in support of this proposition, a dictum of Lord Coleridge in Regina v. Griffiths[16] is cited. The legislation in that case had made certain acts misdemeanours if committed by a debtor \u201cwithin four months next before the presentation of a bankruptcy petition by or against him\u201d while previously such result obtained only in the case of a bankruptcy petition against him. It was held that if the acts had been committed before the new law it did not apply although the bankruptcy was subsequent. This principle cannot have any application in the present case because the situation is entirely different. The Criminal Code does not by s. 660 create an offence of which past crimes are an ingredient. It provides, as it read originally at the material time, for \u201ca sentence of preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the offence \u2026\u201d In this respect, s. 660 does not materially differ from s. 575B of the old code under which a majority of this Court held that being an habitual criminal is not an offence but a state of circumstances which enables the court to pass a further sentence: Brusch v. The Queen[17].\nIt is contended that this has the effect of increasing the penalty for offences already committed but it is clear that such is not the result of the statute nor what was said in this Court in the case just referred to. On the contrary it is obvious that the sentence of preventive detention is imposed in respect of the offence concerning which the application is made. Previous offences as well as the conduct of the accused are nothing else than what Lord Reading termed \u201ccircumstances\u201d in dealing with a determination under the Prevention of Crime Act 1908: Rex v. Hunter[18]. The principle applicable to such legislation is that which is set forth as follows by Maxwell, On Interpretation of Statutes, 11th ed., p. 211:\nNor is a statute retrospective, in the sense under consideration, because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing.\nIn The Queen v. St. Mary Whitechapel[19], the statute under consideration provided that \u201cno woman residing in any parish with her husband at the time of his death shall be removed\u2026\u201d. It was held applicable to a woman whose husband had died before the passing of the Act. Lord Denman said, at page 127:\nthe statute is in its direct operation prospective, as it relates to future removals only, and \u2026 it is not properly called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from time antecedent to its passing.\nIn Ex parte Dawson[20], the statute read:\nAny settlement of property made by a settlor shall, if the settlor becomes bankrupt at any subsequent time within ten years after the date of such settlement, \u2026 be void \u2026\nIt was held applicable to a settlement made before the commencement of the Act.\nIn Re. A Solicitor\u2019s Clerk[21], the Act provided that an order might be made by the Disciplinary Committee directing that no solicitor shall take or retain in his employment a person who \u201chas been convicted of larceny, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion or any other criminal offence in respect of any money or property belonging to or held or controlled by the solicitor by whom he is or was employed or any client\u2026\u201d. This was amended to provide that the order might be made when the clerk had been convicted of any larceny, embezzlement or fraudulent conversion. It was. held that the order could then validly be made in respect of a clerk convicted of larceny of property which belonged neither to his employer nor to a client of his, although such conviction was many years prior to the amendment. Lord Goddard said:\nIn my opinion this Act is not in truth retrospective. It enables an order to be made disqualifying a person from acting as a solicitor\u2019s clerk in the future and what happened in the past is the cause or reason for the making of the order, but the order has no retrospective effect. It would be retrospective if the Act provided that anything done before the Act came into force or before the order was made should be void or voidable, or if a penalty were inflicted for having acted in this or any other capacity before the Act came into force or before the order-was made. This Act simply enables a disqualification to be imposed for the future which in no way affects anything done by the appellant in the past.\nCounsel for the appellant has referred us to some pas-sages of the judgments in Rex v. Chandra Dharma[22], Rex v. Oliver[23] and Buckman v. Button[24]. In none of those cases does the decision lend any support to appellant\u2019s contention. In the first mentioned it was held that a statute extending. the time for commencing a prosecution applied to an offence previously committed. In the other two it was held that a regulation increasing the penalties for some offences applied to offences previously committed.\nOn the proper construction of the statute after consideration of all relevant authorities it must be said that there was no reason in law for excluding from consideration in passing upon the application for preventive detention, the conviction recorded in 1946 prior to the enactment of habitual criminal legislation in Canada.\nThe second question of law arising in this case is whether the trial judge was, in finding the appellant to be an habitual criminal, entitled to consider a conviction entered against the appellant after the commission of the primary offence as one of the three previous convictions contemplated in s. 660 of the Criminal Code.\nBefore a court may find an accused to be an habitual criminal it must be shown (unless he has previously been sentenced to preventive detention) that \u201che has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life\u201d. In s. 575c of the old Code, the wording was \u201cpreviously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment\u201d. As on the first question it is now necessary to ascertain the result of the change in wording.\nOn behalf of the appellant, it is contended that \u201cpreviously\u201d refers to the date of the commission of the primary or substantive offence, that is the offence in respect of which the application for a sentence of preventive detention is made. Grammatically, the text does not support that contention. The section does not open by the words \u201cWhere a person has committed an indictable offence and a conviction is entered against him \u2026\u201d but \u201cWhere an accused has been convicted\u2026\u201d Therefore, when in para. 2 it is enacted that \u201cfor the purposes of sub-section (1) an accused is an habitual criminal if he has previously \u2026\u201d the word \u201cpreviously\u201d has reference to the time when the accused has been convicted of the offence, or possibly to the time when the application is made. There is nothing that renders grammatically possible a construction referring back to the date of the commission of the primary offence.\nAs we have already seen, being an habitual criminal is not an offence but a state of circumstances and the finding that an accused is an habitual criminal is only one of the elements involved in passing the sentence of preventive detention. There can be no doubt that in passing an ordinary sentence the court is entitled to take into consideration the conduct of the accused subsequent to the commission of the offence; provision is made for suspended sentences for that very purpose. Thus, there is no principle suggesting a different construction.\nConcerning the unanimous decision of this Court in Kirkland v. The Queen[25] this appears to be a case for the ap-plication of the rule enunciated by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern[26] and often referred to in this Court v.g. Regina v. Snider[27]; The Queen v. Harder[28]; Robert v. Marquis[29] \u201cthat a case is only an authority for what it actually decides\u201d. In the Kirkland case the determination of the period of time to be considered in making a finding that an accused is an habitual criminal was not in issue. The only question considered was what evidence is necessary to prove that an accused is \u201cleading persistently a criminal life\u201d. In the reasons for judgment it was said (at p. 7) that \u201cthe Crown had failed to satisfy the onus of proving that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence, the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life\u201d. In that case the accused had been apprehended immediately after the commission of the primary offence and undoubtedly was afterwards in custody until the sentence was passed. Therefore, it was obvious that the fact of leading persistently a criminal life was to be proved to have existed at the time of the commission of the primary offence and not subsequently as must indeed be the case in practically every instance, seeing that accused with criminal records such as to render them apt to be declared habitual criminals are not usually let out on bail. Thus, it appears to me that what was said in Kirkland v. The Queen should be taken merely as a statement of what had to be proved in that case, not as an exposition of the meaning of the statute applicable to different circumstances.\nIt must also be pointed out that the case was decided under s. 575c of the old Code. As we have seen, that section expressly provided that the required three convictions had to be \u201cpreviously to the conviction of the crime charged\u201d. There is nothing to indicate that any consideration was given to the question of whether the previous convictions and the persistently criminal life had to be proved to exist at the same time. Nothing indicates that there was any intention to decide against the clear words of the enactment that the three convictions had to be made previously to the commission of the crime, not previously to the conviction thereof. How then can this decision be considered as an authority on the construction to be given to a different enactment where the question is essentially whether the change in wording has effected any change in the substance of the enactment on this point. With the utmost deference for those who think otherwise, it does not appear to me that the judgment in the Kirkland case has any bearing on the question arising in the present case. In my view, it deals solely with the nature of the evidence required to prove that an accused is leading persistently a criminal life. It does not deal with the time during which this fact must be proved to exist, except that in that case it is said that this had to be shown to have existed at the time of the commission of the primary offence. The case has absolutely no reference to the time at which the previous convictions must have been made in order to be taken into account and it can have no application to the construction of a subsequent enactment that is differently worded in that respect.\nThis does not dispose of the second point because another change in wording between the old and the new Criminal Code remains to be considered. Under s. 575c it had to be proved that the accused had \u201cat least three times previously \u2026 been convicted \u2026\u201d, while in s. 660 it is provided that \u201can accused is an habitual criminal if he has previously \u2026 on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted \u2026\u201d. It will be noted that the requirement in respect to previous convictions is changed from \u201cat least three times\u201d to \u201con at least three separate and independent occasions\u201d. Bearing in mind that this is coupled with the other element, \u201cleading persistently a criminal life\u201d, the change is quite important. It is obvious that the new wording was inspired by consideration of the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Rex v. Tier[30] cited and applied in Rex v. Cindler[31], because the new wording is precisely that which Cooper J. used (at p. 437) when he held that in the New Zealand enactment \u201cfour occasions\u201d meant \u201cfour separate and independent occasions\u201d.\nAfter anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the change from \u201cthree times\u201d to \u201cthree separate and independent occasions\u201d has more than a formal significance irrespective of what may have been said in the New Zealand decision about several counts in the same indictment constituting but one \u201coccasion\u201d with the implication that separate indictments would constitute as many \u201coccasions\u201d. It should not be supposed that Parliament intended in effecting this change of wording that the number of \u201cseparate and independent occasions\u201d should depend on whether the prosecutor chose to proceed by several indictments instead of by several counts in the same indictment. The legal requirement is not \u201cthree separate and independent convictions\u201d but convictions on \u201cthree separate and independent occasions\u201d.\nIt is therefore necessary to consider the meaning of the word \u201coccasion\u201d and this must be done bearing in mind that words in statutes are generally to be construed in the popular or usual sense, not in any technical sense. In the Oxford dictionary, the first meaning of \u201coccasion\u201d is as follows:\n1. A falling together or juncture of circumstances favourable or suitable to an end or purpose, or admitting of something being done or effected, an opportunity \u2026\nApplying this definition to the enactment under consideration, must it not be said that in the usual sense, an \u201coccasion\u201d when a criminal is convicted, is when he is apprehended, charged and convicted of whatever number of crimes he is found to have committed before being brought to justice and usually given concurrent sentences.\nIn requiring convictions previously on at least three separate and independent occasions, Parliament cannot have intended that if a man had committed four offences he could be said to be an habitual criminal if the prosecutor chose to proceed by as many separate indictments on different dates. This would turn a substantive requirement into a merely formal requirement and it would not be in accordance with the usual meaning of the word \u201coccasion\u201d which is clearly not technical. Such an offender cannot be said to be a \u201crepris de justice\u201d when caught by the law for the first time. If the requirement cannot be satisfied by proceeding successively on four different charges after a single arrest it cannot be satisfied by so proceeding after two or three where the statute calls for three previous \u201coccasions\u201d.\nIt must also be considered that the accused has to be shown to be leading persistently a criminal life. In the Oxford dictionary, the first sense of \u201cpersistent\u201d is as follows:\nPersisting or continuing firmly in some action, course or pursuit, esp. against opposition or remonstrance, or in spite of failure.\nIn my view, because \u201cpersistent\u201d implies continuing in some action against opposition or remonstrance, the word \u201cpersistently\u201d in the enactment implies \u201cpersistently after being convicted on the required three separate and independent occasions\u201d.\nI do not think that it can properly be said that in thus construing \u201coccasions\u201d and \u201cpersistently\u201d one is going beyond the wording of the Code and adding requirements that are not spelled out. While it is frequently deemed desirable in legal drafting to go into a great deal of minute detail, nothing prevents Parliament from resorting to language requiring elaboration by judicial construction. In the present case, the words \u201coccasions\u201d and \u201cpersistently\u201d have obviously been selected to prescribe conditions the exact nature of which is left to the judgment of the courts.\nFor those reasons, I am of the opinion that the accused was not properly found to be an habitual criminal because, when he was convicted of the primary offence, he could not be said to have been previously convicted \u201con at least three separate and independent occasions\u201d when the last conviction was for an offence for which he was arrested and charged on the same occasion as the primary offence, and also because he could not be found to have been so convicted and to be leading persistently a criminal life when he had been convicted on the last occasion after being arrested for the primary offence.\nThe conclusion I have reached on the second question makes it unnecessary to consider the third question raised, namely that the appellant had not served the sentence imposed upon him on the third previous conviction.\nBecause in the opinion of the majority the appeal fails on the merit I do not deal with the question of jurisdiction but, assuming that we have jurisdiction, I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and HALL, SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.R.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the claimant\u2019s appeal from the award. On appeal to this Court the claimant submitted that the award should be increased to $243,500.\nThe lands expropriated consisted of an area of table land, then a rather steep slope down the side of a valley and finally an area of flat lands at the bottom of the valley. The claimant\u2019s case was that the highest and best use of the lands in question was for the erection of an apartment building. The arbitrator was of the opinion that evidence given on behalf of the claimant with regard to the prices of other properties in the near neighbourhood and in other districts could not be accepted as none of the properties he gave could be considered in any way comparable to the subject land. He was also of the opinion that the apartment scheme proposed by one of the claimant\u2019s witnesses although physically possible was not economically feasible. On the other hand, he accepted the appraisal put on the property by a valuator for the contestant who gave as his opinion that the only value on the land was an amount of $25,000 which would be paid by a speculator in the hope of making a profit on it in the future.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.: The majority of the Court agreed with the conclusions of the arbitrator.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The arbitrator was in error in his conclusion as to comparable properties and his conclusion that the scheme was not reasonably capable of realization did not seem to be in accordance with the evidence given at the trial. The arbitrator should have accepted the evidence given on behalf of the claimant and rejected that given on behalf of the contestant.\nHowever, the proper course in considering an appeal in this Court was to consider whether the calculations and assessment of land valuations were made in accordance with the proper and well\u2011recognized principles. In accepting the evidence given by the valuator for the contestant based on a land residual technique, the arbitrator did not proceed in accordance with proper and well-recognized principles and such evidence should have been rejected. The situation, therefore, was that the arbitrator was left with no proper evidence which he was willing to accept. In the circumstances, there was no solution other than to direct a new hearing of the arbitration.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal by the claimant from an arbitrator\u2019s award fixing the compensation payable by the contestant to the claimant by reason of the expropriation of certain land. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C., and M.J. McQuaid, for the claimant, appellant.\nG.M. Mace and D.C. Ross, for the contestant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Martland, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by JUDSON J.:\u2014In December of 1958 the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto expropriated 2.4 acres of vacant land belonging to the claimant, Samuel Cocomile. The arbitrator awarded $25,000 in compensation. The Court of Appeal dismissed the claimant\u2019s appeal from the award. In this Court the claimant submits that the award should be increased to $243,500.\nIn 1956, the claimant bought the property, together with the house on it, for $22,000. It was then in the hands of the Trust company as an asset of an estate under administration. It was listed for sale at $23,900 for some months and eventually sold to the claimant at $22,000. The real estate department of the Trust company had prepared a detailed report on the property. It contains a description of the land, of the building, the condition of the building, the assessment and the valuation. The following is a description of the land:\nThe subject property is located on the North-East side of Donlands Avenue in the Township of East York adjoining the property whereon is standing the Leaside Bridge. This property is divided into 4 lots. The main lot, lot No. 1, 40 ft. by approx. 140 ft. has the building erected upon it. This lot has a level part extending back about 50 ft. and falls steeply into the ravine. Lot 2 approx. 30 ft. by 140 ft. is pie shaped, it\u2019s levelled back about 25 ft. and falls into the ravine. Lot 3, 105 ft. by 140 ft. is pie shaped with practically no level land. Lot 4 comprises approximately two acres of land in the Don Valley.\nUpon consultation with the Metropolitan Toronto Planning Department it appears according to the present plan, for the Don Valley Roadway, that part of this land will have to be expropriated for this purpose. The main land value in this property is a pie shaped portion with 70 ft. of frontage on Donlands Avenue extending back to a maximum depth of about 60 ft. The area is zoned for residential use and the remaining part of the lot has little commercial value.\nThe lot is landscaped and there is an asphalt private driveway and domestic sidewalks.\nThe building was described as a two-storey brick house about 25 years old, structurally sound and well constructed. It was agreed for the purpose of this arbitration that the value of the lands and premises remaining to the claimant after expropriation was $15,000.\nThe claimant based his case on the suitability of the site for the building of an apartment house. One witness gave evidence that a 374-suite building could have been placed on the expropriated land. This witness did no more than say that it was physically possible to fit such a build- ing into the site. He gave no consideration to the economic feasibility of such a scheme. Another witness did not think that the site could have been sold for a 374-suite building. He thought that a 250\u2011suite building was more suitable to the site and the area. On this basis he arrived at a value of $243,500 for the land expropriated. He took a land value of $1,350 per suite, multiplied it by 250, then deducted two sums, one of $79,000 for the extra cost of construction on a valley site and $15,000 for the residual value of the land and buildings.\nThe arbitrator rejected these valuations of the land based upon the physical possibility of construction but in total disregard of economic commonsense. The conclusions of the learned arbitrator are stated in the following extract from his reasons:\nI have considered the evidence of the witnesses for the Claimant and I am of the opinion that the evidence of Mr. Strung with regard to the prices of other properties in the near neighbourhood and in other districts cannot be accepted as none of the properties he gave can be considered in any way comparable to the subject land. The great majority of the comparables are based on flat table land and the subject land is side-hill land, with very little table land except at the base of the ravine.\nThe apartment scheme proposed by Mr. Bregman may be possible and according to the engineer\u2019s report could be built on the property, but in my opinion was not reasonably capable of realization and is altogether too remote, uncertain and improbable. No such apartment had been built on the side valley lands in or near the Don Valley up to the date of expropriation in 1958 and would not be, considering all the circumstances. To consider building a $3,000,000 or $4,000,000 apartment on the subject land and close up to the Leaside Viaduct with the base of the apartment on the valley floor and the entrance down seven floors below on the hill, appears to be nothing more than a dream that could not be realized and would not be economically feasible.\nI accept on the other hand, the appraisal put on the property by Mr. MacKenzie who gave as his considered opinion that the only value on this land was an amount of $25,000 which would be paid by a speculator in the hope of making a profit on it in the future.\nThe Claimant stated the highest and best use of the subject property was for the purpose of building an apartment building, and their calculations of value for the land are based on a 250 suite apartment. I reject this opinion.\nThe Arbitrator should not treat an advantage consisting of a chance as if it were a certainty, or consider that a hypothetical purchaser would be sure to be a purchaser in fact. The special adaptability as suggested by the Claimant\u2019s witnesses for a proposed apartment site cannot in any way be considered by me as anything more than a chance.\nI accept the evidence of Mr. MacKenzie that the highest and best use is its present existing use and that in his opinion no builder would build a 250 suite apartment or even a smaller apartment on this site. I am therefore of opinion that the Claimant as a prudent man as of the date of the expropriation would not have paid more than $25,000 rather than be ejected from the property. This includes all potentialities.\nI agree with these conclusions, as did a unanimous Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario delivered on April 7, 1965, whereby that Court dismissed without written reasons an appeal from the award of His Honour Judge F.J. McRae, as arbitrator under the provisions of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 250, made November 26, 1963, by which the claimant was allowed the sum of $25,000.\nThe arbitration was to fix the compensation for the expropriation of 2.413 acres in the then Township of East York in the County of York. The claimant\u2019s case was that the highest and best use of these lands, upon which basis, of course, the valuation must be fixed, was for the erection of an apartment building. The claimant, therefore, adduced the evidence of one Joseph Strung to prove the value of the lands sold for such purposes in the immediate area in East York within the several years before the expropriation and upon such basis to give his opinion of the value for such purposes of the lands expropriated. There were, however, rather unusual problems as to site. The lands expropriated may be described as having certain table area on the level of Donlands Avenue upon which there was a detached brick residence, then a rather steep slope down the side of the Don Valley, and finally an area of flat lands at the bottom of the valley. There was 125 feet difference in elevation resulting from this slope of the side of the valley. Moreover, the lands at the top in the table area had a thick cover of very sandy soil. Therefore, the claimant had to demonstrate that this particular area did have its highest and best use as an apartment building. In order to do so, the claimant employed the services of one Sydney Bregman, an architect of some very considerable ability, who had to his credit the design of many modern buildings in Metropolitan Toronto, and a professional engineer, Peter A. Hertzberg, who had several years practice as a consulting engineer with a large firm doing that work in Metropolitan Toronto, particularly in the designing of industrial buildings.\nMr. Bregman produced a series of plans to exhibit an apartment building which he testified could be erected on the site. These plans were marked as ex. 7 and delineated a 374-suite building the front of which at the west corner would be set back from the street line of Donlands Avenue about 280 feet, in T-shape and the leg of the T running to the north, i.e., along the valley bottom lands. The design showed a driveway leaving Donlands Avenue and curving to the table lands and down the slope of the valley through a landscaped park at a grade of 13.7 per cent to a main entrance which was at the seventh floor of the building. The building would then continue a further nine floors above this main entrance. On the north front, i.e., the front which looked across the valley, apartments ran all the way up the whole sixteen floors but on the south front, i.e., the front which looked towards Donlands Avenue, the apartments faced out from the floors from the lobby up. Some of the apartments on the lower of those floors faced this long landscaped slope up to the table land and some were above the level of the table lands. A levelled parking space in front of the building was shown which resulted in the commencement of the slope being about 100 feet south of the building.\nMr. Hertzberg gave evidence that such a building could be constructed on those lands, the soil tests having been such as would permit it, and that the additional cost of construction of the building due to it being situated on such sloping lands would be $79,000. Mr. Strung gave evidence that there was a demand for apartment suites in that particular area of Metropolitan Toronto at the time of the expropriation in 1958. He was of the opinion that a 374-suite building would be so much larger than any nearby apartment building that a bidder would probably not erect a building of more than 250 suites.\nMr. Strung arrived at his opinion of the value of the lands expropriated by two different means. In his report marked at trial as ex. 11 he included a sales analysis chart of 26 properties which had been purchased for apartment buildings in the years 1956 to April and May 1959. Since those dates represented the closing of the transactions of sales, he was of the opinion that the sales must have been negotiated either prior to or just at the time of this expropriation. Mr. Strung showed that the lands comprising these 26 locations had been purchased at such amounts, in view of the buildings later erected on them, that the sale price per suite in the completed buildings varied from $708 to $1,614. He also testified and, in my opinion, with much more relevance, that the sale price per square foot of the lands included in these 26 different apartment house sites purchased varied from $2.04 to $5.12. Mr. Strung gave it as his opinion, based on the aforesaid figures showing the price per suite paid for the land purchased, that the price per suite which a prudent purchaser would pay for the lands expropriated in order to erect a 250-suite apartment building was about $1,350 and therefore arrived at a valuation of the lands at $337,500 less the $79,000 additional necessary for the erection of the apartment building due to the sloping nature of the lands or a total of $258,500. This valuation was not accepted by the learned County Court Judge and I am of the opinion that the evidence is of no assistance in determining the award which should be made.\nIt will be seen that the price per suite differs with the number of suites which are contained in the building which the purchaser plans to erect. The building as delineated by Mr. Bregman contained 374 suites. Mr. Strung was of the opinion that a builder would only erect a structure to contain 250 suites. It may well be that any particular bidder for vacant lands upon which he intends to erect an apartment building will govern himself directly by the amount per suite which he feels he can afford to pay for the lands, but the award must be based not on what one particular bidder plans to build as a building but on what willing purchasers would agree to pay for the lands with the bidder free to use the lands as he deems fit.\nI am of the opinion that a much more accurate gauge than this one of so-called cost per suite is Mr. Strung\u2019s second method. As I have said, he found that the sale price per square foot of the lands in those 26 purchases varied from $2.04 to $5.12. By arithmetical calculation they average $3.60. They are all buildings in the immediate East York area within a few short blocks of the edge of the Don Valley. Mr. Strung pointed out that the buildings which were situated chiefly on Gamble Avenue and Cosburn Avenue, although a few were on Bayview Avenue in the then Town of Leaside, were in groups of rather commonplace apartment buildings often facing each other across a street in a middle class area, while the land expropriated was a little distance farther north and in a group of better class houses and in addition had what Mr. Strung regarded as a very considerable advantage, the unimpaired view free of nearby apartments across the Don Valley. It was pointed out to Mr. Strung that the Leaside Bridge ran parallel to the easterly limit of the lands expropriated and had its southern terminus on Donlands Avenue only 126.58 feet east of the said easterly limit of the lands expropriated, but Mr. Strung was of the opinion that the view nevertheless was most attractive. He did acknowledge that sloping lands always went for a lower price than flat lands and Mr. Daniels, another real estate agent called for the claimant, in reply, made the same admission.\nIt was Mr. Strung\u2019s opinion that the square foot value of the lands expropriated, by a weighted comparison with the sale price of the other lands in the 26 different apartment locations in the area, was $2.79 per square foot and acknowledged that this square foot rate would have to be reduced by the additional cost of construction on steeply sloped land. That cost, as I said, had already been established by Mr. Hertzberg at $79,000. The area of the lands expropriated was taken as being 121,010 square feet, so $79,000 spread over that area would work out at 65 or 66 cents per square foot. If that figure is deducted from the $2.79 it leaves $2.13 or $2.14 as being the value which Mr. Strung would give per square foot for the land expropriated. For the area of 121,010 square feet this would amount to $257,751.30 at $2.13, and $258,961.40 at $2.14, say $258,000. It will be seen that by this method Mr. Strung arrived at almost exactly the same amount as by the values per suite method, but for the reasons which I have outlined I am of the opinion that in the latter method he was proceeding in a much sounder fashion. Of course, the $258,000 valuation as submitted by Mr. Strung must be reduced as he suggested by the amount of $15,000, the agreed value of the small portion of the land upon which the residence was situated and which was excepted out of the expropriation. It should be noted that in-chief the claimant adduced no evidence as to the cost of the erection of the building as outlined by Mr. Bregman nor the amount of the rentals which could be obtained per suite. This course was the logical one on the case as put forward by the claimant. The claimant\u2019s production of the building plans designed by Mr. Bregman was simply to answer the obvious objection to the use of the alleged comparables in the 26 sales that the lands expropriated because of their contours were not suitable for apartment house construction and that therefore such was not the highest and best use. It was in an attempt to demonstrate that the lands could be used advantageously for such apartment house construction that Mr. Bregman and Mr. Hertzberg did their work. Any figures as to cost of construction of the building as designed by Mr. Bregman and the rentals which one could hope to obtain from the suites were given by the claimant\u2019s witnesses only in cross\u2011examination in the contestant\u2019s attempt to apply its \u201cresidual\u201d method to the building designed by Mr. Bregman. There were certain errors in the evidence given in that cross-examination to which I shall refer and which had a very important effect upon the conclusions which the arbitrator arrived at when considering the evidence given on behalf of the claimant.\nThe contestant adduced the evidence of Mr. Arthur D. MacKenzie, who was an appraiser of some very considerable repute. His experience had been largely in the appraisal field rather than in the buying and selling of real estate and his appraisals had very often been for the purpose of advising financial enterprises such as insurance companies as to whether they should lend money on apartment buildings and the amounts which they should lend. I quote a question as to his method and his reply:\nQ. Would you give an outline of your method of appraisal and your valuation, please?\nA. Yes. Your Honour, as part of my qualification there I have stated that we do appraisal work for a large number of the insurance companies and that we have been doing this for myself now for seventeen years and in so doing we do make appraisals on a large proportion of the apartment houses in Toronto aside from working for many individual apartment builders and our procedure in appraising an apartment property is, first, to examine the site in detail and in many cases, as today, we have working drawings which we examine also in detail as part of the value of the whole to be completed. We estimate a fair market value for the site based on the comparison in general and our general knowledge of the area and its acceptability for this particular type of development. We examine the plans with a view to the best layout of suites, best size and type of suite, number of bathrooms, room layout, elevators, heating, natural light and view, air conditioning, etcetera, all in relation to the area and the type of people who may rent in this particular area.\nAnd further:\nHIS HONOUR: Alright, go ahead.\nA. With this done, Your Honour, we estimate a physical value of the cost or physical cost to complete this building on the site for which we have estimated a fair market value and as a check against this, and based also on the area, our knowledge of the area, we estimate the rents which we believe this building will draw in the area. We estimate the various expenses required to operate this building. These are taxes, real estate taxes, insurance, heating, janitor, hydro, water, maintenance and a vacancy allowance and a management allowance. This net or these expenses from the gross estimate diverge in net which we capitalize to get an economic value of this particular proposal. Now this is checked against our physical approach. It is also checked against market analysis of other apartment building sales as against the gross multiplier which is a very general rule. In other words, we use many guides to arrive at a final value of this completed property. Fully rented is our assumption.\nHIS HONOUR: That is an economic value is it?\nA. It is an economic value derived by using the gross, the expenses and the capitalization, but that again is checked against our physical value, etcetera, or the final value.\nMr. MacKenzie testified:\nA. In this particular case, Your Honour, we had no comparable land prices, in my opinion, we must for that reason approach it from an economic direction to find out if there is any residual value of the land and this is part of my reason for this procedure.\nI am of the opinion that this statement which Mr. MacKenzie advanced as his reason for his use of the so-called residual method, the method which the learned arbitrator accepted in making his award, illustrates the basic error in the contestant\u2019s case. There certainly were comparable properties in the immediate area. Mr. Strung had produced a list and a complete analysis of 26 apartment buildings within a short distance of the land expropriated. There were in Metropolitan Toronto literally thousands of apartment buildings which had been built on land purchased in the few years prior to this expropriation. All of these land sales were available and could properly have been used as comparables in considering the value of the lands expropriated. Of course, none of them were exactly the same, in site, in contour, or in size, as the lands expropriated. That situation prevails on other occasions in which any piece of land is compared with any other. Sometimes the differences are great, sometimes they are small. The comparisons must all be considered and weighed. Mr. Strung testified as to these 26 different sales and from his testimony one arrives at an average sale price of $3.60 per square foot. Then Mr. Strung weighed that average by taking from it an amount to reflect the net disadvantage of the lands expropriated. When I use the term \u201cnet disadvantage\u201d, I am referring to admission that sloping or uneven lands always brought lower prices but his opinion was that the expropriated lands had other advantages of view and position not possessed by the lands with which they were compared. The net reduction he gave must have been 81 cents per square foot below the average because he valued the lands expropriated at $2.79 per square foot while, as I have said, the average of the 26 sales, which were all of flat lands, was $3.60 per square foot. Mr. Strung made a further reduction as I have pointed out of 65 cents per square foot to allow for the $79,000 in additional building costs which would be incurred because of the sloped land.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the learned arbitrator was in error when he said:\nMr. Strung did not make any distinction in the subject site between table land and side\u2011hill land. Most of the land of the subject site was side-hill land.\nI am of the opinion that Mr. Strung\u2019s evidence did weigh the comparables in view of the sloping conditions of the expropriated lands and it would appear that he allowed 25 per cent reduction based on that factor in addition to another allowance of 65 cents per square foot for the additional costs of construction.\nTo return to the evidence of Mr. MacKenzie for the contestants, there may be some significance in the fact that Mr. MacKenzie also chose to design an apartment building for the site although he had given it in his evidence that the highest and best use of the lands expropriated was that for which they were presently employed, i.e., a detached private residence on a corner of the table lands and all the whole balance unused and running to waste. Mr. MacKenzie, however, designed a building contrasting strongly to that designed by Mr. Bregman and one which contained only 51 suites. It was agreed by both the claimant and the contestants that the then by-law provisions applicable in East York permitted a building even as large as the 374-suite one designed by Mr. Bregman. Why then should Mr. MacKenzie have designed a 51-suite building? It is evident that he did so because he chose to use only the small area of table land adjoining Donlands Avenue. In view of Mr. Bregman\u2019s and Mr. Hertzberg\u2019s evidence, that the very large building designed by them was quite possible architecturally and from an engineering point of view, it would seem a very uneconomic use of the site to place on the south flat part thereof only a 51-suite building. It is true that of the 26 comparables analyzed by Mr. Strung the largest was only a 91-suite building but that apartment building had been erected on a lot only 180 feet by 150 feet, i.e., 27,000 square feet, while the lands expropriated had an area of 121,010 square feet. It would seem inevitable that if you placed on that large lot, whether it be level or whether it be sloping, only a 51-suite building then you could only afford to pay a very small amount for the lands. Once it has been shown that the large building is architecturally and from an engineering standpoint possible, and once it is shown that there is an effective demand in the neighbourhood for that large number of apartments, then surely a 51-suite building as designed by Mr. MacKenzie could have no relationship whatsoever to the highest and best use of the lands. To compare with that most limited use of the land, even its present use would have been a higher and better use, as Mr. MacKenzie seems to have quite adequately proved that a 51-suite building would leave at the best only a pittance which the buyer could afford to pay for the land.\nIn his evidence, Mr. MacKenzie was asked to deal with two other things. Firstly, the economic feasibility of the building designed by Mr. Bregman using his \u201cresidual\u201d method to which reference has been made and, secondly, in cross-examination, to use the same method for analyzing the 26 sales of what the appellant submitted were comparable properties in the immediate neighbourhood. It was Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s opinion that using his residual method the building designed by Mr. Bregman would not allow any value at all to be assessed to the land. As I have already said, the claimant\u2019s witnesses had in examination-in-chief given neither the costs of construction of the Bregman designed building nor the rents to be expected therefrom, as these calculations were not part of the claimant\u2019s case.\nIn cross-examination, Mr. Bregman had been asked:\nQ. Then would you tell us, roughly, what you think this project would cost?\nA. Well, I would have to do some multiplication. I would perhaps give you a figure on a per suite basis and you can multiply it by three hundred and seventy-four if you wish.\nQ. Is that the way you estimated your cost of this structure, the cost per suite?\nA. Yes, keeping in mind the general design of the buildings we follow this cost up and down according to the type of construction and any inherent problems in the design.\nQ. Perhaps you would give us that figure first then?\nA. Well, I would\u2014including the garage I would estimate it at approximately eleven thousand per suite. Roughly four million one hundred thousand, approximately.\nMr. MacKenzie, in his application of the \u201cresidual\u201d technique to the Bregman design for a building, compared his capitalization of the income from such building at 7\u00bc per cent to that cost figure from Mr. Bregman\u2019s cross-examination and pointed out that it left no value for the land at all. Mr. Bregman was called in reply and gave evidence that his figure of $4,100,000 was a cost figure which he gave in the light of the costs at the time of the hearing upon arbitration, that is, in June of 1963, and that in his opinion the cost at the end of the year 1958 would have been about $9,625 per suite or $3,600,000 for a 374-suite apartment building. Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s capitalization at 7\u00bc per cent to which I have referred above was $3,670,000. Therefore, even if he had used the same rental figures but had taken a proper 1958 rather than a 1963 cost he would have found a $70,000 value in the lands expropriated. Moreover, if Mr. MacKenzie had taken the rentals as stated by Mr. Daniels who was called in reply, the value of the expropriated lands would have worked out at a much higher figure.\nI have referred to this evidence to show that not only is the \u201cresidual\u201d technique one which, in my opinion, is not in accordance with the \u201cproper and well-recognized principle\u201d of fixing values in expropriations but it was inaccurately done. The learned arbitrator rejected the evidence called on behalf of the claimant for reasons which he set out as follows:\nI have considered the evidence of the witnesses for the claimant and I am of the opinion that the evidence of Mr. Strung with regard to the prices of other properties in the near neighbourhood and in other districts cannot be accepted as none of the properties he gave can be considered in any way comparable to the subject land. The great majority of the comparables are based on flat table land and the subject land is side-hill land, with very little table land except at the base of the ravine.\nThe apartment scheme proposed by Mr. Bregman may be possible and according to the engineer\u2019s report could be built on the property, but in my opinion was not reasonably capable of realization and is altogether too remote, uncertain and improbable. No such apartment had been built on the side valley lands in or near the Don Valley up to the date of expropriation in 1958 and would not be, considering all the circumstances. To consider building a $3,000,000 or $4,000,000 apartment on the subject land and close up to the Leaside Viaduct with the base of the apartment on the valley floor and the entrance down seven floors below on the hill, appears to be nothing more than a dream that could not be realized and would not be economically feasible.\nIn these reasons, I have attempted to demonstrate that the learned arbitrator was in error in his conclusion as set out in the first paragraph above. His conclusion in the second paragraph, that the scheme was not reasonably capable of realization and so altogether too remote, uncertain and improbable, seems to be not in accordance with the evidence given at the trial where at least four other large side-hill apartments in various parts of Metropolitan Toronto were cited, since Mr. Bregman and Mr. Hertzberg gave evidence that a building with similar properties as that designed for this site would be physically feasible. As to the existence of effective demand, the learned arbitrator seems to have accepted the opinion of Mr. MacKenzie, but Mr. Strung showed that at the immediate time of the expropriation building of apartments was proceeding apace in the area and very shortly thereafter, and particularly in the area immediately north of the Don Valley, the subject property being on the south bank, many very large apartments were erected.\nHad I been presiding as the arbitrator, for the reasons I have outlined, I would have accepted the evidence given on behalf of the claimant and rejected the evidence given on behalf of the contestant. I was not, however, sitting as an arbitrator and I think that the proper course in con- sidering an appeal in this Court is that which I have outlined in Kramer et al. v. Wascana Centre Authority[1], at p. 248, and which was repeated in the unanimous judgment of the Court in Florence Realty Co. Ltd. et al. v. The Queen[2]:\nIn my view, it is not the duty of this Court to engage in calculations or to exercise judgment as to land valuation in the Province of Saskatchewan. It is the duty of this Court to consider whether those calculations and assessment of land valuations were made in accordance with the proper and well-recognized principle.\nFor the reasons which I have outlined above, I have come to the conclusion that in accepting the evidence given by Mr. MacKenzie based on the \u201cresidual\u201d technique, the learned arbitrator did not proceed in accordance with proper and well-recognized principles and that such evidence should have been rejected. The situation, therefore, is that the learned arbitrator was left with no proper evidence which he was willing to accept. Section 7 of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 250, provides:\nThe award may be appealed against to the Court of Appeal in the same manner as the decision of a judge of the Supreme Court sitting in Court is appealed from, \u2026\nIt is, of course, within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and of this Court on appeal from that Court to direct a new trial, and I can see no other solution other than to adopt such a course in this case.\nI would, therefore, direct that the award be returned to the learned arbitrator to consider in accord with these reasons. The appellant should be entitled to the costs of this appeal and the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario; the costs of the first arbitration, and of any subsequent hearing should be in the discretion of the arbitrator.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the claimant, appellant: Arnup, Foulds, Weir, Boeckh, Morris & Robinson, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the contestant, respondent: A.P.G.

This was done by drawing cheques on non-existent bank accounts. The amount involved in each offence was under $100. He was subsequently found to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention. His record of convictions commenced at age 16 and all but one included an element of theft. On June 25, 1965, the day of the expiration of a four-year sentence for theft of an automobile, he was given money to take him from New Brunswick to Vancouver. On his arrival in Vancouver the same day, he at once obtained a job as a labourer and appeared to have been continuously so employed until his conviction on August 10 of the substantive offences. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the sentence of preventive detention. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court, where his appeal was dismissed on June 26, 1967. In this Court, [1967] S.C.R. 554, the majority came to the conclusion that the magistrate and the majority in the Court of Appeal had rightly found him to be an habitual criminal, and that this Court had no jurisdiction to substitute its opinion on the question as to whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to impose a sentence of preventive detention. The judgment rendered by the minority concluded that it was not expedient for the protection of the public to impose such a sentence. As the question of jurisdiction on which the decision of the majority was founded had not been argued at the hearing of that appeal, an application for a re-hearing was granted. At this re-hearing, which was argued on the assumption that the appellant had rightly been found to be an habitual criminal, counsel for the appellant and for the respondent both contended that this Court had jurisdiction to deal with the question whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention.\nHeld (Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the sentence of preventive detention quashed and the sentences imposed on the convictions of the substantive offences restored. Per Cartwright C.J. and Judson and Hall JJ.: It has not been shown that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention. Section 660(1) of the Code, giving jurisdiction to impose a sentence of preventive detention, is worded permissively and is not mandatory. Since his convictions in 1959, the appellant had not been found guilty of any violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in 1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, he has been sentenced to severe punishment. There is some evidence of his trying to live a normal life. It has not been satisfactorily shown that his release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the public renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in custody.\nThe judgment in The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831, does not bind this Court to hold that, unless it can say that the finding of the Courts below that the appellant was an habitual criminal should be set aside, this Court is without jurisdiction to interfere with the imposition of the sentence of preventive detention. On the plain meaning of the words of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, it seems clear that this Court has jurisdiction to deal with the appeal on the merits. This is an appeal for which leave was granted under s. 41 and which is not barred by subs. (3) thereof. The appeal given by s. 667(1) raises only one question for decision, that is whether the sentence of preventive detention is to be sustained or set aside. The answer to the question whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal sought to be brought before it depends on the subject matter of the appeal and on the terms of the statute conferring jurisdiction.\nPer Spence J.: Accepting the view that it was not expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the accused to preventive detention, an appeal lies to this Court from that finding.\nThis is an appeal from a decision which has resulted in the appellant being sentenced to preventive detention. The matters considered are not the matters considered in an ordinary appeal from sentence but resemble the consideration of an appeal from conviction. Under s. 667 of the Code, the provincial Court of Appeal must find affirmatively as to three elements before it may affirm the sentence of preventive detention. These elements are: (1) conviction on the substantive offence; (ii) that the accused is an habitual criminal; (iii) that it is expedient to sentence him to preventive detention. The leave to appeal to this Court, which was properly granted under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, brings forward for consideration the same three elements and it is the right and the duty of this Court acting within its jurisdiction to consider all three elements. In doing so, this Court would not be going beyond its jurisdiction.\nPer Pigeon J.: It has not been shown that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention.\nThis Court has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to hear appeals by leave in the case of persons sentenced to preventive detention, and this jurisdiction is not restricted to a review of the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal. Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: Once the finding as to the status of the accused as an habitual criminal is not in issue, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the sentence of preventive detention. There is a clear line of authority which establishes that this Court has no jurisdiction to. entertain an appeal with respect to sentences for an indictable offence. No appeal lies to this Court from the determination that it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the accused to preventive detention. Parkes v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 134, is not an authority for the submission that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention in isolation from the finding as to status. The only reported case in this Court in which an appeal has been taken from a sentence of preventive detention when the finding as to status of the accused was not in issue is the case of The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831. In that case the majority of the Court decided that there was no jurisdiction under s. 41 to entertain an appeal from a sentence of preventive detention alone. There is no distinction between the present case and the case of The Queen v. MacDonald in so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014Juridiction\u2014Sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014D\u00e9claration que l\u2019accus\u00e9 est un repris de justice\u2014Opportunit\u00e9 de la condamnation \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a-t-elle juridiction pour entendre un appel d\u2019une telle sentence\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 41\u2014Code criminel, 1958-54 (Can.), c. 61, arts. 660(1), 667(1).\nL\u2019appelant, alors \u00e2g\u00e9 de 34 ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable le 10 ao\u00fbt 1965, de deux infractions d\u2019obtention de biens par faux semblant et de deux infractions de tentative de pareille obtention. Il s\u2019agissait de ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s sur un compte de banque qui n\u2019existait pas. Le montant en jeu dans chaque infraction \u00e9tait de moins de $100. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 repris de justice et condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Son dossier de condamnations commence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 16 ans et toutes, sauf une, contiennent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de vol. Le 25 juin 1965, le jour de l\u2019expiration d\u2019une sentence de quatre ans pour vol d\u2019automobile, il a re\u00e7u une somme d\u2019argent pour se rendre du Nouveau-Brunswick \u00e0 Vancouver. A son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver le m\u00eame jour, il a imm\u00e9diatement obtenu un emploi comme man\u0153uvre et il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 continuellement employ\u00e9 de la sorte jusqu\u2019au jour de sa condamnation le 10 ao\u00fbt pour les infractions sur lesquelles la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive est bas\u00e9e. La Cour d\u2019appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a confirm\u00e9 cette sentence. L\u2019appelant a obtenu permission d\u2019appeler devant cette Cour, mais son appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 le 26 juin 1967 par un jugement majoritaire statuant, [1967] R.C.S. 554, que le magistrat et les juges majoritaires en Cour d\u2019appel avaient eu raison de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un repris de justice, et que cette Cour n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour substituer son opinion sur la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public de lui imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. L\u2019opinion de la minorit\u00e9 dans cette Cour \u00e9tait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas lieu de juger opportun pour la protection du public d\u2019imposer une telle sentence. Vu que la question de juridiction sur laquelle la d\u00e9cision majoritaire \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel, une requ\u00eate pour nouvelle audition a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. Lors de cette nouvelle audition, on a pris pour acquis que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 repris de justice, et les avocats de l\u2019appelant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont tous deux soutenu que cette Cour avait juridiction pour consid\u00e9rer s\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public d\u2019imposer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli, la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e et les sentences impos\u00e9es pour les infractions sur lesquelles elle est bas\u00e9e doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9tablies, les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Judson et Hall: Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public de condamner l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Le texte de l\u2019art. 660(1) du Code, qui conf\u00e8re la juridiction pour imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, est permissif et non pas obligatoire. Depuis ses condamnations en 1959, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019aucun crime de violence. Pour le vol d\u2019une automobile en 1962 et pour les quatre infractions en 1965 sur lesquelles la sentence est bas\u00e9e, il a re\u00e7u des punitions s\u00e9v\u00e8res. Il y a une certaine preuve qu\u2019il essaie de vivre une vie normale. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante que sa mise en libert\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019expiration de l\u2019emprisonnement. auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 pour les infractions dont il s\u2019agit aurait pour effet de constituer. une menace \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou que pour la protection du public il serait opportun qu\u2019il passe le reste de sa vie en d\u00e9tention.\nLe jugement dans The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] R.C.S. 831, n\u2019oblige pas cette Cour \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle puisse dire que la d\u00e9claration des Cours inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelant est un repris de justice doit \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9, elle n\u2019a pas juridiction pour intervenir dans l\u2019imposition de la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Les mots de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, dans leur sens ordinaire, semblent indiquer clairement que cette Cour a juridiction pour juger l\u2019appel sur le fond. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un appel admis par permission sous l\u2019art. 41 et qui n\u2019est pas prohib\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a (3) de cet article. L\u2019appel vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 667(1) requiert la solution d\u2019une seule question, savoir si la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e ou mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9. La juridiction de cette Cour pour entendre et juger un appel que l\u2019on tente de lui faire entendre d\u00e9pend de la mati\u00e8re de l\u2019appel et des termes du statut donnant la juridiction.\nLe Juge Spence: S\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas opportun pour la protection du public de condamner l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, cette Cour a juridiction pour entendre un appel de cette d\u00e9cision.\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision qui a eu pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019imposer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Les questions \u00e0 \u00e9tudier ne sont pas les questions \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer dans un appel ordinaire d\u2019une sentence mais ressemblent \u00e0 un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Avant qu\u2019elle puisse confirmer la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive sous l\u2019art. 667 du Code, la Cour provinciale d\u2019appel doit en venir \u00e0 une conclusion affirmative sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont: (i) la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9; (ii) le fait que l\u2019accus\u00e9 est un repris de justice; (iii) l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de lui imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.

Appel accueilli, les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nRE-HEARING of an appeal, reported at [1967] S.C.R. 554, 60 W.W.R. 641, [1968] 1 C.C.C. 242, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting. Bryan H. Kershaw, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming, by a majority, a sentence of preventive detention imposed on the appellant by His Worship Magistrate G.L. Levey at Vancouver on June 14, 1966. Bull J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, quashed the sentence of preventive detention and restored the sentences imposed in respect of convictions of four substantive offences in lieu of which the sentence appealed against had been imposed.\nThe appeal was first argued on June 5, 1967, before a Court of five judges and on June 26, 1967, the appeal[1] was dismissed by a majority. My brothers Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie were of opinion (i) that the learned magistrate and the majority in the Court of Appeal were right in finding the appellant to be an habitual criminal and (ii) that this Court had no jurisdiction to substitute its opinion for that of the Court of Appeal on the question as to whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention. My brother Judson and I were of opinion that it was unnecessary to decide whether the appellant was rightly found to be an habitual criminal because, on the assumption that he was, it was not expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nAs the question of jurisdiction on which the decision of the majority was founded had not been raised by counsel or the Court at the hearing of the appeal, an application for a re-hearing was granted and the appeal was argued before the full Court on December 11, 1967. At this time counsel for the appellant and for the respondent both contended that, on the assumption that the appellant was rightly found to be an habitual criminal, this Court has jurisdiction to deal with the question whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention; counsel for the respondent submitted that on the merits this question should be answered in the affirmative and the appeal dismissed.\nThe appellant was born on March 3, 1932.\nThe evidence as to his past record is accurately summarized by Bull J.A. as follows:\nJust after reaching 16 years of age, the appellant was convicted of a charge of taking an automobile without consent and stealing four pairs of shoes a day or so earlier, and was fined $20.00 and given a suspended sentence, respectively. Three years later, at the age of 19 years, he was convicted of breaking and entering a drug store and was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. Upon being released from this imprisonment about 19 months later, he joined the Canadian Army and served with it in Canada and Korea for about 2 years until he was dishonourably discharged shortly after having been convicted in Montreal of two charges of robbery and sentenced to five years on each to run concurrently. On his release at expiration of sentence the appellant had odd jobs in and around his home area in New Brunswick for about five months, when he again fell foul of the law. This time he was convicted on four charges of breaking and entering business premises within the space of a few days, and was awarded various sentences to run concurrently, of which the longest was three years in the penitentiary. The appellant was released from imprisonment on November 19, 1961, and worked fairly steadily with some success and employer approval at labouring work for about ten months when he was convicted of theft of a U-Drive automobile which he had rented. For this offence he was sentenced to four years in the penitentiary. On his release from this sentence in June, 1965, the somewhat unusual events occurred which led to his commission of, and convictions on, the substantive offences. On the day of release and provided with funds and an airline ticket by his mother in the Maritimes, he flew to Vancouver claiming to be filled with the admirable resolution to there start a new honest life away from the associations which he claimed had always led him into trouble. Although there were many inconsistencies in his evidence as to exactly what the appellant did for the next few weeks, it does appear quite clear and uncontradicted that promptly after arrival he did get a job with a wrecking company, which lasted about two weeks, followed by a job with a salvage company commencing on July 12, 1965. On July 9, 1965, however, he purchased $41.85, and attempted to purchase a further $91.37, worth of goods from a department store with cheques signed in his own name but drawn on a non-existent account in a local bank. The appellant said the account number used was that of an account that he had in the same bank in Fredericton, N.B., but quite properly little credence was given to this excuse. It is clear that some at least of the goods in question were working clothes and gear needed by the appellant in the new job he was just starting. On the same day, allegedly to replace one stolen from his room, the appellant attempted to buy a watch from a jeweller with a cheque for $83.99 drawn on the same nonexistent account. The appellant was released on bail, went back to work and about ten days later obtained a pipe and some tobacco from a tobacconist with a cheque for $12.74 drawn on a fictitious account. The appellant was convicted of these four depredations on August 10, 1965, and given concurrent sentences aggregating 3 years. Apparently, notwithstanding these shopping sprees, the appellant did have gainful employment for substantially the whole time from his release on June 25, 1965, to his conviction on August 10, 1965. There was no evidence adduced that during this last period of freedom the appellant associated with criminals or undesirable characters.\nI do not find it necessary to choose between the conflicting views of Bull J.A. and of the majority in the Court of Appeal as to whether on the evidence the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal can safely be upheld; for the purpose of these reasons I will assume that it can.\nOn the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, I have reached the conclusion that it has not been shewn that it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nWhether or not in any particular case it is expedient to so sentence a person found to be an habitual criminal is a question of fact or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact; it is certainly not a question of law alone. But, leave to appeal to this Court having been granted, it is clear that we have jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact.\nIn Mulcahy v. The Queen[2], this Court in a unanimous judgment expressly adopted the reasons of MacQuarrie J. who had dissented from the judgment of the majority in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (in banco) and set aside the sentence of preventive detention which had been imposed upon the appellant. The dissenting judgment of MacQuarrie J. is reported in 42 C.R. at page 1.\nIn that case the record shewed that, prior to being convicted of the substantive offence, the appellant had been convicted between 1941 and 1961 on nineteen occasions of offences, for which he had been sentenced to a total of fifteen years and six months in the penitentiary and twenty-six months in prison. None of his convictions were for crimes of violence; six were for breaking and entering and the remainder for theft or having possession of stolen goods.\nMacQuarrie J. based his judgment on two distinct grounds. The first of these was that there was no evidence to support a finding that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. The second ground was expressed as follows:\nWhile I do not attempt to minimize the record of the appellant, a perusal of it (apart from the lack of evidence to justify finding him to be leading persistently a criminal life) indicates that he is not the type of person of whom it can properly be said \u201cit is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d. In my opinion the Crown has failed to prove that (even although the accused was leading persistently a criminal life) a sentence of preventive detention was expedient for the protection of the public.\nIn the case at bar no exception can be taken to the terms in which the learned Magistrate instructed himself as to the applicable principles of law. Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Regina v. Channing[3], he expressed the view that in order to impose a sentence of preventive detention he must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life, that the decision of each case must depend on its own particular facts, (i) as to whether the finding that a person is an habitual criminal should be made and, (ii) as to whether that finding having been made, a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. It is, I think, implicit in the last sentence of his reasons, read in the light of his reference to Regina v. Charnning, that he held it necessary that he should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the second of these points as well as on the first. The sentence to which I refer reads as follows:\nI find that the Crown has proved beyond all reasonable doubt, in my mind, that it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence you to preventive detention, and I so do.\nIn the Court of Appeal Lord J.A., with whom McFarlane J.A. expressed substantial agreement, dealt with this branch of the matter as follows:\nNor can I say that he reached the wrong opinion in finding it expedient for the protection of the public that the appellant be sentenced to preventive detention.\nBull J.A., having held that the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal could not safely be upheld, did not find it necessary to deal with this question.\nIn Regina v. Channing, supra, Sheppard J.A., with whom Norris, Lord and MacLean JJ.A. agreed and Davey J.A. agreed \u201cin general\u201d, said at page 110:\nIn the case at bar, the crown must assume the onus of proving that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the accused be sentenced beyond that imprisonment for the substantive offence: Mulcahy v. Reg., and that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt: Parkes v. Reg. and Kirkland v. Reg.\nIn the same case at page 101, Davey J.A. said:\nLikewise it is undesirable for us to lay down detailed tests of the sufficiency of evidence to prove either that an accused is a habitual criminal or that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he be sentenced to preventive detention. All that is required is that the evidence be sufficient to prove both these essential matters beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the magistrate or trial judge.\nAs already indicated, I am dealing with this appeal on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed and the question to be answered is therefore whether it can properly be said \u201cthat because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d.\nThe answer to this question depends upon the application to the facts of the case of the words of s. 660(1) of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n660.(1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nIt will be observed that the section is worded permissively. Even if both conditions (a) and (b) are fulfilled the Court is not bound to impose the sentence of preventive detention. The wording may be contrasted with that used by Parliament in s. 661(3):\n(3) Where the court finds that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a sentence of preventive detention\u2026\nThe wording of s. 660 may also be compared with that of the corresponding sub-section in the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, of the United Kingdom, 11 and 12 George VI, c. 58, s. 21(2) of which reads as follows:\n(2) Where a person who is not less than thirty years of age\u2014\n(a) is convicted on indictment of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more; and (b) has been convicted on indictment on at least three previous occasions since he attained the age of seventeen of offences punishable on indictment with such a sentence, and was on at least two of those occasions sentenced to Borstal training, imprisonment or corrective training;\nthen, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, the court may pass, in lieu of any other sentence, a sentence of preventive detention for such term of not less than five or more than fourteen years as the court may determine.\nI do not consider that the use of the words \u201cThe court is of the opinion\u201d in s. 660(1) (b) of the Criminal Code prevents the Court of Appeal or this Court from substituting its opinon for that of the learned Magistrate. That course has been followed in Mulcahy v. The Queen, supra.\nIn Regina v. Channing, supra, after stating that what is expedient for the protection of the public is a question of fact in each case, Sheppard J.A. continued at page 109:\nMoreover, as the sentence for the substantive offence will have considered the protection of the public as one of the elements, it would follow that preventive detention should not be imposed unless the crown has proven that the protection of the public is not sufficiently safeguarded by sentence for the substantive offence, but does require some additional protection involved in a sentence of preventive detention: Mulcahy v. Reg., supra; Reg. v. Rose, supra, to the extent of making that sentence expedient for the protection of the public.\nand at page 110 he quoted with approval the following passage in the reasons of Currie J.A. in Harnish v. The Queen[4]:\nThe real, essential principle of the preventive detention provisions of the Criminal Code, s. 660, and of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, ch. 59, is the protection of the public. It is not enough that the accused is merely anti-social, or is a nuisance, or that it is a convenience to the police to have a person removed to a penitentiary.\nIn R. v. Churchill[5], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at page 110:\nThe object of preventive detention is to protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history that they are a menace to society while they are at large.\nand at page 112:\nAs we have already said, when such sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has had no effect. It has become a matter of putting a man where he can no longer prey upon society even though his depredations may be of a comparatively small character, as in the case of habitual sneak thieves. In considering the decisions in England it must always be borne in mind that the maximum sentence of preventive detention which can be imposed there is fourteen years and that, as stated by Lord Goddard on the page last referred to, in the great majority of cases which had come before that Court the sentence passed had been one of eight years. In Canada if the sentence is passed at all it must decree imprisonment for the remainder of the prisoner\u2019s life subject to the possibility of his being allowed out on licence if so determined by the parole authorities, a licence which may be revoked without the intervention of any judicial tribunal.\nSince his convictions in 1959, the appellant has been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in 1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, which involved comparatively trifling sums, he has been sentenced to severe punishment; there is some evidence of his trying to live a normal life; he is now 35 years of age. While I cannot say, in the words used by Currie J.A., that he is merely a nuisance I am not satisfied that his release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will, to use the words of Lord Goddard, constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the public renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in custody. Any doubt that I feel in this case arises from the fact that I am differing from the learned Magistrate and the majority in the Court of Appeal. In a case in which the consequences of an adverse decision are so final and so disastrous for the man concerned I think that doubts should be resolved in his favour.\nFor the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that I would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would have done unless the view suggested by some members of the Court, although neither put forward nor supported by either counsel, compels us to hold that we are without jurisdiction.\nThe suggestion, as I understand it, is that the reasons of Ritchie J. speaking for a majority of the Court in The Queen v. MacDonald[6], bind us to hold that, unless we can say that the finding of the Courts below that the appellant is an habitual criminal should be set aside, we are without jurisdiction to interfere with the imposition of the sentence of preventive detention.\nWhen a question is raised as to the jurisdiction of this Court it is well to look first at the provisions of the Statute which confer the jurisdiction which the parties seek to invoke; in the case at bar these are contained in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act which reads:\n41.(1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\n(2) Leave to appeal under this section may be granted during the period fixed by section 64 or within thirty days thereafter or within such further extended time as the Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after the expiry of the said thirty days fix or allow.\n(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.\n(4) Whenever the Supreme Court has granted leave to appeal the Supreme Court or a judge may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, extend the time within which the appeal may be allowed.\nOn the plain meaning of the words of this section it seems clear that the Court has jurisdiction. The appeal is brought, pursuant to leave duly granted by this Court, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming the imposition by the learned magistrate of a sentence of preventive detention. This is a final judgment of the highest court of final resort in the province in which judgment can be had in this particular case. This Court is not deprived of jurisdiction by the terms of subs. 3 of s. 41 for the judgment of the Court of Appeal is not one acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or of an offence other than an indictable offence. The jurisprudence in this Court on this point is settled and has been applied consistently since the decisions in Brusch v. The Queen[7] and Parkes v. The Queen[8]. The contrary view is said to be founded, as mentioned above, on the reasons of my brother Ritchie, concurred in by a majority of the Court in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra. In approaching a consideration of that decision it is well to bear in mind the rule, often stated, that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides; vide Quinn v. Leatham[9], per Lord Halsbury at 506.\nWhile in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, I agreed with the conclusion of the majority that the appeal should be quashed it was for reasons differently expressed. The sole question relating to our jurisdiction which was raised for decision in that appeal was whether the Attorney\u2011General had a right of appeal to this Court from the order of a Court of Appeal expressly affirming a finding that an accused was an habitual criminal but deciding that the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon him should be set aside. No question arose as to the nature or extent of an accused\u2019s right of appeal.\nThe formal order of the Court of Appeal in that case read as follows:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the appeal of the above-named Appellant from the finding that the Appellant is an habitual criminal be and the same is hereby dismissed, the Appeal of the above-named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby allowed, the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him as aforesaid be and the same is hereby set aside, and pursuant to section 667 of the Criminal Code, a sentence of imprisonment in Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, British Columbia, for a term of one year be and the same is hereby imposed in respect of the said conviction by Magistrate L.H. Jackson entered on the 20th day of May 1964 on the above-described charge, such sentence to run from the 20th day of May, 1964.\nThis may be contrasted with the order of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar, the operative part of which reads:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE THAT the said Appeal of the above\u2011named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby dismissed;\nWith respect, I think that the formal order of the Court of Appeal in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, was improperly drawn. The Criminal Code gives no right of appeal from the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal. Such a finding unless followed by the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention is brutum fulmen. This is made plain by the reasons of Bird C.J.B.C. speaking for the Unanimous Court of Appeal in Regina v. MacNeill.[10] It is a misconception to regard the appeal given by s. 667(1) as raising two matters for decision. There is only one question to be answered, that is whether the sentence of preventive detention is to be sustained or set aside. It may be set aside for various reasons, for example (i) because the Crown has not satisfied the onus of proving that the appellant is an habitual criminal or (ii) because it has not satisfied the onus of proving that it is expedient for the protection of the public that a sentence of preventive detention be imposed or (iii) for both of these reasons or (iv) because of some technical defect or illegality in the proceedings; this list is not necessarily exhaustive. It appears to me to be a novel proposition that the answer to the question whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain and decide an appeal may depend on the reasons which it assigns for allowing or dismissing it.\nIn my view the present case is distinguishable from The Queen v. MacDonald, supra. In the case at bar the appeal to the Court of Appeal was and the appeal to this Court is simply from the imposition of the sentence, and this is as it should be for, as pointed out above, the only right of appeal given to a person sentenced to preventive detention is that set out in s. 667(1) of the Criminal Code:\n667.(1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.\nIt is a trite observation that an appeal is from the judgment pronounced in the Court appealed from and not from its reasons. It appears to me that the existence of our jurisdiction cannot depend upon the grounds upon which we think the sentence should be upheld or set aside. Our jurisdiction to set aside the sentence in the case at bar upon the grounds set out in the reasons of Bull J.A. could not be questioned; in my opinion, it would be consistent with neither principle nor authority to hold that we cease to have jurisdiction because, as it appears to me, the same result should be reached by a different line of reasoning. At the risk of appearing repetitious, I wish to emphasize that the answer to the question whether we have jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal sought to be brought before us depends on the subject matter of the appeal and on the terms of the Statute conferring jurisdiction. The question arises in limine and can and should be answered before we enter upon the merits of the appeal. Either we have or have not jurisdiction to decide the appeal; it is, in my view, a misconception to suggest that our jurisdiction, if we have it, can be lost because we would allow or dismiss the appeal for one reason rather than another. We have held often enough in dealing with the question whether an inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction that we cannot say it has jurisdiction to decide a question rightly but not to decide it wrongly.\nI have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the majority in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, does not bind us to say that we are without jurisdiction in the case at bar and I am satisfied that we have jurisdiction to deal with the appeal on the merits.\nI would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would have done, that is to say, I would allow the appeal, quash the sentence of preventive detention and restore the sentences imposed on the convictions of the four substantive offences.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice in which he has described the circumstances giving rise to the re-hearing of this appeal and concluded that this Court has jurisdiction to hear it and that is should be allowed, but I remain in agreement with the reasons for judgment rendered by Martland J. at the first hearing in which he says that:\nOnce the finding as to the status of the accused as an habitual criminal is not an issue, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against sentence.\nAs has been pointed out by the Chief Justice, if there be jurisdiction in this Court to hear an appeal from the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention, imposed \u201cin lieu of any other sentence that may be imposed\u201d for an indictable offence pursuant to the provisions of s. 660(1) of the Criminal Code, then that jurisdiction must be found in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act (hereinafter called \u201cthe Act\u201d), and it accordingly appears to me to be of first importance to consider the jurisprudence of this Court governing the interpretation of s. 41 in relation to appeals against sentence.\nThe first case in which it was contended that s. 41 of the Act gave the Court jurisdiction to consider an appeal against sentence was Goldhar v. The Queen[11], in which Mr. Justice Fauteux, after a detailed review of the provisions of the statute, concluded, at page 71 that:\nUnder the former Code, appeals against sentence have always been left to the final determination of the provincial courts and there is nothing, under the new Code or s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, indicating a change of policy in the matter, with respect to indictable offences.\nThe Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the present application which I would dismiss.\nThese reasons for judgment were reaffirmed in Paul v. The Queen[12], where Taschereau J. (as he then was) said:\nIt was held in Goldhar v. The Queen that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal Code, we could not find any authority in 41(1) to review the sentence imposed by the Courts below.\nIn that case it was stated by Fauteux J.:\n\u2026that in order to determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of indictable offence it was not permitted to look at s. 41(1) for authority to intervene but only to the Criminal Code which does not permit an appeal against sentence.\nThe effect of these decisions appears to me to have been accurately summarized by Mr. Justice Fauteux in rendering the judgment of the Court in The Queen v. Alepin Freres Ltee. et al[13], in which case the Crown had, with leave granted under s. 41, launched an appeal against the finding of the Court of Appeal on the question of whether the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench or the magistrate had jurisdiction to impose sentences, and after quoting ss. 41(1) and 41(3), Mr. Justice Fauteux went on to say:\nIt is clear from the terms of subsection (3) that, unless the judgment sought to be appealed is a judgment \u2018acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal\u2019 of either an indictable offence or an offence other than an indictable offence, there is no jurisdiction in this Court under that subsection to entertain this appeal. The judgment here sought to be appealed does not come within that description. It is not a judgment related to an acquittal or a conviction of an offence and, while an important question of jurisdiction is involved therein, this question does not relate to an acquittal or a conviction within the meaning of subsection (3) but to sentence. Neither can jurisdiction of this Court be found in subsection (1). The general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be held to be comprised in s. 41(1), with the consequence that this Court would have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of a nature similar to the one here considered, is ruled out by what was said by this Court in Golkar v. The Queen and Paul v. The Queen. It may be a matter of regret that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the important question which gave rise to conflicting opinions in the Court below, but strong as my views may be with respect to that question, I am clearly of opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\nThere is accordingly a clear line of authority which establishes that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal with respect to sentences for an indictable offence.\nIn the present case like the Chief Justice, I proceed on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, and that the sole question to be determined is whether an appeal lies to this Court from the determination made by the Court of first instance, in conformity with the provisions of s. 660(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, that \u201cThe Court is of the opinion that because the accused is a habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d.\nThe concept of imposing preventive detention in the case of habitual criminals was first introduced into our Criminal Code by Chapter 55 of the Statutes of Canada, 1947, which enacted sections 575A to 575H under the heading \u201cPART X(A) HABITUAL CRIMINALS\u201d, where it was provided that a statement that the accused was an habitual criminal was to be added to the indictment after the charge for the substantive offence and further provided that the offender should first be arraigned on the substantive offence and if found guilty the judge or jury were charged to inquire whether or not he was an habitual criminal. Section 575c (4) of the same statute provided, in part, that:\n(4) A person shall not be tried on a charge of being a habitual criminal unless\n(a) the Attorney General of the Province in which the accused is to be tried consents thereto; and (b) not less than seven days\u2019 notice has been given by the proper officer of the court by which the offender is to be tried and the notice to the offender shall specify the previous convictions and the other grounds upon which it is intended to found the charge.\nIt will thus be seen that in the 1947 statute the allegation that an offender was an habitual criminal was included in the indictment and was regarded as being in the nature of an additional charge. This is made clear by the case of The King v. Robinson[14] which was decided under the 1947 Code and is illustrative of the way in which s. 575c was applied by the Crown authorities. In that case, as Mr. Justice Fauteux said at page 523:\n\u2026Each of the respondents was separately indicted on two counts: one being that, at some definite time in 1950, in the province of British Columbia, he was found in unlawful possession of drugs, under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 as amended, and the second one charging him to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the provisions of Part X(A) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nThe appeal in the Robinson case, supra, raised a question of law as to the meaning to be attached to the provisions of s. 575c and the jurisdiction of this Court was not in question, the matter being treated in all respects and by all concerned as if it were an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence. This is no doubt explained by the fact that s. 575E of the Criminal Code at that time provided that:\nA person convicted and sentenced to preventive detention, may appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto.\nThe italics are my own.\nThis meant that the provisions of s. 1025 of the Code providing for an appeal to this Court from a conviction for an indictable offence were applicable to \u201ca person convicted and sentenced to preventive detention\u201d and accordingly that such an appeal would lie \u201con a question of law\u201d if leave to appeal were granted by a judge of this Court. That this is the meaning which was attached to s. 575E is made plain from a further excerpt from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Fauteux in the Robinson case, supra, at page 523 where he said:\n\u2026the judgment rests on the interpretation of the provisions of s. 575c 1(a) of Part X(A). On this point and under the authority of s. 1025 of the Criminal Code leave to appeal to this Court was granted to the appellant. The next \u201cHABITUAL CRIMINAL\u201d case heard in this Court was Brusch v. The Queen[15] which was also decided under the 1947 Code and where there was a dissenting judgment so that the appeal came here under s. 1023 of the Code which provided that:\nAny person convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed on appeal taken under s. 1013 may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been a dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nThe italics are my own.\nThe question of law with which the appeal was concerned was whether the \u201ccharge\u201d of being an habitual criminal was \u201ca charge of a criminal offence\u201d entitling the accused to make an election as to his mode of trial and the Court decided in the clearest terms that it was not such a charge and in so doing adopted the language of Lord Reading in Rex v. Hunter[16], where he said at page 74, speaking of s. 10 of the English Statute (The Prevention of Crimes Act, 1908, Ch. 59) upon which Part X(A) of the 1947 Code was based:\n\u2026that to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the statute is not a substantive offence, but is a state of circumstances affecting the prisoner which enables the court to pass a further or additional sentence to that which has been already imposed;\u2026\nAlthough it was clearly held in the Brusch case, supra, that \u201cthe charge\u201d of being an habitual criminal was not a charge for a criminal offence, it was nevertheless recognized that the penalty of preventive detention attached to the habitual criminal finding as distinct from the crime which was charged. As Mr. Justice Estey said at page 382:\nThroughout the proceeding the offence or crime charged is treated in every respect, even as to punishment, as separate and distinct from being a habitual criminal.\nThe italics are my own.\nThe Criminal Code was, however, revised by Chapter 51 of the Statutes of Canada 1953-54 by which the provisions of Part X(A) were recast and appeared as Part XXI under the general heading of \u201cPREVENTIVE DETENTION\u201d. The new statute adopted a completely different approach to the whole question and under the new Part XXI the practice of making \u201cthe charge\u201d of being an habitual criminal a part of the indictment was abolished and a procedure for making of \u201can application for preventive detention\u201d was substituted therefor. The new section 660(1) provided:\n660(1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in addition to a sentence for the offence of which he is convicted if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nIt is important also to notice the changes in the section providing for appeals. The new s. 667 provided that:\n667. (1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the sentence.\n(2) The Attorney General may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part.\n(3) The provisions of Part XVIII with respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis, to appeals under this section.\nThis is a far cry from the terms of the old s. 575E which, as I have said, provided that in appeals from convictions and sentence of preventive detention\n\u2026the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto\u2026\nUnder the new Code there was no provision for an appeal to this Court in habitual criminal cases and accordingly in Parkes v. The Queen[17], which was the next such case to come here, application for leave to appeal was not made under the Criminal Code but was made under s. 41 of the Act on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario finding the accused to be an habitual criminal was a final judgment of the highest Court of final resort in the Province within the meaning of s. 41(1) and that it was not a judgment affirming conviction of an indictable offence or indeed any offence. (See Brusch v. The Queen, supra).\nIn the Parkes case, supra, the application for leave to appeal was granted and the judgment granting leave was delivered by the present Chief Justice who, at page 135, cited the decision in Brusch v. The Queen, supra, as authority for the proposition\n\u2026that the \u2018charge\u2019 of being an habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence or crime but is merely an assertion of the existence of a status or condition in the accused which enables the Court to deal with the accused in a certain manner,\u2026\nand who then continued:\nIt follows from this that when His Honour Judge Grosch decided that the applicant was an habitual criminal he was not convicting him of an indictable offence but was deciding that his status or condition was that of an habitual criminal. It was this decision which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. That such a decision is a \u2018judgment\u2019 within the meaning of that word in s. 41(1) does not appear to me to admit of doubt. It is indeed a \u2018final judgment\u2019 under the definition contained in s. 2(b). It is a \u2018decision which determined in whole\u2026 a substantive right\u2026 in controversy in a judicial proceeding\u2019\u2014i.e., the right of an accused to his liberty at the conclusion of whatever sentence might be imposed for the substantive offence of theft of which he was convicted prior to the trial and adjudication of the question whether his status was that of an habitual criminal, or, alternatively, the right of the Crown to ask that he be sentenced to preventive detention.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn my respectful opinion, the \u201csubstantive right\u2026 in controversy\u201d in an appeal from a finding that the accused has the status of an habitual criminal is \u201cthe right of the Crown to ask that he be sentenced to preventive detention\u201d, because although such a sentence cannot be awarded unless the accused has been found to be an habitual criminal it by no means follows that the \u201chabitual criminal\u201d finding automatically carries with it a sentence of preventive detention. In order to fully understand what was decided on the motion for leave to appeal in the Parkes case, supra, it appears to me to be desirable to quote the last three paragraphs of the reasons for judgment where it was said:\nMr. Common\u2019s argument that for the purpose of determining whether or not a right of appeal is given the adjudication that the applicant is an habitual criminal should be treated as a conviction of an indictable offence cannot in my view be reconciled with the decision in Brusch v. The Queen, I conclude that we have jurisdiction to grant leave under s. 41(1).\nAs to the merits, it was intimated at the hearing that it was the view of the Court that leave should be granted if we have jurisdiction to grant it and accordingly counsel for the applicant was directed to confine his reply to the question of jurisdiction. I would accordingly grant leave to appeal, pursuant to the terms of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, from the affirmation by the Court of Appeal of the decision of His Honour Judge Grosch that the applicant is an habitual criminal.\nI have quoted at such length from this decision because it is the case which established the jurisdiction of this Court to hear appeals under s. 41 of the Act in habitual criminal cases, and because it limits the ground upon which leave was granted to the question of whether the accused had been properly found to have the status of an habitual criminal.\nThe Parkes case, supra, does not appear to me to afford any authority for the submission that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention in isolation from the finding as to status, although it might perhaps have been contended that, as the sentence under the 1953-54 Code was specified as being \u201cin addition to\u201d any sentence for the indictable offence, it was a sentence for being an habitual criminal and was therefore not a sentence for a criminal charge so that the reasoning in Goldhar v. The Queen, supra, did not apply to it.\nAny doubts in this latter regard have, however, been resolved by the enactment of s. 33(2) of Chapter 43 of the Statutes of Canada 1960-61 whereby s. 660 was amended so as to make it clear that the sentence of preventive detention is no longer to be treated as being \u201cin addition to the sentence for the substantive offence\u201d, but that it is in lieu of such sentence. The new section reads:\n660.(1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention.\n(3) At the hearing of an application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present. In the case of Gordon v. The Queen[18], Judson J. had occasion to comment on this section and said, at page 316:\n\u2026the only sentence of preventive detention which could be imposed in the circumstances of this case was one in lieu of the sentence that had been imposed.\nThe italics are my own.\nHad it not been for the decision on the application for leave to appeal in the Parkes case, supra, it would, I think, have been arguable that s. 660(1) (a) and (b) should be read together and that the section should be construed as dealing with sentence alone and raising no separate question of the finding as to status,, This would perhaps have been more in line with s. 667(1) which now provides that:\n667.(1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.\nThis section appears to treat the whole matter as being one of sentence, but in view of the Parkes decision and the decisions subsequently delivered in this Court concerning the habitual criminal finding, I do not think that our jurisdiction under s. 41 in appeals from the findings as to status can be questioned.\nI have read the habitual criminal cases which have come to this Court since the Parkes case and it appears to me that until the case of The Queen v. MacDonald[19], to which reference has been made by the Chief Justice, there was no case of an appeal against sentence when the question of the finding as to status was not in issue. In each case the appeal was treated as an appeal from the \u201chabitual criminal\u201d finding and was decided on that basis.\nIt is said, however, that the case of Mulcahy v. The Queen[20] was an exception and is to be treated as an appeal against the sentence of preventive detention simpliciter.\nIn the Mulcahy case, supra, Chief Justice Taschereau delivered the following oral judgment on behalf of this Court:\nWe are all of opinion that the appeal against the sentence of preventive detention should be allowed for the reasons given by MacQuarrie J. and that the record should be returned to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco to impose a sentence for the substantive offence of which the appellant was convicted.\nAny suggestion that this decision recognized the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal against a sentence of preventive detention as opposed to an appeal from a finding that the accused was an habitual criminal, must be considered in light of the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice MacQuarrie, which this Court adopted, in which he said:\nI would allow the appeal, quash the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the sentence that he be held in preventive detention and impose a sentence of three years\u2026 for the substantive offence.\nThe italics are my own.\nWith the greatest respect for those who hold a contrary view, I do not think that if the appeal presently before us is to be disposed of on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, it can at the same time be said that the Mulcahy case, supra, is an applicable authority because in that case the finding that the accused was an habitual criminal was quashed and it therefore followed that the question of whether it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the accused to preventive detention could not arise. The fact that Mr. Justice MacQuarrie expressed the view that the accused\u2019s record indicated to him that he was not the type of person of whom it could properly be said \u201cit is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d, is, in my view, with the greatest respect, beside the point because once the habitual criminal finding had been quashed, the matter of sentence was no longer in issue.\nThe grounds of appeal considered in this Court in the Mulcahy case, supra, are made apparent from a consideration of the notice of appeal and of the factum of the appellant. The notice of appeal set forth the following grounds:\n(1) That the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia In Banco erred in failing to hold that the Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was leading persistently a criminal life as required under Section 660(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. (2) That the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia In Banco erred in failing to hold that there was no evidence against the appellant to sustain a finding that the accused was leading persistently a criminal life as required by Section 660(2)(a).\n(3) That the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia In Banco erred in failing to hold that even although the Crown proved the accused was leading persistently a criminal life a sentence of preventive detention was not necessary or expedient for the protection of the public.\nThis Court, having found, as Mr. Justice MacQuarrie did, in favour of the appellant on the first two grounds, it followed that the appeal against the sentence of preventive detention must be allowed.\nIt has been suggested that the fact that leave to appeal to this Court was granted in the present case should have some controlling effect on the decision to be made, after having heard the appeal, with respect to our jurisdiction to entertain it. In this regard it does not appear to me to have been the practice of this Court on hearing an appeal to consider itself in any way affected in deciding the question of whether or not it has jurisdiction, by the fact that leave to appeal has been granted. The matter arose in the case of The Queen v. Warner[21], where leave had been granted and where the Chief Justice, in the course of his reasons for judgment in the appeal, said:\nWhile it was announced that we had jurisdiction, further consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court that such is not the case.\nOther illustrations which come to my mind are The Queen v. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e et al, supra, and The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, in both of which cases leave to appeal had been granted and the Court subsequently held that it had no jurisdiction.\nAs I have indicated, in my view the only reported case in this Court in which an appeal has been taken from a sentence of preventive detention when the finding as to the status of the accused was not an issue, is the case of The Queen v. MacDonald, and in that case the majority of the Court decided that there was no jurisdiction under s. 41 to entertain an appeal from a sentence of preventive detention alone. The majority opinion was there expressed in the following terms:\nThe sentence of preventive detention could only have been imposed on a man who had been found to have the status of an habitual criminal but it was the conviction of an indictable offence which afforded the occasion for its imposition and as this appeal is from the sentence and the finding as to status is not an issue it is in my opinion governed by the decision of this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen, supra.\nAs will be apparent from what I have said, I am unable to appreciate any distinction between the present case and the case of The Queen v. MacDonald in so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned.\nIn my opinion the question is a fundamental one because when such an appeal is taken against the sentence in isolation from the finding as to status, it is nothing more than an appeal from a sentence imposed \u201cin lieu\u201d of a sentence for an indictable offence and I can see no logical distinction between the case of a man who has been sentenced to imprisonment for life for manslaughter, in which case we would have no jurisdiction under the Goldhar case, supra, and those which followed it, and the case of a man sentenced to preventive detention.\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice and by Ritchie J. It is my intention to follow the course which both of my learned brethren have adopted and consider this appeal on the basis that the appellant has been properly found to be an habitual criminal. I am also ready to accept the view of the Chief Justice that it is not expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the accused to preventive detention and I adopt the reasons outlined by the Chief Justice for such conclusion.\nThis leaves, therefore, only the question of whether this Court has any jurisdiction to allow the appeal for the latter reason. It is, in my opinion, unnecessary to analyze the various decisions of this Court referred to in the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Ritchie J. They have performed that task most adequately and repetition would add nothing. I propose to approach the problem in a different way and to attempt to determine just what is the appeal which now comes before this Court.\nIn this case, the accused was convicted on August 10, 1965, on four charges as outlined by the Chief Justice in his reasons and was sentenced to terms of three years\u2019 imprisonment upon two of them and two years\u2019 imprisonment on the other two, all to run concurrently. By notice of application dated November 5, 1965, properly served upon the accused, the prosecutor gave to the accused notice that he was applying to have the accused found to be an habitual criminal and that, therefore, it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to protective detention.\nOn June 14, 1966, Magistrate Levey found that the accused was an habitual criminal and that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to protective detention, and, therefore, imposed a sentence of preventive detention upon the accused.\nBy notice of application for leave to appeal and notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, the accused appealed \u201cfrom the said finding (that he was an habitual criminal) and the said sentence (the sentence of preventive detention)\u201d and by a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on November 1, 1966:\nThe appeal of the above named appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him by Magistrate G.L. Levey at Vancouver, B.C., on the 14th June 1966\u2026\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the said appeal by the above named appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby dismissed.\nThe accused obtained leave to appeal to this Court and pursuant to such leave did appeal by notice of appeal dated January 27, 1967. That appeal purported to be \u201cfrom the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia made on the 1st day of November 1966 whereby it was adjudged that the appeal of the above named appellant from the judgment of Magistrate G.L. Levey made on the 14th of June 1966 finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and imposing the sentence of preventive detention was dismissed\u2026\u201d.\nAs has been said by the Chief Justice, this is an appeal for which leave was granted under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act and is not one which is barred by the provisions of subs. (3) of that section as it is not an appeal \u201cfrom the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence\u2026\u201d. Despite the appearance of being an appeal from a sentence of preventive detention, what the appeal consisted of in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and what, in my view, it consists of here, is an appeal from a decision which has resulted in the accused being sentenced to preventive detention. I say this despite the words of s. 667(1) of the Criminal Code which provides \u201ca person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact\u201d. However much those words may imply an ordinary appeal against sentence the matters considered in this case and in all the other cases in the provincial courts of appeal are not the matters considered in an ordinary appeal from sentence but on the other hand resemble the consideration of appeals from conviction. So in s. 583(b) of the Criminal Code:\n583. A person who is convicted by a trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal\n* * *\n(b) against the sentence passed by the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is one fixed by law.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nIn consideration of such appeals against sentence the court of appeal commences and should commence with the conviction and proceed to consider whether the form and length of sentence chosen by the trial court is appropriate to the particular circumstances of the case and the characteristics of the convicted person.\nThe task of the provincial Court of Appeal in considering an appeal under the provisions of s. 667 of the Criminal Code is quite different. There the Court must consider whether each element of the finding of the Court hearing the application is supportable. Those elements are as follows:\n(a) the conviction of an indictable offence, i.e., the substantive offence;\n(b) that the accused is an habitual criminal in that he has since attaining the age of 18 years on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more, and that he is leading a persistently criminal life;\n(c) that because the accused is an habitual criminal it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nIf the Court hearing the application found that each of these three prerequisites was satisfied then the Court hearing the application may impose a sentence of preventive detention. The Court hearing the application had no alternative but to impose such sentence of preventive detention or refuse to do so. The court hearing the application, for instance, could not have imposed a sentence of eight years rather than the 2 or 3 years given for the substantive offences. It is an example of a sentence fixed by law in the words of s. 583(b) of the Criminal Code. So the provincial Court of Appeal when considering the appeal from the sentence of preventive detention must consider the same three questions which I have recited above. The provincial Court of Appeal must find affirmatively as to these three questions before it may affirm the sentence of preventive detention.\nIn my view, the leave to appeal to this Court, which was properly granted by this Court, brings forward for consideration the same three matters and it is the right and the duty of this Court acting within its jurisdiction as granted by s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to consider all three matters. In doing so, this Court is not going beyond its jurisdiction as limited by the series of cases such as Goldstar v. The Queen[22], Paul v. The Queen[23] and The Queen v. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e, et al.[24].\nIn each of these cases the Court refused to consider an appeal which concerned the propriety of a sentence imposed after a conviction. In the present case, it is proposed that this Court consider whether or not a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed upon the accused and determine that question upon its opinion as to whether he falls within the three categories in which it is necessary for him to fall before such sentence may be imposed.\nFor these reasons I concur with the opinion of the Chief Justice and would allow the appeal.\nPIGEON J.:\u2014Having had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice and by Ritchie and Spence JJ., I agree with the Chief Justice that, on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, it has not been shown that it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nOn the question of jurisdiction, all my brethren agree that this Court has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to hear appeals by special leave in the case of persons sentenced to preventive detention. The only difference of opinion is whether this jurisdiction is limited to a review of the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal in the same way as in appeals from indictable offences under the provisions of the Criminal Code, it is restricted to questions pertaining to conviction as opposed to sentence.\nAfter anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that no such restriction exists. The basis for the distinction in appeals under the Criminal Code is that its provisions for appeals to the Court of Appeal in ordinary cases contemplate separate and distinct rights of appeal against conviction and against sentence. (Sections 583, 584, 720, etc.). In the case of sentences of preventive detention passed upon habitual criminals, a single right of appeal is provided for embracing all grounds of law or fact or mixed law and fact (Section 667). This appeal is given against the sentence of preventive detention, not separately against the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal and the conclusion that it is expedient to sentence him to preventive detention. It does therefore contemplate a review of all the questions involved in passing this sentence, that is the question of whether this is expedient for the protection of the public as well as the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal. Seeing that no one doubts that s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act confers jurisdiction to hear appeals by special leave from the decision of the Court of Appeal in such cases, I can find no basis for deciding that this jurisdiction is limited to a consideration of a part only of the questions involved in the judgment appealed from.\nThe previous decisions of this Court concerning our jurisdiction over sentences of preventive detention are reviewed in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and of my brother Ritchie. I agree with the Chief Justice that in considering them one should bear in mind the rule, often stated, that \u201ca case is only an authority for what it actually decides\u201d. On that basis, I do not find that it was ever decided that our jurisdiction in dealing with appeals against sentences of preventive detention is limited to a review of the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal.\nFor those reasons, I concur in disposing of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed, FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: B.H.

Denison Mines Ltd., [1968] S.C.R. 441\nDate: 1968-04-01\nThe Stanward Corporation (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nStanrock Uranium Mines Limited (made a Party Appellant pursuant to Suggestion filed);\nand\nDenison Mines Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1968: February 7, 8; 1968: April 1.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Abbott, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMines and minerals\u2014Owner of mining claims purchasing additional claims\u2014Royalty agreement\u2014Subsequent amalgamation of purchaser with another company\u2014Ore mined from claims formerly belonging to other company\u2014Whether said claims \u201cadjacent\u201d to purchaser\u2019s original claims within meaning of that term as used in royalty agreement.\nThe plaintiff company brought an action to recover royalties claimed by it from D company in respect of uranium ore mined from certain claims pursuant to an agreement dated January 6, 1956. The plaintiff owned a block of 18 mining claims and the CM company owned a block of 14 claims lying immediately to the west of the plaintiff\u2019s block of claims. The CD company owned a block of 88 claims lying to the west of the CM claims. The distance between the most easterly claim of the CD block and the most westerly of the CM claims was approximately one-quarter of a mile.\nBy the agreement of January 6, 1956, the CM company purchased the plaintiff\u2019s 18 mining claims for $300,000 cash and 50,000 shares of CM stock. In addition, the agreement, contained a royalty clause the meaning of which was that no royalties were to be paid on the first 4,000,000 tons of ore mined from the claims covered by the agreement (i.e., the combined 32 claims and \u201cany other claims which [CM] may acquire adjacent\u201d to its original 14 claims), and that a $1 a ton royalty attached only to the next 750,000 tons mined.\nBy agreement dated January 4, 1960, CD and CM agreed to amalgamate under the provisions of The Corporations Act, 1953 (Ont.), c. 19, and to continue as D company. Up to the date of the amalgamation 1,996,856 tons of ore were mined by CM from the CM block of claims and the plaintiff\u2019s block of claims, and after the amalgamation and up to the date of the issue of the writ, February 14, 1962, no further ore was mined from those blocks of claims. Up to the date of the writ, 3,790,870 tons of ore were mined by D from the block of claims which, prior to the amalgamation, belonged to CD and by August 5, 1961, the combined production by CM before amalgamation and by D thereafter had reached a total of 4,750,000 tons. The ore mined after the amalgamation was taken from only 21 of the claims previously owned by CD and of these 21 claims the one which was closest to any of the CM claims was separated from it by a distance of approximately one and a quarter miles.\nThe basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was that the claims in the CD block were adjacent to the CM claims and were acquired by CM within the meaning of the royalty agreement. The trial judge dismissed the action and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. An appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the defence that the CD claims were not adjacent to the CM claims within the meaning of that term as used in the royalty agreement, the appellant\u2019s argument that the question to be decided was not whether the 21 claims from which the ore was actually mined were adjacent to the CM claims but rather whether the whole block of 88 claims should be regarded as so adjacent was rejected.\nThe Court agreed, as did the Court of Appeal, with the conclusion of the trial judge that the CD claims from which the ore was mined were not adjacent to those set out in the royalty agreement and also with his reasons for reaching that conclusion.

Mayor, etc., of the Borough of Lower Hutt, [1904] A.C. 773, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Gale C.J.H.C, now C.J.O., whereby an action for royalties on ore mined from certain claims was dismissed. Appeal dismissed.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., and J.R. Houston, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., and J.D. Arnup, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Gale C.J.H.C., as he then was, whereby the action of the appellant The Stanward Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \u201cStanward\u201d, was dismissed with costs.\nThe facts are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of Gale C.J.H.C. and a comparatively brief summary will be sufficient to indicate the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nThe action was brought by Stanward to recover royalties in the amount of $750,000 claimed by it from Denison Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDenison\u201d, in respect of uranium ore mined from claims in the Blind River area of the Province of Ontario pursuant to an agreement under seal in the form of a letter dated January 6, 1956, from Stanward, then named Stancan Uranium Corporation, addressed to and accepted by Can-Met Explorations Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cCan-Met\u201d.\nPrior to the execution of this royalty agreement, Stancan owned a block of eighteen mining claims in the Blind River area and Can-Met owned a block of fourteen claims lying immediately to the west of the Stancan block of claims. Another company, Consolidated Denison Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cConsolidated Denison\u201d, owned a block of eighty-eight claims lying to the west of the Can-Met claims. The distance between the most easterly claim of the Consolidated Denison block and the most westerly of the Can-Met claims was approximately one-quarter of a mile.\nAll of the three blocks of claims mentioned above lie in part under the waters of Quirke Lake and the same ore body extends through the Consolidated Denison block into the northerly part of the Can-Met and Stancan blocks.\nOn June 13, 1956, Can-Met entered into a contract with Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, hereinafter called \u201cEldorado\u201d, a Crown corporation, for the sale of 7,350,000 pounds of uranium oxide. This contract was referred to as the \u201cInitial Contract\u201d. By the agreement of January 6, 1956, referred to above, Can-Met purchased the appellant\u2019s eighteen mining claims for $300,000 cash and 50,000 shares of Can-Met stock. It is admitted that this cash was paid and the stock issued. There was a further consideration set out in para. 3 of the agreement, which read as follows:\n3. You \u2018(Can-Met)\u2019 shall pay us a royalty equal to $1.00 per ton on each ton of ore mined from the ground covered by any of the claims listed in paragraph numbered 1 above, (the plaintiff\u2019s eighteen claims) or any of the claims listed below in this paragraph 3; provided that such royalties shall not exceed $750,000 in the aggregate; and provided further that such royalties shall not be payable until 4,000,000 tons of ore shall be mined from such claims, or until you shall have fulfilled deliveries of concentrates under your anticipated initial contract with Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, whichever shall occur sooner:\nS.67832\u201467843, inclusive,\nS.82986,\nS.82987,\nor any other claims which you may acquire adjacent thereto.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim rests on the allegation that more than 4,000,000 tons of ore have been mined from the claims referred to in this royalty agreement. It is common ground that the meaning of the royalty clause was that no royalties were to be paid on the first 4,000,000 tons of ore mined from the claims covered by the agreement, and that the $1 a ton royalty attached only to the next 750,000 tons mined.\nBy agreement dated January 4, 1960, Consolidated Denison and Can-Met agreed to amalgamate, under the provisions of The Corporations Act, 1953 (Ont.), c. 19, under the name of Denison Mines Limited.\nIt is agreed that up to the date of the amalgamation 1,996,856 tons of ore had been mined by Can-Met from the Can-Met block of claims and the Stancan block of claims, that after the amalgamation and up to the date of the issue of the writ no further ore was mined from those blocks of claims and that all the rest of the ore required to fulfill the Initial Contract with Eldorado was mined from the block of claims which, before the amalgamation, belonged to Consolidated Denison. It is also agreed that up to February 14, 1962, the date of the issue of the writ, 3,790,870 tons of ore were mined by Denison from the block of claims which, prior to that amalgamation, belonged to Consolidated Denison and that by August 5, 1961, the combined production by Can-Met before amalgamation and by Denison thereafter had reached a total of 4,750,000 tons.\nThe basis of the appellant\u2019s claim is that the claims in the Consolidated Denison block were adjacent to the Can-Met claims and were acquired by Can-Met within the meaning of the royalty agreement.\nThe claim was resisted on three grounds:\n1. That the Consolidated Denison claims were not acquired either by Can-Met or by Denison within the meaning of that term as used in the royalty agreement;\n2. That the claims from which the ore was mined following the amalgamation were not adjacent to the claims referred to in the royalty agreement within the meaning of that term as used in the agreement;\n3. That even if the appellant was otherwise entitled to succeed on its claim, it had lost its right because prior to the amalgamation Can-Met made a proposal in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Act and Stanward failed to prove its claim in that proceeding although it had notice thereof.\nGale C.J.H.C. was of opinion that the eighty-eight Consolidated Denison claims were acquired by Can-Met or by Denison within the meaning of that term as used in the royalty agreement but that the claims from which the ore was mined were not adjacent to the Can\u2011Met claims and consequently he found it unnecessary to deal with the defence founded on the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Kelly J.A. who held that the Consolidated Denison claims were not acquired by either Can-Met or Denison and that on this ground the action failed. He also expressed his complete agreement with the reasons and conclusion of the learned trial Judge as to the claims from which the ore was mined not being adjacent to the Can-Met claims. Consequently he also refrained from dealing with the defence under the Bankruptcy Act.\nI find it necessary to deal only with the defence that the Consolidated Denison claims were not adjacent to the Can-Met claims within the meaning of that term as used in the royalty agreement. As already mentioned, the most easterly of the Consolidated Denison claims was separated by approximately one-quarter of a mile from the most westerly of the Can-Met claims. The ore mined after the amalgamation was taken from only twenty-one of the claims previously owned by Consolidated Denison and of these twenty-one claims the one which was closest to any of the Can-Met claims was separated from it by a distance of approximately one and a quarter miles.\nIt was urged for the appellant that the question to be decided on this branch of the matter was not whether the twenty-one claims from which the ore was actually mined were adjacent to the Can-Met claims but rather whether the whole block of eighty-eight claims should be regarded as so adjacent. Gale C.J.H.C. rejected this argument and in my opinion rightly so.\nI find myself, as did the Court of Appeal, in full agreement with the conclusion of Gale C.J.H.C. that the Consolidated Denison claims from which the ore was mined were not adjacent to those set out in the royalty agreement and also with his reasons for reaching that conclusion.\nIf I had been doubtful in the matter it would still have been my opinion that no sufficient ground has been shown to enable us to differ from the conclusion of Gale C.J.H.C. confirmed, as it has been, by the Court of Appeal. It appears to me that a passage in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Mayor, etc., of the City of Wellington v. Mayor, etc., of the Burrough of Lower Hutt[3] is apposite. That case turned on the meaning of the word \u201cadjacent\u201d as used in a statute. After stating that the word is not one to which a precise and uniform meaning is attached by ordinary usage and that it is entirely a question of circumstances what degree of proximity would justify the application of the word, Sir Arthur Wilson, at p. 776, continued:\n. . . It is enough for the decision of this appeal to say that their Lordships could not properly advise His Majesty to interfere with the decision appealed against unless they were clearly satisfied that the view of the majority of the learned judges as to the meaning of the section and its application to the present case was wrong, and they are far from being so satisfied.\nThis applies a fortiori when, as in the case at bar, the Courts below have been unanimous. I do not find it necessary to have resort to the maxim, Verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem (Co. Litt. 36 a), but it does appear that the royalty agreement was prepared by the advisers of the appellant.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, Appellant: Cassels, Brock, Des Brisay, Guthrie & Genest, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Fraser, Beatty, Tucker, McIntosh & Stewart, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 2 O.R. 585, 57 D.L.R.

The purpose was to make the information arising from the survey available to the public, in the hope and expectation that it would lead to development of the area and thus increase traffic over the transportation system. In the computation of the respondent\u2019s income for the years 1960, 1961 and 1962, the Minister refused to allow the deduction of the moneys paid for the survey on the ground that these expenditures were outlays \u201cof capital\u201d or payments \u201con account of capital\u201d within the meaning of s. 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.

Berlis, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, pronounced by the learned President of the Court, on March 16, 1966, whereby he allowed an appeal by respondent from assessments made under the Income Tax Act, for the 1960, 1961 and 1962 taxation years. The circumstances giving rise to the question to be determined in this appeal can be summarized as follows: In July 1960, respondent, in order to improve its transportation business, arranged, with Franc. R. Joubin & Associates Mining Geologists Limited,\u2014hereafter referred to as the Joubin company,\u2014for a broad general geological survey, over a period of five years, of the mineral possibilities of a section of the unpopulated land through which respondent\u2019s railway ran in the province of Ontario, and which is, essentially, either crown land or respondent\u2019s property. This arrangement was made with the declared intention of making the information arising from the survey available to interested members of the public, in the hope and expectation that it would lead to development of the area (possible mines, secondary industry, etc.) that would produce traffic for respondent\u2019s transportation system. Consequent to this arrangement, the amounts admittedly paid by respondent to the Joubin company are $43,603.40 in respect of 1960, $85,189.06 in respect of 1961 and $138,369.41 in respect of 1962. The question is whether these amounts are deductible in computing respondent\u2019s profits from its business for those respective years. More precisely, the issue is whether, as contended for by appellant and successfully disputed by respondent, in the Court below, these expenditures are outlays \u201cof capital\u201d or payments \u201con account of capital\u201d, within the meaning of those expressions in s. 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act and, as such, not deductible in computing the profits of the respondent\u2019s business.\nParliament did not define the expressions \u201coutlay\u2026 of capital\u201d or \u201cpayment on account of capital\u201d. There being no statutory criterion, the application or non-application of these expressions to any particular expenditures must depend upon the facts of the particular case. We do not think that any single test applies in making that determination and agree with the view expressed, in a recent decision of the Privy Council, B.P. Australia Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia[2], by Lord Pearce. In referring to the matter of determining whether an expenditure was of a capital or an income nature, he said, at p. 264:\nThe solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer.\nThe learned President, after considering all the facts in the present case, decided that the expenditures in issue were not of a capital nature within the provisions of s. 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act. We agree with his conclusion. Hence, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

He elected trial by judge and jury and the magistrate proceeded with a preliminary inquiry. After the Crown had adduced much of its evidence, the accused, through his counsel, addressed the Court and requested permission to re-elect to be tried by the magistrate, indicating that he wished to plead guilty to the charge. The magistrate assented to the request and the accused pleaded guilty. After further evidence was taken as to the circumstances of the offence charged, the accused was sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment. An appeal both as to conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, one member of the Court dissenting. An appeal was then brought to this Court and the submission was made that the magistrate, once he had proceeded with the preliminary inquiry after the election by the accused against summary trial, had no jurisdiction to entertain a re-election and then proceed to convict the accused and sentence him.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.

Grymek et al., [1968] S.C.R. 452\nDate: 1968-04-01\nArnold Alkok (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nIssie Grymek and Yetta Grymek (Defendants) Respondents.\n1967: December 15, 18; 1968: April 1.\nPresent: Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Building contract providing for payment by instalments upon architect\u2019s certificate\u2014Breach of term requiring builder to satisfy architect that subcontracts had been paid\u2014Contract terminated by owners\u2014Builder not in breach of term going to root of contract\u2014Damages\u2014Quantum meruit.\nThe plaintiff, a building contractor, entered into a contract in writing with the defendants to build a house for $57,500. It was provided that the defendants were to \u201cmake payment on account thereof upon the architect\u2019s certificate (when the architect is satisfied that the payments due to subcontractors have been made)\u201d according to a schedule set out in the contract. The plaintiff proceeded with the contract and the defendants paid the first two instalments and one-half of the third, which amounts totalled $22,000, without requiring that the plaintiff satisfy the architect that the payments to the subcontractors had been made. Later when the plaintiff pressed for payment of the balance of the third instalment, the defendants required the plaintiff to comply with the provisions of the contract and to so satisfy the architect. After several conferences, the plaintiff failed to so satisfy the architect and in addition there were complaints from the defendants and the architect that there were defects in the construction and that the construction was delayed. Although the plaintiff was willing and anxious to continue the work, the defendants terminated the contract and engaged others to complete the building.\nIn an action brought by the plaintiff under the provisions of The Mechanics Lien Act, the Master dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim and allowed a counterclaim by the defendants in the amount of $6,075. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal in part, finding that the plaintiff was entitled to a lien and personal judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,125 and dismissing the counterclaim of the defendants. The plaintiff further appealed to this Court and the defendants cross-appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the Court below that the defendants had not shown sufficient grounds to support their termination of the contract. The plaintiff was not in breach of a term going to the root of the contract. While it was true that he was in breach of the term requiring him to satisfy the defendants\u2019 architect that the subcontracts had been paid this was a mere ancillary term which could be enforced perfectly by the defendants simply refusing to make payments until they were satisfied, as indeed the defendants were refusing. As to the additional alleged breaches, i.e., defective work and delay, the Master had found that these defects were minor, easily rectified and certainly not such as to go to the root of the contract, and that despite any delay the contract could have been completed substantially at the time completion was required by its provisions. These findings were accepted by the Court of Appeal.\nOn the matter of damages, the contractor\u2019s right to recover was what he could prove on a quantum meruit basis. Accepting that the plaintiff was entitled to the balance of the third draw and the whole of the fourth draw, less certain deductions, the Court found that the quantum meruit claim proved was $11,042.50. Adding thereto $2,495 for repair of storm damage and $950 for extras supplied at the request of the defendants, but deducting therefrom liens in the amount of $2,320 paid by the defendants, the total amount due to the plaintiff was $12,167.50. The defendants, however, were entitled to claim a reduction for the cost of correcting the defects in the work done by the plaintiff, such amount to be determined upon a reference to the Master.\nNorthern Lumber Mills Ltd. v. Rice (1917), 41 O.L.R. 201, referred to.\nAPPEAL by plaintiff and CROSS-APPEAL by defendants from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], varying a report of D.W. Rose, Q.C., Master, in a mechanics\u2019 lien action. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed. C.E. Woollcombe, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD.I. Bristow, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] pronounced on February 21, 1966.\nThe Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario had tried this mechanics\u2019 lien action pursuant to a judgment of reference made by Morand J. on October 4, 1963. By his report made on June 24, 1964, the learned Master had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim for lien and had allowed a counterclaim by the defendants in the amount of $6,075.\nBy the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario this was varied to allow the plaintiff (there appellant) a lien on the premises owned by the defendants in the sum of $1,125 together with the costs of the action and dismissing the counterclaim of the defendants-respondents.\nThe plaintiff as appellant in the Court of Appeal further appealed to this Court and the defendants cross-appealed.\nThe appellant is a contractor in the City of Toronto. He entered into a contract with the respondents dated May 14, 1956, whereby he agreed to\n(a) provide all the materials and perform all the work shown on the drawings and described in the specifications entitled \u201cproposed residence for Mr. I. Grymek\u201d which have been signed in duplicate by both the parties and which was prepared by Edward I. Richmond, M.R.A.I.C., acting as and hereinafter entitled \u201cthe architect\u201d and\n(b) do and fulfill everything indicated by this Agreement, the Specifications, and the Drawings.\nThe contract provided that the owner would pay to the contractor $57,500 and\n(b) Make payment on account thereof upon the Architect\u2019s certificate (when the Architect is satisfied that payments due to Sub-Contractors have been made), as follows:\ni) Upon completion of the sub-floor $6,000.00;\nii) Upon completion of the roof $12,000.00;\niii) Upon completion of the brown coat of plaster $8,000.00;\niv) Upon completion of the white coat of plaster, including all plumbing and electrical work $12,000.00;\nv) Upon completion of trim $8,000.00;\nvi) the sum of ELEVEN THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($11,500.00) . . . The appellant commenced work of erecting the house in accordance with the said contract and from time to time the respondents required the addition of certain extras which the appellant added and which the Court of Appeal for Ontario found were of the value of $950. The respondents paid to the appellant the whole of the first two instalments of $6,000 and $12,000 respectively, and one-half of the third instalment, i.e., $4,000, and did so without requiring that the appellant comply with the provisions of para, (b) aforesaid by satisfying the architect that the payments due to the subcontractors had been made.\nLater when the appellant pressed for the payment of the balance of the third instalment, the respondents required the appellant to comply with the provisions of the contract and to so satisfy the architect. After several conferences, the appellant failed to so satisfy the architect and in addition there were complaints from the respondents and from their architect Mr. Richmond that there were defects in the construction and that the construction was delayed. The solicitor for the respondents who had drafted the original contract and who had been present at the various conferences when an attempt was made to satisfy the architect that the subcontractors had been paid, wrote to the appellant on November 10, 1956, complaining of the progress of the work and of certain defects expressing the fear that mechanics\u2019 liens would be registered against the property and concluded with this paragraph:\nUnless all of the building infractions, which are your responsibility, have been remedied, and the work carried on at a proper pace, my clients shall have no alternative than to employ their own specific trades to complete your portion of the uncompleted work, and any moneys or expenses incurred by my clients in employing tradesmen for either work done or materials supplied shall be deducted from the contract price herein.\nSix days later, on November 16, 1956, the said solicitor wrote again to the appellants in which he said:\nFurther to the above matter, in confirming my conversation with you yesterday, I hereby advise you on behalf of my clients Issie Grymek and Yetta Grymek that they are terminating their contract with you as of todays date.\nThey intend to complete the lands and premises in the manner in which they believe the work should be done.\nIn accordance with that letter the appellant ceased work on the contract though Mr. Richmond, the architect for the respondents, has testified that the appellant was willing and anxious to continue it. The respondents proceeded to complete the building themselves through the intervention of other contractors and material men.\nIt was the view of the learned Master that the respondents were entitled to terminate the contract at the time and in the fashion aforesaid.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario, however, came to the conclusion that sufficient grounds for the termination of the contract had not been established. McGillivray J.A., in his reasons for judgment, quoted Anson\u2019s Law of Contract, 21st ed., at p. 424, as follows:\nThe question to be answered in all these cases of incomplete performance is one of fact; the answer must depend on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of each case. The question assumes one of two forms\u2014Does the failure of performance amount in effect to a renunciation on his part who makes default? Does it go so far to the root of the contract as to entitle the other to say, \u201cI have lost all that I cared to obtain under this contract; further performance cannot make good the prior default\u201d?\nThat proposition needs no support by citation from judgments and I accept it as expressing the proper test which the Court must apply here. As pointed out by McGillivray J.A., in his reasons, the contract as between the parties was for the contractor to build a house and for the defendants to pay for it. The contractor had proceeded with the building although not in accordance with the pace which the owners believed he should be proceeding and had been guilty of what the Court of Appeal for Ontario has found were certain minor defects in construction. The owners having paid two instalments and part of the third were refusing to pay the balance of the third instalment or those which would become due thereafter, and in so doing were relying upon the provision of the contract which required the appellant as contractor to satisfy the respondents\u2019 architect that the payments to the subcontractors had been made. They were entitled to require that the appellant continue his work upon the contract and to refuse to pay him until he did satisfy that provision. If the appellant had refused to proceed on that basis then, of course, he would have been in breach of the provision of the contract going to the root thereof and the respondents would have been entitled to terminate the contract. The appellant did not indicate by word or conduct an intention to so act or not to be bound in every way by the contract. The appellant, therefore, did not give to the respondents the opportunity to terminate the contract on the ground that the appellant had been in breach of a term going to the root of it. It was true that he was in breach of the term requiring him to satisfy the respondents\u2019 architect that the subcontracts had been paid, but, with respect, I agree with McGillivray J.A.\u2019s view that this was a mere ancillary term which could be enforced perfectly by the respondents simply refusing to make payments until they were satisfied, as indeed the respondents were refusing. I am, therefore, in accord with the view of McGillivray J.A., that the respondents have not shown sufficient grounds to support their termination of the contract.\nI should point out that while I have referred only to the alleged breach by the appellant in his failure to satisfy the architect as to payment of subcontractors, there were two additional breaches alleged: firstly, defective work, and secondly, delay. The learned Master found that the defects were minor, easily rectified and certainly not such as to go to the root of the contract, and that despite any delay the contract could have been completed substantially at the time completion was required by its provisions. The Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted these findings and they seem to be based on the evidence of Mr. Richmond, the architect called as a witness by the respondents, who testified as follows:\nQ. Are you saying that what you saw in November could not have been finished on the inside by the middle of February of the following year?\nA. It would be pretty close to it, if the builder would, say, have 3 or 4 groups on the job, and carried his work along at a reasonable pace. I would say about the latter part of February and he could have gotten out of there.\nThe contract between the parties provided in para. 4:\nInterior to be completed no later than February 15, 1957, so that owner can take possession thereof.\nOnce it is determined that the respondents\u2019 action in terminating the contract had not been justified, one must turn, to the question of what, if any, damages the appellant is entitled to recover. It was said in Macklem & Bristow on Mechanics\u2019 Liens in Canada, at p. 47:\nIf the owner ceases to make payments under the contract, cancels it or, through some act of his own and without cause, makes it impossible for the contractor to complete then the contractor is justified in abandoning the work and is entitled at that time to enforce his claim for lien to the extent of the actual value of the work performed and materials supplied up until that time.\nThe contractor\u2019s right to recover therefore would seem to be what he could prove on a quantum meruit basis. In the present case, the Court of Appeal for Ontario was of the opinion that the plaintiff had quite failed to prove any quantum meruit basis. The plaintiff had attempted this by two alternative methods: firstly, the plaintiff proved the total amount due under the contract, i.e., $57,500, and agreed to the deduction therefrom of the amounts already paid on account, i.e., $22,000; the amounts which the respondents were required to pay in satisfying certain mechanics\u2019 liens registered against the property, and also the amount which he, the plaintiff, testified would have been required to complete the building, i.e., $18,195.\nAs I have said, the defendants (here respondents) did proceed to complete the building at a cost of $48,231.21. Deducting therefrom the sum of $1,400 for an air conditioning unit which the Master found was not included in the original cost, the defendants\u2019 costs of completion, therefore, were $46,882.31. The learned Master found on the evidence of Mr. Richmond that those costs had represented about 15 per cent more than would have been required by an efficient builder and therefore, found that the proper cost of completion was $39,850.31. There is such a gross discrepancy between the plaintiff\u2019s estimated cost of completion and the defendants\u2019 actual cost of completion that neither the learned Master nor the Court of Appeal could place any reliance upon that method of proof. It should be noted in addition that this method fails to adduce the evidence necessary to establish a quantum meruit claim. The use in the calculation of the final contract price must include an element for a contractor\u2019s profit and what the plaintiff would be entitled to upon a quantum meruit proof in a mechanics\u2019 lien action is a payment for the work and materials provided up to the time of the termination not such a profit as he might have contemplated making had the contract been completed: The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 233, s. 5.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s second method of calculation was this. The plaintiff alleged that at the time the contract had been terminated he had completed all the work which entitled him to the third draw, of which he had been paid only one-half, and substantially all the work which would have entitled him to the fourth draw. It was his submission that these draws were calculated to keep pace with the construction and that therefore the completion of the work which would entitle the plaintiff to demand the payment of the instalment would automatically demonstrate the proportion of the work which had been completed, and would, therefore, prove the amount of the quantum meruit to which, subject to adjustments, the plaintiff would be entitled. On this basis, the appellant submitted to the Court of Appeal and to this Court that it should be entitled to the balance of the third draw of $4,000, the whole of the fourth draw of $12,000 less deductions to which he agreed to submit in the following amounts:\nBalance of plumbing........................................\n$2,262.50\nBalance of electrical work...............................\n800.00\nRepairs to plaster.............................................\n910.00\nIn Northern Lumber Mills Ltd. v. Rice[3], an action was brought under the provisions of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act as here to enforce a lien for the material supplied for the erection of a house. The price of those materials was to be paid for in three payments. Before the action, the first two had become payable but the third had not. Meredith C.J.C.P. said at p. 202:\nA cause of action arose upon default in payment of each of these instalments; and so, apart from the provisions of the enactment, the action would have been properly brought as to the first two, but improperly as to the third\u2026\nThe Court held that the action under the provisions of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act was not premature as to any of the three instalments.\nAt the trial, there was produced in cross-examination of Mr. Richmond, called as witness for the defendants, a statement which he had drawn up in preparation of an answer to the evidence of the plaintiff (here appellant) as to the costs of completion, and the appellant is submitting to the deductions in the amounts set out by Mr. Richmond in his statement items 16, 17 and 18, i.e.,\n16\u2014Plumbing...................................................\n$2,262.50\n17\u2014Plastering.................................................\n910.00\n18\u2014Electrical...................................................\n800.00\nMr. Richmond was cross-examined on these various items as well as all the others in the said statement. It is true that also to be completed before the plaintiff was entitled to the fourth draw were, of course, roofs, and Mr. Richmond had deducted that $228 for repair of roofs. He admitted, however, that if the roofs were in need of repair then, of course, the roofing contractor who had supplied the roofs only a short time before under guarantee should have been approached and required to make good his guarantee and that he had not done so.\nAs to item 16, Mr. Richmond testified that when the plaintiff left the job the rough plumbing was all done and that it represented about 50 per cent of the plumbing contract.\nAs to electrical work, about 65 per cent had been done at the time the plaintiff left the job.\nAs to plastering, all the white plaster had been completed but it was necessary to repair some. As I have pointed out, the appellant has accepted Mr. Richmond\u2019s amounts of these three items. The appellant, however, has not agreed to any deduction for heating. Heating, of course, would have had to have been installed before the white plaster was put on and that white plaster was required by the terms of the contract to have been completed before the fourth instalment was due.\nMr. Richmond in his statement gave a figure of $2,385 as being the amount necessary to complete the heating, but he agreed in his evidence that of that amount $1,400 was paid for an air conditioning unit not part of the original contract and he agreed also with the suggestion of counsel for the plaintiff at the trial that \u201ca little less than $1,000 was charged in respect of heating\u201d. Deducting the $1,400 from $2,385 one finds a balance of $985 and I am of the opinion that the appellant must also submit to a deduction of that sum. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the appellant has proved a quantum meruit as follows:\nBalance of third draw.............................\n$ 4,000.00\nFourth draw.............................................\n12,000.00\n$ 16,000.00\nDeduct:\nHeating...............................................\n$ 985.00\nBalance plumbing..............................\n2,262.50\n\u201cplaster................................\n910.00\n\u201celectrical............................\n800.00\n4,957.50\n$ 11,042.50\nTherefore, the quantum meruit claim proved was $11,042.50. In addition, the appellant is entitled to two amounts: Firstly, the amount of $2,495 for repair of storm damage, and secondly, $950 for extras supplied at the request of the respondents. The Court of Appeal found in favour of the appellant in both of these items and such a finding would seem to be in accordance with the evidence. The appellant admits that the respondents have paid mechanics\u2019 liens in the amount of $2,320 which sum must be deducted from any recovery of the appellant. Therefore, allowing to the appellant his quantum meruit proof of $11,042.50 and adding thereto the storm damage of $2,495 and the extras of $950 but deducting therefrom the liens paid by the respondents one reaches a total amount due to the appellant of $12,167.50.\nThis would appear to dispose of the issues in this appeal with one exception. As I have pointed out, the learned Master found that the defects in the work done by the appellant were minor and easily rectified, and McGillivray J.A., in the Court of Appeal adopted this finding. The respondents are, however, entitled to claim a reduction for the cost of correcting such defects. Therefore, I would allow the appeal and direct that the report of the Master be amended by the deletion of the sum of $1,125 appearing in the first paragraph of the report and replacing that sum with the sum of $12,167.50 unless within thirty days of the delivery of this judgment the respondents proceed with a reference before the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to determine the costs of the correction of the said minor defects. In that event the sum to be inserted should be the said $12,167.50 less the cost of correcting the defects found by the Master upon such reference. The cost of the reference should be determined by the Master in his report.\nThe appellant is entitled to the costs granted to him by the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to his costs in this Court.

The female in question was a policewoman and had no intention of using the drug. It was argued by the appellant that he could not have supplied the drug in question \u201cknowing\u201d that it was intended to be used to procure a miscarriage because in fact it was not intended that it be so used or employed. The appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and he was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 238 of the Code is directed against the supplying or procuring of poison or noxious things for the purpose of procuring abortion with the intention that they shall be so employed, and knowing that it is intended that they shall be so employed. The intention of any other person besides the accused himself that the poison or noxious thing should be used to procure a miscarriage is not necessary to constitute the offence. In the present case, the appellant intended that the substance procured by him should be used to procure a miscarriage. This case was therefore within the words of the statute.\nDroit criminel\u2014Vente d\u2019une drogue pour obtenir l\u2019avortement\u2014Est-ce que l\u2019intention d\u2019employer la drogue pour cette fin est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l\u2019infraction\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 238.\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de la tentative de commettre l\u2019infraction d\u2019ill\u00e9galement fournir une drogue sachant qu\u2019elle est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9e pour obtenir l\u2019avortement d\u2019une personne du sexe f\u00e9minin, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 238 du Code criminel.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal dismissed.\nS.J. Helman, Q.C., and R. Kambeitz, for the appellant.\nE.L. Collins, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1 affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction for attempting to commit the offence of unlawfully supplying a drug knowing that it was intended to be used to procure the miscarriage of a female person contrary to s. 238 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\nEvery one who unlawfully supplies or procures a drug or other noxious thing or an instrument or thing, knowing that it is intended to be used or employed to procure the miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\nLeave to appeal was granted to this Court under the provisions of s. 591(1) (b) of the Criminal Code on the following question of law, namely:\nWhether in the circumstances of the charge the Appellate Division erred in the interpretation of the words \u201cknowing that it is intended to be used or employed to procure the miscarriage of a female person\u201d, as those words are used in Section 238 of the Criminal Code.\nIn the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice McDermid on behalf of the Appellate Division, it was held that:\n\u2026if the person who supplied the drug believes that the person to whom he is supplying it intends to use it to procure a miscarriage that is sufficient for a conviction under the section. It does not matter that the person to whom the drug was supplied did not in fact intend to use it.\nThe appellant was charged as the result of a policeman and policewoman, dressed in civilian clothes, going to his drug store in Calgary where the policeman told the appellant that his girlfriend was pregnant and said: \u201cWe were wondering if we could get something to do something about it\u201d. The appellant then supplied them with a \u201cbean bag\u201d saying that that was what they needed and that it would cost $10.00. The \u201cbean bag\u201d consisted of 4 boxes of pills and a 2-ounce bottle of castor oil. Neither the policewoman nor any girlfriend of the policeman was pregnant and neither of them intended the pills to be used to procure a miscarriage.\nAt his trial before Chief Justice McLaurin, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that he could not have supplied the drug in question \u201cknowing\u201d that it was intended to be used to procure a miscarriage because it was not intended that it should be so used or employed. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the case of Reg. v. Hyland[2], where it was decided on an equal division of the Court that \u201cthe words \u2018intended to be used\u2019 must apply to the person supplied and not to the supplier\u201d and Madden C.J. said:\nWhatever difficulty there may be\u2026 arriving at a knowledge of what another really \u201cintends\u201d, it at least is possible; while the absurdity of asking a tribunal to be satisfied that a prisoner \u201cknew\u201d, as a thing intended to be done, what admittedly no one ever did intend, has only to be stated to be manifest.\nThe Hyland case runs contrary to a line of authority starting with the case of Reg. v. Hillman[3], where Erle C.J., speaking of s. 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which was virtually the same as s. 238 of the Criminal Code, said:\nThe question is, whether or not the intention of any other person besides the defendant himself, that the poison or noxious thing should be used to procure a miscarriage, is necessary to constitute the offence charged under the 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, s. 59. We are all of opinion that that question must be answered in the negative. The statute is directed against the supplying or procuring of poison or noxious things for the purpose of procuring abortion with the intention that they shall be so employed, and knowing that it is intended that they shall be so employed. The defendant knew what his own intention was, and that was, that the substance procured by him should be employed with intent to procure miscarriage. The case is therefore within the words of the Act.\nThe Hillman case was followed seventeen years later in R. v. Titley[4], where Stephen J. rendered a decision which has been quoted at length and adopted by Mr. Justice McDermid in the reasons for judgment which he rendered on behalf of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the present case.\nNo Canadian case directly in point was cited to us and I have been unable to find one, but the authority of the Hillman and Titley cases is recognized by leading Canadian text writers (see Tremeear\u2019s Criminal Code, 6th ed., page 385, and Crankshaw\u2019s Criminal Code of Canada, 7th ed., pages 361 and 362). These cases also appear to have been widely followed in other parts of the Commonwealth as indicated by the case of R. v. Neil[5], which is a decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and Rex v. Noseworthy[6], a decision of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. The same reasoning appears to have been followed by the courts in South Africa; see R. v. Freestone[7].\nIn my view the reasoning of Erle C.J. in the Hillman case, supra, applies to the construction to be placed on s. 238 of the Criminal Code and I agree with the interpretation of that section adopted by the Appellate Division.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those expressed in the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice McDermid, I would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Helman, Fleming & Neve, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General of Alberta.\n[1] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 103, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 50.\n[2] (1898), 24 Vict.

The complainant, who was admittedly under 14 years of age, gave evidence that the offence was committed when the respondent took her, in company with another couple, to a room with twin beds in a motel. Each couple occupied one of the beds. The lights were turned out and the complainant says that the respondent lay on one of the beds with her for more than two hours during which time they had some drinks and were \u201cnecking\u201d, that he undid her clothes and had intercourse with her. The respondent admitted to \u201cnecking\u201d but denied that intercourse took place. The second couple confirmed most of complainant\u2019s story, but they were unable to say whether or not sexual intercourse had actually taken place. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the dismissal of the charge on the ground that the evidence of the other couple was incapable of being corroborative. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nThe corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime. It is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with it. In the present case, the evidence of the other couple was capable of being so construed. It was for the jury to say under all the circumstances whether or not that evidence in fact amounted to corroboration.\nDroit criminel\u2014Rapports sexuels avec fille de moins de 14 ans\u2014Y a-t-il corroboration du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 138(1).\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction d\u2019avoir eu des rapports sexuels avec une personne du sexe f\u00e9minin \u00e2g\u00e9e de moins de 14 ans, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 138(1) du Code criminel.

Appel accueilli. APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, affirming the respondent\u2019s acquittal. Appeal allowed.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ.R. White, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought at the instance of the Attorney General of British Columbia pursuant to s. 598 of the Criminal Code of Canada from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 (McFarlane J.A. dissenting) whereby that Court dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s appeal from the acquittal of the respondent before Mr. Justice Ruttan sitting with a jury on a charge of having sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 14 years contrary to s. 138(1) of the Criminal Code.\nThe complainant, who was under 14 years of age, gave evidence that the offence was committed when the respondent took her, in company with another couple, (Loreen Fischer and Malcolm Gagnon) to a twin-bedded room in a motel. Each couple occupied one of the beds. The lights were turned out and the complainant says that the respondent lay on one of the beds with her for more than two hours during which time they had some drinks and were \u201cnecking\u201d, he undid her blouse, loosened her brassiere and later a bedspread was pulled over them and he removed her slacks and panties and had intercourse with her.\nThe respondent admits going to the motel under the circumstances described by the complainant but says that as they lay on the bed they only \u201cstarted to neck a little bit\u201d, that the bedspread was not pulled over them, her brassiere was not loosened, her clothes were not removed and no intercourse took place. In fact, the respondent testified that the complainant had said she would do anything he wanted but that he replied \u201cThanks, no thanks\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get into any trouble.\u201d\nFischer and Gagnon confirmed the complainant\u2019s story as to the drinking and the fact that she and the respondent were lying \u201cnecking\u201d in the dark for more than two hours and Fischer confirmed the fact that the complainant\u2019s brassiere was loosened, but they were unable to say whether or not sexual intercourse had actually taken place between the respondent and the complainant.\nIn charging the jury, the learned trial judge read the provisions of s. 134 of the Criminal Code respecting the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant and proceeded to say that:\n\u2026evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed but also that the prisoner committed it.\nThe learned trial judge then went on to tell the jury, in effect, that the evidence of Fischer and Gagnon did not fall within the definition of corroboration that he had given to them, and was not capable of being treated as corroborative because they \u201cdid not know whether the act of intercourse was taking place, or not\u201d. The learned judge appears to have regarded this evidence as corroborative only of the fact that there was opportunity to commit the offence and he clearly thought it necessary, in order to comply with the requirements of s. 134 of the Criminal Code that the corroborative evidence should be direct evidence of the commission of the offence. He expressed this view to the jury saying:\nNow I must tell you, in looking at the evidence in this case I am unable to point to evidence that falls within the definition of corroboration that I have given to you. That is, evidence that is entirely separate from the girl\u2019s story of sexual intercourse. The other persons in the motel didn\u2019t confirm it. They didn\u2019t know whether the act of intercourse was taking place, or not.\nThe only ground of appeal contained in the Crown\u2019s notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was expressed in the allegation that:\nThe learned trial judge failed to charge the jury that the evidence of Loreen Fischer and Malcolm James Gagnon was capable of corroborating the evidence of the Complainant.\nThis is the question upon which Mr. Justice McFarlane differed from the majority of the Court of Appeal and to which this Court is therefore limited under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. In the course of his reasons for judgment dismissing the appeal, Mr. Justice Bull agreed with the learned trial judge that the evidence of the couple in the other bed at the motel did nothing more than corroborate the fact that there was opportunity for sexual intercourse which was not denied by anyone and that as it did not amount to direct evidence of the act having taken place, it was not capable of being corroborative. His conclusion was expressed in the following terms:\nIn the case at bar, I consider that the evidence of Miss Fischer and Gagnon could not possibly do more than support a mere opportunity for sexual intercourse, and that if it had been put to the jury as being capable of being corroborative of evidence of the commission of the crime alleged against the respondent, the jury would have been found wrong in making those corroborative inferences therefrom. The learned trial judge determined quite properly that the evidence was not so capable and hence it would have been an error to put it to the jury as being capable of being corroborative.\nIt is true that under certain circumstances corroboration of the existence of mere opportunity may be no corroboration at all, and in this regard the statement of Lord Reading made in the course of his reasons for judgment in Burbury v. Jackson[2] is often quoted. The Chief Justice there said:\n\u2026the question is whether where the parties by the nature of their employment have opportunity of intercourse that is of itself corroboration. In my opinion it is not\u2026 The evidence here shows nothing more than that it was possible to have committed the misconduct at the material date. That is not enough. The evidence must show that the misconduct was probable.\nIn the case of Rex v. Reardon[3], McRuer J.A. makes reference to the reasons for judgment of Lord Dunedin in Dawson v. M\u2019Kenzie[4] where, after saying that mere opportunity did not amount to corroboration, he went on to say:\n\u2026that the opportunity may be of such a character as to bring in an element of suspicion\u2026\nIn my view evidence of the circumstances described by the witnesses Fischer and Gagnon and admitted by the respondent in this case was a great deal more than evidence of mere opportunity and was capable of being con- strued as an account of preliminary activities calculated to culminate in the sexual intercourse which the complainant describes. Whether or not these circumstances amounted to corroboration of the complainant\u2019s whole story was a question which in my view should have been left to the jury.\nMr. Justice Norris, who agreed with Bull J.A. that the appeal should be dismissed, appears to have taken the view that because the evidence that the complainant and the respondent were lying on a bed in a darkened motel room \u201cnecking\u201d for more than two hours was not denied by the respondent, it was therefore irrelevant. The learned judge said:\nHere the incidental matter, the so-called \u201cnecking\u201d or love play was never in dispute. As it was not in issue, evidence of it was not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the offence with which the respondent was charged. As it must \u201cimplicate\u201d the respondent it must \u201cinvolve\u201d him in the offence. However reprehensible such action may seem, in the circumstances of this case and on a fair interpretation of a totality of the evidence of all the witnesses, it was an \u201cinnocent\u201d act irrelevant to the issue.\nThis paragraph seems to be based on the assumption that the respondent admitted all \u201cincidental matters\u201d by which I take it that the learned judge means everything except the actual commission of the offence. The fact of the matter is, however, that the respondent categorically denied that the complainant\u2019s brassiere was loosened at all or that he ever had a bedspread or anything else over him. This was vital evidence and the complainant\u2019s statement that her brassiere was loosened was corroborated by Fischer whereas both Fischer and Gagnon testified that the bedspread was pulled over the complainant and the respondent.\nIt also appears to me that Mr. Justice Norris proceeded on the assumption that none of the matters admitted by the respondent were \u201cin issue\u201d and that it followed that corroboration of them \u201cwas not \u2018material\u2019 to the offence with which the respondent was charged\u201d. In this regard I agree with Mr. Justice McFarlane who, in the course of his dissenting reason for judgment, adopted the views expressed by Curran L.J. in Regina v. Hodgett[5], where he said, at page 8:\n\u2026we know of no authority for restricting the requisite corroboration to the part or parts of the accomplice\u2019s testimony that the accused chooses to put in issue. On the contrary, admissions have for long been held corroborative and it is hard to see how this could be so if the argument under consideration were sound.\nIf any other authority be needed to support the latter proposition, it is to be found in the leading case of The King v. Baskerville[6], where the accused was charged with having committed acts of gross indecency with two boys and it was argued that as they were accomplices their evidence required corroboration. In the course of his reasons for judgment in that case, Lord Reading, after pointing out that letters from the accused to the boys had been put in evidence, went on to say:\nThe prisoner had admitted to the police that the boys had been at his flat, that he knew one as a page-boy at the Trocadero Restaurant, and that this boy had been to see him on several occasions with another boy, and the appellant suggested to the police that he belonged to a boys\u2019 club and, therefore, was entitled to invite any of the members to his place. The appellant was not a member of a boys\u2019 club. The appellant gave evidence at the trial and admitted that he had given money to the boys on various occasions, and that, on hearing a peculiar whistle outside his flat, he had gone downstairs to let the boys in. We entertained no doubt that this evidence afforded ample corroboration of the boys\u2019 testimony, even if we assumed that the corroboration required was corroboration \u201cin some material particular implicating the accused\u201d.\nI find myself in full agreement with the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice McFarlane and I would adopt the views which he expressed in the following paragraph:\nI think evidence which may be corroboration of the evidence of a female person in such a case is evidence which may, in law, be considered by the jury as evidence of a material particular implicating the accused in the commission of the crime alleged. A particular is material in this sense if it may, in the opinion of the jury, show or tend to show that the testimony of the female person that the offense was committed and committed by the accused is true, thus being relevant to the issue which the jury is called upon to decide. That issue in this case was simply whether or not there was an act of sexual intercourse. To be capable of being considered corroborative, evidence need not in itself prove the guilty act.\nThe last sentence of this paragraph is fully borne out by what was said in the following statement of Lord Reading in Rex v. Baskerville, supra:\nThe corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime. In my view, the evidence of Fischer and Gagnon was capable of being construed as circumstantial evidence of the respondent\u2019s connection with the crime of which he was charged. It was for the jury to say under all the circumstances whether or not it in fact amounted to corroboration.\nFor all these reasons I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of the jury and direct that a new trial should be had.\nAppeal allowed and new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Boyd, King and Toy, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.W.

The mortgagee (N) started foreclosure proceedings against the said property because of arrears, and judgment directing a reference was given on June 15, 1962. The report of the Local Master, issued on November 30, 1962, fixed the date for redemption at May 23, 1963. A did not redeem on or before that date and on June 17, 1963, N obtained a final order of foreclosure. The property was advertised for sale on June 28, July 3 and July 10. On August 6, 1963, N accepted an offer to purchase from one P and his wife, who were nominees for the respondent (D). The sale was to be completed on September 6, 1963. On that date, before the transaction was completed at the Registry Office, the Local Master made an order reopening the foreclosure on the following terms: (a) Payment in full on September 13, 1963, during banking hours. In default of such payment the application was to be dismissed, (b) That A provide a sufficient and appropriate bond, guarantee and indemnity to N in reference to any loss or claim which might arise against N as a result of the sale made of the property on August 6, 1963. The parties attended before the Local Master on September 13, 1963, when the mortgage account was fixed at $27,577.62. A certified cheque for $27,400 was delivered to N\u2019s solicitors and the balance of $177.62 was sent by letter dated September 16, 1963. No bond, however, was delivered.\nIn the meantime D had taken steps to set aside the order of the Local Master. On September 13, 1963, he took out a praecipe order to have himself made a party plaintiff in the action. On September 20, 1963, the Local Master set aside this praecipe order but made another order adding D as a party defendant. D then appealed. On October 16, 1963, Hughes J. set aside the order of the Local Master. After the time for appeal from the order of Hughes J. had expired, the firm of solicitors which had acted throughout for both N and D sent a cheque for $27,577.62 to A\u2019s solicitor. On November 9, 1963, N\u2019s sale to D was completed. Thereafter A made an application to extend the time for serving notice of appeal from the order of Hughes J., and such time for appeal was extended to December 17, 1963. The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal on January 23, 1964, and was unanimousry dismissed. The members of the Court agreed with the opinion of Hughes J. that the foreclosure should not have been reopened after the final order had been made where the mortgagor had made no serious effort to raise the money before the expiry of the time for redemption and that there were no special circumstances in the case that would require a Court of equity to interfere. The final order of foreclosure having been made, a sale had now been made to a bona fide purchaser who had paid his money.\nSubsequently, an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.: The review of this case before Hughes J. and the Court of Appeal was thorough and complete and in accordance with principle. There was no ground for interference by this Court.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: Had the purchaser (respondent) been a stranger to the whole transaction and represented independently throughout the appellant could not have advanced a sufficiently strong reason to persuade the Court to take the most unusual step of vacating the final order of foreclosure after the owner, by virtue of that final order of foreclosure, had made a bona fide sale to such third party. However, the purchaser, a former employee of the appellant, was no stranger and had chosen to employ the same firm of solicitors, who were acting for the mortgagee. The knowledge of the firm, in the circumstances, was the knowledge of both their clients, the mortgagee and the respondent.\nWhen the appeal proceeded before Hughes J., the order under appeal had been acted on by both parties\u2014by the mortgagor\u2019s payment of the exact amount required and the mortgagee\u2019s acceptance of that amount, and the mortgagee\u2019s demand for and definition of the indemnity bond required in that order. The respondent was so affected by the knowledge of these circumstances that he could not succeed in separating his position from that of the mortgagee.\n[Boulton v. Don & Danjorth Road Co. (1865), 1 Ch. Chrs. 335, applied.] APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Hughes J., reversing an order of the Local Master which conditionally set aside and vacated a final order of foreclosure and extended the time for redemption of a certain mortgage. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nSarkis Alexanian, appellant, in person.\nRoss A. Wilson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Martland, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This litigation results from the reopening of a final order of foreclosure by the Local Master at St. Catharines, Ontario. On October 16, 1963, on appeal to a judge of the High Court, this order was set aside by Hughes J. On January 23, 1964, the Court of Appeal1 dismissed the appeal from the order of Hughes J. Notice of appeal was given to this Court on March 3, 1964. The appeal came on for hearing in December of 1967 and January of this year. It is necessary to set out step by step what happened in this action.\nThe action was between William C. Nickerson, as mortgagee, and Sarkis Alexanian, as mortgagor, to foreclose a mortgage given by Alexanian to Nickerson. There was serious default under the mortgage. Judgment directing a reference was given on June 15, 1962. The report of the Local Master was issued on November 30, 1962. In December of 1962, the mortgagee paid the 1959 taxes to save the property from a tax sale. May 23, 1963, was the last day for redemption and on June 27, 1963, the final order of foreclosure was granted and it was registered a few days later. Alexanian had served notice, early in the action, as required by the Rules of Court, that he desired an opportunity to redeem. He was personally present on the reference before the Local Master and thus had knowledge of the amount found due on the mortgage and the last day for redemption.\nThe property was advertised for sale on June 28, 1963, and two subsequent days, one week apart. On August 6, 1963, Nickerson accepted an offer to purchase from William and Shirley Patriquin. These people were nominees for the respondent John Dolinski. The sale was to be completed on September 6, 1963. On that date, before the transaction was actually closed at the Registry Office, the Local Master made the order in question reopening the foreclosure on terms. The terms were:\n(a) Payment in full on Friday, September 13, 1963, during banking hours. In default of such payment the application was to be dismissed.\n(b) That Alexanian provide a sufficient and appropriate bond, guarantee and indemnity to the plaintiff in reference to any loss or claim which might arise against the plaintiff as a result of a certain sale made of this property to William and Shirley Patriquin.\nThe evidence is that these possible claims were twofold:\n(1) from the real estate agent who had brought in the offer for 5 per cent on the purchase price of $40,200\u2014$2,010; and\n(2) from the purchaser John Dolinski for approximately $1,000 for legal fees and costs in connection with a mortgage that he negotiated with the British Mortgage Company, and for his legal costs on the purchase.\nThe same firm of solicitors acted throughout for Nickerson and Dolinski. Originally, when Dolinski\u2019s offer was accepted, both Nickerson and he had the same interest in completing the sale. When the Local Master reopened the foreclosure on September 6, Nickerson took no strong stand. He was concerned with getting back his money and with the indemnity against the costs of the real estate agent and Dolinski. Dolinski, however, was interested in completing the sale.\nOn September 13, 1963, the parties attended before the Local Master when the mortgage account was fixed at $27,577.62. A certified cheque for $27,400 was delivered to Nickerson\u2019s solicitors and the balance of $177.62 was sent by letter dated September 16, 1963. Nothing turns on this and no one suggests that the sending of the balance of $177.62 on September 16 was not compliance with the Master\u2019s order as to payment in full by September 13. No bond, however, was ever delivered. I will come back to this matter later. Nickerson did not appeal against the Local Master\u2019s order.\nIn the meantime, Dolinski had taken steps to set aside the order of the Local Master. On September 13, 1963, he took out a praecipe order to have himself made a party plaintiff in the action. On September 20, 1963, the Local Master set aside this praecipe order but made another order adding Dolinski as a party defendant. Dolinski then appealed. On October 16, 1963, Mr. Justice Hughes set aside the order of the Local Master. On November 4, 1963, Messrs. Miller, Fullerton and Martin, solicitors for both Nickerson and Dolinski, sent a cheque for $27,577.62 to Harold M. Smith of Toronto. Mr. Smith was the solicitor who had negotiated for the money to enable Alexanian to redeem. He was acting for the new proposed lender and for Alexanian. The time for appeal from the order of Hughes J. had expired. On November 9, 1963, Nickerson\u2019s sale to Dolinski was closed, tax arrears for the years 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1963 were allowed to the purchaser. These amounted to approximately $8,000. Nickerson paid the real estate agent\u2019s commission of $2,010, and the Sheriff\u2019s costs of obtaining possession of the premises\u2014$1,847.97. On January 23, 1964, the Court of Appeal gave judgment dismissing the appeal from the order of Hughes J., and the notice of appeal to this Court followed on March 3, 1964. Then a period of almost four years elapsed before the appeal was heard.\nI wish to make it clear at this point that this delay was entirely the fault of the parties. It was Alexanian\u2019s duty, as appellant, to proceed with despatch according to the rules. The respondent had the right to move for dismissal for delay if Alexanian did not proceed with due despatch to complete the appeal. This action was not taken until some time in 1967. The result was that the appeal was then completed and heard.\nI will deal next with the terms of the contract of sale. The vendor, when he accepted the offer, had a final order of foreclosure. The price was $40,200, which, according to the real estate agent, was a good price at the time. Alexanian had different ideas of the value of the property but there is no evidence that could justify a Court in holding that this was a sale at an undervaluation. It realized in cash $32,274.44. The mortgage account at the time of closing was approximately $27,750. The surplus was approximately $4,500. From this has to be deducted the $2,010 payable to the real estate agent and the costs of obtaining possession. Mr. Justice Roach was right when he said in the Court of Appeal that there was, in fact, little or no surplus.\nIf this appeal is to succeed it must be on the ground that there was a redemption of this mortgage on September 13, 1963, pursuant to the Local Master\u2019s order. It is argued that there was such a redemption by the deposit of the two cheques in the trust account of Messrs. Miller, Fullerton and Martin, and the retention of the money in the trust account until November 4, 1963. There could be no redemption when the money was never turned over to Nickerson and when it was returned on November 4, 1963, to the solicitors for Alexanian, who were apparently glad to get it back although they did complain about a non-allowance of interest. Further, the requirement of the bond was never waived. Alexanian could not insist on an assignment of the mortgage to his nominee on the mere payment of the money. He had to produce this bond in addition. Alexanian made no attempt to comply with the order of the Local Master at this point.\nIt is suggested that the correspondence between the solicitors constitutes such a waiver. I now set out the correspondence in full and to me it is quite apparent that there was no such waiver:\nSeptember 16, 1963.\nMessrs.

Smith, in the sum of $177.62, in favour of your firm. This amount represents the balance due to the plaintiff, in accordance with the findings of the local Master on Friday last; the sum of $27,400.00 having been delivered to you at the time of the reference.\nIt is understood and agreed that you will hold the enclosed funds, together with the funds delivered at the time of the reference in escrow pending delivery to this office of duly executed documents assigning the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage and the judgment herein from the plaintiff to Caroline M. Stafford, of the Township of North York, Trustee.\nI understand further that from the funds delivered to you, you will pay off the claim of William C. Nickerson in full and will attend payment of the Sheriff\u2019s account and the fire insurance premium referred to in your Statement of Account dated September 13th.\nWhen delivering the required documents, will you also let me have the original order of His Honour Judge Darby dated September 6th.\nPlease let me also have a memorandum of your disbursements respecting the registration of the certificate of order re-opening the foreclosure proceedings and setting aside the final order of foreclosure and for any other disbursements you may have incurred on my behalf.\nYour courtesy in attending these matters on the writer\u2019s behalf is very much appreciated.\nYours very truly,\n(sgd) George E.

Bell Esq.,\nRe: Nickerson vs. Alexanian et al.\nDear Mr. Bell:\nI acknowledge and thank you for your letter of September 16th enclosing cheque in the sum of $177.62 representing the balance due to the Plaintiff in accordance with the findings of the Local Master at St. Catharines.\nWe agree that the total of the funds which you have delivered to us will be held in escrow pending delivery to you of the executed documents assigning the mortgage and judgment. These documents were prepared on Monday for execution by Mr. Nickerson but unfortunately due to the pressure of business the writer did not have them ready when Mr. Nickerson came into the office. Therefore we have made an appointment with Mr. Nickerson for this afternoon to have them executed and if he is able to get in in time to catch the afternoon mail we will forward them to you under separate cover.\nWe have obtained from the Registrar of the Supreme Court a Certificate of the original order made by the Local Master and will have it registered and return the duplicate original of the Certificate together with the original order to you.\nWe understand, of course, that out of the funds which were delivered to us we are to pay the Sheriff\u2019s account and the fire insurance premium.\nThere is one other matter which has not been mentioned and that is of course the bond to be provided to indemnify Mr. Nickerson against any claims which may be brought against him arising out of the agree- ment of purchase and sale which was entered into on August 6th, 1963. Would you please advise us as to what is proposed in this connection in accordance with the Judge\u2019s Order, and it seems to us that under the circumstances that if the bond is to be given by Alexanian it should be with at least two sureties. As far as I am able to estimate the total amount involved would be a maximum of $3,000.00 assuming that we were compelled to pay everybody in full. Please let me hear from you in connection with this as soon as possible.\nYours very truly,\nMILLER, FULLERTON & MARTIN,\nPer:\nFLM: id\n(F.L. Miller)\nNovember 4th, 1963.\nHarold M.

Bell Esq.\nRe: Nickerson vs. Alexanian et al.\nDear Sirs:\nWe enclose herewith our cheque in the sum of $27,577.62 being the funds which you paid to us pursuant to the Order made by His Honour Judge Darby. The other requirement of the said Order, namely that a bond be provided to indemnify Mr. Nickerson against any claims which may be brought against him arising out of the agreement of purchase and sale, was never complied with as referred to in our letter of September 18th and we therefore have no documents in that connection to return.\nThe Order of His Honour Judge Darby having been set aside and the time for appeal having expired we are returning the funds to you.\nYours very truly,\nMILLER, FULLERTON & MARTIN,\nPer:\n(F.L.

CATHARINES, Ontario.\nDear Sirs:\nRe: Alexanian\nThis will acknowledge your letter of November 13th.\nWhen you returned to me the money which I paid to you for an Assignment of your client\u2019s original mortgage on the property, you did not include the accrued interest. We feel that during the interval in question our client was entitled to the interest accruing on the mortgage, which I calculate at $245.88.\nUpon receipt of this amount, I will obtain the Discharge for which you ask.\nYours truly,\n(sgd) H.M. Smith\nHMS: cs\nThe suggestion of waiver arises from the following sentence in the letter of Messrs. Miller, Fullerton & Martin:\nTherefore we have made an appointment with Mr. Nickerson to have them executed and if he is able to get in in time to catch the afternoon mail, we will forward them to you under separate cover.\nLater in the letter the question of the bond was raised. The solicitors did not send the assignment of the mortgage; they did not turn over the money to their client. Dolinski was proceeding with his efforts to get himself joined in the action for the purpose of appeal. This was known to the other side. They appeared on the appeal to Hughes J. to oppose the appeal. Then after the time for appeal from the order of Hughes J. had expired, the money was returned and accepted.\nPart of the trouble arises from the action of the Local Master in reopening the foreclosure without first making Dolinski a party defendant. He had a right to be heard on the motion to reopen and to be joined in the action: Boulton v. Don & Danforth Road Co.[2]\nMessrs. Miller, Fullerton & Martin, solicitors for Nickerson, could not deliver an assignment of this mortgage without being assured of costs that Nickerson would have to meet amounting to nearly $3,000. They had the order of the Master requiring this and no waiver can be spelled out from the correspondence and the conduct of the parties. If they had delivered the assignment of the mortgage without the bond, they would undoubtedly have been liable to their client for the amount of his loss.\nIt was argued before us that if Hughes J. had known of the settlement of the mortgage account before the Local Master on September 13, 1963, and the delivery of the certified cheque for $27,400, and the subsequent delivery of the balance of $177.62, and the retention of these moneys until November 6, he would not have made the order that he did and reverse the Local Master. I do not agree with this submission for two reasons:\n(a) Hughes J. was not trying a theoretical question. The order of the Local Master directed payment in full \u201cby Friday, September 13, 1963, during banking hours\u201d and that on default the application be dismissed with costs to be taxed. If payment had not been made in full, there would have been nothing to litigate before Hughes J.\n(b) Both parties were represented on the motion before Hughes J., Dolinski by Mr. Fullerton and Alexanian by Mr. Bell, who was an associate of Harold M. Smith. It was he who had come to St. Catharines to attend the settlement of the account on September 13, 1963, and had personally delivered the certified cheque for $27,400.\nCounsel for Alexanian now submits that what happened on September 13 and 16 was payment of the mortgage and that he is now entitled to a vesting order vesting the property in Alexanian free and clear of the mortgage without further payment.\nI am therefore going to proceed on the assumption that Hughes J. knew that he was dealing with actualities and not theory and that there had been compliance with para. 3 of the Local Master\u2019s order. His reasons for judgment make it clear that he was of the opinion that in this case there had been an erroneous exercise of the Local Master\u2019s discretion in reopening this foreclosure. His opinion was that the foreclosure should not have been reopened after the final order had been made where the mortgagor had made no serious effort to raise the money before the expiry of the time for redemption and that there were no special circumstances in the case that would require a Court of equity to interfere.\nThe Court of Appeal was of the same opinion. Roach J.A. said:\nIn this case there is no evidence of what has been referred to in a number of decisions as intrigue between the mortgagee plaintiff and the purchaser. There is no evidence of any effort or scheme by the mortgagee to freeze out the appellant from this property and to acquire the appellant\u2019s equity if there was one. The attitude of the plaintiff mortgagee as disclosed in the material before us was not one in which he was attempting to overreach or take undue advantage of his position as a mortgagee. The mortgage was in arrears, taxes remained unpaid and the plaintiff mortgagee was required to pay some of those taxes in order to protect his mortgage interest. He offered to the mortgagor, who was then in possession, to accept the arrears of interest and the taxes which he, the mortgagee, had been required to pay, and enable the mortgagor to put the mortgage in good standing to that extent and permit him to remain in possession. The mortgagor did not comply with the offer that the mortgagee had thereby made.\nCertain dates are significant. The interim judgment of foreclosure was dated June 15, 1962, and fixed the date for redemption as May 23, 1963. The final order of foreclosure was dated June 17, 1963. Now it is pertinent to enquire, having regard to the factors that are important in deciding this case, what efforts, if any, the mortgagor made, prior to the final order of foreclosure, to put this mortgage in good standing. He did not have the cash, apparently, with which to do it. He said he did two things; one, he had a claim of some sort against an employee based on an allegation of fraud and the farthest he is willing to go, apparently, in the material presented to us, in so far as that claim is concerned, is to say that he was hopeful that he might be able to recover something on that claim and use the amount that he thereby recovered to put this mortgage in good standing. He did not at any time seek the assistance of the Court in recovering on that allegation of fraud against that unnamed employee.\n* * *\nThe final order of foreclosure having been made in the circumstances that I have only briefly outlined, we are not satisfied that there are any special circumstances that would require this Court as a Court of equity to interfere with the title acquired by Dolinski who in our opinion on the material before us was a bona fide purchaser who had not been guilty of any intrigue or conduct unworthy of a purchaser attempting to acquire a property in an open market. The equities, as it seems to us, are all in favour of the respondent. We agree with the Honourable Mr. Justice Hughes that the appellant did not show the diligence that was required of him in an effort, and I am now speaking particularly of the period before the final order of foreclosure was made, to obtain the money with which to redeem. The final order of foreclosure having been made, a sale has now been made to a bona fide purchaser who has paid his money.\nIn my respectful opinion the review of this case before Hughes J. and the Court of Appeal has been thorough and complete and in accordance with principle.\nI can see no ground for interference by this Court and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] pronounced on January 23, 1964, which dismissed the appeal from the judgment of Hughes J. pronounced on October 16, 1963. By the latter judgment, Hughes J. had allowed an appeal from the decision of the Local Master at St. Catharines of September 6, 1963. The Local Master had by that judgment conditionally set aside and vacated a final order of foreclosure dated June 17, 1963, and extended the time for redemption of the mortgage to September 13,1963.\nThe said final order of foreclosure although pronounced on June 17, 1963, is erroneously referred to in the said order of Hughes J. as having been dated June 24, 1963, which was the date of the certificate thereof and the registration of that certificate.\nThe appellant had entered into a mortgage with William Nickerson as mortgagee on November 28, 1956, in the principal sum of $20,000. This mortgage having fallen very considerably into arrears, the said William Nickerson as mortgagee issued a writ of foreclosure and obtained a judgment in the action oh June 15, 1962. That judgment in the ordinary form of mortgage action was for reference to the Local Master at St. Catharines. The report of the said Local Master at St. Catharines upon such reference was settled on November 30, 1962, and in that report the time for redemption was fixed as May 23, 1963. The mortgage was not redeemed on or before that date and no redeption had taken place thereafter so that the said William C. Nickerson as plaintiff in the mortgage action as I have said caused a final order of foreclosure to be issued on June 17, 1963. The said William C. Nickerson then proceeded to advertise the property for sale, advertisements being inserted in the St. Catharines Standard on June 28 and July 3 and 10, 1963. By this advertisement, the said William C. Nickerson called for sealed tenders for the sale of the mortgaged premises. The advertisement stated that further particulars might be obtained at the office of the solicitors who had acted for Mr. Nickerson in issuing the writ of foreclosure. One tender was received. The tenderers were William and Shirley Patriquin and the tender was for $40,200 of which sum $30,000 was to be paid by the vendor accepting a mortgage back. Mr. Nickerson refused this tender. Shortly thereafter, one Walker, a real estate agent in St. Catharines, delivered to Mr. Nickerson an offer to purchase in which the proposed purchasers, the same persons William and Shirley Patriquin, offered to purchase the premises in question at the same price of $40,200 payable $4,000 upon acceptance of the offer and the balance in cash on the closing date subject to normal adjustments. This offer dated July 30, 1963, was accepted by Mr. Nickerson on August 6, 1963, and in his acceptance in the usual form he agreed to pay to the said Walker a commission of 5 per cent on the sale price. The offer originally required the transaction to be closed on August 30, 1963, but Mr. Nickerson and the proposed purchasers agreed to postpone the date for closing of the sale to September 6, 1963.\nMr. Nickerson has sworn that he instructed Walker to change the date of the closing of the transaction to September 6, 1963, in order to give the appellant an opportunity to vacate the premises. The respondent John Dolinski, a former employee of the appellant in his rug business, has sworn that the said offer to purchase made by William and Shirley Patriquin and accepted by Mr. Nickerson was made by them as his undisclosed agents, and the respondent\u2019s solicitor Charles William Fullerton in his affidavit sworn on January 22, 1968, has deposed that the respondent and his wife Ruby Dolinski brought to him the said agreement of purchase and sale.\nOn September 3, 1963, that is, only three days before the sale from Mr. Nickerson to the respondent was to be carried out, the appellant served upon the solicitor for Mr. Nickerson a notice of motion returnable on September 6, 1963, for an order vacating the final order of foreclosure together with the appellant\u2019s affidavit sworn on said September 3, 1963.\nThe ground upon which the order was sought was that the appellant has been able to obtain mortgage financing in an amount sufficient to pay off all the encumbrances and that the proceeds of the mortgage were to be available on September 13, 1963. On September 6, 1963, the Local Master considered the appellant\u2019s application in the presence of counsel for the plaintiff, i.e., Mr. Nickerson, and for the appellant. The Local Master gave judgment that day setting aside the final order of foreclosure and extending the time for redemption to September 13, 1963. The Local Master gave reasons for this disposition in long and detailed form. It was quite evident that the Local Master had been informed of the offer to purchase by the Patriquins as agents for Dolinski accepted by Mr. Nickerson and that the transaction was to be closed on that same day. The Local Master said in part:\nI am advised by counsel for the respondent, that the sale which was to have been concluded has not, to this moment, as yet been concluded. I understand that a member of the same firm is also acting for the purchasers. I think, however, that this has no bearing on the matter, being a matter of choice. However, it is of interest, whether it is conceivable or not, that the counsel for the applicant produces an abstract from the Sheriff\u2019s Office showing that two people with the same names are also judgment creditors in the amount of over $1300 under a writ filed on January 27, 1963. Again this, of course, may not affect the purchasers1 ability to conclude this purchase.\nI do not know what particular rights or obligations the purchasers have otherwise acquired or assumed, but exercising my discretion, and distinguishing this case from those cited, namely, that there has been a very short time since the issue of the final order of foreclosure, that the defendant is still in possession, that he has his job and his home in the premises, that he appears to have made every effort and to have finally succeeded in obtaining sufficient funds to more than pay off and redeem his property, I shall make an order setting aside the final order of foreclosure and reopening the reference and fixing Friday, September 13 at 2:00 o\u2019clock to resume the reference. The applicant must be prepared to pay the plaintiff in full including all proper expenses, also including costs of $100 in connection with this application and to make other and suitable arrangements concerning the present circumstances having regard to whatever rights the purchasers may have as outlined in Marriott\u2019s textbook dealing with practice in mortgage actions in Ontario, second edition. I may say, however, in connection with this, it appears to me that the purchasers went into this transaction with their eyes wide open, undoubtedly Mr. Walker as their agent, no doubt explained to them the mortgage situation. In any event, the purchasers\u2019 solicitor knew of the mortgage situation and the knowledge of the solicitor must be imputed to the purchasers. The purchasers knew the mortgage had been but only recently foreclosed and it is hard to understand or believe that the purchasers would not have an accurate knowledge of the situation as it existed here. I also note there is a very substantial excess value alleged to be in the premises and there, for example, would appear to be no information as to the fact that the purchasers have even inspected the property as purchasers before making their offer.\nAs the Local Master points out, the solicitor for the respondent was throughout the partner of the solicitor for Mr. Nickerson and one must assume that the knowledge of one partner was the knowledge of both and the knowledge of each was the knowledge of the respective clients. Therefore, although the respondent Dolinski was not represented by counsel before the Local Master on September 6, 1963, his solicitor\u2019s partner was present and was arguing strongly against the vacating of the final order of foreclosure and any extension of time for redemption.\nThe respondent\u2019s solicitor in his affidavit sworn only two weeks later has deposed that:\nBefore I could register the deed to John Dolinski, I was advised by my office that the Vendor\u2019s solicitor had called and left a message that His Honour Thomas J. Darby had expressed the opinion that the deed to my client should not be registered if that had not already been done and that I was not to register the said deed if that was the case.\nThe formal order of the Master made on September 6, 1963, is in six paragraphs which I think should be repeated verbatim:\n1. IT IS ORDERED that the Final Order of Foreclosure made hereon and dated the 17th day of June, 1963, and the Certificate hereof issued on the 24th day of June, 1963, and registered in the Registry Office for the Registry Division of the County of Lincoln as No. 92958 be and the same are hereby vacated and set aside.\n2. AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the time for redemption in the action herein on behalf of the Defendant, Sarkis Alexanian, be and it is hereby extended to Friday, September 13th, 1963, during banking hours.\n3. AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Defendant, Sarkis Alexanian do pay in full the Claim of the plaintiff in the action on Friday, September 13th, 1963, during banking hours and that on default the application to be dismissed with costs to be taxed.\n4. AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Defendant Sarkis Alexanian and the Plaintiff William C. Nickerson or their counsel do attend on September 13th, 1963, at the hour of 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon before the Local Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at the Court House in the City of St. Catharines, in the County of Lincoln to determine the Plaintiff\u2019s claim.\n5. AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of this application be and they are hereby fixed at $100.00 and to be paid to the Plaintiff as part of the Plaintiff\u2019s account on the 13th day of September, 1963.\n6. AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Defendant, Sarkis Alexanian provide sufficient and appropriate bond guarantee and indemnity to the Plaintiff in reference to any loss of claim which may arise against the Plaintiff as a result of a certain sale made on this property to one William and Shirley Patriquin.\nThereafter, on September 13, 1963, the same solicitor for Mr. Nickerson, and the then solicitor for the appellant again attended the office of the Local Master and the mortgage account was settled at the sum of $27,577.62. The said solicitor for the appellant delivered at once to the solicitor for Mr. Nickerson a certified cheque payable to the solicitors\u2019 firm for $27,400. That cheque was dated September 13, 1963, and certified in Toronto on that day. It is quite evident that it was for an amount as closely as could be calculated beforehand to pay the mortgage account in full. As a matter of fact, it proved to be $177.62 too small an amount, and the then solicitor for the appellant promised to forward to the solicitor for Mr. Nickerson by mail the balance of the said moneys.\nBy a letter dated September 16, 1963, and addressed to the firm of solicitors who, as I have said, were then acting for both Mr. Nickerson and the respondent, the then solicitor for the appellant forwarded his firm cheque for $177.62. Paragraph 2 of that letter reads as follows:\nIt is understood and agreed that you will hold the enclosed funds, together with the funds delivered at the time of the reference in escrow pending delivery to this office of duly executed documents assigning the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage and the judgment herein from the plaintiff to Caroline M. Stafford, of the Township of North York, Trustee.\nThere was no mention in that letter of any bond as referred to in para. 6 of the Local Master\u2019s order quoted above.\nOn September 18, the said firm of solicitors who had received the letter of the 16th replied to the then solicitor for the appellant as follows:\nHarold M. Smith, Esq.,\nBarrister, etc.,\n80 Richmond St. West,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\nAttention: George E. Bell Esq.\nRe: Nickerson vs. Alexanian et al.\nDear Mr. Bell:\nI acknowledge and thank you for your letter of September 16th enclosing cheque in the sum of $177.62 representing the balance due to the Plaintiff in accordance with the findings of the Local Master at St. Catharines.\nWe agree that the total of the funds which you have delivered to us will be held in escrow pending delivery to you of the executed documents assigning the mortgage and judgment. These documents were prepared on Monday for execution by Mr. Nickerson but unfortunately due to the pressure of business the writer did not have them ready when Mr. Nickerson came into the office. Therefore we have made an appointment with Mr. Nickerson for this afternoon to have them executed and if he is able to get in in time to catch the afternoon mail we will forward them to you under separate cover. We have obtained from the Registrar of the Supreme Court a Certificate of the original order made by the Local Master and will have it registered and return the duplicate original of the Certificate together with the original order to you.\nWe understand, of course, that out of the funds which were delivered to us we are to pay the Sheriff\u2019s account and the fire insurance premium.\nThere is one other matter which has not been mentioned and that is of course the bond to be provided to indemnify Mr. Nickerson against any claims which may be brought against him arising out of the agreement of purchase and sale which was entered into on August 6th, 1963. Would you please advise us as to what is proposed in this connection in accordance with the Judge\u2019s Order, and it seems to us that under the circumstances that if the bond is to be given by Alexanian it should be with at least two sureties. As far as I am able to estimate the total amount involved would be a maximum of $3,000.00 assuming that we were compelled to pay everybody in full. Please let me hear from you in connection with this as soon as possible.\nYours very truly,\nMILLER, FULLERTON & MARTIN\nPer:\n(G.L. Miller)\nNo reply was received by the solicitors who had forwarded that letter. However, on September 13, 1963, that same firm of solicitors acting for the respondent had filed a praecipe for \u201can order pursuant to Rule 300 joining John Dolinski as party plaintiff\u201d and on the same day, the Local Registrar at St. Catharines acting on that praecipe made an order so adding the respondent as party plaintiff. On September 16, 1963, the respondent swore his affidavit in which he outlined the offer to purchase the premises to which I have referred and alleged that he had incurred certain liabilities in reference thereto.\nBy an order dated, in error, Friday, September 19, 1963, quite evidently made on Friday, September 20, 1963, the Local Master set aside the order of the Local Registrar adding the respondent as a party plaintiff and by another order of the same day designated the respondent as a party defendant.\nI find some significance in the fact that there was an affidavit by the then solicitor for the appellant sworn on September 17, 1963, served upon the solicitors for the respondent together with a notice of application to set aside the aforesaid praecipe order and then filed in which the then solicitor for the appellant swore in part \u201cpayment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim has been made in full to the solicitors for the plaintiff and the plaintiff has been ordered and authorized to assign the mortgage to Caroline M. Stafford of the Township of North York, and the solicitors for the said plaintiff William C. Nickerson have undertaken to deliver a duly executed assignment of mortgage and an assignment of judgment prepared in accordance with a direction and authorization received by them\u201d. This affidavit was before the Local Master when he made the two orders on September 20, and should have been available at the time of the subsequent consideration of that order on appeal.\nBy the notice of appeal dated September 13, 1963, John Dolinski as plaintiff (on that day and until September 20, 1963, he was a plaintiff in the action by virtue of the praecipe order which was vacated on the latter date) appealed to the presiding judge in chambers at Osgoode Hall from the order pronounced by the Local Master at St. Catharines vacating the final order of foreclosure and extending the time for redemption to September 13, 1963. This is quite evidently a notice of appeal from the Local Master\u2019s order of September 6 which has been set out above. That notice of appeal was served on the then solicitors for the appellant herein on September 13, 1963, and service was admitted. The said appeal was to be heard on September 17, 1963, but there is an endorsement that on that day it was adjourned for one week.\nBy virtue of Rule 514 of the Ontario Rules of Practice an appeal may be taken by \u201ca person affected by an order of the Master\u201d on notice served within four days and returnable within ten days after the decision complained of. The appeal came on for hearing before Hughes J. on September 24, 1963, and in his reasons the learned judge noted that he had extended the time for service of the notice of appeal to September 21 and the time for return of the motion to September 27.\nHughes J. reserved judgment and gave carefully detailed reasons therefor on October 16, 1963. By his order, Hughes J. allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Local Master made on September 6, 1963. The appellant here appealed from that order of Hughes J. and on January 23, 1964, the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed that appeal. Although, as I have pointed out, the fact of the payment on September 13, 1963, by the then solicitors for the appellant to the firm of solicitors here acting for both Mr. Nickerson and the respondent was known to the Local Master at St. Catharines and was referred to by him in his disposition of the application which came before him on September 20, there seems to have been no mention of these circumstances to the Court of Appeal when that Court considered the appeal from the order of Hughes J. Although the members of this Court sought enlightenment on that astounding circumstance, we received no explanation from any counsel. In my view, it is the important circumstance which must be considered on this appeal. As the argument developed in this Court, no real attack was made on the reasoning of Hughes J. on which he based his reversal of the order of the Local Master nor upon the reasoning of the Court of Appeal when that judgment was confirmed. Nor, in my opinion, could any criticism be made of those reasons.\nHad the purchaser been a stranger to the whole transaction and represented independently throughout then I am of the opinion that the appellant could not have advanced a sufficiently strong reason to persuade the Court to take the most unusual step of vacating the final order of foreclosure after the owner, by virtue of that final order of foreclosure, had made a bona fide sale to such third party. There may be circumstances in which a Court would not be justified in doing so on any circumstances which have been shown. The situation, however, is not that situation. As the appellant has sworn without contradiction, the respondent, the purchaser, was no stranger. Although he and his wife had been employees of the appellant and resulting from their employment there have been strenuous controversies as yet unsettled, the respondent chose not to reveal his identity until after he had made, through the use of an agent\u2019s name, first a tender and then when that was refused, an offer to purchase, and the latter had been accepted. The respondent chose to employ the same firm of solicitors who were acting for the mortgagee, Mr. Nickerson, and, as I have said, there can be no significance that one member of that firm conducted the business for Mr. Nickerson while another member of the firm conducted the business for the respondent, both doing so in the firm name. Under such circumstances, the knowledge of one member of the firm, as I have said, was the knowledge of the other, and the knowledge of the firm was the knowledge of both their clients, Mr. Nickerson and the respondent.\nThe Local Master made an order on September 6 which in exact terms required that the appellant \u201cdo pay in full the claim of the plaintiff in the action on Friday, September 13th, 1963, during banking hours\u2026\u201d and made a further order that the appellant and the plaintiff Nickerson or their counsel do attend on September 13 at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon before him to determine the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. When the parties acted on that order attending with their solicitors at that time and determining the exact amount due and then the appellant paying the exact amount in the fashion which I have outlined, both parties had complied with the order.\nIt is true that by para. 6 of the Master\u2019s order of September 6, 1963, \u201cit is further ordered that the defendant Sarkis Alexanian provide sufficient and appropriate bond guarantee and indemnity to the Plaintiff in reference to any loss or claim which may arise against the plaintiff as a result of a certain sale made on this property to one William and Shirley Patriquin\u201d, but the provision of that bond was not required to be made on September 13. The solicitor for Mr. Nickerson realized this and in his letter to the then solicitor for the appellant dated September 18, 1963, which I have quoted above, he undertook to forward the assignment of the mortgage and judgment required by the solicitor for the appellant so soon as his client Mr. Nickerson could attend him to execute the same, and then merely asked for a bond in the amount of $3,000 with two sureties, without in any way making it a term of the escrow upon which he had received the sums totalling $27,577.62. By that date the same firm of solicitors were proceeding as solicitors for the respondent Dolinski to appeal from the decision of the Local Master which had directed the payment and required the bond. The payment had been made and for the first time the amount and terms of the bond, previously never defined, were suggested by the solicitors for Mr. Nickerson.\nWhen the appeal proceeded before Hughes J., the order under appeal had been acted on by both parties\u2014by the appellant\u2019s payment of the exact amount required and the respondent\u2019s acceptance of that amount, and the respondent\u2019s demand for and definition of a bond required in that order.\nSubsequently, when the appellant was evicted from the premises, the appellant and his family resisted and as a result were charged with obstructing the peace officer. They were convicted and appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which Court composed of the same members who had dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal against the order of Hughes J., with this additional information, remarked:\nIn our opinion, in the circumstances as they then stood, Alexanian was entitled to resist the execution by the Sheriff and his assistants of the writ of possession on the strength of which the Sheriff and his assistants were purporting to act. It was as of that date a trespass upon the premises of Alexanian. It was more than a trespass, it was an effort to evict him from the mortgaged premises whereas of that date he was entitled to remain in peaceful possession he having paid the mortgage in full.\n(The italicizing is my own.) With that comment I agree.\nIf Hughes J. were aware of these most important circumstances, and the material is utterly silent upon the point nor is there any reference thereto in the learned judge\u2019s reasons, then he failed to appreciate that when he considered the appeal the order from which the appeal had been taken had already been acted upon by this appellant and by Mr. Nickerson. I am of the opinion that the respondent was so affected by the knowledge of these circumstances that he could not succeed in separating his position from that of Mr. Nickerson. Therefore, I would allow the appeal.\nThe problem which the Court then faces is to determine a proper disposition of the appeal.\nThe respondent went into possession of the premises. The Registrar\u2019s abstract shows that he placed thereon three mortgages, the first two of which have been discharged but the third of which in favour of a company known as Bentex Limited is for the principal amount of $40,000 and that he has subsequently conveyed the lands for $1 and other valuable consideration (the details of which have not been revealed) to one Anthony Benedek who is said without denial to be \u201cinterested in Bentex Limited\u201d. This mortgage to Bentex and the conveyance to Anthony Benedek were both dated and both registered long after the registration on September 19, 1966, of a certificate of the appellant\u2019s appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal and therefore such transactions as they represent must have been carried out with notice of this appeal.\nThe said notice of appeal to this Court was dated March 3, 1964. That appeal was not completed for a very long time and no proceeding was taken on behalf of the respondent to cause the appeal to be dismissed for want of prosecution until 1967. The appeal first came on for argument in this Court at the end of the term in 1967 and for the first occasion after the appeal from the learned Local Master to Hughes J. an application was made to introduce the evidence as to payment on September 13, 1963. The Court considered such application, permitted the introduction of that evidence, and evidence in reply thereto, and put the appeal over until the month of January 1968. When the appeal was called at that time, the Court permitted additional evidence in the form of affidavits to be filed by both parties and also permitted the filing of the correspondence between the said solicitor for the appellant and the solicitor for the respondent during the months of September and November 1963 which in the latter consisted of a letter from the solicitor for the respondent speaking therein as solicitors for Mr. Nickerson dated November 4, 1963, enclosing the solicitor\u2019s cheque for $27,577.62, \u201cbeing the funds which you paid to us pursuant to the order made by His Honour Judge Darby\u201d. The solicitor continued:\nThe other requirement of the said order, namely, that a bond be provided to indemnify Mr. Nickerson against any claims which may be brought against him arising out of the agreement of purchase and sale was never complied with as referred to in our letter of September 18th and we therefore have no documents in that connection to return\u2026\nThe order of His Honour Judge Darby having been set aside and the time for appeal having expired we are returning the funds to you.\nTo that letter, the then solicitor purporting to act for the appellant replied requesting interest on the said sum during the interval in which it was held by the solicitors for the respondent. In his affidavit, the said solicitor for the appellant has stated that he returned the sum to his client, that is, not the appellant but the proposed mortgagee.\nIt is, in my view, significant that the firm of solicitors acting for both Mr. Nickerson and for the respondent held these funds from September 13, 1963, to November 4, 1963, and only returned them after the time for appeal from the order of Hughes J. had expired. In other words, on one hand they were still acting under the order of the learned Local Master and on the other hand they were attempting to have that order vacated.\nUnder all of these circumstances, I am of the opinion that the reference must be continued. I can see no part that Mr. Nickerson should be required to play upon such reference. I am of the opinion that the respondent when he purchased from Mr. Nickerson with all the knowledge which must be attributed to him has simply stepped into the shoes of Mr. Nickerson and that therefore there must be an accounting between the appellant and the respondent proceeding from September 13, 1963, to the date of the reference, and that on the reference a new date of redemption must be set for the payment of the amount due on such reference. Upon the reference, of course, the respondent must be credited with any disbursements properly made in the acquiring and maintenance of the property including payments for such matters as taxes, and he must be debited with the rents received and other income from the property including some amount attributable to his own occupation. I would, therefore, so order.\nUnder the order of the Court of Appeal, the appellant is to pay the costs in that Court and the order of Hughes J. requiring the appellant to pay the costs of the appeal before him was confirmed. I believe that a proper disposition would be to leave those orders as to costs in effect but provide that the respondent should pay the costs of the appeal to this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O\u2019Driscoll, Kelly & McRae, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wilson, Miller, Fullerton, Wilson & Partington, St. Catharines.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 360, 42 D.L.R.

The purpose of this transaction was to acquire the 14 licences, which was the only means open to the appellant for expanding its business. These licences were to expire within a month but were ordinarily renewed annually. The agreement anticipated the renewal of the licences in the name of the purchaser; if this did not happen, the assets were to be reconveyed to the vendor. In its 1961 income tax return, the appellant allocated $72,000 of the purchase price to the licences and the balance to cars and equipment. It claimed a capital cost allowance on the ground that the $72,000 represented either automotive equipment within the meaning of Class 10, Schedule B of the Income Tax Regulations or a licence for a limited period in respect of property within the meaning of Class 14, Schedule B. The Minister contended that the $72,000 had not been paid for any depreciable property. The Exchequer Court ruled that the appellant was not entitled to capital cost allowance in respect of any part of the $72,000. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Exchequer Court rightly held that the appellant company was not entitled to capital cost allowance.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Allocation du co\u00fbt en capital\u2014Bien susceptible de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation\u2014Achat de 14 taxis licenci\u00e9s\u2014Le montant attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019achat des licences est-il un bien susceptible de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation comme repr\u00e9sentant une automobile ou une licence pour une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 11(1)(a)\u2014R\u00e8glements de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et c\u00e9dule B, classe 10 et classe 14.\nAu mois de janvier 1961, la compagnie de taxis appelante a achet\u00e9 d\u2019un concurrent 14 taxis licenci\u00e9s pour la somme de $104,664.04. Le but de l\u2019achat \u00e9tait d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les 14 licences, le seul moyen dont disposait l\u2019appelante pour agrandir son entreprise. Les licences devaient expirer dans un mois mais elles \u00e9taient ordinairement renouvel\u00e9es chaque ann\u00e9e.

Minister of National Revenue, [1968] S.C.R. 498\nDate: 1968-04-01\nInterprovincial Pipe Line Company Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1967: November 21, 22; 1968: April 1.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Calculation of foreign tax credit\u2014Sources of income\u2014Effect of 1960 amendments to Income Tax Act\u2014Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, Article XV\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 11(1)(c), 41, 139(1a), (1b).\nThe facts in this case are substantially the same as those in Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. v. M.N.R., [1959] S.C.R. 763, which dealt with the appellant\u2019s taxation years 1950 to 1954. The question again is how the calculation of the foreign tax deduction under s. 41 of the Income Tax Act is to be made and the result depends upon the effect to be given to the amendment to the Income Tax Act enacted in the year 1960. The appellant company\u2019s pipelines were connected by a pipe running through the United States which was owned and operated by a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary company. The appellant carried on no business there. All the capital needed for the construction of the pipeline was raised by the appellant largely through the issue of bonds and debentures in Canada. The appellant also financed the construction of the U.S. section of the line and took from its subsidiary interest bearing demand notes and bonds. In the years 1960 and 1961, the appellant received substantial amounts of interests on the bonds of its U.S. subsidiary, on which it paid a withholding tax of 15 per cent to the U.S. government. In computing its income, the appellant deducted the total amount of the tax paid to the United States. The Minister granted the appellant a much smaller foreign tax credit, ruling that the appellant\u2019s income from U.S. sources for the purposes of s. 41, was the net interest from the bonds of the U.S. subsidiary, i.e., the bond interest received less the interest paid on the money borrowed to acquire the bonds. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment, and the company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs decided by the Exchequer Court, the method followed by the Minister in computing the appellant\u2019s foreign tax credit was the correct one. The effect of s. 139(1a) and (1b) was to require that the total interest on borrowed money claimed by the appellant and allowed to it under s. 11(1) (c) of the Act as a deduction had to be broken up and related to the appellant\u2019s various sources of income.\nThe effect of Article XV of the Canada-U.S. Convention was to establish a mutual covenant to apply as between each country whatever foreign tax credit provision the respective domestic laws of each country may from time to time adopt. This covenant did not require any alteration in the appellant\u2019s rights as determined by the interaction of ss. 41 and 139(1a) and (1b) of the Income Tax Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Calcul du d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement pour imp\u00f4t \u00e9tranger\u2014Sources du revenu\u2014Effet des amendements de 1960 \u00e0 la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Convention entre le Canada et les Etats-Unis, Article XV\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 11(1)(c), 41, 139(1a), (1b).\nLes faits dans cette cause sont substantiellement les m\u00eames que dans la cause Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. v. M.N.R., [1959] R.C.S. 763, qui a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 1950 \u00e0 1954 de la compagnie appelante. La question est de savoir comment doit se faire le d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement pour imp\u00f4t \u00e9tranger sous l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9pend de l\u2019effet que l\u2019on doit donner \u00e0 un amendement de 1960 \u00e0 la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Les pipelines de la compagnie appelante sont reli\u00e9s par un pipe-line traversant les \u00c9tats-Unis et qui est poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et exploit\u00e9 par une corporation filiale am\u00e9ricaine enti\u00e8rement poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante. Cette derni\u00e8re ne fait pas affaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis. La compagnie appelante s\u2019est procur\u00e9 le capital n\u00e9cessaire pour la construction du pipe-line en grande partie au moyen d\u2019obligations et de d\u00e9bentures \u00e9mises au Canada. Elle a aussi fourni les fonds n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la construction de la section am\u00e9ricaine et en retour a re\u00e7u de sa filiale des billets promissoires et des obligations portant int\u00e9r\u00eat. En 1960 et en 1961, la compagnie appelante a re\u00e7u des montants substantiels d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les obligations de sa filiale am\u00e9ricaine, et a pay\u00e9 sur ce montant une taxe de 15 pour-cent au gouvernement am\u00e9ricain. Dans le calcul de son revenu, l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9duit le montant total des taxes pay\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Le Ministre a permis un d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement pour imp\u00f4t \u00e9tranger beaucoup moindre, statuant que le revenu de l\u2019appelante provenant des sources am\u00e9ricaines pour les fins de l\u2019art. 41 \u00e9tait l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat net provenant des obligations de la filiale am\u00e9ricaine, i.e., l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat provenant des obligations moins l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat encouru dans le pr\u00eat d\u2019argent pour l\u2019acquisition des obligations. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a maintenu la cotisation du Ministre, et la compagnie en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nTel que d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, le Ministre a employ\u00e9 la bonne m\u00e9thode pour calculer le d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement pour imp\u00f4t \u00e9tranger de l\u2019appelante. L\u2019article 139(1a) et (1b) a pour effet d\u2019exiger que le montant total de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur l\u2019argent emprunt\u00e9, dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante et qui lui fut permise en vertu de l\u2019art. 11(1)(c), doit \u00eatre fractionn\u00e9 et attribu\u00e9 aux diff\u00e9rentes sources de revenu de l\u2019appelante.\nL\u2019article XV de la Convention entre le Canada et les \u00c9tats-Unis a pour effet d\u2019\u00e9tablir une entente mutuelle entre chaque pays pour appliquer les dispositions relatives au d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement pour imp\u00f4t \u00e9tranger que les lois domestiques de chaque pays peuvent adopter de temps \u00e0 autre. Cette entente ne requiert aucune modification des droits de l\u2019appelante, tels que d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par l\u2019action r\u00e9ciproque des arts. 41 et 139(1a) et (1b) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Pr\u00e9sident Jackett de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1] en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nLazarus Phillips, Q.C., and Philip F. Vineberg, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014We are concerned here with appeals of Interprovincial Pipe Line Company from reassessments made for its 1960 and 1961 taxation years. The Exchequer Court has affirmed these reassessments. The facts are substantially the same as those in Interprovincial Pipe Line Company v. The Minister of National Revenue[2]. The sole question again is how the calculation of the foreign tax deduction under s. 41 of the Income Tax Act is to be made and the result depends upon the effect to be given to the amendment to the Income Tax Act enacted in the year 1960 following the former decision.\nThe amendment is to be found in 8-9 Eliz. II, Statutes of Canada 1960, c. 43, s. 33. It repeals s. 139(1) (az) of the Act as it stood when the 1959 litigation was decided and substitutes for it a new section 139(1a) and 139(1b). I will put the old legislation and the new legislation in two parallel columns for the purpose of comparison. I am not reproducing the new legislation in full but only those parts that are relevant to this appeal:\nOld Legislation\nNew Legislation 1960\nSection 139(1) (az)\nSection 139(1a) and (1b)\n139. (1) In this Act,\n(az) a taxpayer\u2019s income from a business, employment, property or other source of income or from sources in a particular place means the taxpayer\u2019s income computed in accordance with this Act on the assumption that he had during the taxation year no income except from that source or those sources of income and was entitled to no deductions except those related to that source or those sources.\n(1a) For the purposes of this Act\n(a) a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from a business, employment, property or other source of income or from sources in a particular place means the taxpayer\u2019s income computed in accordance with this Act on the assumption that he had during the taxation year no income except from that source or those sources, and was allowed no deductions in computing his income for the taxation year except such deductions as may reasonably be regarded as wholly applicable to that source or those sources and except such part of any other deductions as may reasonably be regarded as applicable to that source or those sources; and\n(b) In applying subsection (1a) for the purposes of sections 31 and 41, all deductions allowed in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of Part I\u2026 shall be deemed to be applicable either wholly or in part to a particular source or to sources in a particular place.\nThere is no substantial difference between s. 41(1) and (5) of the Income Tax Act applicable to this appeal and the section as it read when the 1959 appeal was decided. This section deals with foreign tax deduction. The other sections of the Act are the same in both cases\u2014s. 3 (world income); s. 4 (income from business or property); s. 6(1)(b) (interest), and s. 11(1)(b) (deduction allowed for interest paid on borrowed money for the purpose of computing income).\nInterprovincial\u2019s method of financing is set out in the 1959 Report. Interprovincial owns and operates a pipe line in Canada with a connecting link in the United States. The connecting link is owned and operated by Lakehead Pipe Line Company Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. Interprovincial raised all the money to construct these lines. It lent the necessary money to Lakehead and took bonds in return. In the year 1960 Interprovincial received interest on these bonds but it itself had to pay interest on its own bonds which it had issued to acquire the Lakehead bonds. These are the figures:\nInterest received from Lakehead Bonds...............................\n$ 2,421,165.80\nCost of borrowed money used to acquire Lakehead Bonds.......................................................................................\n2,363,966.79\n$ 57,199.01\nThese figures can be broken down by taking the Lakehead bonds series by series and making the same calculation. The result is the same and there is no dispute about the figures.\nDuring the 1960 taxation year, the item of $2,421,165.80 above shown was not an actual receipt in that the sum of $363,174.87 was remitted by Lakehead to the Government of the United States pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of that country. This was a 15 per cent withholding tax. But Interprovincial, in computing its income as required by s. 6 of the Act, included the full sum of $2,421,165.80. Lakehead, in computing its income, deducted as an expense the said sum of $2,421,165.80.\nInterprovincial claimed and was allowed as a deduction for interest on borrowed money pursuant to s. 11(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act the sum of $4,549,355. This sum includes the sum of $2,363,966.79 referred to above under the heading \u201cCost of borrowed money used to acquire Lakehead Bonds\u201d. The question is what is to be done about the $363,174.87 withholding tax paid to the United States? The 1959 decision held\n(1) that this was available as a tax credit in respect of foreign tax paid on a gross basis on receipts of an income nature whether or not those receipts, after deduction of expenses incurred to earn them, resulted in a net profit when brought into the computation of the taxpayer\u2019s overall taxable income;\n(2) that there was no authority for splitting up the income of the business of the taxpayer; and\n(3) that the income of the business to be determined in order to ascertain what was taxable income was the entire income of the appellant and not that income split up into parts according to the situs of the source of that income.\nInterprovincial still submits that it is entitled to deduct under s. 41 of the Act the full amount of the United States withholding tax, $363,174.87. The Minister submits that subs. (1b) of s. 139 of the Act contains a mandatory direction that in computing income from various sources for the purpose of s. 41 of the Act, the deduction of $4,549,355, i.e., the total interest on borrowed money claimed by Interprovincial and allowed to it pursuant to s. 11(1)(c) of the Act, is to be broken up and related to Interprovincial\u2019s various sources of income. If this is done, as I have shown above, Interprovincial\u2019s income for the year 1960 from United States sources was $57,199.01. In my opinion the Minister is right and the effect of the 1960 amendment (the new s. 139(1a) and (1b) above quoted) is to require this to be done. This is the conclusion also reached by the Exchequer Court and I would affirm it.\nWe now must start by segregating the income from United States sources. That income is not a gross amount of $2,421,165.80, but a net amount of $57,199.01 after deducting the cost of borrowed money used to acquire the Lakehead bonds. Interprovincial\u2019s submission that its income from sources in the United States for the purpose of computing the amount deductible under s. 41 was still the gross amount of interest received from the United States without being reduced by its interest expense in Canada, is in error.\nI cannot see that there is any substantial difference between s. 41(1) and (5) dealing with the foreign tax deduction as it stood when the 1959 case was decided and as it now stands. Briefly, it enables the taxpayer to deduct from the tax payable an amount equal to the lesser of two sums,\n(a) any income or profits taxes paid to the government of a country other than Canada for the year, or\n(b) that proportion of the tax that (i) the taxpayer\u2019s income from sources in that country is of (ii) the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year.\nThe lesser of these two sums is now the sum calculated in accordance with the provisions of s. 41(1)(b) and this is all that is allowable as a foreign tax credit when the provisions of the news. 139(1a) and (1b) are applied.\nInterprovincial also put forward an alternative argument that the provisions of the Canada\u2011U.S. Reciprocal Tax Convention prevented the application of the Income Tax Act in the way above outlined and that the Minister could not deny the taxpayer the full deduction of foreign taxes paid.\nArticle XV of the Convention provides:\n1. As far as may be in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, Canada agrees to allow as a deduction from the Dominion income and excess profits taxes on any income which was derived from sources within the United States of America and was there taxed, the appropriate amount of such taxes paid to the United States of America.\n2. As far as may be in accordance with the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code, the United States of America agrees to allow as a deduction from the income and excess profits taxes imposed by the United States of America the appropriate amount of such taxes paid to Canada.\nI agree with the judgment of the Exchequer Court that the effect of this Article was to establish a mutual covenant to apply as between each country whatever foreign tax credit provision the respective domestic laws of each country might from time to time adopt and that this covenant does not require any alteration in the appellant\u2019s rights as determined by the interaction of s. 41 of the Income Tax Act and section 139(1a) and (1b).\nI therefore agree with the judgment of the Exchequer Court on both grounds and I would affirm it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Phillips, Vineberg, Goodman, Phillips & Rothman, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

The father\u2019s will, under which she received that property, provided that, during her lifetime, she would receive the income, but that, at her death, if she was survived by children, as was actually the case, the capital of her share could be \u201cdisposed of after her death in such manner as she may direct by will\u201d. There was also included in the estate of the deceased a life interest in a trust property given to her by a deed of donation inter vivos made by her father. That deed stipulated that the deceased \u201cshall have the absolute right to dispose of the said trust property by her will in such manner as she may deem advisable\u201d. The Minister assessed the two properties as \u201cproperty passing on the death\u201d of the deceased. The executors submitted that the deceased was never, within the meaning of ss. 3(1) (a), 3(2)(a) and 58(1)(i) of the Estate Tax Act, competent to dispose of this property. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s view and ruled that the deceased was vested with a general power to dispose, by will, of such property as she saw fit. The executors appealed to this Court and submitted: (1) that s. 3(1)(a) contemplates property which a deceased was competent to actually transfer immediately prior to his death, and not property which is only actually effectively transferred after death; (2) that the deceased did not have such a general power as met the definition of s. 58(1) (i), because her father did not intend her to have the power to dispose of the property by her will in any way and to any person; (3) that the deceased never had a general power within the meaning of s. 58(1) (i), since the property was donated or bequeathed to her for alimentary support and was immune from seizure; (4) that the deceased\u2019s father disposed of the property to the persons as the deceased might direct would receive it.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n(1) Section 3(1) (a) deals with the competency to transfer, and not with the transfer of property. The words \u201cimmediately prior to death\u201d in s. 3(1) (a) refer to the point at which a person is competent to dispose of property and not to the point at which there is, consequent to the exercise of competency, an actual and effective transfer of property. The executors\u2019 interpretation is further conclusively defeated by the provisions of s. 58(1)(i) taken together with ss. 3(1)(a) and 3(2)(a).\n(2) The rule stated in art. 1013 of the Civil Code is to the effect that common intention must be determined by interpretation rather than by adherence to the literal meaning of the words of the contract only if there is doubt as to what the parties intended.

Cet acte de donation stipulait que la d\u00e9funte aurait le droit absolu de disposer de ces biens mis en fiducie par testament de telle mani\u00e8re \u00abas she may deem advisable\u00bb.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an estate tax matter. Appeal dismissed. John de M. Marler, Q.C., and D.J.A. MacSween, for the appellants.\nAlban Garon and A. Peter F. Cumyn, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing appellants\u2019 appeal from an estate tax reassessment made by the Minister of National Revenue and levying a tax in the net amount of $250,390.60 in respect of the estate of Agnes Henry Wilson.\nAgnes Henry Wilson, hereafter also called the deceased, died, while domiciled in the province of Quebec; on January 26, 1963. She was survived by her husband, Robert George Sare, and three children of mature age. In her last will and testament, she made certain particular legacies, bequeathed the residue of her property including, inter alia, any property over which she \u201cmay have the power of appointment or disposal\u201d and appointed as her executors the appellants and her husband; the latter died on September 24, 1965, and has not been replaced as an executor.\nThe present litigation concerns (i) the property being the share which, by his last will and testament, executed at the City of Montreal on December 11, 1912, James Reid Wilson, the father of Agnes Henry Wilson,\u2014who himself died on May 11, 1914,\u2014allotted to the latter as one of his universal residuary legatees and (ii) certain other property which, by deed of donation inter vivos, done at the City of Montreal on December 17, 1912, he gave, in trust, to the Royal Trust for her. At the date of the death of the deceased, the value of the property comprised in her share in the estate of her father was $986,59311 and the value of the property given to the Royal Trust for her was $113,054.03.\nThe issue between the parties can be briefly stated. In computing,\u2014as he is required to do by s. 3 of the Estate Tax Act, (1958), 7 Eliz. II, c. 29,\u2014the aggregate value of the property passing on the death of the deceased, the Minister included the property mentioned above which he considered as property coming within that description. On appellants\u2019 view, such is not the case. Their submission is that, in view of the terms of the will and of the deed of donation, executed by her father, the deceased was never, within the meaning of ss. 3(1) (a), 3(2) (a) and 58(1) (i) of the Estate Tax Act, competent to dispose of this property.\nThe Will:\u2014After bequeathing numerous particular legacies, the father of the deceased left the residue of his estate to his children in equal shares, thereby instituting them as his universal residuary legatees. With respect to the share of his daughters, he directed that:\nThe shares of each of my daughters shall be retained in the hands of my Executors during her lifetime, and only the revenues thereof paid to her.\nand dealing particularly with the share of his daughter, Agnes Henry Wilson, the deceased, he further directed in the tenth clause:\nTENTH:\u2014The capital of the share of my daughter AGNES HENRY WILSON (Mrs. R.G. SARE) shall be disposed of after her death in the following manner:\u2014Should she die without leaving issue surviving her, one-fourth of her share shall belong to her husband, if living, and the remaining three-fourths shall belong to her brothers and sister, in equal shares. Should she die leaving issue surviving her which live to be six months old, the capital of her share shall be disposed of after her death in such manner as she may direct by Will, or should she die intestate it shall belong to her heirs-at-law. The donation to be made by me to THE ROYAL TRUST COMPANY for the benefit of my said daughter AGNES HENRY WILSON, shall be considered as a payment to my daughter in advance on account of her share in my estate & in the division of my estate the TRUST PROPERTY mentioned in said Deed, or the securities representing the same at the time of my death, shall be considered as of the value of FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.\nThe Deed of Donation:\u2014By the deed of donation to the Royal Trust Company, made six days after his will, the father of the deceased gave certain securities to the Trustee upon trust to pay the net revenues therefrom to his daughter, Agnes Henry Wilson, during her lifetime and provided in the fifth clause that:\nFIFTH:\u2014In the event of the said Dame Agnes Henry Wilson surviving said donor, she shall have the absolute right to dispose of the said Trust Property by her Will in such manner as she may deem advisable, and, failing to doing, the same shall at her death pass to her heirs-at-law. In the event of the said Dame Agnes Henry Wilson predeceasing the said Donor, leaving issue her surviving, any of whom has attained or shall attain the age of six months, then the said Trust Property shall be governed by the Will of the said Dame Agnes Henry Wilson, and, failing a Will, the same shall become the property of her heirs-at-law. In the event of the said Dame Agnes Henry Wilson predeceasing the said Donor, without leaving issue, or, leaving issue, none of whom attains the age of six months, then the said Trust Property shall be divided between the said Robert George Sare and the Estate of the said Donor in the proportion of one-fourth to the said Robert George Sare and three-fourths to the Estate of the said Donor, but, in the event of the said Robert George Sare being not then living, then the whole of the said Trust Property shall revert to and form part of the Estate of the said Donor.\nIn these extracts of the will and of the deed of donation, I have indicated in italics the very event which, amongst others contemplated by the father of the deceased, did actually take place.\nIt is common ground that the provisions of the Estate Tax Act which are here relevant are to be found in the following sections:\n3. (1) There shall be included in computing the aggregate net value of the property passing on the death of a person the value of all property, wherever situated, passing on the death of such person, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing,\n(a) all property of which the deceased was, immediately prior to his death, competent to dispose;\n* * *\n(2) For the purposes of this section,\n(a) a person shall be deemed to have been competent to dispose of any property if he had such an estate or interest therein or such general power as would, if he were sui juris, have enabled him to dispose of that property;\n* * *\n58. (1) In this Act,\n(i) \u201cgeneral power\u201d includes any power or authority enabling the donee or other holder thereof to appoint, appropriate or dispose of property as he sees fit, whether exercisable by instrument inter vivas or by will, or both, but does not include any power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity under a disposition not made by him, or exercisable as a mortgagee;\nThe trial judge rejected as ill-founded appellants\u2019 fundamental contention that the deceased, Agnes Henry Wilson, was not competent to dispose of the above property. He considered that the latter had survived her father and left three children of mature age; that, in such event, her father had directed, in his will, that the capital of her share shall be disposed of after her death in such manner as she may direct by Will and had directed, by the deed of donation, that she shall have the absolute right to dispose of the said trust property by her Will in such manner as she may deem advisable; and the learned judge held that these were plain and unambiguous directives which vested the deceased with a general power to dispose, by will, of such property as she saw fit. In support of their appeal from this decision, appellants\u2019 first submission is that, on a proper interpretation of s. 3(1) (a), it cannot be said,\u2014as admittedly it has to be found in this case to sustain the assessment,\u2014that the deceased was immediately prior to her death, competent to dispose of the property. They argue that since the property to be included, under s. 3(1) (a), is all the property of which the deceased was, immediately prior to her death, competent to dispose, and since a will has no disposing effect until the time of or after death, one must conclude that a person, whose estate or interest in property is such as to enable him to dispose of it only by will or whose general power over it is exercisable only by will, is not a person immediately prior to his death competent to dispose of it. Thus, on appellants\u2019 interpretation, s. 3(1) (a) contemplates property which a deceased was competent to actually and effectively transfer immediately prior to his death, and not property which is only actually and effectively transferred after death. In my opinion, s. 3(1) (a) deals with the competency to transfer and not with the transfer of property; and the words immediately prior to death in s. 3(1) (a) refer to the point at which a person is competent to dispose of property and not to the point at which there is, consequent to the exercise of competency, an actual and effective transfer of property.\nAppellants\u2019 interpretation is further conclusively defeated, in my view, by the provisions of s. 58(1) (i) which, collectively with ss. 3(1)(a) and 3(2)(a), operate to provide that a person shall be deemed to have been competent immediately prior to his death to dispose of property if the general power enabling him to dispose of property is exercisable either by instrument inter vivos or by Will, or both.\nDoubts were cast by appellants as to the applicability or effectiveness of s. 58(1) (i) for the reason that s. 58(1) (i) is in Part IV of the Act, while s. 3(1) (a), the taxing section, is in Part I thereof. Part IV, as its heading accurately indicates, deals exclusively with Interpretation and Application of the Act. Section 58 defines various expressions found in the Act. The opening words of the section leave no doubt that the meaning and effect which must be given to the expression general power appearing in s. 3(2) (a), is the meaning and effect that Parliament ascribed to that expression in s. 58(1) (i).\nAppellants contended that their interpretation of s. 3(1) (a) is borne out by s. 3(2) (e) which relates to the legal system of community of property and which prescribes that:\n3. (2)\n(e) notwithstanding anything in this section, the expression in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) \u2018property of which the deceased was, immediately prior to his death, competent to dispose\u2019 does not include the share of the spouse of the deceased in any community of property that existed between the deceased and such spouse immediately prior to his death.\nIt is said that, in effect, this section provides that when a deceased husband and his spouse were in community of property, the share of the surviving spouse is not to be included in the property of which the husband was, immediately prior to his death, competent to dispose. And it is then argued (i) that if, on the one hand, the expression immediately prior to his death means at the time of his death, then, these provisions are unnecessary, since, under art. 1293 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, the husband is not competent at the time of his death. to dispose by will of anything more than his share in the community; and (ii) that if, on the other hand, the expression means a point during the lifetime of the husband, then, since the husband has the right to dispose of the community property, during his lifetime, these provisions are necessary to prevent that, on the death of the husband, tax be exigible on the whole and not merely on his half of the community property. Hence, the appellants conclude that the latter meaning must be given to the expression immediately prior to his death. The Estate Tax Act, enacted in 1958 and coming into force on January 1, 1959, governs the estate of persons who died on or after that date and is designed to replace the Dominion Succession Duty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 89 , which continues to govern the estate of persons who died prior to that date. I agree that s. 3(2) (e) of the Estate Tax Act is not really necessary. Indeed, it had no counterpart in the Dominion Succession Duty Act and, in my opinion, was inserted in the Estate Tax Act ex majore cautela to ensure that, in cases of com- munity of property, on the death of the husband, his estate would not be deemed to include the widow\u2019s community half. While, in a loose sense, it may be said that the husband is competent to dispose, in his lifetime, of community assets, under the general administrative power conferred on him by art. 1292 et seq. of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, he is not free, not competent to dispose of such assets in any sense contemplated by ss. 3(1)(a), 3(2)(a) and 58(1) (i) quoted above. The premise, on which rests the second branch of the dilemma propounded by appellants, is not valid. In my opinion, these provisions of s. 3(2) (e) do not support appellants\u2019 interpretation of s. 3(1)(a).\nAppellants\u2019 next proposition is that even if it can be said that the deceased was immediately prior to her death competent to dispose, she could not appoint or dispose as she saw fit, for, notwithstanding the unlimited language used in the will and in the deed of donation, her father did not intend, thereby, his daughter to have the power to dispose of the property by her will in any way and to any person. Accordingly, it is said, she has no such general power as meets the definition of s. 58(1) (i). This view, as to the intention of the father of the deceased, is formed by the appellants on a consideration of the directions appearing in the tenth clause of the will and of the provisions of the fifth clause of the deed of donation which they seek to interpret and rationalize in a manner consistent with the motives which, in their view, prompted the father of the deceased to so direct and provide. The legal principles applicable in the determination of intention are well-known. With respect to the determination of the intention of a testator, the rule is stated in Auger v. Beaudry[2], where Lord Buckmaster, delivering the judgment of the Board, said, at page 359:\n\u2026it is now recognised that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will. Human motives are too uncertain to render it wise or safe to leave the firm guide of the words used for the uncertain direction of what it must be assumed that a reasonable man would mean.\nWith respect to the determination of the common intention of the parties to a contract, the rule, stated in art. 1013 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, is to the effect that the common intention must be determined by interpretation rather than by adherence to the literal meaning of the words of the contract only if there is doubt as to what the parties intended. In view of the plain and unmistakable language of the tenth clause of the will and of the fifth clause of the deed of donation quoted above, and particularly to the italicized part thereof, I find no need or justification to resort to interpretation. Nor am I able to agree with the further submission made in support of this second proposition, that the words in such mariner as she may direct by Will and in such manner as she may deem advisable, respectively appearing in these clauses of the will and of the deed of donation, only mean that the deceased could by her will prescribe the manner in which her children would take. In the whole context of the clauses in which they are found, these words are only apt to describe the unfettered power which the deceased had to dispose of the property by will to any person.\nAppellants then submitted that even if Mrs. Wilson, the deceased, could appoint or dispose to any person, nevertheless she never had a general power within the meaning of s. 58(1) (i), in view of the following provisions in the deed of donation and in the will:\nIn the Deed of Donation:\nTHE PRESENT DONATION, being intended as an alimentary provision for the beneficiaries herein named, the said Trust Property shall be, in capital and revenues, so long as it remains in the hands of the Trustee, incapable of being taken in attachment for the debts of the said beneficiaries, nor shall the said annuity be capable of being assigned or anticipated in any way, any such assignment or anticipation to be treated as an absolute nullity.\nIn the Will:\nTWELFTH:\u2014I declare that all the bequests herein contained are thus made on condition that the property bequeathed and the revenues thereof shall be exempt from seizure for any debts of the legatees named, the said bequests being intended for their alimentary support.\nThus, in both cases, the liberalities are declared to be intended for alimentary support and the property is made immune from seizure and, moreover, inalienable in the case of the property donated, for the debts of the beneficiary. Obviously, the provision of the deed of donation becomes emptied of any purpose and object, at the moment at which Mrs. Wilson dies if, immediately prior to death, she disposed of the property by will. In my opinion, in no way could it affect her right to exercise the power enabling her to dispose, by will, of the property donated \u201cin such manner as she may deem advisable\u201d. Nor could the provision of clause twelve of the will affect a similar power given to her with respect to the property bequeathed to her. A disposition, declaring that property, donated or bequeathed, is intended to be donated or bequeathed for alimentary support and is, for that reason, made immune from attachment, has always been interpreted by the courts as not limiting the right of the beneficiary to dispose of the same as he sees fit, but as having for sole object and effect to prevent third parties to acquire possession of the property by attachment, without the consent of the beneficiary. Nolin v. Flibotte[3]; Delisle v. Valli\u00e8res[4]; Caisse Populaire de Levis v. Marauda[5]. Hence, it cannot be said, in my opinion, that, because of these provisions, Mrs. Wilson never had a general power to appoint or to dispose within the meaning of s. 58(1) (i).\nAppellants\u2019 last proposition is that the father created a fiduciary substitution, in his will, with respect to his daughter\u2019s share in his estate and that for this reason and also because he created a trust, in the deed of donation, with respect to the property donated, it is not his daughter, Mrs. Wilson, who disposed of the property at the time of her death, but the father himself. In the deed of donation, there is admittedly no fiduciary substitution. As expressed in their factum, appellants\u2019 submission is that when, by the deed of donation, the father of Mrs. Wilson disposed of the property to the trustee, he also disposed of it, on his daughter\u2019s death if she survived him, to the person or persons that she might direct would receive it. And because, it is said, the father disposed of the property on his daughter\u2019s death, she herself could not dispose of it at that time. In my view, this submission is, to say the least, repugnant to the unlimited grant, which the father made to his daughter in the deed of donation, of\n\u2026the absolute right to dispose of the said property by her Will in such manner as she may deem advisable \u2026 As to the will, any fiduciary substitution, which it may be said to contain, would be related to and conditioned upon the happening of an event other than the one which actually happened and with which, only, the Minister was concerned. I am in respectful agreement with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that, in the provision applicable to the event which did actually take place, there is no fiduciary substitution. The plain and unmistakable language of the direction, relevant in that case, rendered Mrs. Wilson free to dispose as she saw fit of the property; and those who benefited as a result of her will, received from her and not from her father. Even if there were in the will, as contended for by appellants, a fiduciary substitution with respect to the share of Mrs. Wilson in the estate of her father, there would still remain to be determined whether, by a fiction of the law,\u2014which is open for Parliament to create for purposes of federal taxation,\u2014that share was not property passing on the death of Mrs. Wilson within the meaning of the Estate Tax Act.\nThe cases of Montreal Trust Co. et al. v. M.N.R.[6] and Wanklyn and others v: M.N:R.[7], to which we were referred by appellants, differ, fundamentally and in more than one way, from the one here considered. Suffice it to say that in the first one, there was, in the will, an effective fiduciary substitution and that the second, governed by the Dominion Succession Duty Act , (1940-41), 4-5 Geo. VI, c. 14, was determined on consideration of certain provisions thereof which differ, in substance, from their counterparts in the Estate Tax Act, supra.\nIn my view, the appeal, from the judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeal from the estate tax reassessment made by the Minister, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

Act, 1930, c. 26.\nThe appellant is an Indian from the Province of Manitoba and was convicted of having game birds in his possession, contrary to s. 12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. On appeal by way of trial de novo, the conviction was quashed. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, the conviction was restored by a majority judgment. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The issue in the appeal is whether para. 13 of an agreement made on December 14, 1929, between the government of Canada and the government of Manitoba (approved by statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament, the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Manitoba) exempts the appellant from compliance with the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the regulations made thereunder. Paragraph 13 provides that\u2026 \u201cCanada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians might have a right of access\u201d.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.: Paragraph 13 of the agreement did not have the effect of exempting the appellant from compliance with the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the regulations made thereunder. The whole tenor of the agreement is that of a conveyance of land imposing specified obligations and restrictions on the transferee, not on the transferor. This applied particularly to para. 13 which made provincial game laws applicable to Indians in the province subject to the proviso contained therein. That only provincial game laws were in the contemplation of the parties, and not federal enactments, is underscored by the words \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d in para. 13. Care was taken in framing para. 13 that the legislature of the province could not unilaterally affect the right of Indians to hunt for food on unoccupied Crown lands. The agreement and the legislation confirm- ing it did no more than impose specified obligations and restrictions upon the transferee province. They did not repeal by implication a statute of Canada giving effect to an international convention.\nPer Pigeon J.: This was a case for the application of the rule of construction that Parliament is not presumed to legislate in breach of a treaty or in any manner inconsistent with the comity of nations and the established rules of international law. The words in para. 13 of the agreement \u201cCanada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof\u201d contemplate the laws of Manitoba. It is perfectly possible without doing violence to the language used to construe para. 13 as applicable solely to provincial laws and thus to avoid any conflict. Furthermore, it would not only be foreign to the declared object of the agreement but even inconsistent with it, to provide for an implied modification of the Migratory Birds Convention Act.\nPer Cartwright C.J., dissenting: The words \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d do not cut down the right of hunting which in plain and unequivocal words para. 13 say the Indians shall have. The rights given to the Indians by the words of para. 13 have been, since 1930, enshrined in our Constitution and given the force of law \u201cnotwithstanding anything in\u2026any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d. There is no rule which permits to add after the words \u201cCanada\u201d the words \u201cexcept the Migratory Birds Convention Act\u201d.\nPer Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The words in para. 13 of the agreement \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d do not have the effect of limiting the rights thereby accorded to the Indians, to provincial rights, but rather to constitute additional assurance of the general rights described in that paragraph.\nIn view of the words of s. 1 of the B.N.A. Act, 1930, giving the agreement the force of law \u201cnotwithstanding anything in\u2026any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d, the agreement takes precedence over the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the regulations made thereunder, with the result that these enactments do not apply to Indians in Manitoba when engaged in hunting migratory birds for food in the areas set out in para. 13.\nDroit criminel\u2014Indiens\u2014Droit de chasse des Indiens du Manitoba\u2014Possession de gibier en temps prohib\u00e9 contrairement au statut\u2014Convention entre le Canada et le Manitoba dispense\u2011t-elle d\u2019ob\u00e9ir au statut\u2014Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149\u2014Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs, S.R.C. 1952, c. 179, art. 12(1)\u2014Loi des ressources naturelles du Manitoba , 1930 (Can.), c. 29; 1930 (Man.), c. 30\u2014Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1930, c. 26.\nL\u2019appelant, un Indien du Manitoba, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019avoir eu en sa possession du gibier contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12(1) de la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs, S.R.C. 1952, c. 179. Sur appel par voie de proc\u00e8s de novo, la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e.

L\u2019appelant a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 cette Cour. La question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre est de savoir si le para. 13 de la convention faite le 14 d\u00e9cembre 1929 entre le gouvernement du Canada et le gouvernement du Manitoba (ratifi\u00e9e par les statuts du parlement du Royaume-Uni, du parlement du Canada et de la l\u00e9gislature du Manitoba) dispense l\u2019appelant d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs et les r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablis en vertu d\u2019icelle. Le para. 13 stipule que\u2026\u00able Canada consent \u00e0 ce que les lois relatives au gibier et qui sont en vigueur de temps \u00e0 autre dans la province, s\u2019appliquent aux Indiens dans les limites de la province; toutefois, lesdits Indiens auront le droit que la province leur assure par les pr\u00e9sentes de chasser et de prendre le gibier au pi\u00e8ge et de p\u00eacher le poisson, pour se nourrir en toute saison de l\u2019ann\u00e9e sur toutes les terres inoccup\u00e9es de la Couronne et sur toutes les autres terres auxquelles lesdits Indiens peuvent avoir un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s\u00bb.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Ritchie, Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Pigeon: Le paragraphe 13 de la convention ne dispense pas l\u2019appelant d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs et aux r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablis en vertu d\u2019icelle. La convention est un acte de transmission de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 imposant des obligations et des restrictions sp\u00e9cifiques au cessionnaire, mais non pas au c\u00e9dant. Ceci s\u2019applique particuli\u00e8rement au para. 13 qui rend les lois de chasse provinciales applicables aux Indiens dans la province sous r\u00e9serve de la condition y pr\u00e9vue. Les mots \u00abque la province leur assure par les pr\u00e9sentes\u00bb dans le para. 13 montrent bien que les parties n\u2019avaient en vue que les lois de chasse provinciales et non pas les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. On a pris soin de s\u2019assurer que la province ne pourrait pas unilat\u00e9ralement porter atteinte au droit des Indiens de chasser pour se nourrir sur les terres inoccup\u00e9es de la Couronne. La convention ainsi que la l\u00e9gislation la ratifiant n\u2019ont pas d\u2019autre effet que d\u2019imposer des obligations et des restrictions sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 la province cessionnaire. Elles n\u2019ont pas eu pour effet d\u2019abroger implicitement un statut du Canada qui donnait effet \u00e0 une convention internationale.\nLe Juge Pigeon: Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on doit appliquer la r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation disant que le parlement n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un trait\u00e9 ou d\u2019une mani\u00e8re incompatible avec les convenances et les r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies du droit international. Dans le para. 13 de la convention, les mots \u00able Canada consent \u00e0 ce que les lois relatives au gibier et qui sont en vigueur de temps \u00e0 autre dans la province, s\u2019appliquent aux Indiens dans les limites de la province\u00bb visent les lois du Manitoba. Sans faire violence aux mots dont on s\u2019est servi, il est parfaitement possible d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ce para. 13 comme s\u2019appliquant uniquement aux lois provinciales et ainsi d\u2019\u00e9viter tout conflit. Interpr\u00e9ter ce paragraphe comme une modification implicite de la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs serait non seulement s\u2019\u00e9loigner de l\u2019objet de la convention mais aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright, dissident: Les mots \u00abque la province leur assure par les pr\u00e9sentes\u00bb n\u2019enl\u00e8vent rien au droit de chasser qu\u2019en des termes clairs et non \u00e9quivoques le para. 13 dit que les Indiens poss\u00e8dent. Les droits donn\u00e9s aux Indiens par le para. 13 ont \u00e9t\u00e9, depuis 1930, consacr\u00e9s par notre constitution et sont devenus la loi \u00abnonobstant tout ce qui est contenu\u2026dans toute loi du Parle- ment du Canada\u00bb. Il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e8gle qui permette d\u2019ajouter apr\u00e8s les mots \u00abCanada\u00bb les mots \u00abexcept\u00e9 la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs\u00bb.\nLes Juges Ritchie, Hall et Spence, dissidents: Dans le para. 13 de la convention, les mots \u00abque la province leur assure par les pr\u00e9sentes\u00bb n\u2019ont pas l\u2019effet de limiter aux seuls droits provinciaux les droits qui y sont accord\u00e9s aux Indiens, mais au contraire constituent une garantie additionnelle des droits g\u00e9n\u00e9raux d\u00e9crits dans ce paragraphe.\nVu les termes de l\u2019art. 1 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1930, donnant \u00e0 la convention force de loi \u00abnonobstant tout ce qui est contenu\u2026dans toute loi du Parlement du Canada\u00bb, la convention a priorit\u00e9 sur la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs et les r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablis en vertu d\u2019icelle. Il en r\u00e9sulte que cette l\u00e9gislation ne s\u2019applique pas aux Indiens du Manitoba lorsqu\u2019ils chassent pour se nourrir les oiseaux migrateurs dans les endroits sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s au para. 13.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel du Manitoba1, r\u00e9tablissant une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Ritchie, Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[1], restoring the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nWilliam R. Martin, for the appellant.\nD.H. Christie, Q.C., for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal, the relevant facts (all of which are undisputed) and the historical background in the light of which the controversy must be considered are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nThat the problem is not free from difficulty is attested by the differences of opinion in the Courts below and in this Court.\nSince the decisions of this Court in Sikyea v. The Queen[2] and The Queen v. George[3], it must be accepted that, if it were not for the provisions contained in section 13 of the agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba which was approved and given the force of law by Statutes of the Imperial Parliament, the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Manitoba, the conviction of the appellant would have to be upheld.\nNothing would be gained by my repeating the reasons which I gave in George\u2019s case for thinking that both it and Sikyea\u2019s case should have been decided differently. I accept those decisions.\nThe first question before us is as to the meaning of the words used in section 13 of the agreement and particularly the following:\n\u2026provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians might have a right of access.\nI share the view of my brothers Ritchie and Hall that the words \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d do not cut down \u201cthe right of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year\u201d which in plain and unequivocal words the clause says that the Indians shall have.\nIn Sikyea\u2019s case and George\u2019s case the Court decided that this right, secured to the Indians by treaty, could be, and as a matter of construction had been abrogated by the terms of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Regulations made thereunder. In George\u2019s case the Court held that while s. 87 of the Indian Act preserved the treaty rights of the Indians against encroachment by laws within the competency of the Provincial Legislature it had no such effect in regard to an Act of Parliament.\nThe situation in the case at bar is different. The right of hunting, trapping and fishing given to the Indians by the words of section 13 quoted above has been, since 1930, enshrined in an amendment to our Constitution and given:\n\u2026the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act as aforesaid.\nI find it impossible to uphold the conviction of the appellant unless we are able to say that, by the application of some rule of construction, there should be inserted in s. 1 of the British North America Act, 1930, immediately after the words \u201cParliament of Canada\u201d the words \u201cexcept the Migratory Birds Convention Act\u201d. I know of no rule which permits us to take such a course.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Hall.\nThe Judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant is an Indian within the meaning of para. (g) of subs. (1) of s. 2 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149. He was convicted on December 7, 1964, of having in his possession\nMigratory Game Birds, during a time when the capturing, killing, or taking of such birds, is prohibited, contrary to the Regulations under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, thereby committing an offence under Section 12(1) of the said Migratory Birds Convention Act.\nOn an appeal by way of trial de novo his conviction was quashed. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[4], his conviction was restored and the sentence affirmed by a majority judgment. He appeals to this Court with leave.\nThe issue in this appeal is whether by operation of para. 13 of the agreement made on December 14, 1929, between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the Province of Manitoba (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe agreement\u201d) the appellant was exempted from compliance with the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations made thereunder bearing in mind that at the relevant time and place he was an Indian who had hunted game for food on land to which he had a right of access.\nThere can be no doubt that apart from para. 13 of the agreement above quoted the appellant was, in the circumstances of this case, subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations. See: Sikyea v. The Queen[5]; The Queen v. George[6]; Sigeareak v. The Queen[7]. Paragraph 13 of the agreement provides:\n13. In order to secure to the Indians of the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.\nParagraph 13 is part of an agreement dated December 14, 1929, between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Manitoba for the transfer to the province from the Dominion of all ungranted Crown lands. This agreement was approved by the Manitoba Legislature and by Parliament. (Statutes of Manitoba, 1930, c. 30; Statutes of Canada, 1930, c. 29.) It was subsequently affirmed by the British North America Act, 1930, 20-21 Geo. V., c. 26. Three similar agreements involving Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia were subsequently affirmed.\nSection 1 of the British North America Act 1930 provides:\n1. The agreements set out in the Schedule to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act as aforesaid.\nPrior to the coming into force of the agreement, title to all ungranted Crown lands in the Province of Manitoba was vested in the Dominion. Briefly, the relevant history is that by the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, 31-32 Vict., c. 105 (R.S.C. 1952, vol. VI, p. 99) provision was made for the surrender of Rupert\u2019s Land by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company and for the acceptance thereof by Her Majesty. Section 3 of the said Act provided:\nthat such Surrender shall not be accepted by Her Majesty until the Terms and Conditions upon which Rupert\u2019s Land shall be admitted into the said Dominion of Canada shall have been approved of by Her Majesty, and embodied in an address to Her Majesty from both the Houses of the Parliament of Canada in pursuance of the 146th Section of the British North America Act 1867.\nBy Imperial Order in Council of June 23, 1870, Rupert\u2019s Land was admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada effective July 15, 1870\u2014R.S.C. 1952, vol. VI, p. 113. By operation of the Manitoba Act 1870, 33 Vict., c. 3 (Canada), subsequently affirmed with retrospective effect by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (B.N.A. Act, 1871, 34-35 Vict., c. 28, s. 5, R.S.C. 1952, vol. VI, p. 146), the Province of Manitoba was carved out of Rupert\u2019s Land and came into being on the same date Rupert\u2019s Land entered Confederation. By s. 30 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, all ungranted or waste lands in the Province vested in the Crown to be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of the Dominion.\nThe Crown in right of the Dominion being the owner of all Crown lands, including the mines and minerals therein, in the Province of Manitoba that Province, together with Alberta and Saskatchewan, was in a less favourable condition than the other Provinces who by operation of s. 109 of the British North America Act, 1867, retained Crown lands upon entering Confederation. The purpose of the agreement was to transfer these lands to Manitoba in order that it might be in the same position as the other provinces under s. 109 of the British North America Act, 1867. This is apparent from the preamble to and paragraph 1 of the agreement and from the following cases where the matter was under consideration:\nSaskatchewan Natural Resources Reference[8]:\nReference concerning Refunds of Dues paid to the Dominion of Canada in respect of Timber Permits in the Western Provinces[9];\nAnthony v. Attorney General of Alberta[10];\nAttorney General of Alberta v. Huggard Assets Limited[11]:\nWestern Canadian Collieries Limited v. Attorney General of Alberta[12].\nThe whole tenor of the agreement is that of a conveyance of land imposing specified obligations and restrictions on the transferee, not on the transferor. This applies, in particular, to paragraph 13, which makes provincial game laws applicable to Indians in the province subject to the proviso contained therein. That only provincial game laws were in the contemplation of the parties, and not federal enactments, is underscored by the words \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d in para. 13. As indicated by para. 11 of the agreement and para. 10 of the Alberta and Saskatchewan agreements, Canada, in negotiating these agreements, was mindful of the fact it had treaty obligations with Indians on the Prairies. These treaties, among other things, dealt with hunting by Indians on unoccupied lands. For example, treaties 5 and 6, which cover portions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, provide:\nHer Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes, by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said Government.\nTreaty No. 8, which covers portions of Alberta and Saskatchewan, provides:\nAnd Her Majesty the Queen HEREBY AGREES with the said Indians that they shall have right to pursue their usual vocations of hunting, trapping and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as heretofore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by the Government of the country, acting under the authority of Her Majesty, and saving and excepting such tracts as may be required or taken up from time to time for settlement, mining, lumbering, trading or other purposes.\nTreaty No. 7, which covers a portion of Alberta, is to the same effect.\nIt being the expectation of the parties that the agreement would be given the force of law by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Paragraph 25) care was taken in framing para. 13 that the Legislature of the province could not unilaterally affect the right of Indians to hunt for food on unoccupied Crown lands. Under the agreement this could only be done by concurrent Statutes of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the province, in accordance with para. 24 thereof.\nThe majority opinion in the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that the agreement, affirmed as it was by legislation of all interested governments, could not be reconciled with the Migratory Birds Convention Act and that the latter Act must prevail. The Migratory Birds Convention Act, being of general application throughout Canada, ought not to be construed as circumscribed by the restricted legislation that is to be found in the Manitoba Natural Resources Act . It was desirable that a matter within the legislative responsibility of Parliament and governed by international treaty be uniform in application throughout the country unless specifically provided otherwise.\nThe dissenting opinion would have held that para. 13 of the agreement should prevail over the Migratory Birds Convention Act notwithstanding that such a result gives the Act a different effect in Manitoba from that which it has in other parts of Canada.\nThe Migratory Birds Convention Act was enacted in 1917. It confirms a treaty made between Canada and the United States. The regulations under the Act go back to 1918. (P.C. 871, April 23, 1918). In my opinion, the agreement and the legislation of 1930 confirming it did no more than impose specified obligations and restrictions upon the transferee province. They did not repeal by implication a statute of Canada giving effect to an international convention.\nOn this subject I adopt the law as stated in 36 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 465:\nRepeal by implication is not favoured by the courts for it is to be presumed that Parliament would not intend to effect so important a matter as the repeal of a law without expressing its intention to do so. If, however, provisions are enacted which cannot be reconciled with those of an existing statute, the only inference possible is that Parliament, unless it failed to address its mind to the question, intended that the provisions of the existing statute should cease to have effect, and an intention so evinced is as effective as one expressed in terms. The rule is, therefore, that one provision repeals another by implication if, but only if, it is so inconsistent with or repugnant to that other that the two are incapable of standing together. If it is reasonably possible so to construe the provisions as to give effect to both, that must be done; and their reconciliation must in particular be attempted if the later statute provides for its construction as one with the earlier, thereby indicating that Parliament regarded them as compatible, or if the repeals expressly effected by the later statute are so detailed that failure to include the earlier provision amongst them must be regarded as such an indication.\nI would dismiss the appeal. RITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by other members of the Court in which the circumstances giving rise to this appeal are fully recited.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Hall that the words \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d as they occur in paragraph 13 of the agreement which is a schedule to the Manitoba Natural Resources Act , Statutes of Canada 1930, c. 29, do not have the effect of limiting the rights thereby accorded to Indians, to provincial rights, but rather that they constitute additional assurance of the general rights described in the said paragraph.\nLike my brother Hall, I can only read the provisions of s. 1 of the British North America Act, 1930, as giving the agreement \u201cthe force of law notwithstanding anything in \u2026any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u2026\u201d and I am therefore of opinion that the agreement takes precedence over the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179 and the regulations made thereunder, with the result that these enactments do not apply to Indians in Manitoba when engaged in hunting migratory birds for food in the areas set out in section 13.\nI would accordingly dispose of this matter in the manner proposed by my brother Hall.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts in this appeal are not in dispute. The appellant, Paul Daniels, who is a Treaty Indian of the Chemahawin Indian Reserve in the Province of Manitoba, was convicted by Police Magistrate Neil McPhee, at The Pas, Manitoba, for an offence contrary to subs. (1) of s. 12 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. The charge on which he was convicted was that he, the said\nPaul Daniels, of Chemahawin Indian Reserve, Manitoba, on the 3rd day of July, A.D. 1964, at Chemahawin Indian Reserve, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully and without lawful excuse have in his possession Migratory Game Birds, during a time when the capturing, killing or taking of such birds is prohibited, contrary to the regulations under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, thereby committing an offence under Section 12(1) of the said Migratory Birds Convention Act.\nAgainst the conviction the accused appealed to the County Court by way of trial de novo. His Honour J.W. Thompson, sitting as a judge of the County Court of Manitoba, allowed the appeal and acquitted the accused. The Crown then took an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[13] which Court, Freedman J.A. dissenting, allowed the appeal and restored the conviction. The appellant then applied for and was given leave to appeal to this Court.\nOn July 3, 1964, the appellant had in his possession two wild ducks, one described as a redhead and the other a mallard or greenhead. At a point along the Saskatchewan River, within the Reserve, he had, on his own admission, shot and killed the birds for food and they were being cooked over a campfire when two constables of the R.C.M.P. entered the area. Section 6 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act provides:\nNo person, without lawful excuse, the proof whereof shall he on such person, shall buy, sell or have in his possession any migratory game bird, migratory insectivorous bird or migratory nongame bird, or the nest or egg of any such bird or any part of any such bird, nest or egg, during the time when the capturing, killing or taking of such bird, nest or egg is prohibited by this Act.\nUnder s. 3(b)(i) \u201cMigratory Game Birds\u201d includes wild ducks. Section 12(1) of the Act provides that every person who violates any provision of this Act or any regulation, is, for each offence, liable upon summary conviction to a fine of not more than three hundred dollars and not less than ten dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both fine and imprisonment.\nSection 5(1) of the Regulations provides:\nUnless otherwise permitted under these Regulations to do so, no person shall\n(a) in any area described in Schedule A, kill, hunt, capture, injure, or take or molest a migratory bird at any time except during an open season specified for that bird and that area in Schedule A\u2026\nPart VII of Schedule A to the Regulations defines the open season for ducks in Manitoba. In the area north of Parallel 53 which includes the Chemahawin Indian Reserve, the open season is from noon September 11 to November 28, inclusive of the closing date. It is further provided in s. 5(2) of the Regulations:\nIndians and Eskimos may take auks, auklets, guillemots, murres, puffins and scoters and their eggs at any time for human food or clothing, but they shall not sell or trade or offer to sell or trade birds or eggs so, taken and they shall not take such birds or eggs within a bird sanctuary.\nUnless the appellant\u2019s status as an Indian in Manitoba permits him to hunt and possess migratory game birds at all seasons of the year, he was properly convicted: Sikyea v. The Queen[14].\nThe appellant claimed immunity from the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act by virtue of the Manitoba Natural Resources Act , Statutes of Canada 1930, c. 29, which he contends exempts him from the operations of the Migratory Birds Convention Act because he is an Indian residing in the Province of Manitoba.\nIn the year 1929, some twelve years after the enactment of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba reached an agreement respecting the transfer to Manitoba of the unalienated natural resources within the Province. The agreement was approved by the Parliament of Canada in the Manitoba Natural Resources Act , supra, and by the Legislature of Manitoba by the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 180. The schedule to both statutes contains the terms of the agreement, in which s. 13 reads as follows:\nIn order to secure to the Indians of the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians might have a right of access.\nThis section of the agreement was dealt with by this Court in Prince and Myron v. The Queen[15], which held that Indians in Manitoba hunting for food on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which they may have rights of access were not subject to any of the limitations which the Game and Fisheries Act of Manitoba, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, imposes upon the non-Indian residents of Manitoba. Section 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, reads as follows:\n72(1) Notwithstanding this Act, and in so far only as is necessary to implement The Manitoba Natural Resources Act , any Indian may hunt and take game for food for his own use at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the Indian may have the right of access.\nThe question which falls to be determined in this appeal is whether the terms of the agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba as ratified by Parliament and by the Legislature of Manitoba and confirmed at Westminster in the British North America Act 1930 take precedence over the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Regulations made thereunder. If full effect is to be given to s. 13 of the agreement in question, it must be held that the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Regulations made thereunder do not apply to Indians in Manitoba when engaged in hunting migratory birds for food in the areas set out in the section. On the other hand, if the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act take precedence, the right of Indians in Manitoba to hunt game for food at all seasons of the year in accordance with said s. 13 is wiped out. Accordingly, the decision must be made as to which legislation is paramount.\nFreedman J.A., in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, dealt with the problem as follows:\nAt first blush it might be thought that the reference to Indians and their hunting rights both in the Convention and in the regulations of the Migratory Birds Convention Act\u2014under which they are permitted to hunt scoters, auks, auklets, etc.\u2014settles the matter. Obviously such rights are far smaller than the unrestricted right to hunt all game for food, which is provided by Sec. 13 of \u201cThe Manitoba Natural Resources Act \u201d. The reference to Indians in the Convention and in the regulations is in general terms, no exception being made with regard to Indians of Manitoba or elsewhere. It might accordingly be plausibly argued that the Indians in Manitoba have only such rights with respect to migratory birds as are conferred by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. But this is not necessarily so. We must remember that when the Convention of 1917 was entered into, the agreement relating to the transfer of Manitoba\u2019s natural resources was not yet in existence nor even in contemplation. Hence no exception with regard to Manitoba Indians could have been expected in the Convention. As for the regulations of 1958, it is true that they were enacted subsequent to The Manitoba Natural Resources Act and that they contain no exception in favour of Indians of Manitoba. But the regulations could not enlarge or go beyond the provisions of the statute pursuant to which they were enacted. Rather they would conform to the terms of that statute; so no such exception would be expected in the regulations either.\nThe parallel argument on the other side appears to me to be far more cogent. The terms of Sec. 13 contained in The Manitoba Natural Resources Act are comprehensive and permit the hunting by Indians of game for food at all seasons of the year. No exception is made with respect to migratory birds, even though the Migratory Birds Convention Act had been on the statute books since 1917. Instead of making the provisions of Sec. 13 subject to the terms of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the legislators did quite the opposite. They enshrined the agreement within the Canadian constitutional framework by having it confirmed at Westminster in the British North America Act, 1930, and declared it should have the force of law \u201cnotwithstanding anything in\u2026 any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d. I believe it should be given that force and not be read as subject to the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act.\nI am conscious of the fact that this conclusion will give to the Migratory Birds Convention Act a different effect in Manitoba (and incidentally in Saskatchewan and Alberta, which have similar provisions to Sec. 13 ) from that which it has in other parts of Canada. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Reg. vs. Sikyea, (1964) S.C.R. 642, upheld the application of the Migratory Birds Convention Act to an Indian of the Northwest Territories notwithstanding hunting rights contained in treaties. The decision of that Court in The Queen vs. George, (1966) 55 D.L.R. (2d) 386, came to the same conclusion as regards an Indian in Ontario. In neither case, of course, did Sec. 13 of The Manitoba Natural Resources Act apply. If the application of Sec. 13 gives to the Migratory Birds Convention Act a disparate result in different parts of Canada, that is simply an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the conflicting legislation on the subject.\nI am in full agreement with Freedman J.A. and the fact that the conclusion arrived at by him gives the Indians of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta a latitude while hunting for food on unoccupied crown lands and on other lands to which Indians might have a right of access greater than that possessed by other Indians in Canada is not of itself a reason for putting a strained interpretation on said s. 13 or for failing to give effect to the very plain language in the British North America Act 1930. The lamentable history of Canada\u2019s dealings with Indians in disregard of treaties made with them as spelt out in the judgment of Johnson J.A. in Regina v. Sikyea[16] and by McGillivray J.A. in Rex v. Wesley[17] ought in justice to allow the Indians to get the benefit of an unambiguous law which for once appears to give them what the treaties and the Commissioners who were sent to negotiate those treaties promised.\nI said at p. 646 of my reasons in Sikyea which were concurred in by the six other members of this Court who heard the appeal:\nOn the substantive question involved, I agree with the reasons for judgment and with the conclusions of Johnson J.A. in the Court of Appeal, (1964) 2 C.C.C. 325, 43 C.R. 83, 46 W.W.R. 65. He has dealt with the important issues fully and correctly in their historical and legal settings, and there is nothing which I can usefully add to what he has written.\nIt should be noted that in Sikyea the British North America Act 1930 had no application because the offence there being dealt with had occurred in the Northwest Territories, an area wholly within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Parliament has the power to breach the Indian treaties if it so wills: Regina v. Sikyea, supra. That point is dealt with by Johnson J.A. at p. 330 as follows:\nDiscussing the nature of the rights which the Indians obtained under the treaties, Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee in A.-G. Can. v. A.-G. Ont., A.-G. Que. v. A.-G. Ont., (1897) A.C. 199 at p. 213, said:\n\u201cTheir Lordships have had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that, under the treaties, the Indians obtained no right to their annuities, whether original or augmented beyond a promise and agreement, which was nothing more than a personal obligation by its governor, as representing the old province, that the latter should pay the annuities as and when they became due\u2026\u201d\nWhile this refers only to the annuities payable under the treaties, it is difficult to see that the other covenants in the treaties, including the one we are here concerned with, can stand on any higher footing. It is always to be kept in mind that the Indians surrendered their rights in the territory in exchange for these promises. This \u201cpromise and agreement\u201d, like any other, can, of course, be breached, and there is no law of which I am aware that would prevent Parliament by legislation, properly within s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, from doing so.\nHowever, parliament cannot legislate in contravention of the British North America Act and that is why the British North America Act 1930 is decisive in this case.\nA reading of Johnson J.A.\u2019s historical review in Sikyea, particularly at pp. 335-6, where he said:\nIt is, I think, clear that the rights given to the Indians by their treaties as they apply to migratory birds have been taken away by this Act and its Regulations. How are we to explain this apparent breach of faith on the part of the Government, for I cannot think it can be described in any other terms? This cannot be described as a minor or insignificant curtailment of these treaty rights, for game birds have always been a most plentiful, a most reliable and a readily obtainable food in large areas of Canada. I cannot believe that the Government of Canada realized that in implementing the Convention they were at the same time 1 breaching the treaties that they had made with the Indians. It is much more likely that these obligations under the treaties were overlooked\u2014a case of the left hand having forgotten what the right hand had done. The subsequent history of the Government\u2019s dealing with the Indians would seem to bear this out. When the treaty we are concerned with here was signed in 1921, only five years after the enactment of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, we find the Commissioners who negotiated the treaty reporting:\n\u201cThe Indians seemed afraid, for one thing, that their liberty to hunt, trap and fish would be taken away or curtailed, but were assured by me that this would not be the case, and the Government will expect them to support themselves in their own way, and, in fact, that more twine for nets and more ammunition were given under the terms of this treaty than under any of the preceding ones; this went a long way to calm their fears. I also pointed out that any game laws made were to their advantage, and, whether they took treaty or not, they were subject to the laws of the Dominion.\u201d\nand there is nothing in this report which would indicate that the Indians were told that their right to shoot migratory birds had already been taken away from them. I have referred to Art. 12 of the agreement between the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta signed in 1930 by which that Province was required to assure to the Indians the right of \u201chunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands\u201d. (The amendment to the B.N.A. Act (1930 (U.K.), c. 26) that confirmed this agreement, declared that it should \u201chave the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act\u2026 or any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u2026\u201d) It is of some importance that while the Indians in the Northwest Territories continued to shoot ducks at all seasons for food, it is only recently that any attempt has been made to enforce the Act.\nconfirms what I said in Sikyea and I am fortified in that view by the judgment of McGillivray J.A. in R. v. Wesley, particularly at pp. 283-4 where, in dealing with s. 12 of the Alberta agreement, identical in effect with s. 13 of the Manitoba agreement, he said:\nIn Canada the Indian treaties appear to have been judicially interpreted as being mere promises and agreements. See A.-G. Can. v. A.-G. Ont. (Indian Annuities case), (1897) A.C. 199, at p. 213.\nAssuming as I do that our treaties with Indians are on no higher plane than other formal agreements yet this in no wise makes it less the duty and obligation of the Crown to carry out the promises contained in those treaties with the exactness which honour and good conscience dictate and it is not to be thought that the Crown has departed from those equitable principles which the Senate and the House of Commons declared in addressing Her Majesty in 1867, uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aborigines.\nAt the time of the making of this Indian Treaty it was of first class importance to Canada that the Indians who had become restless after the sway of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. had come to an end, should become content and that such title or interest in land as they had should be peacefully surrendered to permit of settlement without hindrance of any kind. On the other hand it goes without saying that the Indians were greatly concerned with \u201ctheir vocations of hunting\u201d upon which they depended for their living.\nIn this connection it is of historical interest although of no assistance in the interpretation of the treaty, that Governor Laird who with Colonel Macleod negotiated this treaty, said to the Chiefs of the Indian tribes:\u2014\n\u201cI expect to listen to what you have to say today, but first, I would explain that it is your privilege to hunt all over the prairies, and that should you desire to sell any portion of your land, or any coal or timber from off your reserves, the Government will see that you receive just and fair prices, and that you can rely on all the Queen\u2019s promises being fulfilled.\u201d\nAnd again he said:\u2014\u201cThe reserve will be given to you without depriving you of the privilege to hunt over the plains until the land be taken up.\u201d\nIt is true that Government regulations in respect of hunting are contemplated in the Treaty but considering that Treaty in its proper setting I do not think that any of the makers of it could by any stretch of the imagination be deemed to have contemplated a day when the Indians would be deprived of an unfettered right to hunt game of all kinds for food on unoccupied Crown land.\nIn the case A.-G. v. Metropolitan Electric Supply Co., 74 L.J. Ch. 145, at p. 150, Farwell J., said:\u2014\n\u201cI think it is germane to the subject to consider what the Legislature had in view in making the provisions which I find in the Act of Parliament itself. As Lord Halsbury said in Eastman Photographic Materials Co. v. Comptroller General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks, (1898) (A.C. 571) referring to Heydon\u2019s Case (1584), (3 Co. Rep. 7a) \u2018We are to see what was the law before the Act was passed, and what was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided, what remedy Parliament appointed, and the reason of the remedy.\u2019 That is a very general way of stating it, but no doubt one is entitled to put one\u2019s self in the position in which the Legislature was at the time the Act was passed in order to see what was the state of knowledge as far as all the circumstances brought before the Legislature are concerned, for the purpose of seeing what it was the Legislature was aiming at.\u201d\nIf as Crown counsel contends, s. 12 taken as a whole gives rise to apparent inconsistency and is capable of two meanings then I still have no hesitation in saying in the light of all the external circumstances relative to Indian rights in this Dominion to which I have alluded, that the law makers in 1930 were in the making of this proviso, aiming at assuring to the Indians covered by the section, an unrestricted right to hunt for food in those unsettled places where game may be found, described in s. 12.\nIt was argued that para. 13 of the agreement in question is limited in its application solely to provincial laws because of the presence of the clause \u201cwhich the Province hereby assures to them\u201d, in the sentence under consideration. That clause inserted parenthetically between commas cannot derogate from the thrust of the principal clause which contains the specific declaration \u201cthat the said Indians shall have the right,\u2026of hunting, trapping and \u2022 fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year\u201d. In my view it adds emphasis to the declaration by making manifest the application of the declaration to the Province as though the clause read \u201cwhich the Province also hereby assures to them\u201d.\nIf all that s. 13 of the agreement was intended to achieve in 1930 was a declaration by the Province that Indians were to have the right to fish, hunt and trap for food at all seasons of the year, it was, according to that interpretation, an empty, futile and misleading gesture. Either the Indians then had those rights or they did not have them for the Migratory Birds Convention Act had been on the statute books since 1917. The only interpretation that makes sense is the one that acknowledges that the right of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year existed in 1930 regardless of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Federal Government wanted those rights to continue notwithstanding the transfer to the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta of the unalienated natural resources withheld when the Provinces were formed. What logic could there have been in having the Provinces assure to Indians non-existing rights?\nThe Federal authority was already under treaty obligation contained in Treaties 5 and 6 which read:\nHer Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes, by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said Government.\nto preserve the Indians\u2019 right to hunt and fish for food at all seasons of the year, and it was merely making certain that the Provinces would accord the same rights when they got control of the unalienated Crown lands. The obligation of Canada to preserve the right to hunt and fish for food at all seasons was an historical one arising out of the rights of Indians as original inhabitants of the territories from which Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta were carved and arising out of the treaties above mentioned. The subject of aboriginal rights as they apply to Indians of Western Canada and the effect of the treaties made with the Indians were dealt with by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Regina v. White and Bob[18]. This Court upheld that decision in an oral judgment[19] as follows:\nMr. Justice Cartwright delivered the following oral judgment:\n\u201cMr. Berger, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Christie. We do not find it necessary to hear you. We are all of the opinion that the majority in the Court of appeal were right in their conclusion that the document, Exhibit 8, was a \u2018treaty\u2019 within the meaning of that term as used in s. 87 of the Indian Act (R.S.C. 1952, c. 149). We therefore think that in the circumstances of the case, the operation of s. 25 of the Game Act (R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 160) was excluded by reason of the existence of that treaty.\u201d\nIt follows that if Exhibit 8 in White and Bob which reads:\nKnow all men that we the Chiefs and people of the Sanitch Tribe who have signed our names and made our marks to this Deed, on the 6th day of February 1852 do consent to surrender entirely and forever, to James Douglas the Agent of the Hudsons Bay Company, in Vancouver Island that is to say for the Governor Deputy Governor and Committee of the same, the whole of the lands situate and lying between Mount Douglas and Cowitchen Head on the Canal de Arro and extending thence to the line running through the centre of Vancouver Island north and south.\nThe condition of, or understanding of this sale, is this, that our village sites and enclosed fields, are to be kept for our own use, for the use of our children, and for those who may follow after us, and the lands shall be properly surveyed hereafter; it is understood however, that the land itself with these small exceptions, becomes the entire property of the white people forewer; it is also understood that we are at liberty to hunt over the unoccupied lands, and to carry on our fisheries as formerly. We have received as payment\u2014Forty one pounds thirteen shillings and four pence.\u2014In token whereof we have signed our names, and made our marks at Fort Victoria, on the seventh day of February, One thousand eight hundred and fifty two.\n(Emphasis added.)\nwas a treaty within s. 87 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, so are Treaties 5 and 6 aforesaid.\nSoon after the agreement in question was entered into, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Smith[20], dealt with the effect of s. 12 of the Saskatchewan agreement which is identical with s. 13 now under review and in that case Turgeon J.A. (later C.J.S.) said:\nAlthough this case is of great interest and importance I do not think it will be necessary in disposing of it to examine minutely the state of the law existing prior to recent date, nor the Indian treaty or treaties referred to in the argument. If these treaties, or the various Dominion or provincial statutes referred to have any present bearing on the case it is only in so far as they may throw some light upon the interpretation of certain words in the instrument which, in my opinion, now governs the relations of these Indians with the game laws of Saskatchewan, and to which I am about to refer.\nThe 24th enumeration of sec. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, ch. 3, confers upon the parliament of Canada exclusive jurisdiction upon the subject of \u201cIndians and Lands Reserved for the Indians,\u201d while, on the other hand, the provinces have power to make laws concerning the hunting, fishing, preservation, etc. of game in the province. As a result, controversies have arisen in the past as to the application of provincial game laws to Indians: Rex v. Rodgers (1923) 2 W.W.R. 353, 33 Man. R. 139, 40 C.C.C. 51.\nBut in the years 1929 and 1930 something occurred which, in my opinion, had the effect of recasting the jurisdiction of the province of Saskatchewan in respect to the operation of its game laws upon our Indian population. In December, 1929, an agreement was entered into between the Dominion and the province having for its primary object the transfer from the one to the other of the natural resources within the province. This transfer was accompanied by many terms, some of which had to do with matters pertaining to the Indians. Among these is par. 12 of the agreement, which reads as follows (L.R. 1929-30, p. 293):\n12. In order to secure to the Indians of the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.\nIt is admitted in this case that the accused was hunting for food.\nThis agreement between the Dominion and the province was made \u201csubject to its being approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the Province\u201d and also to confirmation by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ratification by the Imperial Parliament was necessary in so far at least as the agreement purported to make any change in the constitutional powers of the Dominion or of the province. In a recent decision of this Court, Rex v. Zaslavsky, ante p. 34, the learned Chief Justice quoted from the remarks of Lord Watson in the course of the argument in C.P.R. v. Notre Dame de Bonsecours Parish (1899) A.C. 367, 68 L.J.P.C. 54. The statement quoted by the learned Chief Justice may fittingly be repeated here:\nThe Dominion cannot give jurisdiction or leave jurisdiction with the province. The provincial Parliament cannot give legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion Parliament. If they have it, either one or the other of them, they have it by virtue of the Act of 1867. I think we must get rid of the idea that either one or other can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction.\nConsequently no legislative jurisdiction can be taken from the Dominion Parliament and bestowed upon a provincial Legislature, or vice versa, without the intervention of the parliament of the United Kingdom.\nThe Imperial statute confirming the agreement is 1930, 20 & 21 Geo. V., ch. 26, sec. 1 of which enacts that the agreement shall have the force of law \u201cnotwithstanding anything in the British North America Act of 1867 or any Act amending the same,\u201d etc. It follows therefore that, whatever the situation may have been in earlier years the extent to which Indians are now exempted from the operation of the game laws of Saskatchewan is to be determined by an interpretation of par. 12, supra, given force of law by this Imperial statute. This paragraph says that the Indians are to have the right to hunt, trap and fish for food in all seasons \u201con all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access\u201d.\nFor the purposes of the present inquiry we can confine ourselves to Crown lands (excluding lands owned by individuals as to which some other question might arise) because this game preserve is Crown land. The question then is (1) is it unoccupied Crown land, or (2) is it occupied Crown land to which the Indians have a right of access? If it is either of these no offence was committed by the accused.\n(Emphasis added.)\nCounsel for the accused, in proposing a test for the meaning which must be given to the word \u201coccupied\u201d and \u201cunoccupied\u201d referred to the treaty made between the Crown and certain tribes of Indians near Carlton, on August 23, 1876, whereby, on the one hand, these Indians consented to the surrender of their title of whatsoever nature in an area of which this game preserve forms part and, on the other hand, the Crown undertook certain obligations towards them and assured them certain rights and privileges. As I have said, it is proper to consult this treaty in order to glean from it whatever may throw some light on the meaning to be given to the words in question. I would even say that we should endeavour, within the bounds of propriety, to give such meaning to these words as would establish the intention of the Crown and the Legislature to maintain the rights accorded to the Indians by the treaty.\n(Emphasis added.)\nI have already dealt with the meaning of s. 13 of the Manitoba agreement. To me it is clear and unambiguous and by s. 1 of the British North America Act 1930 which reads:\n1. The agreements set out in the Schedule to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act as aforesaid.\nhas the force of law, notwithstanding \u201cany Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d. The Migratory Birds Convention Act is an Act of the Parliament of Canada. One would suppose that that should end the matter, but it is urged that s. 1 of the British North America Act 1930 does not necessarily refer to every provision of the agreement and, in particular, that s. 13 is outside the plain and unambiguous language of the Act in that Ottawa and Westminster could not conceivably have intended s. 13 to take precedence over the Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1917. One should, I think, be slow to accept the argument that the negotiators of the Manitoba agreement and Parliament at Ottawa were in 1929 and 1930 totally forgetful of the existence of the Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1917. Rather is it not more logical that knowing of the solemnity with which the Indian treaties had been negotiated and how highly they were regarded by the Indians, neither the negotiators of the agreement nor the Government at Ottawa had the slightest intention of breaching those treaties.\nIf it had been intended that the Migratory Birds Convention Act should take precedence, it would have been a simple matter to have said so in the agreement or in the Manitoba Natural Resources Act . Much would have to be read into s. 13 of the agreement to make it subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act. I am not prepared to add exclusions which Parliament and Westminster did not see fit to do.\nIt is argued that this is a case for the application of the rule of construction that Parliament is not presumed to legislate in breach of a treaty or in any manner inconsistent with the comity of nations and the established rules of international law. The rule does not, of course, come into operation if a statute is unambiguous for in that event its provisions must be followed even if they are contrary to the established rules of international law. The case of Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Collco Dealings Ltd.[21] is a case in which this very argument was made. In that case the Court was being asked to read into a section of the Income Tax Act 1952 additional words which would enlarge the meaning of the section so as to include persons not included by the precise words of the enactment but which were included under an agreement between the British Government and the Republic of Ireland providing for exemption from tax where the claimant was a resident in the Republic of Ireland and was not a resident in the United Kingdom.\nIn dealing with the argument, Viscount Simonds said at pp. 18 and 19:\nIt has been urged that the general words of the subsection should be so construed as not to have the effect of imposing or appearing to impose the will of Parliament upon persons not within its jurisdiction. This argument, which had influenced the special commissioners, was not advanced before this House. A somewhat similar argument was, however, pressed upon your Lordships and was perhaps more strongly than any other relied on by the appellant company. It was to the effect that to apply section 4(2) to the appellant company would create a breach of the 1926 and following agreements, and would be inconsistent with the comity of nations and the established rules of international law: the subsection must, accordingly, be so construed as to avoid this result.\nMy Lords, the language that I have used is taken from a passage at p. 148 of the 10th edition of \u201cMaxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes\u201d which ends with the sentence: \u201cBut if the statute is unambiguous, its provisions must be followed even if they are contrary to international law.\u201d It would not, I think, be possible to state in clearer language and with less ambiguity the determination of the legislature to put an end in all and every case to a practice which was a gross misuse of a concession. What, after all, is involved in the argument of the appellant? It is nothing else than that, when Parliament said \u201cunder any enactment,\u201d it meant \u201cany enactment except\u2026\u201d But it was not found easy to state precisely the terms of the exception. The best that I could get was \u201cexcept an enactment which is part of a reciprocal arrangement with a sovereign foreign state.\u201d It is said that the plain words of the statute are to be disregarded and these words arbitrarily inserted in order to observe the comity of nations and the established rules of international law. I am not sure upon which of these high-sounding phrases the appellant company chiefly relies. But I would answer that neither comity nor rule of international law can be invoked to prevent a sovereign state from taking what steps it thinks fit to protect its own revenue laws from gross abuse, or to save its own citizens from unjust discrimination in favour of foreigners. To demand that the plain words of the statute should be disregarded in order to do that very thing is an extravagance to which this House will not, I hope, give ear.\nI would paraphrase the latter part of this statement as follows in applying it to the Indians of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta by saying: But I would answer that neither comity nor rule of international law can be invoked to prevent a sovereign state (Canada) from taking what steps it thinks fit to protect its own aboriginal population (Indians) from being deprived of their ancient rights to hunt and to fish for food assured to them in Treaties 5 and 6 made with them.\nIt took those steps when it included s. 13 of the Manitoba agreement, confirmed by the Manitoba Natural Re- sources Act and petitioned Parliament at Westminster to enact s. 1 of the British North America Act 1930. If there is inconsistency or repugnancy between the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Manitoba Natural Resources Act the later prevails over the earlier; British Columbia Railway Co. v. Stewart[22] and Summers v. Holborn District Board of Works[23]. It is difficult, I think, to find language more forthright and less ambiguous than s. 1 of the British North America Act 1930. To repeat, it reads:\n1. The agreements set out in the Schedule to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act as aforesaid.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal and quash the conviction. The appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Courts below.\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The facts are summarized in the reasons of my brother Judson with whom I am in agreement.\nI wish to add that, in my view, this is a case for the application of the rule of construction that Parliament is not presumed to legislate in breach of a treaty or in any manner inconsistent with the comity of nations and the established rules of international law. It is a rule that is not often applied, because if a statute is unambiguous, its provisions must be followed even if they are contrary to international law, as was said recently in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Collco Dealings Ltd.[24], where all relevant authorities are reviewed. In that case, the House of Lords came to the conclusion that the intent of Parliament was clear and unmistakable and, therefore, the plain words of a statute could not be disregarded in order to observe the comity of nations and the established rules of international law. However, the principle of construction was recognized as applicable in a proper case.\nHere we must not be misled by the clear and unambiguous provision of section 1 of the British North America Act 1930 into believing that, because it is there said that the agreement shall have the force of law notwithstanding any act of the Parliament of Canada, every provision of the agreement was intended to override all federal legislation.\nThe question to be decided is whether in par. 13 of the agreement, the words \u201cCanada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof\u201d contemplate laws of Canada as well as laws of Manitoba. The language certainly is not that which one would normally use in referring to both classes of laws. It is rather the language one would be expected to use in a provision intended to subject the Indians to provincial game laws. This is further borne out by the fact that the proviso on which this appeal is based is in a form of an assurance by the province only. Can it be said that where Canada stipulates in the agreement: \u201cthat the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year\u2026\u201d the intention was expressed in clear language and without ambiguity to amend the Migratory Birds Convention Act contrary to Canada\u2019s international obligations? In my view, the least that can be said is that the intention to derogate from the statute implementing the treaty is not clearly expressed. It is perfectly possible without doing violence to the language used to construe the provision under consideration as applicable solely to provincial laws and thus to avoid any conflict.\nIt must also be considered that an agreement is not to be construed as applying to anything beyond its stated scope unless the intention to do so is unmistakable. Here the purpose of the agreement is stated in its preamble to be that the Province be placed in a position of equality with the other provinces with respect to the administration and control of its natural resources. It is quite consistent with this declared object to provide that provincial laws respecting the use of some resources, namely fish and game, shall apply to Indians subject to a restriction the effect of which is to carry out Canada\u2019s treaty obligations towards the Indians in that respect. On the other hand, it would not only be foreign to this object but even inconsistent with it, to provide for an implied modification of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. The result would be to enact a provision having no relation with the stated purpose of the agreement and also to create a lack of uniformity by establishing in favour of the Indians in one province an exception that does not exist in favour of the Indians in other provinces.\nIn Danby v. Coutts & Co.[25], it was held that a power of attorney granted in general terms for the purpose stated in the recitals, to act for the grantor during his absence from England, must be construed as limited to the duration of such absence. Concerning statutes, Maxwell says (The Interpretation of Statutes, 11th ed., p. 79): \u201cGeneral words and phrases, therefore, however wide and comprehensive they may be in their literal sense, must, usually, be construed as being limited to the actual objects of the Act.\u201d and he adds quoting Lord Halsbury in Leach v. Rex[26], \u201cIt would be \u2018perfectly monstrous\u2019 to construe the general words of the Act so as to alter the previous policy of the law.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and RITCHIE, HALL and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.R.

An action brought by Runnymede Investment Corporation Ltd. for foreclosure of a mortgage against Louis Mayzel and City Parking Ltd. was discontinued by Runnymede, but prior to the discontinuance a counterclaim was commenced by Mayzel against Runnymede and Rexdale Investments Ltd. The aim of the counterclaim was to set aside the sale of an interest in certain lands, which interest had been sold to Rexdale by Runnymede on October 6, 1964, relying on a power of sale in a mortgage of that interest from Mayzel to Runnymede. The latter mortgage had been given to Runnymede to secure an extension of time on two other mortgages held by Runnymede on adjoining lands owned by Mayzel. All three mortgages were in default on May 20, 1964, when a notice of sale was given by Runnymede.\nThe Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 245, s. 29 (rep. & sub. 1964, c. 64, ss. 4 and 5) provides that a mortgagee shall not exercise a power of sale unless a notice of such exercise in the form prescribed has been given to certain persons enumerated by the Act. Mayzel would have been one of such persons. Section 8 of the same Act provides that the foregoing provision \u201capplies where proceedings under a power of sale are commenced on or after the 1st day of September, 1964.\u201d\nThe exercise of the power was upheld by the trial judge and an appeal from his decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Mayzel then appealed to this Court. Runnymede and Rexdale submitted that the proceedings under the power of sale were commenced by the notice given on May 20, 1964, and that they were consequently outside the legislation in question.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the proceedings under the power of sale were commenced by the notice of May 20, 1964; that these proceedings were never abandoned and that the right subsisted and continued up to October 6, 1964; and that negotiations between Mayzel and Runnymede which were running concurrently with the sale proceedings did not constitute a withdrawal or an abandonment of the proceedings.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Haines J. Appeal dismissed.\nClaude R. Thomson, for the appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014We are concerned in this appeal with the counterclaim of Louis Mayzel against Runnymede Investment Corporation Limited and Rexdale Investments Limited. In this counterclaim Mayzel asked for a declaration that the exercise of the power of sale in a certain mortgage given by him to Runnymede Investment Corporation Limited was a nullity. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have upheld the exercise of the power.\nMayzel says that the exercise of the power is a nullity because it offends s. 29 of The Mortgages Act, which was enacted by 1964 Statutes of Ontario, c. 64, s. 5. This legislation came into force on September 1, 1964. The new s. 29(1) provides:\n29. (1) A mortagee shall not exercise a power of sale unless a notice of exercising the power of sale (Form 1) has been given by him to the following persons, other than the persons having an interest in the mortgaged property prior to that of the mortgagee and the persons subject to whose rights the mortgaged property is being sold:\nThere is a transitional provision in the 1964 legislation contained in s. 8, which reads as follows:\n8. The Mortgages Act, as amended by this Act, applies where proceedings under a power of sale are commenced on or after the 1st day of September, 1964.\nMayzel\u2019s argument is that the proceedings under the power of sale were commenced on or after September 1, 1964. Runnymede and Rexdale submit that the proceedings were commenced by a notice given on May 20, 1964, and that they are consequently outside the new legislation. This is the only issue involved in this appeal.\nMayzel was the owner in fee of two parcels of land on University Avenue. These were subject to mortgages which were vested in Runnymede as mortgagee. There were encumbrances prior to these mortgages. Mayzel was also interested in land known as 137 Richmond Street West, which adjoined the two freehold parcels. His interest in 137 Richmond Street West was a right to acquire a leasehold interest from Principal Investments Limited. This leasehold enjoyed a right of perpetual renewal every twenty-one years at an agreed or arbitrated amount as ground rental. To secure an extension of time on the mortgages on the freehold lands on University Avenue, Mayzel gave a mortgage to Runnymede on his right to acquire the leasehold interest in 137 Richmond Street West. All three mortgages were in default on May 20, 1964, when Run- nymede Investment Corporation Limited gave the following notice of sale. It applied both to the freehold lands and the leasehold interest. It is in the following form:\nMay 20, 1964.\nMr. Norton Penturn,\nJohn Penturn & Son Limited,\n25 Adelaide Street West,\nToronto 1,\nOntario.\nMortgagee\u2019s sale of freehold and\nleasehold land\nWe wish to inform you that written Offers to Purchase will be considered by us at the offices of Messrs. McDonald, Davies & Ward, 4 King Street West, Toronto 1, on Friday May 29, 1964 at 12:00 o\u2019clock noon, in respect of the lands described in the enclosed sketch. The lands are vacant except for a service station building located at the northeast corner of the property.\nThe portion of the property outlined in red is leasehold land subject to a perpetually renewable lease which provides for a current rental of $7,200 per annum. Such rental to be re-negotiated and if necessary settled by arbitration in 1970 for the ensuing twenty\u2011one year term and so on from term to term. The balance of the property is freehold land which will be sold subject only to an existing first mortgage for $800,000 due as to the principal amount on October 1, 1971 with interest only payable during the term at the rate of $4,600.03 per month.\nThe area of the property is approximately 60,000 square feet; the 1963 real estate taxes were approximately $74,000 and we understand (without warranty thereof) that the net rental income derived from the property is approximately $55,000 per annum.\nA deposit equal to 10% of the purchase price, in cash or by certified cheque, will be required upon the submission of any Offer to Purchase. The balance of the purchase price shall be payable in cash or by certified cheque on June 12, 1964. The freehold portion of this property is being sold by us as third mortgage under and by virtue of the power of sale without notice contained in a first mortgage upon the said leasehold interest.\nIn connection with this sale we refer you to our letter of October 24, 1963, which was mailed to you. The sale contemplated by that letter was abandoned because of the furnishing by the mortgagor of the adjoining leasehold property as additional security for us. As this additional mortgage is now in default and the original mortgage has continued in default we are now entitled to sell the two properties together.\nYours very truly,\nRUNNYMEDE INVESTMENT CORP. LTD.\nLouis Charles\nLC\/ej\nEnc. This notice was sent to forty of the leading real estate agents in Toronto and a copy was also sent to Mr. Mayzel and his solicitor.\nMayzel\u2019s right to acquire an assignment of the leasehold interest from Principal Investments was in serious jeopardy. The purchase price was $250,000 with a $10,000 deposit. The purchase should have been completed on December 17, 1962, but because of litigation concerning the validity of the right of perpetual renewal, there were extensions from time to time. The closing date was finally extended to October 6, 1964. On that date Mayzel required almost $250,000 to save the property.\nThere were continuous negotiations between Runnymede and Mayzel from the date of the notice, May 20, 1964, to the date of closing of the purchase of the leasehold interest, October 6, 1964. Mayzel\u2019s object in these negotiations was to come to some kind of agreement with Runnymede about the ultimate disposition of the property. It is admitted that no such agreement was made but on October 6, 1964, Mayzel consented to the sale from Runnymede to Rexdale of his right to acquire the leasehold interest in the hope that he would be able to come to a subsequent arrangement with the person who controlled both Runnymede and Rexdale. He signed a direction, dated October 5, 1964, to Principal Investments to assign the lease to Rexdale Investments Limited in the following terms:\nTO: National Trust Company,\nReceiver-Manager of\nPrincipal Investments Limited.\nRE: Principal Investments Limited sale to\nMayzel. Principal Investments Leaseholds\nPlease make the Assignment of the Lease between John Elias Gibson and Principal Investments Limited, dated December 15th, 1949, and registered in the Registry Office for the City of Toronto on December 4th, 1950, as Instrument Number 31971E.S. to REXDALE INVESTMENTS LIMITED, a Company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario.\nThis shall be your good and sufficient authority for so doing.\nDATED at Toronto this 5th day of October, 1964.\nWITNESS:\n(sgd)\nVera Christoff\n(sgd)\nLouis Mayzel\nLOUIS MAYZEL On October 6, 1964, Runnymede, for a consideration of $65,000, assigned to Rexdale all the right, title and interest of Mayzel to purchase the leasehold interest in 137 Richmond Street West under the agreement of October 19, 1962, made between Mayzel and Principal Investments.\nI have mentioned that both Runnymede and Rexdale were under the same control but Mayzel, as appellant, declined to attack the transaction on this ground. He could not very well do so. He had released his interest in the property in favour of Runnymede and Rexdale in the hope that he would be able to make a subsequent agreement with them. This is more than acquiescence. He confines his attack on the transaction to the legislation amending The Mortgages Act in 1964. This legislation came into force, as I have said, on September 1, 1964, over a month before the exercise of the power of sale on October 6, 1964.\nThe Court of Appeal has held that the proceedings under the power of sale were commenced by the notice of May 20, 1964; that these proceedings were never abandoned and that the right subsisted and continued up to October 6, 1964; and that the negotiations which were running concurrently with the sale proceedings did not constitute a withdrawal or an abandonment of the proceedings. With this conclusion I agree.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Claude R. Thomson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Arnup, Foulds, Weir, Boeckh, Morris & Robinson, Toronto.\n"

Fudge (Defendants) Respondents.\n1968: February 27, 28; 1968: April 29.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Planning legislation\u2014Subsidiary land use bylaw\u2014\u201dIndustrial\u201d and \u201caccessory\u201d uses\u2014Whether lumber warehouse and wholesale and retail outlet a permitted use.\nThe appellant carried on a wholesale and retail lumber business and having lost its premises through expropriation planned to continue the business at a new location. The appellant filed an application for the issuance of a permit for the erection of a building having a total floor area of approximately 16,000 square feet of which 3,000 square feet or approximately 18\u00be per cent was to consist of \u201cfloor space to be used as a showroom and retail sales space\u201d. The respondent building inspector refused the application for a permit being of the opinion that the erection of the building was prevented by the provisions of a subsidiary land use by-law of the respondent township. The appellant then moved for an order by way of mandamus and the motion resulted in the granting of an order requiring the respondents to issue a building permit in the terms of the application made by the appellant. An appeal by the respondents from the order of the judge of first instance was allowed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe question to be determined was whether a lumber warehouse and wholesale and retail business came within the extended definition of the words \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201cindustrial use\u201d in the by-law in question. It was significant that neither wholesaling nor retailing was mentioned in that extended definition so that the only way in which a wholesale or retail lumber outlet could come within the permitted use would be that it was an \u201caccessory\u201d use to \u201cwarehousing and storage within enclosed buildings\u201d. What was decisive, was that the wholesale and\/or retail selling was not accessory to the warehousing or storage but, in fact, the warehousing or storage was incidental to the wholesale and retail selling. There could be no other purpose for the building than to sell lumber therefrom at either wholesale or retail, and for that purpose and that purpose only to store the lumber which was to be sold.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, whereby that Court allowed an appeal by the respondents from an order of Moorhouse J. granting the appellant a mandamus requiring the respondents to issue a building permit.

By the latter order, the learned judge of first instance had granted a mandamus requiring the respondents to issue a building permit upon an application made by the appellant.\nThe Corporation of the Township of Markham had enacted an official land use by-law with attached to and forming part thereof an official land use plan. This land use plan covered the whole of the Township of Markham except certain incorporated municipalities and was intended to be an over-all plan from which more detailed plans would be involved for the various areas and communities. One of those areas was subsequently covered by the enactment on October 9, 1962, of By-law 1957. That by\u2011law affected, inter alia, lands on Woodbine Avenue in the said Township of Markham, a short distance north of Steeles Avenue, being part of lot 2, concession 4 in the Township of Markham. These lands were subsequently purchased by the appellant and the appellant proposed to erect thereon the building the subject of the application for permit.\nThe appellant had engaged in a wholesale and retail lumber business with premises on the north side of Sheppard Avenue at Leslie Street, and having lost those premises through expropriation planned to continue the business at the premises in question.\nThe appellant filed an application for the issuance of a permit for the erection of a building having a total floor area of approximately 16,000 square feet of which 3,000 square feet or approximately 18\u00be per cent was to onsist of \u201cfloor space to be used as a showroom and retail sales space\u201d. In the letter accompanying this application, the solicitors for the appellant stated:\nThe proposed uses of the building comply with your By-law under Clause 8(ii)(a) as to the major portion of the building. However, you will see on the Plans that the building is to include a part at the front for retailing products of Oriole Lumber Limited. The respondent Fudge, as building inspector of the respondent Corporation of the Township of Markham, refused the application for a permit being of the opinion that the erection of the building was prevented by the provisions of By-law 1957. The relevant portions of the said By\u2011law 1957 are as follows:\nDEFINITIONS\n2. (i) \u201cAccessory\u201d when used to describe a use shall mean a use naturally and normally incidental, subordinate and exclusively devoted to a main use and located on the same lot.\n. . .\n(xxvi) \u201cUse\u201d shall mean the purpose for which land or a building is arranged, designed or intended or for which either land or a building or structure is, or may be, occupied or maintained.\n* * *\nPERMITTED LAND USE\n8. No person shall hereafter use any building, structure or land and no person shall erect any building or structure in the area defined as shown on Schedule \u201cA\u201d, for any purpose other than one or more of the following uses, namely:\n(i) A dwelling for a caretaker of a manufacturing or industrial undertaking permitted under Sub-section (ii) provided that the requirements of By-law Number 1442 of the Township of Markham are complied with or an apartment for a caretaker of a manufacturing or industrial undertaking permitted under Sub-section (ii), provided that the total ground floor area of the said manufacturing or industrial undertaking is not less than 30,000 square feet.\n(ii) Industrial Uses which shall include:\n(a) Warehousing and storage within enclosed buildings, and the assembly of manufactured products, such as textiles, wood, paper, light metal sections, radio and television equipment and other similar products, and also the manufacture within enclosed buildings of radio and television equipment, drugs, cosmetics, jewellry, and watches, toys, publishing and bookbinding, office equipment, sanitation products and any other light manufacturing operations which are not obnoxious by reason of the erosion or emittance of any noise, smoke, odour, dust, gas fumes, refuse or water carried waste;\n(b) Shops for the repair or manufacturing within enclosed buildings, of small goods and wares, laundries and dry-cleaning plants, bakeries, printers, dyers, storage warehouses, chemical products, paper and paper boxes, electrical products, canning and food plants, aluminum products, and any other manufacturing or industrial establishment within an enclosed building which is not obnoxious by reason of the emission of odour, dust, smoke, noise, gas fumes, cinders, vibration, refuse matter, water carried waste, or unsightly open storage;\nPublic Utilities\n(iii) All public utilities and essential public services including railway trackage, industrial spurs and supporting tracks, but not including schools.\nThe learned judge of first instance granted the application for the mandamus without written reasons. Schroeder J.A., giving the judgment for the Court of Appeal, was of the opinion that the word \u201cindustrial\u201d by ordinary definition intended a use which was primarily one involving the art of production or manufacture of some item, and that it involved activity or labour whereby a saleable commodity was created or produced. Of course, it is not intended that in this warehouse and wholesale and retail lumber outlet there should be activity or labour resulting in the creation of a product but merely the storing of such products and their sale at wholesale or retail. Schroeder J.A. continued to point out that the ordinary meaning of \u201cindustrial use\u201d had been expanded by By-law 1957 in para. 8(ii)(a) to include matters well beyond the ordinary definitions of \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201cindustrial use\u201d by including warehousing and storage \u201cwithin enclosed buildings\u201d. He dealt with the proposition of the appellant that wholesaling and retailing of lumber was \u201can accessory use\u201d of warehousing premises so as to bring it within para. 2(i) of the said by-law quoted above by pointing out that although the respondent had, without conceding, refrained from urging that a wholesale lumber business was not \u201can accessory\u201d to a warehouse and storage business, nevertheless, a retail business could only be characterized as an accessory to a wholesale and that therefore to permit the building proposed was to engraft an accessory upon an accessory.\nIt was the basis of the official plan that there should be a series of categories of use of premises and to those categories the municipal council assigned various designations. It is these designations which are the vocabulary of the legislative scheme for use of lands within the township and which should govern the primary determination of whether a proposed building is in accordance with the various subsidiary land use by-laws such as By-law 1957. There was produced as ex. \u201cE\u201d to the affidavit of Hein Cats filed upon the application for permit, a copy of the official plan of the township. That plan shows a designation of all lands within the township under various designations, i.e., urban residential, rural residential, rural, major open space, institutional and transportation, highway frontage, industrial, and community commercial (the order of the naming is not significant). That such designations do not always accurately reflect ordinary definitions may be illustrated by noting that there are shown on the final plan several golf and country clubs which all bear the hatch marking indicating that they are for \u201cinstitutional and transportation use\u201d. Therefore, without having to refer to the dictionary definitions of the word \u201cindustrial\u201d it is sufficient to note that the legislators intended to distinguish between \u201cindustrial use\u201d and \u201ccommercial use\u201d.\nIn my view, much of the argument before this Court as to whether a lumber warehouse and wholesale and retail business was industrial has become academic. That type of business would certainly have been commercial in the allocation of it to either a \u201ccommercial\u201d or \u201cindustrial\u201d classification. So it matters not whether it could ordinarily have been termed \u201cindustrial\u201d as well as \u201ccommercial\u201d. The question therefore to be determined is whether this business comes within the extended definition of the words \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201cindustrial use\u201d in s. 8, para, (ii) of the by-law. It is significant that neither wholesaling nor retailing is mentioned in that extended definition so that the only way in which a wholesale or retail lumber outlet could come within the permitted use in the said 8(ii)(a) would be that it was an accessory to \u201cwarehousing and storage within enclosed buildings\u201d.\nWhether warehousing should be confined, as was argued by the respondent, to providing a building for the storage of goods of others consigned to one\u2019s care and custody for a fee, or whether it has a much wider connotation, need not, in my opinion, be decided, although the additional words \u201cand storage within enclosed buildings\u201d would seem to indicate the wider definition. What is decisive, is that the wholesale and\/or retail selling is not accessory to the warehousing or storage but, in fact, the warehousing or storage is incidental to the wholesale and retail selling. There can be no other purpose for the building as illustrated graphi- cally by the plan filed by the appellant than to sell lumber therefrom at either wholesale or retail, and for that purpose and that purpose only to store the lumber which is to be sold. It is the place where the stock-in-trade of the business is kept to. be sold just as much as it is in the case of a retail hardware store. I am, therefore, of the opinion that there can be no inclusion within the permitted use of a wholesale and retail lumber outlet by any allegation that it is accessory to a warehousing business.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rohmer, Cory & Haley, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mingay & Shibley, Toronto.\n"

Jones, [1968] S.C.R. 554\nDate: 1968-04-29\nArthur D. Wilson (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJoan DeLancey Jones (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1968: February 5, 6; 1968: April 29.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014By-law restricting use of lands\u2014Interpretation\u2014Designated area restricted to \u201cprivate residences\u201d or \u201cduplex dwellings\u201d\u2014Whether building containing 17 apartments a permitted use.\nUnder By-law 1275 of the Town of Niagara, enacted in 1950, a defined area in the town was designated as a residential area and it was provided in s. 4(a) that all land within the said area \u201cshall be used [subject to certain exceptions] for private residences\u2026\u201d. By an amending by-law, enacted in 1951, the words \u201cor duplex dwellings\u201d were added after the words \u201cprivate residences\u201d in the said s. 4(a). In 1965 the building inspector for Niagara issued to the defendant a permit to erect a 2\u00bd-story building to contain 17 separate suites. The building was to have two entrances, one at the front and the other at the rear, and these were to open into corridors. Each apartment was to have its own private entrance into the corridors.\nAn action for an injunction restraining the construction of the proposed building was dismissed by the trial judge, who was of the view that the various apartments were \u201cprivate residences\u201d and that therefore the erection of the building was not prohibited by By-law 1275 as amended. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal and directed the issuing of an injunction. An appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words to be construed were \u201cprivate residences\u201d or \u201cduplex dwellings\u201d and the standard to be used was to \u201cconstrue in an ordinary or popular and not in a legal or technical sense\u201d. These were ordinary words which were easily understood by everyone in the business of building, buying, or selling housing accommodation.\nWhat was contemplated in the erection of the proposed building was not private residences but many private residences under one roof plus communal accommodation, i.e., in plain and ordinary terms, an apartment house. Such a building was not within the by-law.\nRogers v. Hosegood, [1900] 2 Ch. 388, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Grant J. Appeal dismissed.\nB. James Thomson, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on November 2, 1966. That Court, by a majority judgment, allowed an appeal from the judgment of Grant J. pronounced on January 11, 1966. In the latter judgment, Grant J. had refused the respondent, a ratepayer, an injunction which she had sought under the provisions of s. 486 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 249, which reads as follows:\n486. Where any by-law of a municipality or of a local board thereof, passed under the authority of this or any other general or special Act, is contravened, in addition to any other remedy and to any penalty imposed by the by-law, such contravention may be restrained by action at the instance of a ratepayer or the corporation or local board.\nThe Town of Niagara, in the Province of Ontario, had on December 12, 1950, enacted By-law 1275 purporting to be a by-law to restrict the use of lands and to regulate and restrict the construction and use of buildings and structures within a defined area. Section 2 of that by\u2011law provided:\n2. THAT the use of land or the construction or use of buildings or structures within Zone \u201cA\u201d, other than for such purposes as may be permitted by this by-law, is hereby prohibited. And in s. 4 provided, in part\n4. THAT Zone \u201cA\u201d shall be and it is hereby designated as a residential area and the following provisions and restrictions shall apply:\n(a) All land lying within Zone \u201cA\u201d shall be used except as hereinafter provided, for private residences and the use of such land for trade, business, commercial or industrial activity is prohibited.\n(b) The erection or use of any building or structure within the said Zone, for any trade, business, commercial or industrial activity or purpose, except as hereinafter provided, is hereby prohibited and such buildings or structures shall be used for private residences only.\n(c) Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit the erection or use of any residence in the said Zone by a physician, surgeon or dentist for the purpose of carrying on the practice of his profession, or the use of any residence in the said Zone as a boarding house, lodging house or house furnishing meals, or by a mortician as a funeral home.\nThe Town of Niagara amended that by-law by By-law 1294 enacted on June 5, 1951, and for the purpose of this decision the only portion of the amendment with which we are concerned is the addition of the words \u201cor duplex dwellings\u201d after the words \u201cprivate residences\u201d in s. 4, para. (a) of the said By-law 1275.\nThe appellant applied for the issuance of a building permit to allow him to build in Zone \u201cA\u201d a certain building which is outlined on floor plans produced and marked as an exhibit, and which is further delineated as being similar to the photograph of the building which he had built in another municipality also produced and marked as an exhibit.\nThe building inspector of the Town of Niagara on June 16, 1965, issued to the appellant a building permit to erect the said building in accordance with the plans filed and which had been approved by the said building inspector.\nAt the trial of the issue, counsel agreed that if By-law 1275 as amended were valid and prevented the erection and use of the building in question then the building permit was of no legal significance and it had been issued illegally.\nBefore the appellant could commence to build, the respondent applied for an injunction under the provisions of the aforesaid s. 486 of The Municipal Act. The building as delineated on the said plans and as illustrated in the said photograph is one of two and a half-storeys, that is, there is a ground floor which is partially below ground level and partially protruding above the ground, and there are two storeys above that ground floor. The ground floor is to contain five apartments, some of one bedroom and some of two. Both upper floors are to contain six apartments each, that is, there will be a total of seventeen apartments. Each apartment, so far as the living-room, dining-room, kitchen and bedroom are concerned, is totally separated from the other apartments, but there is one entrance in about the centre of the front of the building and another entrance at the rear of the building. Both of these entrances open into corridors. Each apartment has its own private entrance into these corridors. There would seem to be no entrance whatsoever directly to any apartment whether on the first or other floors except from the corridors. In addition, at the rear of the ground floor, there is a large space which is to be occupied by lockers and another large space which is designated as a laundry, as well as space used for housing the heating plant.\nIt was the view of the learned trial judge upon a consideration of Rogers v. Hosegood[2] that the various apartments were \u201cprivate residences\u201d and that therefore the erection of the building was not prohibited by By-law 1275 as amended. The learned trial judge, therefore, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for an injunction.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] allowed the appeal and directed the issuing of the injunction which the respondent had claimed, interpreting By-law 1275 as amended as prohibiting the erection of the building outlined in the respondent\u2019s application for a permit.\nThe late Chief Justice of Ontario giving judgment for the majority also dealt with Rogers v. Hosegood pointing out that the part of that decision which governs this litigation was the finding in reference to the 1876 covenant between the parties and adopted the reasons of Collins L.J. at p. 409 as follows:\nWe think that residential flats, involving the use of a public entrance and staircase, do not answer the description of private residences contemplated by the words quoted. The covenant must, we think, be construed in an ordinary or popular, and not in a legal and technical, sense; and we do not think that residential flats, though for many purposes separate dwelling-houses, come within the popular description of the class of buildings which it was intended to permit. The appeal from the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario should be dismissed. I am of the opinion that the standard used by Collins L.J. in Rogers v. Hosegood for the interpretation of a covenant in a conveyance is equally proper in the interpretation of a by-law restricting the use of lands and that standard is as stated by the learned Lord Justice to \u201cconstrue in an ordinary or popular and not in a legal or technical sense\u201d. The words to be construed are \u201cprivate residences\u201d or \u201cduplex dwellings\u201d. With respect, I differ from the late Chief Justice of Ontario when he finds himself unable to utilize the amendment wrought in 1951 by By-law 1294 to construe By-law 1275 as enacted in 1950. I am of the opinion that when the council in 1951 enacted the amending By-law 1294 they must have had in consideration the by-law which they were amending and which had been enacted only the previous year and have considered the words I have quoted as they appeared after the amendment. Therefore the council believed that they had enacted a by-law which would permit only something which could be better described as a single, one-family residence, determined to widen the permitted use so that there could be erected a building which could consist of two one-family residences placed one on top of the other. In enacting the by-law first and its amendment later they have used ordinary words, i.e., private residences, and duplex dwellings, which were easily understood by everyone in the business of building, buying, or selling housing accommodation.\nI therefore regard it as an important aid to the construction of the words \u201cprivate residences\u201d that the council in their next year should have widened it only so far as to permit a building of two family residences one on top of the other, and in my view impliedly held fast to the determination that it would not permit a building of three, four, or, as in the present case, seventeen, residences. It is to be noted that the apartment house in addition to containing the number of private residences far beyond the two which are contained in the duplex contained other accommodation which is for the communal use of the occupants of seventeen of the private residences, to wit, the corridors, the lockers and the laundry in the proposed building.\nI am, therefore, of the view that what was contemplated in the erection of the proposed building was not private residences but many private residences under one roof plus communal accommodation, i.e., in plain and ordinary-terms, an apartment house, and that an apartment house is not within the by-law any more than the apartment house was in Rogers v. Hosegood. I have come to this conclusion realizing that a by-law restricting the use of land must be strictly construed and that any doubt as to the application of the by-law to prevent the erection of a specific building should be resolved in favour of such proposed use. No authority need be cited for each of these propositions. These principles, however, need only be applied when upon the reading of the whole by-law there is an ambiguity or difficulty of construction. Reading the whole by\u2011law, I have, for the reasons which I have outlined, come to the conclusion that there is no such ambiguity or difficulty in interpretation and therefore the two canons are not applicable. Both the learned trial judge and MacKay J.A. have pointed out that the municipal authorities issued a permit for the construction of the said building and MacKay J.A. remarks that this indicates the view of the municipal authorities that the building falls within those permitted by the by\u2011law. As I have pointed out, the two by-laws were enacted by the council of the Town of Niagara in 1950 and 1951. The permit was issued by the building inspector in 1965. There is no indication that it was considered by council. The parties have agreed that if the erection of the building is prevented by the by-laws then the building permit was issued illegally. I can obtain little assistance in interpreting the by-laws enacted by council in the year 1950 and 1951 from the view of the building inspector in 1965.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Reid, McNaughton, Martin & Zabek, St. Catharines.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Fleming, Harris, Barr, Hildebrand, Geiger & Daniel, St. Catharines.\n[1] [1967] 1 O.R. 227, 60 D.L.R.

At the date of the agreement A Co. was indebted to G Co. (a company controlled by the respondent) in an amount exceeding $200,000. In accordance with a term of the agreement, A Co. executed and delivered to G Co. a chattel mortgage to secure payment of this indebtedness in monthly instalments. The agreement contained provisions respecting the termination of the purchasers\u2019 rights thereunder in the event of default of payments both in respect of the main agreement and the chattel mortgage. By a letter dated January 2, 1962, the respondent notified the appellants that A Co. having made default in the payment of an instalment under its chattel mortgage, he was electing, pursuant to the agreement, to declare the balance of the purchase price of the shares due and payable, and by a further letter dated January 23, 1962, he notified the appellants that all their rights under the said agreement had ceased and been determined. The evidence established that the respondent had no reasonable grounds for believing that he was entitled to give the notices of January 2 and January 23, 1962. However, the appellants did not accept these notices as constituting a repudiation of the contract. Negotiations looking to the formation of a new agreement were entered into but did not succeed.\nThe respondent sued the appellants for the amount outstanding under the agreement of September 17, 1959. The appellants filed a defence to the action and counterclaimed for return of payments that they had made to the respondent under the agreement and for return of certain shares held in escrow. Some months later the appellants amended their defence and counterclaim and, for the first time, alleged that the respondent had wrongfully revoked and terminated the agreement of September 17, 1959, and they elected to treat the notice of January 23, 1962, as wrongfully and unlawfully terminating the said agreement and they claimed damages. The respondent in his reply to the appellants\u2019 amended pleadings abandoned his original claim and alleged instead that the agreement of September 17, 1959, had been justifiably terminated.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for the respondent, declaring the agreement of September 17, 1959, a valid and subsisting agreement and dismissing the appellants\u2019 counterclaim. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and varied the judgment of the trial judge by striking out the declaration that the agreement of September 17, 1959, was a valid and subsisting agreement and substituting the direction that the respondent\u2019s action and claims in the action be dismissed. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the Court of Appeal that the respondent wrongfully attempted to repudiate the agreement and also that the appellants failed to elect to accept the repudiation and communicate their acceptance to the respondent within a reasonable time.

Appeal dismissed.\nK.F. Arkell and L. Lewin, for the defendants, appellants.\nW.J. Wallace, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.1 The litigation originated out of an agreement dated September 17, 1959, under which the appellants agreed to purchase from the respondent 325 shares of the capital stock of Arctic Construction Company Limited for the sum of $190,000 payable in monthly instalments and subject to certain terms and conditions. At the date of the agreement Arctic Construction was indebted to Ben Ginter Construction Company Limited (a company controlled by the respondent) in an amount exceeding $200,000. In accordance with a term of the agreement, Arctic Construction executed and delivered to the Ginter Company a chattel mortgage to secure payment of this indebtedness in monthly instalments. Prior to entering into this agreement, the appellant Keen had a construction business doing oil field construction work in the Fort Nelson area of northern British Columbia, and requiring more equipment he approached the respondent who had a business at Prince George, British Columbia. The parties arrived at a point where they were ready to do business, and as a means of doing so an inactive company, Neals Lake Logging Limited, which the respondent controlled was reactivated and renamed \u201cArctic Construction Company Limited\u201d. 175 shares of Arctic were acquired by the appellants and 325 allotted to the respondent. It was these 325 shares of Arctic which the appellants agreed to purchase. The appellant Chapman, who was at this time General Manager of Ben Ginter Construction Company Limited, was to leave that company on January 1, 1959, and become Manager of Arctic Construction with the appellant Keen as Field Manager.\nThe agreement of September 17, 1959, contained the following clauses:\n5. The time for payment of the said purchase price of said shares and interest thereon is material and of the essence of this agreement and if any payment is not made upon its due date and such default continues for 60 days the whole of the balance of the purchase price for the Vendor\u2019s Shares (and interest hereon) shall immediately become due and payable without notice and in default of immediate payment all the rights of the Purchasers hereunder shall immediately cease and be determined at the option of the Vendor, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding, and any payments theretofore made by the Purchasers to the Vendor shall be then retained by the Vendor as liquidated damages for the failure of the Purchasers to complete the purchase of the Vendor\u2019s Shares and to pay the purchase price thereof but the Purchasers shall not be relieved of liability for any breach of any of the other covenants herein set forth.\n6. In the event that the Arctic Company shall be in default for sixty days in the payment of any instalment of the principal and interest secured by said Chattel Mortgage to the Ginter Company the Vendor may elect to declare the balance of the purchase price of the Vendor\u2019s shares due and payable and in default of payment thereof by the Purchasers to the Vendor within ten (10) days of notice thereof in writing all the rights of the Purchasers hereunder shall immediately cease and be determined at the option of the Vendor in the same manner and with the like effect as in Clause 5 hereof preceding. The agreement also provided that the appellants\u2019 175 shares in Arctic should be held as collateral security for the due payment of the mortgage debt by Arctic to the Ginter Company.\nUnder the said agreement the appellants continued to operate Arctic from this date until November 3, 1961. There were some minor modifications in the arrangements, but these are of no consequence in this appeal. On November 3, 1961, Arctic\u2019s mortgage payments to Ben Ginter Construction Limited were up to date as of October 31, 1961, with the November 1, 1961, payment then due and payable. Ben Ginter Construction Limited held Arctic\u2019s postdated cheques for the mortgage payments of November 1, 1961, and December 1, 1961. The payments by the appellants on their share purchase agreement were in arrears for September, October and November, being three payments totalling $11,250.\nThe respondent Ginter on November 3, 1961, wrote the appellants and proposed an arrangement whereby Ben Ginter Construction Limited would withhold and not deposit Arctic\u2019s mortgage cheques until \u201csuch time as I consider you can adequately handle both commitments\u201d. By \u2018both commitments\u2019 Ginter meant Arctic\u2019s mortgage payments to Ben Ginter Construction Limited and the appellants\u2019 payments to the respondent on the share purchase agreement of September 17, 1959. Ginter\u2019s letter of November 3, 1961, contained a new schedule of the payments from the appellants to the respondent pursuant to the share purchase agreement whereby the three payments in arrears would be paid on November 15, 1961, and the monthly payments by the appellants thereafter increased to $4,000 per month for December 1, 1961, and January 1, 1962, and then to $4,200 per month. The $11,250 which was in arrears on November 3, 1961, and the December 1, 1961, payment were made, bringing the agreement of September 17, 1959, in good standing to December 31, 1961.\nMeanwhile, on December 21, 1961, the respondent deposited Arctic\u2019s cheques dated November 1, 1961, and December 1, 1961, referred to in respondent\u2019s letter of November 3, 1961, and because Arctic did not have sufficient funds in its bank account to meet them, these cheques were returned N.S.F. on December 27, 1961. The respondent, then purporting to act under clause 6 of the agreement of September 17, 1959, sent notices to the appellants as follows:\nPrince George, B.C.\nJanuary 2, 1962\nMessrs. Chapman & Keen\nBox 55,\nDawson Creek, B.C.\nDear Sirs:\nYou are hereby given notice that Arctic Construction Co. Ltd. having made default for sixty days in the payment of an instalment of principal and interest under its chattel mortgage to Ben Ginter Construction Company Ltd. of Prince George, B.C., I do hereby, pursuant to Clause 6 of our agreement dated September 1959, elect to declare the balance of the purchase price of the shares in Arctic Construction Co. Ltd. which, by the said agreement dated September 17th 1959, I agreed to sell to you, due and payable, the said balance which is now due and payable in the sum of $101,293.88.\nYours truly,\nBenjamin George Ginter.\nand he followed this notice with a further letter dated January 23, 1962, as follows:\nMessrs. Chapman & Keen,\nBox 55,\nDawson Creek, B.C.\nDear Sirs:\nSince the period of ten days has elapsed since I gave you notice under Clause 6 of our agreement dated November* 17, 1959, concerning your purchase from me of shares in Arctic Construction Company Limited, that I had elected to declare the balance of the purchase price of those shares due and payable and since you have not paid said balance to me, I hereby give you notice that all your rights under said agreement have ceased and been determined.\nYours truly,\nBenjamin George Ginter.\n*(The reference to November is obviously an error for September.)\nThe appeal proceeded upon the footing that, as held by the learned trial judge:\n\u2026 there had not been a default under the chattel mortgage for sixty days, of which the plaintiff may take advantage when the notices of January 2nd and January 23rd 1962 were given. These notices were premature and the plaintiff was not entitled to declare the defendants\u2019 rights under the agreement terminated when he purported to do so. and it was conceded by the respondent that the evidence established he had no reasonable grounds for believing that he was entitled to give the notices of January 2, 1962, and January 23, 1962.\nHowever, the evidence is clear that the appellants did not accept these notices as constituting a repudiation of the contract, but instead, the appellant Keen and the respondent entered into negotiations looking to the formation of a new agreement whereby the appellant Keen would purchase the respondent\u2019s shares in Arctic and the appellant Keen, on behalf of himself and the appellant Chapman, thereafter negotiated with the respondent with the view of entering into a new agreement. No new agreement was arrived at. Relations between the parties deteriorated, the appellant Keen being dismissed by Ginter on April 11, 1962, as an employee and officer of Arctic. The appellant Chapman had earlier resigned. The appellant Keen took action against Ben Ginter Construction Company Limited for unlawful dismissal. That litigation has no bearing on the present appeal.\nOn May 10, 1962, the respondent sued the appellants for $100,983.66, being the balance owing for the shares under the agreement of September 17, 1959. The appellants thereupon demanded return of the money they had paid to Ginter under the said agreement and also requested return of the certificates for their 175 shares in Arctic. On June 14, 1962, the appellants filed a defence to the respondent\u2019s action and counterclaimed for return of the payments they had made to the respondent under the agreement and for the shares. The pleadings remained in this state until February 6, 1963, when the appellants amended their defence and counterclaim and, for the first time, alleged that the respondent had wrongfully revoked and terminated the agreement of September 17, 1959, and they elected to treat the notice of January 23, 1962, as wrongfully and unlawfully terminating the said agreement and they claimed damages. The respondent Ginter in his reply to the appellants\u2019 amended pleadings of February 6, 1963, abandoned his claim for $100,983.66 for which he had sued on May 10, 1962, and alleged instead that the agreement of September 17, 1959, had been justifiably terminated. Subsequent amendments were made to the pleadings in April 1963 and in September 1964. The action came on for trial at Vancouver on February 22, 1965.\nIn summary the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice McFarlane, in a judgment dated March 10, 1965, gave judgment declaring the agreement of September 17, 1959, a valid and subsisting agreement and dismissing the counterclaim with costs. An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. In a judgment dated April 17, 1967, that Court allowed the appeal of the appellants and varied the judgment of McFarlane J. by striking out the declaration that the agreement of September 17, 1959, was a valid and subsisting agreement and substituting the direction that the respondent\u2019s action and claims in the action be dismissed. The formal judgment in this respect reads as follows:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Appeal herein be allowed \/in part\/ and the Judgment aforesaid varied to the extent of striking out the declaration that the Agreement of 17th September, 1959 between the Appellants and the Respondent is a valid and subsisting contract, and substituting for the said declaration the following paragraph:\u2014\n\u201cTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the action and claims of the Plaintiff (Respondent), Benjamin George Ginter against the Defendants (Appellants), Leon Everett Chapman and Robert Jordan Keen, be and the same are hereby dismissed in their entirety.\u201d\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the aforesaid Judgment appealed from be further varied by striking out the following paragraph thereof:\u2014\n\u201cAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Defendants do pay to the Plaintiff the costs of this action forthwith after taxation thereof.\u201d\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that all parties to this action do bear their own costs in this Court and in the Court below.\nThe reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal were delivered by Tysoe J.A. He came to the conclusion that the notices of January 2 and January 23, 1962, were premature and the respondent Ginter was not entitled to declare the appellants\u2019 rights under the agreement of September 17, 1959, terminated when he purported to do so. Tysoe J.A. continued as follows:\nI am of the opinion that it cannot reasonably be inferred from the proven circumstances, including the conduct of the parties, that the appellants elected to accept the repudiation and to hold the respondent liable in damages and that, that election was communicated to or known to the respondent within a reasonable time. It is my view that the learned trial Judge was correct in his finding that \u201cneither defendant did so elect or communicate his election within a reasonable time\u201d\u2014a time which was reasonable in all the circumstances. February 1963, over a year after the repudiation, was outside the limit of any reasonable time. It appears to me that the raising, by way of amendment to the pleadings, on that late date of a claim of repudiation by the respondent and acceptance thereof by the appellants and for damages was a mere afterthought.\nIt follows from what I have said that the appellants\u2019 claim that they are entitled, by reason of the wrongful repudiation of the agreement by the respondent, to damages against the respondent for breach of the agreement cannot be maintained. As the argument before this Court was directed to only this one point, in ordinary circumstances I would simply dismiss the appeal. But the circumstances here are unusual and, after all, it is the function and duty of the court to make such order as proper justice requires.\nAs I have earlier pointed out, this action was commenced by a specially endorsed writ and the claim was for the balance of the purchase price of shares of Arctic Construction payable under and by virtue of the agreement of September 17, 1959. The appellants\u2019 claim for damages based on the respondent\u2019s wrongful repudiation of that agreement was set up by way of counterclaim. In his reply to that counterclaim the respondent asked for a declaration that the agreement is a valid and subsisting agreement. That declaration was granted by the judgment appealed from. To set up such a cross-claim in a reply to a counterclaim is a somewhat unusual procedure. It can be so set up only if the plaintiff desires to use it merely as a shield against the counterclaim, otherwise he must amend his statement of claim. See: Renton, Gibbs & Co. v. Neville and Co. [1900] 2 Q.B. 181. No amendment to the statement of claim was made in the case at bar. In his opening at trial respondent\u2019s counsel drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the plaintiff\u2014respondent, in his reply to the counterclaim had expressly abandoned his claim for the balance of the purchase price of the shares as endorsed on the writ of summons. Thus the statement of claim in the action was in effect withdrawn and the trial proceeded as if the appellants were the plaintiff and the respondent was the defendant, the counterclaim was the statement of claim and the reply to the counterclaim was the statement of defence and counterclaim. In the result the appellants\u2019 counterclaim was dismissed and the respondent was given judgment declaring the agreement to be a valid and subsisting agreement. So long as that declaration stands the appellants remain liable to pay for the shares in accordance with the terms of the agreement even though the respondent had expressly abandoned his claim for the balance of the purchase price. Likewise, of course, the obligations of the respondent under the agreement remain in force. But the respondent, acting upon his wrongful repudiation took complete control of the affairs of Arctic Construction and dealt with the assets and business of the company as if they were his own. The evidence shows that at the time of trial there had been such a drastic change in the affairs of the company and in particular in its assets that the equity behind the shares was completely different to what it had been at the time of the respondent\u2019s repudiation. It appears to me that in these circumstances it would be inequitable to leave the appellants with no recourse against the respondent and with an obligation to accept the shares and a liability to pay for them in accordance with the terms of the agreement. I express no opinion as to whether, if all the facts were known, it would be found that the respondent did or did not manage the affairs of the company and deal with its assets in a proper and business\u2014like manner. I simply do not know what the situation is in this regard.\nWhat order should be made so that proper justice may be done depends, in my view, on the interpretation which ought to be placed on the conduct of the parties. The respondent wrongfully repudiated the agreement but the appellants did not elect to accept the repudiation and to communicate the election to the respondent within a reasonable time. It is my opinion that the proper inference on the evidence is that both parties walked away from the agreement and abandoned it. They attempted to negotiate a new agreement but the apellants were unable to meet the requirements of the respondent and so the negotiations came to nothing.\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, I would allow the appeal and vary the judgment below to the extent of striking out the declaration that the agreement is a valid and subsisting agreement and substituting a direction that the respondent\u2019s action and claims in the action be dismissed.\nI am fully in agreement with Tysoe J.A. on his findings that the respondent Ginter wrongfully attempted to repudiate the agreement and also that the appellants failed to elect to accept the repudiation and communicate their acceptance to the respondent within a reasonable time. In my view, the conclusion reached by Tysoe J.A. that both parties \u201cwalked away from the agreement and abandoned it\u201d was the proper one and I think he was correct in the disposition he made of the appeal.\nThe appeal to this Court should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Lewin, Arkell & Callison, Dawson Creek.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nA motion to vary the judgment pronounced in the above appeal having been heard on June 17, 1968, by the same Bench that heard the appeal, the following judgment was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for the Court):\u2014The formal pronouncement of the judgment of the Court made on April 29, 1968, is varied to read as follows:\u2014\nIt is declared that the appellants are entitled to the 175 shares of Arctic Construction Limited which were placed in escrow to collaterally secure performance of the agreement of September 17, 1959, and that the said shares are released from escrow. It is further declared that the appellants are not entitled to the return of the moneys paid by them under the agreement of September 17, 1959, towards the purchase of the respondent\u2019s shares of Arctic Construction Limited. Subject to the making of the above declarations the appeal is dismissed with costs. The cross-appeal is dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1967), 60 W.W.R. 385.\n"

Act, ss. 91, 92.\nIn 1954, a licence permitting the inter-provincial transport of goods was issued to the appellant in Ontario, under the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 59. When informed that the respondent Board intended to hold a hearing to review the terms of the certificate which led to the issue of the licence, the appellant applied for an order prohibiting the Board from proceeding on the ground that the Board was without jurisdiction because the Motor Vehicle Act, which confers upon it the jurisdiction which it sought to exercise, was ultra vires. The trial judge dismissed the application, and this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court. In support of the appeal, it was argued that the terms of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, and particularly s. 3 thereof, constituted an unlawful delegation by Parliament to the provincial legislatures of the power to legislate in relation to the subject matter of inter-provincial motor vehicle carriage, a subject matter wholly within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament. Counsel for each of the intervenants supported the constitutional validity of the Act.\nHeld (Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ.: By the terms of s. 3 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, the question whether a person may operate the undertaking of an inter\u2011provincial carrier of goods by motor vehicle within the limits of the province of Ontario is to be decided by a Board constituted by the provincial legislature and which must be guided in the making of its decision by the terms of the statutes of that legislature and the regulations passed thereunder as they may exist from time to time. There is here no delegation of law\u2011making power, but rather the adoption by Parliament, in the exercise of its exclusive power, of the legislation of another body as it may from time to time exist, a course which has been held constitutionally valid by this Court in A.G. for Ontario v. Scott, [1956] S.C.R. 137, and by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Glibbery, [1963] 1 O.R. 232. The respondent Board derives no power from the legislature of Ontario to regulate or deal with the inter-provincial carriage of goods. Its wide powers in that regard are conferred upon it by Parliament, which can at any time terminate them.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: Section 3(2) of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Can.) is not valid federal legislation. This legislation constitutes an unconstitutional delegation from the federal to the provincial authority of a subject matter reserved to Parliament alone under the B.N.A. Act. In enacting the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, and particularly ss. 3(2) and 5 thereof, the Parliament of Canada purported to relinquish all control over that subject matter.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Validit\u00e9 d\u2019un statut\u2014S\u2019agit-il d\u2019une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation inconstitutionelle par le Parlement du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en mati\u00e8re de transport interprovincial par v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur\u2014Loi sur le transport par v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 59, art. 3(1), (2)\u2014Ontario Highway Transport Board Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 273\u2014Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, arts. 91, 92.\nEn 1954, un permis pour le transport interprovincial de marchandises a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en Ontario en vertu de la Loi sur le transport par v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 59.

Moylan, for the Attorney General of Manitoba.\nGerald LeDain, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Quebec.\nSamuel A. Friedman, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Alberta.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 made on October 14, 1965, affirming an order of Gale C.J.H.C., made on July 15, 1965, dismissing an application of the appellant for an order prohibiting the respondent from proceeding with a hearing to review the terms of the certificates which led to the issue of an extra-provincial operating licence to the appellant. The Court of Appeal gave no written reasons for its decision but we are informed by counsel that it stated its agreement with the reasons of Gale C.J.H.C.\nThere is no dispute as to any matter of fact. All of the business of the appellant consists of inter\u2011provincial transport of goods and none of its operations involves transport entirely within one province so as to be of an intra-provincial nature. In 1954 a licence was issued to the appellant in Ontario under the Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Canada); this licence permits the inter-provincial movement of certain specific types of merchandise and is number X828. The respondent has informed the appellant of its intention to hold a hearing under The Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Canada) to review the terms of the certificate which led to the issue of the licence.\nThe application for prohibition was founded on the ground that the respondent was without jurisdiction because the Act which confers upon it the jurisdiction which it sought to exercise is ultra vires of Parliament. That Act is The Motor Vehicle Transport Act, Statutes of Canada, 2\u20113 Eliz. II, c. 59. The relevant provisions of the Act are:\nSection 2:\nIn this Act,\n(a) \u201cextra-provincial transport\u201d means the transport of passengers or goods by means of an extra-provincial undertaking;\n(b) \u201cextra-provincial undertaking\u201d means a work or undertaking for the transport of passengers or goods by motor vehicle, connecting a province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of a province;\n* * *\n(g) \u201clocal undertaking\u201d means a work or undertaking for the transport of passengers or goods by motor vehicle, not being an extra-provincial undertaking; and\n(h) \u201cprovincial transport board\u201d means a board, commission or other body or person having under the law of a province authority to control or regulate the operation of a local undertaking.\nSection 3(1):\n(1) Where in any province a licence is by the law of the province required for the operation of a local undertaking, no person shall operate an extra-provincial undertaking in that province unless he holds a licence issued under the authority of this Act.\n(2) The provincial transport board in each province may in its discretion issue a licence to a person to operate an extra-provincial undertaking into or through the province upon the like terms and conditions and in the like manner as if the extra provincial undertaking operated in the province were a local undertaking.\nSection 5:\nThe Governor in Council may exempt any person or the whole or any part of an extra\u2011provincial undertaking or any extra-provincial transport from all or any of the provisions of this Act.\nWhile an additional submission was made to Gale C.J.H.C., the only ground in support of the appeal relied upon before us was that the terms of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, and particularly s. 3 thereof, constitute an unlawful delegation by Parliament to the provincial legislatures of the power to legislate in relation to the subject matter of inter-provincial motor vehicle carriage which subject matter was rightly conceded to be wholly within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament.\nCounsel for each of the intervenants supported the constitutional validity of the Act.\nThe Motor Vehicle Transport Act was assented to on June 26, 1954; pursuant to a proclamation of the Governor in Council issued under s. 7 of the Act it came into force in Ontario on September 15, 1954. At that date the powers as to the regulation of intra-provincial carriage of goods by motor vehicle now exercised by the respondent Board were conferred upon the Ontario Municipal Board by The Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 304. The respondent Board was created by Statutes of Ontario, 1955, 4 Eliz. II, c. 54, by s. 25 of which the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 304, was amended so that the powers as to the regulation of intra-provincial carriage of goods by motor vehicle theretofore exercised by the Ontario Municipal Board were transferred to the respondent Board.\nThe rules which guide the Board in the performance of its duties are now contained in the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 139 and Regulations made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council pursuant to s. 16 of that Act.\nFrom the above brief review of the relevant legislation it will be seen that as matters stand at present the question whether a person may operate the undertaking of an inter-provincial carrier of goods by motor vehicle within the limits of the Province of Ontario is to be decided by a Board constituted by the provincial legislature and which must be guided in the making of its decision by the terms of the statutes of that legislature and the regulations passed thereunder as they may exist from time to time.\nMr. Laidlaw argues that in bringing about this result by the enactment of s. 3 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act Parliament has in substance and reality abdicated its power to make laws in relation to the subject of inter-provincial motor vehicle carriage and unlawfully delegated that power to the provincial legislature.\nIt is made clear by the judgment of this Court in Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada[2], and by the earlier decisions of the Judicial Committee and of this Court collected and discussed in the reasons delivered in that case, that neither Parliament nor a Provincial Legislature is capable of delegating to the other or of receiving from the other any of the powers to make laws conferred upon it by the British North America Act. Bill No. 136 of the Legislature of Nova Scotia which was under consideration in that case in terms provided that the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province might:\nby proclamation, from time to time delegate to and withdraw from the Parliament of Canada authority to make laws in relation to any matter relating to employment in any industry, work or undertaking in respect of which such matter is, by Section 92 of The British North America Act, 1867, exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of this Legislature and any laws so made by the said Parliament shall, while such delegation is in force, have the same effect as if enacted by this Legislature.\nThe difference between such a bill and the Act which we are considering is too obvious to require emphasis.\nIt is well settled that Parliament may confer upon a provincially constituted board power to regulate a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the reasons delivered in the case of P.E.I. Potato Marketing Board v. H.B. Willis Inc[3].\nIn the case before us the respondent Board derives no power from the Legislature of Ontario to regulate or deal with the inter-provincial carriage of goods. Its wide powers in that regard are conferred upon it by Parliament. Parliament has seen fit to enact that in the exercise of those powers the Board shall proceed in the same manner as that prescribed from time to time by the Legislature for its dealings with intra-provincial carriage. Parliament can at any time terminate the powers of the Board in regard to inter-provincial carriage or alter the manner in which those powers are to be exercised. Should occasion for immediate action arise the Governor General in Council may act under s. 5 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act.\nIn my opinion there is here no delegation of law-making power, but rather the adoption by Parliament, in the exercise of its exclusive power, of the legislation of another body as it may from time to time exist, a course which has been held constitutionally valid by this Court in Attorney General for Ontario v. Scott[4] and by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Glibbery[5].\nAs has already been stated the point dealt with above was the only one argued before us. In regard to it I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Gale C.J.H.C. It follows that I would dismiss the appeal.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to call attention to the fact that in each of the proclamations whereby the Motor Vehicle Transport Act was brought into force in the various provinces it is recited that this action had been requested by the Government of the Province concerned. It seems plain that the Government of Canada in co-operation with the Governments of the Provinces concerned has sought to achieve a satisfactory manner of regulating the transport of goods by motor vehicle. Our duty is simply to determine whether as a matter of law the Act of Parliament impugned by the appellant is valid; but it is satisfactory to find that there is nothing which compels us to hold that the object sought by this co\u2011operative effort is constitutionally unattainable.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs but would make no order as to costs in regard to any of the intervenants.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] dismissing without reasons an appeal from a judgment rendered by Gale C.J.H.C. (as he then was) whereby he dismissed the application of the present appellant for an order prohibiting the Ontario Highway Transport Board from proceeding with a hearing to review the certificates of public necessity and convenience which led to the issuance of his Extra\u2011Provincial Operating Licence for the Province of Ontario. I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the present Chief Justice in which he sets out the relevant statutory provisions and reviews the circumstances giving rise to this appeal, but I do not find it possible to agree with the conclusion, which he has reached in confirming the judgments of the Courts below.\nThe \u201cExtra-Provincial Operating Licence\u201d here in question, which is numbered X828, appears to be signed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles for the Province of Ontario. It bears the heading: \u201cThe Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Canada 1954)\u2014Ontario Department of Transport\u2014Extra-Provincial Operating Licence\u201d and it authorizes the appellant \u201cto operate an extra-provincial undertaking for the transportation of goods\u2026subject to the terms and conditions printed on the back hereof\u2026\u201d The terms and conditions referred to read, in part, as follows: THE MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSPORT ACT\nStatutes of Canada 1954\n1. This Act authorizes the Minister of Transport to licence inter-provincial and international undertakings for the transport of passengers and goods by motor vehicle upon like terms and conditions and in the like manner as if the extra-provincial undertaking were a local undertaking.\n2. Licences issued under this Act for the transportation of goods between two or more provinces of Canada or between the province of Ontario and a state of the United States are designated \u2018extra-provincial operating licences\u2019 and the serial number of each licence shall commence with the letter \u2018X\u2019. The terms and conditions are that it shall be subject to the provisions of The Public Commercial Vehicles Act (Ontario) and the regulations made thereunder with the following exceptions:. . .\nThe italics are my own.\nThe exceptions are not strictly relevant for the purpose of this appeal.\nThe section of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act which is called in question in the present case is s. 3(2) which reads as follows:\n3. (2) The provincial transport board in each province may in its discretion issue a licence to a person to operate an extra-provincial undertaking into or through the province under the like terms and conditions and in the like manner as if the extra\u2011provincial undertaking operated in the province were a local undertaking.\nThe appellant contends that these provisions, when read in conjunction with the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 319 and the regulations made thereunder, constitute a delegation by Parliament to the Provincial executive of the power to exercise control over a connecting undertaking by regulation, which power is expressly stated in the case of A.G. (Ontario) v. Winner[7], to be vested in the federal authority exclusively by reason of the provisions of s. 92(10) (a) of the British North America Act.\nIn the case of A.G. (Ontario) v. Winner, supra, the Privy Council had decided that it was beyond the legislative powers of a province (New Brunswick) to prohibit the operator of an interprovincial bus line from carrying passengers from points outside the province to points within the province and vice versa on the ground that no province had jurisdiction to legislate in relation to extra-provincial transport. The matter was succinctly stated by Lord Porter at page 580 where he said:\n\u2026it is for the Dominion alone to exercise, either by Act or by regulation, control over connecting undertakings. It appears to me to be of more than passing interest to note that the Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Canada) was assented to by Parliament almost exactly four months after the decision in the Winner case had been rendered by the Privy Council and that three months later, at the request of the Province of Ontario, a proclamation was issued \u201cdeclaring the said act to be in force in the said province\u201d.\nIt seems to me that if it is to be held that s. 3(2) of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act is valid federal legislation, then the effect of the decision in the Winner case has been effectively nullified insofar as the Province of Ontario is concerned.\nBefore considering the question of whether or not this legislation constitutes a delegation from the federal to the provincial authority of subject matter reserved to Parliament alone under the British North America Act, it appears to me to be proper to re-state the proposition, that neither Parliament nor a provincial legislature is capable of delegating its powers to the other, in the language in which it was stated by Chief Justice Rinfret in A.G. of Nova Scotia v. A.G. of Canada[8]. The Chief Justice there said at page 34:\nThe constitution of Canada does not belong either to Parliament, or to the Legislatures; it belongs to the country and it is there that the citizens of the country will find the protection of the rights to which they are entitled. It is part of the protection that Parliament can legislate only on the subject matters referred to it by section 91 and that each Province can legislate exclusively on the subject matters referred to it by section 92. The country is entitled to insist that legislation adopted under section 91 should be passed exclusively by the Parliament of Canada in the same way as the people of each Province are entitled to insist that legislation concerning the matters enumerated in section 92 should come exclusively from their respective Legislatures.\nNo power of delegation is expressed either in section 91 or in section 92, nor, indeed, is there to be found the power of accepting delegation from one body to the other; and I have no doubt that if it had been the intention to give such powers it would have been expressed in clear and unequivocal language.\nNotwithstanding these observations, it has nevertheless been settled, at least since the case of the P.E.I. Potato Marketing Board v. H.B. Willis Inc.[9] (hereinafter referred to as the P.E.I. case), that Parliament may authorize the Governor-in-Council to empower a provincially-appointed board to regulate a matter which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament provided that ultimate control over the manner in which such power is to be exercised is retained by the federal authority. The impugned legislation considered in the P.E.I. case was section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act, 1949, which read as follows:\n2(1) The Governor in Council may by order grant authority to any board or agency authorized under the law of any province to exercise powers of regulation in relation to the marketing of any agricultural product locally within the province, to regulate the marketing of such agricultural product outside the province in interprovincial and export trade and for such purposes to exercise all or any powers like the powers exercisable by such board or agency in relation to the marketing of such agricultural product locally within the province.\n(2) The Governor in Council may by order revoke any authority granted under subsection one.\nThe effect of this legislation was described by Chief Justice Rinfret at page 396 in the following terms:\nThe effect of that enactment is for the Governor-in-Council to adopt as its own a board, or agency already authorized under the law of a province, to exercise powers of regulation outside the province in inter-provincial and export trade, and for such purposes to exercise all or any powers exercisable by such board, or agency, in relation to the marketing of such agricultural products locally within the province. I cannot see any objection to federal legislation of this nature. Ever since Valin v. Langlois, (1879) 5 A.C. 115, when the Privy Council refused leave to appeal from the decision of this Court, the principle has been consistently admitted that it was competent for Parliament to \u201cemploy its own executive officers for the purpose of carrying out legislation which is within its constitutional authority, as it does regularly in the case of revenue officials and other matters which need not be enumerated\u201d. The latter are the words of Lord Atkin, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association et al. v. A.G. for Canada et al., (1931 A.C. 310). The words just quoted are preceded in the judgment of Lord Atkin by these other words:\u2014\n\u2018Nor is there any ground for suggesting that the Dominion may not\u2026\u2019\nIt will be seen, therefore, that on that point the Judicial Committee did not entertain the slightest doubt.\nIn The Agricultural Products Marketing Act of 1949 that is precisely what Parliament has done. Parliament has granted authority to the Governor-in-Council to employ as its own a board, or agency, for the purpose of carrying out its own legislation for the marketing of agricultural products outside the province in interprovincial and export trade, two subject\u2011matters which are undoubtedly within its constitutional authority.\nThe italics are my own. It will be seen also from a consideration of the Chief Justice\u2019s reasons for judgment, page 395, that he regarded the delegations of authority under the Agricultural Products Marketing Act as being \u201calong the same lines\u201d as those passed upon by this Court in the War Measures Act cases of In re Gray[10] and The Chemical Reference[11].\nIn comparing the P.E.I. case with the case of Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada, supra, Mr. Justice Taschereau said, at pages 410 and 411:\nHere the issue is entirely different. The Federal legislation does not confer any additional powers to the legislature but vests in a group of persons certain powers to be exercised in the interprovincial and export field. It is immaterial that the same persons be empowered by the legislature to control and regulate the marketing of Natural Products within the Province. It is true that the Board is a creature of the Lieutenant-Governor\u2011in\u2011Council, but this does not prevent it from exercising duties imposed by the Parliament of Canada. (Valin v. Langlois).\nIn the same case, Mr. Justice Rand expressed himself rather more fully in the following terms at pages 414 and 415:\nWhat the law in this case has done has been to give legal significance called incidents to certain group actions of five men. That to the same men, acting in the same formality, another co\u2011ordinate jurisdiction in a federal constitution cannot give other legal incidents to other joint actions is negated by the admission that the Dominion by appropriate words could create a similar board, composed of the same persons, bearing the same name, and with a similar formal organization, to execute the same Dominion functions. Twin phantoms of this nature must, for practical purposes, give way to realistic necessities. As related to courts, the matter was disposed of in Valin v. Langlois. No question of disruption of constitutive provincial features or frustration of provincial powers arises: both legislatures have recognized the value of a single body to carry out one joint, though limited, administration of trade. At any time the Province could withdraw the whole or any part of its authority. The delegation was, then, effective.\nThe italics are my own.\nI am unable to conclude that the language of s. 3(2) of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act creates a situation in which the principle recognized in Valin v. Langlois[12] has any application.\nIn the P.E.I. case, Parliament did nothing more than to authorize the Governor-in-Council to select as an arm of the federal authority any board or agency already estab- lished under provincial law for the regulation of Agricultural Marketing within the province and for the purpose of regulating such marketing extra provincially, to grant to it \u201cany powers like the powers exercisable by such board or agency in relation to the marketing of such agricultural products locally within the province\u201d.\nThe Agricultural Products Marketing Act, and particularly s. 2 thereof and the order-in-council made by the Governor-in-Council thereunder, when read together with the provincial legislation, constitute an example of valid co-operation between federal and provincial authorities, and the whole question in the present case is whether the same thing has been achieved by the enactment of s. 3(2) and s. 5 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act.\nThe difficulty which presents itself to Parliament and to the legislatures in such cases is exemplified in the reasons for judgment of Lord Atkin in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada[13], where he said:\nUnless and until a change is made in the respective legislative functions of Dominion and Province it may well be that satisfactory results for both can only be obtained by co\u2011operation. But the legislation will have to be carefully framed, and will not be achieved by either party leaving its own sphere and encroaching upon that of the other.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn light of these observations, it is to be noted that in the case of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act the extent to which the provincial powers to regulate were adopted, to be exercised in the extra\u2011provincial field, remained within the control of the Governor-in-Council and in fact the order\u2011in\u2011council granting such authority to the P.E.I. Potato Board was restricted by reference to a selected number of provincially authorized regulations. In my view, the important aspect of this legislation from the point of view of the present case is that the controlling authority under that statute remained at all times in federal hands, with the result that the powers exercisable by the Board in the regulation of extra-provincial marketing are such as may from time to time be authorized by the Governor\u2011in\u2011Council. In the case of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, direct authority has been given to the local board in each province \u201cin its discretion to issue a licence to a person to operate an extra\u2011provincial undertaking into or through the province\u201d, and the manner in which that discretion is to be exercised is not limited to such provincial regulations as the Governor\u2011in\u2011Council may designate but is to be exactly the same as if the extra-provincial undertaking were a \u201clocal undertaking\u201d. In my view the effect of this legislation is that the control of the regulation of licensing of a \u201cconnecting undertaking\u201d, is turned over to the provincial authority, and in the Province of Ontario this means that the controlling legislation is the Ontario Highway Transport Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 273, and the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 319.\nThat this is in fact the effect of the legislation is made apparent from a consideration of the Notice of Review of the appellant\u2019s operating licence which is brought in question in the present case. It was published in the Ontario Gazette and read as follows:\nThe Ontario Highway Transport Board Act, 1960\nThe Ontario Highway Transport Board pursuant to Section 16 of The Ontario Highway Transport Board Act will review the terms of the certificates which led to the issuance of extra-provincial operating licence No. X-828, and has fixed Monday, the 14th day of September, 1964, at 10 a.m. (E.D.S.T.) at its Chambers, 67 College Street, Toronto, Ontario, for that purpose.\nAt the hearing the applicant will be required to show cause why these certificates should not be amended or revoked by reason of operations contrary to the public interest; the operations are, more specifically\u2014continued disregard of The Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Canada) and The Highway Traffic Act and the regulations pursuant thereto.\nThe Board may amend or revoke the terms of these certificates.\nAlthough reference is made in the Notice to \u201ccontinued disregard of The Motor Vehicle Transport Act (Canada) and The Highway Traffic Act\u201d it is nevertheless clear that the Ontario Highway Transport Board Act was the statute pursuant to which the Notice was issued and the hearing was to be held.\nThere can, in my view, be no objection to Parliament enacting a statute in which existing provincial legislation is incorporated by reference so as to obviate the necessity of re-enacting it verbatim, but in providing for the granting of licences to extra-provincial undertakings in the like manner as if they were local undertakings, Parliament must, I think, be taken to have adopted the provisions of the provincial statutes in question as they may be amended from time to time. The result is that the granting of such licences is governed by the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, supra, pursuant to s. 16 of which the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may make regulations\n\u2026(q) respecting any matter necessary or advisable to carry out effectively the intent and purpose of this Act,\u2026\nI can only read this as meaning that the licensing regulations for extra-provincial transport may be governed by decisions made from time to time by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council without any control by, or reference to, the federal authority. This is very different from adopting by reference the language used in a provincial statute and, in my opinion, it means that the control over the regulation of licensing in this field has been left in provincial hands.\nIt is, of course, true that Parliament can at any time terminate the powers of the provincial boards to licence extra-provincial undertakings, but it seems to me that this would entail repealing s. 3(2) of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act and it is the constitutionality of that subsection which is here impugned.\nIt is also suggested that the Governor-in-Council might exercise control by acting under s. 5 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act which reads as follows:\nThe Governor-in-Council may exempt any person or the whole or any part of an extra\u2011provincial undertaking or any extra-provincial transport from all or any of the provisions of this Act.\nWith the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I do not think that this provision vests any control in the Governor-in-Council of the kind with which he was clothed by the Agricultural Products Marketing Act. Under the latter statute control of the regulation of extra\u2011provincial marketing was vested in the Governor-in-Council; whereas under s. 5 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act the powers of the Governor-in-Council are limited to exempting any extra-provincial transport from all or any of the provisions of the Act. I do not read this latter section as reserving any power to the Governor-in-Council to nullify the effect of s. 3(2) of the Act by exempting all extra-provincial transport from its provisions, and I am therefore of opinion that no control was retained by the federal authority over the unlimited legislative powers which it purported to transfer to the province by the language employed in s. 3(2) of the Act. Presumably, any person or undertaking exempted by the Governor\u2011in\u2011Council from the provisions of the Act, would be without authority to operate in the Province of Ontario, unless and until provision was made for the granting of a federal licence, but this would in no way effect the powers which s. 3(2) purported to confer on the Board to issue licences to persons or undertakings which had not been so exempted.\nIn my view, therefore, in enacting the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, and particularly s. 3(2) and 5 thereof, the Parliament of Canada purported to relinquish all control over a field in which Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction under the British North America Act, and left the power to exercise control of the licensing of extra-provincial undertakings to be regulated in such manner as the Province might from time to time determine.\nThe case of A.G. for Ontario v. Scott[14], has been cited in support of the validity of the legislation which is here in question, but in my view the question decided in that case was an entirely different one. The legislation there called in question was the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 334, which provided for registration in the Ontario court of a maintenance order made by a reciprocal state against a resident of Ontario. For the purpose of enforcement of the order, section 5(2) of the Act provided:\nAt the hearing it shall be open to the person on whom the summons was served to raise any defence that he might have raised in the original proceedings had he been party thereto but no other defence;\u2026\nIt was contended that this section amounted to a delegation by the legislature of its power to deal with the civil rights of its citizens, as the defences permitted under the law of England when the provincial act came into force might or might not have been extended or limited by subsequent English legislation. No question of delegation between federal and provincial authorities of powers conferred by the British North America Act was at issue in this case and the crux of the matter appears to me to have been stated by Rand J., speaking on behalf of himself, the Chief Justice, Kellock and Cartwright JJ. at page 141, where he said:\nThat the legislation is within head 16, as a local or private matter, appears to me to be equally clear. No other part of the country nor any other of the several governments has the slightest interest in such a controversy and it concerns ultimately property, actual or potential, within Ontario in a local sense.\nGiven, then, a right so created by the law of Ontario, the action taken in England is merely an initiating proceeding looking to effective juridical action in Ontario for the purposes of which it is a means of adducing a foundation in evidence. In the administration of justice the province is supreme in determining the procedure by which rights and duties shall be enforced and that it can act upon evidence taken abroad either before or after proceedings are begun locally I consider unquestionable.\nTo the same effect, Mr. Justice Abbott, speaking for himself, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ., said, at pages 147 and 148:\nAs to s. 5, it is clearly competent to any province to determine for the purpose of a civil action brought in such province, what evidence is to be accepted and what defences may be set up to such an action. With the greatest respect for the learned judges in the Court below who have expressed the contrary view, the provision contained in s. 5(2) that \u2018it shall be open to the person on whom the summons was served to raise any defence that he might have raised in the original proceedings had he been a party thereto but no other defence\u2019 is not in my opinion a delegation of legislative power to another province or state. It is merely a recognition by the law of the province of the rights existing from time to time under the laws of another province or state, in accordance with the well recognized principles of private international law.\nNotwithstanding certain obiter dicta in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Rand and Mr. Justice Locke, I consider that the excerpts above quoted accurately reflect the ratio decidendi of the case of A.G. for Ontario v. Scott, supra, and with all respect for the opinion of others, I do not think that it constitutes an authority supporting the validity of the statute which is here called in question.\nReliance was placed also on the case of Regina v. Glibbery[15]. In that case it was contended that the provisions of the Government Property Traffic Regulations passed under the authority of the Government Property Traffic Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 324, constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority by Parliament to the Province of Ontario. The accused, Glibbery, was charged with careless driving, contrary to the provisions of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, whilst driving his vehicle in the defence establishment of Camp Borden which was government property, and contrary also to the provisions of s. 6(1) of the Government Property Traffic Regulations which read as follows:\nNo person shall operate a vehicle on a highway otherwise than in accordance with the laws of the province and the municipality in which the highway is situated.\nThe constitutional argument is referred to in the judgment rendered by Mr. Justice McGillivray on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Ontario where he says at page 235:\nIt is submitted however, that this Regulation can only apply to the laws of the Provinces and municipalities as they were in 1952 when the Government Property Traffic Act and the Regulations thereunder became law. If \u201claws of the province\u201d as used in s. 6 is to mean more than that and to mean laws of the Province as they may be amended from time to time then, it is contended, there exists an unconstitutional and invalid delegation of legislative authority by Parliament to the Province.\nAfter observing that he had no doubt that it was intended that the traffic regulations regarding highways upon Dominion property should conform at all times with those on highways in the areas surrounding such property and that such was the intention of the present regulation, Mr. Justice McGillivray went on to say at page 236:\nThere is not here any delegation by Parliament to a Province of legislative power vested in the Dominion alone by the B.N.A. Act and of a kind not vested by the Act in a Province. Delegation by Parliament of any such power would be clearly unconstitutional: A.-G. N.S. et al v. A.-G. Can. 1950 4 D.L.R. 369, 1951 S.C.R. 31. The power here sought to be delegated was not of such a type but was in relation to a matter in which the Province was independently competent. Parliament could validly have spelled out in its own regulations the equivalent of relevant sections of the Highway Traffic Act as they existed from time to time but it was more convenient to include them, as has been done, by reference to contemporary legislation in the Province.\nIt appears to me that as the federal property at Camp Borden was within the Province of Ontario, the Highway Traffic Act of that Province would have applied to the highways inside the Camp boundaries had no regulations been enacted by the federal authority, but the federal government, of course, had authority to exercise control by way of regulation over the movement of traffic on its own property if it saw fit to do so and s. 6(2) of the Government Property Traffic Act Regulations makes it plain that the whole of the provincial law was not adopted and that the exercise of control by regulation over the movement of traffic within the Camp area was never relinquished by the federal authority. Section 6(2) reads as follows:\nIn this section the expression \u2018laws of the province and the municipality\u2019 does not include laws that are inconsistent with or repugnant to any of the provisions of the Government Property Traffic Act or these regulations.\nIn my view, therefore, the case of Regina v. Glibbery is distinguishable from the present case on the ground that the federal legislation there placed in question related to property within the province in respect to which the province was independently competent to legislate, whereas the matter of extra\u2011provincial transportation rests within the legislative competence of Parliament alone. Even if this were not so, and Parliament had exclusive power to regulate traffic within the boundaries of its own property, the regulations which were passed for that purpose do not constitute a delegation of that power to the provinces because control is clearly retained in the federal authority as is indicated by the last-quoted section of the regulations, whereas under the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, Parliament has, in my opinion, relinquished to the province all control over the licensing of extra-provincial transport.\nI have no doubt that the legislation here impugned was enacted by the Parliament of Canada with a view to cooperating with the provinces in the field of interprovincial transportation, but in framing the provisions of s. 3(2) and 5 of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, Parliament has, in my opinion, failed to achieve the end which it sought and the authority of the case of the A.G. v. Winner, supra, remains as it was before the statute was enacted.\nI do not think that anyone would question the desirability and in some cases the necessity of co\u2011operation between the federal and provincial authorities in the carrying out of their respective functions, but if this is to be done, as Lord Atkin said in A.G. for B.C. v. A.G. for Canada, supra, \u201cthe legislation will have to be carefully framed\u201d, and if it results in the federal authority relinquishing to a province all control over a sphere allotted to \u201cthe exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada\u201d under the British North America Act, then the legislation cannot stand.\nThe fact that Parliament can at any time repeal the offending sections of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act appears to me, with all respect, to be beside the point. The question here at issue is whether the language used by the framers of those sections, when read within the framework of the existing statute itself, has the effect of relinquishing all federal control over the licensing of \u201ca connecting undertaking\u201d. I think that it does.\nFor all these reasons I would allow this appeal and direct that an order of prohibition be made prohibiting the Ontario Highway Transport Board from proceeding with any hearing with respect to the appellant\u2019s extra-provincial operating licence. In my opinion, the appellant should have his costs in this Court and in the courts below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, MARTLAND and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.J.

Board of Govan School Unit No. 29 et al., [1968] S.C.R. 589\nDate: 1968-04-29\nIan McKay, an infant, suing by his next friend and father, Ivan McKay, and the said Ivan McKay (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Board of the Govan School Unit No. 29 of Saskatchewan and Donald Molesky (Defendants) RESPONDENTS.\n1968: February 20, 21, 22; 1968: April 29.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nNegligence\u2014Standard of care\u2014High school student injured as result of fall from parallel bars while practising for gymnastic display\u2014Breach of duty to guard against risk that boy might fall\u2014Teacher in charge exempted from liability by statute\u2014Liability of school board\u2014Damages.\nThe infant plaintiff sustained serious injuries, resulting in paraplegia, when he fell between parallel bars while practising for a gymnastic display which was to be staged at the high school, where he was a pupil, at a variety night performance arranged by the school. He was one of a group of 12 to 18 students who had volunteered to put on the gymnastic display under the supervision of a teacher, the second defendant. The action against the latter was dismissed by consent having regard to the provisions of s. 225a (added 1961, c. 29) of The School Act of Saskatchewan (now R.S.S. 1965, c. 184, s. 242) which provides that where the principal of a school approves or sponsors activities such as those here in question \u201cthe teacher responsible for the conduct of the pupils shall not be liable for damage \u2026 for personal injury suffered by pupils during such activities\u201d.\nThe jury found that the defendant school board failed in its duty of care to the plaintiff and that such failure resulted in the injuries sustained by him. The acts or omissions which constituted the failure in the duty of care were stated as follows: (i) Lack of competent instruction on parallel bars. (ii) Insufficient care and attention to spotting. (iii) Insufficient demonstration on parallel bars. (iv) Progressive steps on parallel bars rushed. (v) Instructor not sufficiently qualified. (vi) Insufficient safety precautions. The jury further found that the plaintiff had not contributed to his injuries by failure to exercise reasonable precautions for his own safety.\nDamages for the infant plaintiff were assessed by the jury at $183,900. The defendant school board appealed to the Court of Appeal and that Court, by a majority judgment, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial as to both liability and damages. An appeal by the plaintiffs was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nWhile not satisfied that the principle which was first expressed in Williams v. Eady (1893), 10 T.L.R. 41, that a schoolmaster was bound to take such care of his pupils as a careful father would take of his children is of universal application, particularly in cases where a schoolmaster is required to instruct or supervise the activities of a great number of pupils at one time, the Court was nevertheless of the opinion that a small group, such as that in this case, was one where the principle did apply.\nThe position here was that the teacher had accepted responsibility for the care and control of the infant plaintiff while he was engaged in the gymnastic practice and whatever analogy was involved in describing the standard by which his duty was to be tested, his supervisory duties required him to guard against forseeable risks to which this inexperienced boy was exposed in the performance of exercises on the parallel bars. There was a real risk that the boy might fall and there was a concomitant duty to guard against that risk eventuating. The jury found that there was a breach of that duty.\nAlso, it seemed that when Woods J.A., who delivered reasons for judgment on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, held, in effect, that the trial judge was wrong in directing the jury that the defendant owed the boy the duty of \u201ca careful parent\u201d rather than the duty of a \u201cphysical training instructor\u201d, he was saying that the judge had invited the jury to determine the liability of the defendant school board according to a lower standard of care than that by which it should have been judged. If this were indeed the case, it was difficult to understand how the defendant had any cause for complaint. This appeared to be the ground upon which the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the jury\u2019s verdict as to liability. This Court was of opinion that it could not be supported and accordingly the verdict of the jury should be restored in this regard.\nAs to the question of damages, R. 39 of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal Rules meant that even if there was misdirection on the part of the trial judge, the Court of Appeal could not grant a new trial unless it were satisfied that the damage award was so high or so low as to constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Here there could be no doubt that the injuries sustained by the infant plaintiff were of such a massive and crippling character as to justify a substantial award of damages. In his charge to the jury as to the principles by which they should be guided in making the assessment there was no misdirection on the part of the trial judge that would warrant the granting of a new trial.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], setting aside a judgment of MacPherson J. in favour of the present appellants after a trial with a jury in an action for damages for personal injuries and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.\nK.R. MacLeod and W.J. Vancise, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nD.G. McLeod, Q.C., and R.H. Bertram, for the defendant, respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[2], Hall J.A. dissenting, setting aside a judgment rendered in favour of the present appellant after a trial with a jury before Mr. Justice MacPherson and ordering a new trial on the issues as to both liability and damages.\nThis action was brought by Ivan McKay as next friend of his infant son, Ian McKay and personally against the respondent school board and one of its teachers, Donald Molesky, for damages arising out of injuries sustained by Ian McKay when he fell between parallel bars while practising for a gymnastic display which was to be staged by the William Derby High School, where he was a pupil, at a variety night performance arranged by that school. As a result of the fall the boy developed paraplegia and after long hospitalization and treatment, he was, at the time of the trial (two years after the accident) paralyzed from the neck down except for some shoulder and bicep muscles.\nThe action against Molesky was dismissed by consent having regard to the provisions of s. 225a (added 1961, c. 29) of The School Act of Saskatchewan (now R.S.S. 1965, c. 184, s. 242) which provides that where the principal of a school approves or sponsors activities such as those here in question \u201cthe teacher responsible for the conduct of the pupils shall not be liable for damage \u2026 for personal injury suffered by pupils during such activities\u201d.\nIan McKay was athletically inclined and was one of a group of 12 to 18 students who had volunteered to put on the gymnastic display under the supervision of Molesky who had had some experience in gymnastics while at teachers\u2019 college but who was not a qualified instructor in gymnastic work on the parallel bars. In the early days of practice for this display, the activities of the boys were limited to \u201ctumbling\u201d on mats on the floor, but a few days before the accident some parallel bars were brought from the public school to the scientific laboratory in the high school which was being used as the scene of the gymnastic practice. The evidence does not disclose that McKay had ever done any work on parallel bars before this time, but after a few days practice he assayed, under Molesky\u2019s charge and direction, the difficult feat which he describes as swinging his legs back and forth quite a few times with a view to gathering sufficient momentum to do a flip at the end of the bars and he says that his legs \u201cwere getting a little bit higher each time and when they were about level with my head, I guess about a foot above the bars, then I fell \u2026 in between the bars face down with my head turned a little to the left\u201d.\nThere is some difference between the witnesses as to the exact manoeuvre that the boy was trying to perform and Molesky described a simpler movement, but in any event, this untrained youth was in my opinion undoubtedly engaged in an exercise which was dangerous for him and which required close supervision. McKay says that Molesky had described the exercise but had not demonstrated it. Molesky and one of the other boys apparently were acting as what Molesky describes as \u201cspotters\u201d whose function was to help the performer on the parallel bars in his dismount, but it is clear that neither of them was at any time in a position to assist McKay in what he was doing or to prevent a fall in the area where it took place.\nThe following admissions were formally made by the respondent School Board:\n1. That on or about the 12th day of February, A.D. 1963, the defendant, Donald Molesky, was employed by the Defendant, the Board of the Govan School Unit, as a teacher at the William Derby High School and that during the school hours on the said day, the defendant, Donald Molesky was acting in the course of his employment as such.\n2. That the Plaintiff, Ian McKay, sustained injury to his person during school hours on the said day during activities then being supervised by the defendant, Donald Molesky, and approved or sponsored by the principal and teachers of the said High School, all duly appointed by the defendant, The Board of the Govan School Unit; and that the supervision of the said activities had been assigned to the defendant, Donald Molesky by the said principal of the said high school.\n3. That the said defendant, Donald Molesky, was responsible for the conduct of the pupils, including the plaintiff, Ian McKay, taking part in the said activities, within the meaning of section 225a of The Schools Act.\n4. That at the said time the defendant, Donald Molesky had the right of control of the said pupils including the plaintiff, Ian McKay. After a lengthy trial, the jury gave the following answers to questions submitted by the learned trial judge:\n1. Has the plaintiff satisfied you that the defendant failed in his duty of care to the plaintiff and that the said failure in whole or in part resulted in the injury to the plaintiff?\nAnswer: Yes.\n2. If answer number 1 is \u201cYes\u201d then please state fully the acts or omissions which constituted the failure in duty of care.\nAnswer:\n(i) Lack of competent instruction on parallel bars.\n(ii) Insufficient care and attention to spotting.\n(iii) Insufficient demonstration on parallel bars.\n(iv) Progressive steps on parallel bars rushed.\n(v) Instructor not sufficiently qualified. (vi) Insufficient safety precautions.\n3. Has the defendant satisfied you that the injuries of the plaintiff were caused or contributed to by his failure to exercise reasonable precautions for his own safety?\nAnswer: No.\nThe jury assessed damages for the infant plaintiff at $183,900.\nIt appears to me to be desirable before considering the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, for me to state that in my opinion the evidence is capable of supporting the answers which the jury gave to the first three questions which were submitted to them, but they did not necessarily have to reach the conclusion which they did and if, as the majority of the Court of Appeal has found, there was misdirection prejudicial to the respondent in the charge of the learned trial judge respecting the standard of care required of the school authorities, then there should, of course, be a new trial on the question of liability.\nIn his charge to the jury the learned trial judge repeatedly told them that the duty of care which Molesky owed to young McKay was that which a careful father of a large family owes to his children. This view, which has often been adopted, was first expressed many years ago by Lord Esher in Williams v. Eady[3], where he said at p. 42:\nAs to the law on the subject there can be no doubt; and it was correctly laid down by the learned Judge, that the schoolmaster was bound to take such care of his boys as a careful father would take of his boys, and there could not be a better definition of the duty of a schoolmaster. While I am not satisfied that this definition is of universal application, particularly in cases where a schoolmaster is required to instruct or supervise the activities of a great number of pupils at one time, I am nevertheless of the opinion that a small group, such as that which Molesky had in his charge in the improvised gymnasium, is one to which Lord Esher\u2019s words do apply.\nMr. Justice Woods, however, in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, expressed the view that while the test of the \u201ccareful father\u201d is readily applicable to students taking part in team games such as hockey or baseball, it did not apply to the facts of this case and he continued by saying:\nA physical training instructor in directing or supervising an evolution or exercise is bound to exercise the skill and competence of an ordinarily competent instructor in the field. The standard of the careful parent does not fit a responsibility which demands special training and expertise.\nThe learned judge later said:\nThe standard of the person possessed of special training or expertise may well be higher than that of the careful parent and it may well be that on applying it to the present facts a jury might arrive at the same result. This, however, is conjectural and therefore cannot be assumed. The standard of care put before the jury was inappropriate and confusing. It amounts to misdirection.\nI take the view that a reasonably careful parent would have been unlikely to permit his boy, almost totally inexperienced in gymnastics, to execute the manoeuvre which young McKay performed without exercising a great deal more care for his safety or ensuring that someone else did so on his behalf.\nThe position in the present case is that Molesky had accepted responsibility for the care and control of young McKay while he was engaged in the gymnastic practice and whatever analogy is involved in describing the standard by which Molesky\u2019s duty is to be tested, it is clear to me that his supervisory duties required him to guard against forseeable risks to which this inexperienced boy was exposed in the performance of exercises on the parallel bars. There was, in my opinion, a real risk that the boy might fall and there was a concomitant duty to guard against that risk eventuating. The particulars specified in the jury\u2019s answer to question No. 2 constitute a finding that there was a breach of that duty.\nWith the greatest respect, it seems to me also that when Mr. Justice Woods held, in effect, that the learned trial judge was wrong in directing the jury that the respondent owed the boy the duty of \u201ca careful parent\u201d rather than the duty which would have been owed by a \u201cphysical training instructor\u201d, he was saying that the judge had invited the jury to determine the liability of the respondent school board according to a lower standard of care than that by which it should have been judged. If this were indeed the case, it is difficult to understand how the respondent has any cause for complaint. This appears to me to be the ground upon which the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the jury\u2019s verdict as to liability, and with all respect, I do not think that it can be supported and I would accordingly restore the verdict of the jury in this regard.\nMr. Justice Woods also concluded that the learned trial judge had so misdirected the jury on the question of damages as to make a new trial necessary on this issue. This conclusion must, of course, be considered in light of the provisions of R. 39 of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal Rules which read, in part, as follows:\nA new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection \u2026 unless in the opinion of the Court, some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has been thereby occasioned in the trial \u2026\nWhen considering the jury\u2019s assessment of damages in isolation from the question of liability, it seems to me that this Rule must mean that even if there was misdirection on the part of the trial judge, the Court of Appeal could not grant a new trial unless it were satisfied that the damage award was so high or so low as to constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThere can, I think, be no doubt that the injuries sustained by Ian McKay were of such a massive and crippling character as to justify a very substantial award of damages. There does not appear to be any hope of his recovery and the only evidence of any possible improvement is highly speculative. The task of the jury was to endeavour to express the effect of his almost total physical disability in terms of financial recompense. Involving as it did so many imponderables, this was not an easy problem for the jury who had to make the assessment or for the judge who had to direct them as to the principles by which they should be guided.\nIn an attempt to provide some yardstick by which to judge the loss, evidence was adduced from a member of the staff of the head office of an insurance company who testified by reference to certain statistical tables that the average life expectancy of a youth of McKay\u2019s age would be 53 years, and a doctor who was familiar with his case stated that although some insurance companies were now insuring paraplegics, he did not feel that a normal life expectancy, even of a paraplegic, could be expected in Ian\u2019s case.\nYoung McKay had apparently had some ambitions to become an architect and it was suggested that a figure of $500 per month would be a moderate one to represent his potential future earnings if he had not been injured; his father also gave evidence that without the constant care which he is now getting at his home, it would cost at least $150 to retain someone to look after him.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Woods singled out the following quotation from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge as constituting \u201cmisdirection on a vital factor\u201d:\nThe damages which you calculate and which you award, gentlemen, as both Counsel have said, cannot be perfect. You heard evidence to the effect that to provide $500 a month for fifty-three years, requires $133,000. That is based upon 4%. But, of course, we have no way of knowing, you have no way of knowing, how long this chap will live, or how long he would have lived if he had not had the injury.\nMr. Justice Woods, in commenting on this statement said:\nThe charge, when referring to this 53 years, if it does not in fact do so, comes close to stating that such is the expectation of life of this infant plaintiff, properly to be considered by the jury in its calculation of damages. Considering all that was said on this factor, I cannot but come to the conclusion, that the charge was much too favourable to the infant plaintiff. It failed to adequately place before the jury, the probable life expectancy of the infant plaintiff as the basis of its calculation for this portion of damages suffered. I am of the opinion that this constitutes misdirection on a vital factor.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that the learned judges who formed the majority of the Court of Appeal overlooked the fact that almost immediately after the excerpt quoted above from the trial judge\u2019s charge, he went on to say:\nI did not consider that Mr. Clark (the insurance man) said that fifty-three years was the life expectancy of an annuitant. It was the life expectancy on the average, established by various insurance companies as far ago as 1938, 1939. It was before the war in any event. You cannot, gentlemen, in calculating this thing, just add up what he might have earned, what he needs to maintain himself\u2014add it all up and say that is what he is entitled to. This is perfect damages. The law says that you cannot make perfect damages. You cannot determine all the\u2014you cannot add up all the income he might have made as an architect because you do not know whether he would have become an architect, whether he would have got through University, whether he would have gone back to his father\u2019s farm;\u2026\nNotwithstanding this language, Mr. Justice Woods also found that the jury had been instructed \u201cthat earnings and cost of future care are to be cumulative, in the calculation of damages\u201d and he based this on a passage earlier in the judge\u2019s charge where he had said of \u201cthe financial loss experienced by this plaintiff\u201d\u2014\u201cI refer not only to prospective earnings for the balance of his life but to the financial loss resulting from constant care for the rest of his life \u2026\u201d With the greatest respect, I think that if there was any misdirection in this statement it was fully corrected and that there was no misdirection in this regard.\nMr. Justice Woods also criticized the charge of the learned trial judge on the ground that he had not warned the jury against letting sympathy affect their calculation of damages and in failing to state that the award \u201cshould not be punitive, exemplary, nor extravagant and oppressive\u201d. In so doing, Mr. Justice Woods discounted the fact that at the beginning of his charge the learned trial judge had said:\n\u2026 this is a Court of Law, and however profound your sympathy you must in this Court disregard it because sympathy is a poor guide in the search for legal principles.\nand that before embarking on the main body of his charge, he had again said: \u201c\u2026 you will rid yourselves of sympathy\u201d. In addition to this, immediately before addressing the jury on the subject of damages, the learned trial judge said:\nI repeat to you, gentlemen, what I said in opening. Sentiment is no guide in the search for legal principles. Do not be governed in your decision on liability by sympathy which undoubtedly you have for the plaintiff. I cannot find that there was any misdirection in this regard.\nMr. Justice Woods further criticized the learned trial judge for failing to instruct the jury that some discount should be made for the present payment of that portion of the damages designed to cover McKay\u2019s future requirements. It may be that some direct reference should have been made to this element, but I do not think that it can be said that the absence of such a direction constituted substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nIn conclusion, Mr. Justice Woods said:\nI am left with the strong conviction that in calculating the award, the jury has taken the annuity cost of $500 per month for 53 years, namely, $133,000 (which is not shown to have any direct relationship to the plaintiff\u2019s needs), and has added thereto a substantial sum for other elements of damages, to arrive at the total of $183,900. It cannot have allowed for all the contingencies of life which might have or may now happen. This indicates error, which, in substantial part, may have arisen from the matters referred to.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that in this passage Mr. Justice Woods entered upon the dangerous field of attempting to delve into the minds of the jury and to interpret their verdict in terms of his own mental processes.\nIn relation to the last-quoted excerpt from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it should be pointed out that in my view full instruction was given to the jury in relation to \u201cthe contingencies of life\u201d. The learned trial judge read to the jury a paragraph from the judgment of Sellers L.J. in Warren and Another v. King and Others[4], in which he said, in part:\n\u2026damages must take into consideration, in varying degrees according to circumstances, the many contingencies of life, its misfortunes as well as its good fortunes.\nWith the greatest respect, I am unable to agree with the Court of Appeal that there was any such misdirection in the charge of the learned trial judge as to warrant the granting of a new trial. For all these reasons I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Saskatchewan.\nThe appellant will have the costs of this appeal and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Balfour, MacLeod, McDonald, Moss, Laschuk & Kyle, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Pedersen, Norman, McLeod, Bertram & Todd, Regina.\n[1] (1967), 60 W.W.R. 513, 62 D.L.R.

As a result of the accident, which occurred late at night, the driver was killed and the plaintiff suffered serious injuries. The driver had had very little sleep for a considerable period prior to the accident. The force of the impact indicated a speed of 60 m.p.h., and the absence of skid marks where the car approached the sign showed that no attempt was made to stop. The car was a year old; there was no evidence of malfunction and the tires were good. The plaintiff\u2019s action for damages for the injuries which he sustained in the accident was dismissed at trial and an appeal from the trial judgment was dismissed by the Appellate Division. The plaintiff then appealed further to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIf the rule of res ipsa loquitur is accepted in cases where proof of \u201cnegligence\u201d is in issue, there was no logical reason why it should not apply with equal force when the issue is whether or not there was \u201cvery great negligence\u201d provided, of course, that the facts of themselves afford \u201creasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose\u201d as a result of \u201ca very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d.\nOn the evidence as a whole, the probable cause of this accident was that the driver fell asleep. He had continued to drive when he was feeling tired and had had very little sleep for thirty-six hours before the accident. He should have foreseen the danger that he might go to sleep at the wheel and his doing so under these circumstances involved a breach of duty to his passenger which constituted gross negligence. Consequently, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed under the provisions of s. 132(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 356.\nMcCulloch v. Murray, [1942] S.C.R. 141, applied; Ottawa Electric Co. v. Crepin, [1931] S.C.R. 407; Parent v. Lapointe, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 376; Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co.

(H.L.) 43, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming a judgment of Farthing J. dismissing an action for damages for personal injuries. Appeal allowed\u2026\nW.K. Moore, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW.R. Brennan, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the judgment rendered at trial by Mr. Justice Farthing whereby he dismissed the appellant\u2019s action for damages to compensate him for the injuries which he had sustained in an accident which occurred at 3:30 a.m. on September 22, 1963, when he was being driven as a gratuitous passenger in a Volkswagen motor vehicle owned by the respondent, Sadie Coates, and operated by the late Barry Alan Coates.\nThe driver Coates was killed in the accident and the appellant was asleep in the back seat of the car, but it is apparent from the evidence of Corporal Johnston of the R.C.M.P., which was recited by the trial judge, that the vehicle was being driven south towards Banff on a two-lane paved highway 36\u00bd feet in width, and had crossed the centre double traffic line and struck a direction sign pointing to the entrance of Buffalo Paddock which was 18 inches off the eastern edge of the highway. The wooden portion of the sign was 4 feet high and was set in a pile of Rocky Mountain stone which was mortared together and measured 6 feet 8 inches wide, 2 feet high and 4 feet 6 inches thick. In reviewing a portion of Corporal Johnston\u2019s evidence the learned trial judge said:\nCorporal Johnston said that there were no skid marks where the car approached the sign so no attempt was made to stop it. The force of impact was so great that it tore away three feet six inches from the stone base of the sign. He said that he thought the weight of the Volkswagen would be 1,700 pounds. It was a year old, the tires were good\u2014one of them was damaged in the accident\u2014and there was no evidence of malfunction in the car. The evidence of the force of the impact would indicate a speed of sixty-miles an hour, though this estimate was admitted by the corporal to have been based partly on the speed at which he had seen Coates drive in the past. The damage to the front of the car was so extensive that the police couldn\u2019t tell much about it. North of the sign\u2014whence the Volkswagen had come\u2014the road is straight for half a mile.\nAs I have indicated, the appellant was being transported in the motor vehicle in question as the guest of the driver \u201cwithout payment for transportation\u201d and under the provisions of s. 132(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 356, no such passenger \u201chas any cause of action for damages against the owner or driver for injury, death or loss, in case of accident, unless the accident was caused by gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle, and unless the gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury, death or loss for which the action is brought\u201d.\nIn spite of many judicial efforts to define \u201cgross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\u201d in precise terms, it appears to me that the test remains that which was outlined by Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. in McCulloch v. Murray[1], where he said, at p. 145:\nAll these phrases, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, imply conduct in which, if there is not conscious wrongdoing, there is a very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that the circumstances of the accident speak for themselves and constitute prima facie evidence of the fact that in driving his Volkswagen as he did, at a high rate of speed directly across the centre line of the highway so as to collide so forcefully with an obvious road sign, the driver, Barry Alan Coates showed a \u201cvery marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d.\nThe application of the rule which is usually referred to as res ipsa loquitur to cases of negligence has been accepted in this Court in the cases of Ottawa Electric Co. v. Crepin[2], at p. 411 and Parent v. Lapointe[3], at p. 381, in the terms in which it was stated by the Exchequer Chamber in Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Company[4], where it was said:\nThere must be reasonable evidence of negligence.\nBut where the thing is shewn to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.\nThere can be no doubt in the present case that the motor vehicle was under the management of Coates and that the accident was one which in the ordinary course of things would not have happened if he had used proper care, but it is contended on behalf of the respondent that the rule does not extend to proof of gross negligence.\nThis proposition was advanced by Ruttan J. sitting at trial in the case of Ball v. Kraft[5], where he said, at p. 39:\n\u2026Kerr v. Cummings, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 846, 6 W.W.R. (N.S.) 451 (affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, [1953] 2 D.L.R. 1, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 147) is authority for the principle that res ipsa loquitur does not apply to create a presumption of gross negligence. Negligence, as that authority holds, may be inferred when the circumstances \u201cwarrant the view that the fact of the accident is relevant to infer negligence\u201d. [[1952] 2 D.L.R. at p. 852]. But the plaintiff must still prove gross negligence. Robertson J.A. in our Court of Appeal in Kerr v. Cummings, [1952] 2 D.L.R. at p. 853, said:\n\u201cUnless the plaintiff in an action for gross negligence, when the cause of the accident is unknown, suggests a reason showing a greater probability that the accident may have happened from gross negligence than from the reason suggested by the defendant, the plaintiff must fail.\u201d And in the Supreme Court of Canada, [1953] 2 D.L.R. at p. 2, Kerwin J., in giving the judgment of the Court said:\n\u201c\u2026it is impossible, in my view, to say that the mere happening of the occurrence in the present case gives rise to a presumption that it was caused by very great negligence\u2026\u201d\nIt is, in my view, clear that Mr. Justice Kerwin intended his observations to be limited, as he says himself, to the facts of the case with which he was dealing, and although those facts were similar to the facts in the present case, there were marked differences amongst which was the fact that in the Kerr case, supra, there was \u201ca governor on the car which precluded a speed exceeding 40 miles per hour\u201d. In the Kerr case Mr. Justice Kerwin also made an express finding to the effect that he could not read the evidence as indicating either that the driver had been without sleep during the previous night or that he had fallen asleep at the wheel.\nThe passage from the judgment of Robertson J.A. in the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Kerr v. Cummings to which Ruttan J. referred in Ball v. Kraft is based on the authority of an English Admiralty case The Kite[6], where Langton J., sitting alone, approved the dissenting judgment of Lord Dunedin in the Scottish case of Ballard v. North British Railway Co.[7] The passage which he approved reads, in part, as follows:\nI think this is a case where the circumstances warrant the view that the fact of the accident is relevant to infer negligence. But what is the next step? I think that, if the defenders can show a way in which the accident may have occurred without negligence, the cogency of the fact of the accident by itself disappears, and the pursuer is left as he began, namely, that he has to show negligence. I need scarcely add that the suggestion of how the accident may have occurred must be a reasonable suggestion.\nIf the rule of res ipsa loquitur is accepted in cases where proof of \u201cnegligence\u201d is in issue, I can see no logical reason why it should not apply with equal force when the issue is whether or not there was \u201cvery great negligence\u201d provided, of course, that the facts of themselves afford \u201creasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose\u201d as a result of \u201ca very marked departure from the standards\u201d to which Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. referred in the McCulloch case. In my view, the circumstances here disclosed \u201cwarrant the view that the fact of the accident is relevant to infer\u201d \u201cvery great negligence\u201d. The driver himself was killed and there were no witnesses who could suggest a way in which the accident may have occurred without such negligence, but this is not the end of the matter if there are any other reasonable inferences which could be drawn from the circumstances themselves and which make it more probable than not that the accident occurred without gross negligence.\nIt is conceivable, as the respondent\u2019s counsel suggested, that an animal ran across the road and the car swerved to avoid it or that there, was a blow-out in the damaged tire or the sudden appearance of another vehicle and it appears that the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal are based in large measure on an acceptance of these suggestions, but there is no evidence whatever of an animal having run in front of the car or of the car having swerved to avoid it and no witnesses related the severely damaged condition of the front wheel of the car which hit the road sign, to a blow-out, nor was there any evidence of another car. In my opinion, the evidence as a whole makes it more probable that this accident happened because the driver went to sleep and I am also of the opinion that he should have known that he was likely to be overcome by sleep having regard to the fact that he had had so little sleep for such a long time.\nThe activities of Barry Alan Coates from 12 noon on Friday, September 20 until the time of the accident at 3:30 a.m. on the following Sunday, are conveniently summarized in the factum compiled on behalf of the appellant and I think it convenient to reproduce that summary:\nFriday,\nSeptember 20, 1963.\n12:00 noon\nCoates reports for work\n1:00 p.m.\nCoates at work\n2:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n3:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n4:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n5:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n6:00 p.m. to\n10:00 p.m.\nNo direct evidence\n10:40 p.m.\nCoates at work\n11:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n12:00 midnight\nCoates out with Walter Royle Saturday,\nSeptember 21, 1963.\n1:00 a.m.\n2:00 a.m.\n3:00 a.m.\nNo direct evidence\n4:00 a.m.\nCoates arises from bed\n4:45 a.m.\nCoates reports for work\n5:00 a.m.\nCoates at work\n6:00 a.m.\n\u201c\n7:00 a.m.\n\u201c\n8:00 a.m.\n\u201c\n9:00 a.m.\n\u201c\n10:00 a.m.\n\u201c\n11:00 a.m.\n\u201c\n12:00 noon\n\u201c\n12:30 p.m.\nCoates at Banff Pool Hall\n1:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n2:00 p.m.\n\u201c\n3:00 p.m.\nCoates still in Pool Hall\nWalker and Christou depart\n4:00 p.m.\nTime unaccounted for\u2014but Coates did not\n5:00 p.m.\ngo to bed\n6:00 p.m.\nCoates at Muskrat Street for dinner\n7:00 p.m.\nCoates at Muskrat Street watching football\n8:00 p.m.\ngame on television\n9:00 p.m.\nCoates leaves Muskrat Street\n9:30 p.m.\nCoates at Christou\u2019s house\n10:00 p.m.\nCoates leaves for dance\n11:00 p.m.\nCoates at dance\n12:00 midnight\nSunday,\nSeptember 22, 1963.\n12:30 a.m.\nCoates seen at Christou\u2019s party\n1:00 a.m.\n2:00 a.m.\nCoates leaves party to drive to hospital\n2:30 a.m.\nCoates leaves hospital for Town of Canmore\n3:30 a.m.\nCollision on return trip from Canmore.\nThere is evidence that before leaving the hospital for his drive to Canmore at 2:30 a.m., Coates indicated by his words and actions that he was tired and in my view the whole record of his activities from noon on Friday, September 20 until the time of the accident, when taken together with the circumstances of the accident itself, justifies the inference that Coates fell asleep at the wheel.\nThe case of Parent v. Lapointe, supra, was one in which the driver of a vehicle had gone to sleep but it did not in- volve proof of gross negligence. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Rand J., however, had occasion to say, at p. 387:\nOperating such a dangerous agency, an automobile moving at high speed, a speed which, judging from the position and condition of the car, was probably greater than that mentioned, with the lives of four sleeping men in his keeping, the driver was under the highest degree of duty toward them. There is nothing to qualify the simple fact of falling asleep at the steering wheel; and ordinarily, drowsiness sends out its premonitory signals, a warning which in such circumstances is disregarded by a driver at his peril.\nI do not adopt this passage in its entirety because I am not prepared to found any inference of negligence on the basis that there is ordinarily a forewarning of the approach of sleep, but, as I have indicated, I do think that a driver like Coates who continued to drive when he was feeling tired and who had had very little sleep for thirty-six hours before the accident, should have foreseen the danger that he might go to sleep at the wheel and that his doing so under these circumstances involved a breach of duty to his passenger which constituted gross negligence.\nIn any event, I do not think that the inference of gross negligence to which the circumstances of the accident itself give rise is in any way weakened by the fact that the evidence as a whole makes it more probable than not that the driver went to sleep. It accordingly appears to me that even applying the test suggested by Mr. Justice Robertson in the Kerr case, supra, there are circumstances here \u201cshowing a greater probability that the accident may have happened from gross negligence than from the reasons suggested by the defendant\u201d.\nI appreciate that this is an appeal in which neither the trial judge nor the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was prepared to draw an inference of gross negligence, but no question arises as to the veracity of the witnesses and this is accordingly a case which is governed by the language used by Lord Halsbury in Montgomerie & Co. Ltd. v. Wallace\u2011James[8], at p. 75, which was affirmed by the Privy Council in Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Insurance Co.[9], at p. 257. Lord Halsbury said, in part:\n\u2026where no question arises as to truthfulness, and where the question is as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence, then the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges of an Appellate Court. In view of all the above, I would allow this appeal and direct that the appellant should have his costs throughout. The appeal being in forma pauperis the costs in this Court will be taxed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 142 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The appellant is accordingly entitled to his special damages and general damages in the amount of $40,000 as assessed by the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: MacDonald, Moore, Atkinson, McMahon & Tingle, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan, Fraser, Bell & Code, Calgary.\n[1] [1942] S.C.R. 141.\n[2] [1931] S.C.R. 407.\n[3] [1952] 1 S.C.R. 376.\n[4] (1865), 3 H. & C. 596, 159 E.R. 665.\n[5] (1967), 60 D.L.R.

Murdoch Whitcomb (Defendants) Respondents.\n1968: February 28, 29; 1968: May 13.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nBills and notes\u2014Unconditional promise in writing to pay principal at fixed and determinable future time\u2014Option to make earlier payments from time to time\u2014Whether promissory note\u2014Acceleration clause on default of interest payments\u2014Number of late payments accepted without penalty of default\u2014Whether defence of equitable estoppel applicable\u2014Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, s. 176(1).\nUnder an agreement involving the sale of the plaintiff company to the defendant W, $42,000 of the purchase price was \u201c\u2026 to be secured by a promissory note made by the Purchaser and endorsed by an endorser acceptable to the Vendor\u2026\u201d W caused the defendant company to be incorporated and the plaintiff agreed to accept a note signed by that company and endorsed by W. In furtherance of this arrangement, the defendants executed a document whereby the defendant company promised to pay the appellant or order the sum of $42,000 in nine years and ten months from April 1, 1963, together with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on May 1, 1963, and on the first day of each month thereafter until payment, \u201cprovided that the maker may pay on account of principal from time to time the whole or any portion thereof upon giving thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of intention prior to such payment\u201d. In default of payment of any interest payment for a period of ten days after the same became due the whole amount payable under the note was to become immediately due.\nBy October 1, 1964, eleven payments had been accepted more than ten days after they were due. On December 7, the November 1 interest payment then being 36 days overdue, the president of the plaintiff addressed a registered letter to both defendants demanding immediate payment of the $42,000 and outstanding interest. W\u2019s reaction to this demand was to tender the sum of $420, being the amount of the November 1 and December 1 instalments of interest, but this offer was rejected. On January 14, 1965, an action was commenced whereby the plaintiff claimed against the defendants as maker and endorser of a promissory note the sum of $42,000, by reason of the default made in the interest payments due for the months of October and November, 1964, together with interest to date.\nThe trial judge, in giving judgment for the plaintiff, found that the instrument in question was a \u201cpromissory note\u201d within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, and that the plaintiff was not estopped by its conduct from setting up the defendants\u2019 failure to make the interest payments in accordance with the note as entitling it to recover the whole amount payable thereon. On appeal, the Court of Appeal by a majority held that the appeal should be allowed in part and the judgment reduced to $420. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe instrument in question was an unconditional promise in writing made by the defendant to pay the plaintiff or order the sum of $42,000 at a fixed and determinable future time, namely, nine years and ten months from April 1, 1963. This was a promise of the kind defined in s. 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, and the fact that the maker was accorded the privilege of making payments on account of principal from time to time did not alter the nature of his unconditional promise to pay at the time fixed by the instrument, but merely gave him an option to make earlier payment. Accordingly, the instrument in question was a promissory note, and there could be no doubt that the defendants were in default in their interest payments for more than ten days after the same became due. Dagger v. Shepherd, [1946] 1 All E.R. 133, applied; Williamson et al. v. Rider, [1962] 2 All E.R. 268; Crouch v. Credit Foncier of England (1873), L.R. 8 Q.B. 374, not followed.\nThe circumstances disclosed by the evidence were not such as to justify the majority of the Court of Appeal in concluding that this was a case to which the defence of equitable estoppel or estoppel by representation applied. This type of equitable defence could not be invoked unless there was some evidence that one of the parties entered into a course of negotiation which had the effect of leading the other to suppose that the strict rights under the contract would not be enforced, and this implied there must be evidence from which it could be inferred that the first party intended that the legal relations created by the contract would be altered as a result of the negotiations. It was not enough to show that one party had taken advantage of indulgences granted to him by the other for if this were so in relation to commercial transactions, such as promissory notes, it would mean that the holders of such notes would be required to insist on the very letter being enforced in all cases for fear that any indulgences granted and acted upon could be translated into a waiver of their rights to enforce the contract according to its terms.

Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nWilliam L. Hoyt, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nE. Neil McKelvey, Q.C., and J. Ian M. Whitcomb, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (Bridges C.J. dissenting)1 setting aside the judgment rendered at trial by Barry J. whereby he had awarded the appellant the sum of $42,000 together with interest of $420 as the amount due to it on what he found to be a valid promissory note made in its favour which was signed by the respondent company and endorsed by the respondent Whitcomb.\nFor some time prior to the events which gave rise to this action, John M. Burrows, the beneficial owner of all the shares in the capital stock of the appellant company, had been on friendly terms with the respondent, Whitcomb, with whom he appears to have been engaged in various business ventures, and on March 22, 1963, he became a party to an agreement whereby the appellant company (which then operated under the name of Subsurface Survey Limited), agreed to sell its assets to Mr. Whitcomb as of the close of business on January 31, 1963, for a total price of $127,274.43. Under the agreement $42,000 of the purchase price was\n\u2026to be secured by a promissory note made by the Purchaser and endorsed by an endorser acceptable to the Vendor payable to the Vendor within a period of ten years from the date of this Agreement, such promissory note to bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum with such interest being payable monthly and to provide for thirty days\u2019 notice by the Purchaser to the Vendor of any payments made on the principal thereof except the final payment payable on the date ten years from this Agreement.\nFor the purpose of carrying out this transaction, Whitcomb caused the respondent company to be incorporated under the name of Subsurface Surveys Limited and the appellant agreed to accept a note signed by that company and endorsed by Whitcomb. In furtherance of this arrangement, the respondents executed the following document upon which this action is now brought:\nFredericton, N.B.\nMarch 28, 1963.\n$42,000.00\nFOR VALUE RECEIVED Subsurface Surveys Ltd. promises to pay to John Burrows Ltd. or order at the Royal Bank of Canada the sum of forty-two Thousand Dollars ($42,000.00) in nine (9) years and ten (10) months from April 1st, 1963, together with interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from April 1st, 1963, payable monthly on the first day of May, 1963, and on the first day of each and every month thereafter until payment, provided that the maker may pay on account of principal from time to time the whole or any portion thereof upon giving thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of intention prior to such payment.\nIn default of payment of any interest payment or instalment for a period of ten (10) days after the same became due the whole amount payable under this note is to become immediately due.\nSUBSURFACE SURVEYS LTD.\n(Sgd.) \u201cG. Murdoch Whitcomb\u201d\nPresident\n(Sgd.) \u201cG. Murdoch Whitcomb\u201d\nEndorser\nThe makers, endorsers, and guarantors hereof waive presentment for payment, notice of nonpayment, protest and notice of protest.\nSUBSURFACE SURVEYS LTD.\n(Sgd.) \u201cG. Murdoch Whitcomb\u201d\nPresident\n(Sgd.) \u201cG. Murdoch Whitcomb\u201d\nEndorser.\nOn March 28 the respondent, Whitcomb, also executed an agreement with the appellant company wherein he is described as \u201cthe debtor\u201d and the appellant is described as \u201cthe company\u201d, whereby he acknowledged that he had deposited 5,101 common shares of Subsurface Surveys Limited with John Burrows Limited \u201cby way of pledge as security for payment of the said note\u201d, by which he clearly intended to refer to the document last hereinbefore recited. This agreement contains the following clause:\nThat on default being made by both Subsurface Surveys Ltd. and the Debtor in paying any principal or interest due at any time according to the terms of the said note the Company may forthwith cause the pledged shares to be transferred to the name of the Company on the share register of Subsurface Surveys Ltd. and the pledged shares shall thereupon become the absolute property of the Company.\nSo long as Burrows remained on friendly terms with the respondent Whitcomb the appellant company does not appear to have insisted on enforcing the letter of this agreement, and continuing indulgences were granted to the respondent with respect to the making of interest payments on the due dates so that by October 1, 1964, eleven payments had been accepted more than ten days after they were due, but on November 23, 1964, there was a falling out between Burrows and Whitcomb and heated words were exchanged between them. On December 7, the November 1 interest payment then being 36 days overdue, Burrows addressed a registered letter to both respondents in the following terms:\nThis letter will serve to inform you that, an interest payment due under the terms of the promissory note dated March 28, 1963 made by Subsurface Surveys Ltd. and endorsed by G. Murdoch Whitcomb being in default for more than 10 days, the whole amount payable under the note is now due.\nWe hereby demand immediate payment of the principal amount of $42,000.00, and outstanding interest.\nIf payment in full is not made by December 11, 1964 it is our intention to exercise our remedies under the agreement of March 28, 1963 between G. Murdoch Whitcomb and John Burrows Ltd.\nThe respondent Whitcomb\u2019s reaction to this demand was to tender the sum of $420, but things had gone too far and Mr. Burrows rejected the offer and made it plain that the matter would in future be handled by his solicitor. In due course, on January 14, 1965, this action was commenced whereby the appellant claimed against the respondents as maker and endorser of a promissory note, the sum of $42,000 by reason of the default made in the interest payments due for the months of October and November, 1964, together with interest to date. The two defences raised by the respondents which form the subject of the appeal are:\n(a) That the document referred to in paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim is not a promissory note because it is not due at a fixed or determinable future time and is not for a sum certain as required by Section 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act. \u2026 (and)\n(c) \u2026(i) the Plaintiff is estopped from saying that the Defendants defaulted in the payment of such interest because by its conduct\u2026 it represented to the Defendants that late payment would be accepted without penalty of default which said representation was intended to affect the legal relations between the Plaintiff and the Defendants and which said representation was relied on and acted on by the Defendants.\nAs has been indicated, the appellant\u2019s action was originally framed as an action on a promissory note, but during the course of the trial, and at the suggestion of the learned trial judge, the statement of claim was amended to include alternative claims for the principal amount of $42,000 as the balance due by the respondent company on the purchase price of the business and also as the balance due by both respondents on an account stated between them and the appellant.\nThe learned trial judge however, in giving judgment for the present appellant, found that the instrument in question was a \u201cpromissory note\u201d within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, and that the appellant was not estopped by its conduct from setting up the respondents\u2019 failure to make the interest payments in accordance with the note as entitling it to recover the whole amount payable thereon.\nIt was contended on behalf of the respondent that because the instrument in question contained the provision that:\n\u2026the maker may pay on account of principal from time to time the whole or any portion thereof upon giving thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of intention prior to such payment.\nit was therefore not a promissory note within the definition contained in s. 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act which reads as follows:\n(1) A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to, or to the order of, a specified person, or to bearer.\nIn acceding to this contention in the opinion which he delivered in the Appeal Division, Mr. Justice Ritchie, with whom Limerick J.A. agreed in the result, relied in great measure on the case of Williamson et al. v. Rider[2], where the majority of the Court of Appeal in England held that a written promise to pay a sum certain \u201con or before\u201d a given date was not a promissory note within the meaning of s. 83(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882 (which is identical with s. 176(1) of our own Act), because the words created an uncertainty as to the date of payment and introduced a contingency.\nThe opinion of the majority was most fully expressed in the judgment of Danckwerts L.J., who thought the case to be governed by the decision of Blackburn J. in Crouch v. Credit Foncier of England[3], in which it was held that debentures issued under a company\u2019s seal, repayable at a certain time but subject to a condition which permitted redemption by drawings by lot, \u201ccould not be promissory notes\u201d.\nDanckwerts L.J. treated this case as decisive notwithstanding the authority of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Dagger v. Shepherd[4], in which a notice by a landlord to quit \u201con or before\u201d a fixed date was held to be an effective notice and in which Evershed J. had said:\nThe use of the phrase \u201con or before\u201d some fixed date is today by no means uncommon, particularly in covenants or demands for payment of money, and in such a context it cannot, in our judgment, be open to serious doubt that it means, and would be understood to mean that the covenantor or debtor is under obligation to pay the debt on (but not earlier than) the date fixed but has the option of discharging it at any earlier time selected by him.\nWe are not bound by the decision of the majority in the Williamson case and I prefer the reasoning in the dissenting judgment delivered by Ormerod L.J., in which he pointed out that the Crouch case was distinguishable on the ground that the payment there was dependent upon a very real contingency, namely a lottery, whereas in the Williamson case, as in the present case, there was no such contingency. Mr. Justice Ormerod cited with approval the judgment of Evershed J. in Dagger v. Shepherd, supra, and concluded by saying:\n\u2026I have come to the view that, in spite of the words \u201con or before\u201d, there is no uncertainty about the date of payment under this promissory note which would render this document other than that which it purports to be. I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that this is a promissory note within the meaning of s. 83(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882\u2026\nThe instrument here in question is an unconditional promise in writing made by the respondent to pay the appellant or order the sum of $42,000 at a fixed and determinable future time, namely, nine years and ten months from April 1, 1963. This was a promise of the kind defined in s. 176(1) and the fact that the maker was accorded the privilege of making payments on account of principal from time to time did not alter the nature of his unconditional promise to pay at the time fixed by the instrument, but merely gave him an option to make earlier payment.\nI am accordingly of opinion that the instrument in question was a promissory note, and there can be no doubt that the respondents were in default in their interest payments for more than ten days after the same became due.\nIt remains to be considered whether the circumstances disclosed by the evidence were such as to justify the majority of the Court of Appeal in concluding that this was a case to which the defence of equitable estoppel or estoppel by representation applied.\nSince the decision of the present Lord Denning in the case of Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.[5], there has been a great deal of discussion, both academic and judicial, on the question of whether that decision extended the doctrine of estoppel beyond the limits which had been theretofore fixed, but in this Court in the case of Conwest Exploration Co. Ltd. et al. v. Letain[6], Mr. Justice Judson, speaking for the majority of the Court, expressed the view that Lord Denning\u2019s statement had not done anything more than restate the principle expressed by Lord Cairns in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[7], in the following terms:\nIt is the first principle upon which all courts of equity proceed, that if parties, who have entered into definite and distinct terms, involving certain legal results\u2014certain penalties or legal forfeiture\u2014afterwards by their own act or with their own consent, enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable, having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties.\nIn the case of Combe v. Combe[8], Lord Denning recognized the fact that some people had treated his decision in the High Trees case as having extended the principle stated by Lord Cairns and he was careful to restate the matter in the following terms:\nThe principle, as I understand it, is that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his word.\nIt seems clear to me that this type of equitable defence cannot be invoked unless there is some evidence that one of the parties entered into a course of negotiation which had the effect of leading the other to suppose that the strict rights under the contract would not be enforced, and I think that this implies that there must be evidence from which it can be inferred that the first party intended that the legal relations created by the contract would be altered as a result of the negotiations.\nIt is not enough to show that one party has taken advantage of indulgences granted to him by the other for if this were so in relation to commercial transactions, such as promissory notes, it would mean that the holders of such notes would be required to insist on the very letter being enforced in all cases for fear that any indulgences granted and acted upon could be translated into a waiver of their rights to enforce the contract according to its terms.\nAs Viscount Simonds said in Tool Metal Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Tungsten Electric Co. Ltd.[9]:\n\u2026the gist of the equity lies in the fact that one party has by his conduct led the other to alter his position. I lay stress on this, because I would not have it supposed, particularly in commercial transactions, that mere acts of indulgence are apt to create rights\u2026 The learned trial judge dealt with the rule of estoppel by representation as applied to the circumstances of the present case in the following brief paragraphs:\nIt is my opinion, however, that for such a rule to apply, the plaintiff must have known or should have known that his action or inaction was being acted upon by the defendant and that the defendant thereby changed his legal position. I do not believe that John Burrows ever gave any consideration to the fact that in accepting late payments of interest on the note, he was thereby leading Mr. Whitcomb\u2014as an officer of the defendant corporation\u2014into thinking that strict compliance would not be required at any time.\nIt is a matter of regret that Mr. Burrows did not see fit to advise Mr. Whitcomb by letter or verbally of his intention to require strict adherence to the terms of the note; but be that as it may, it is my opinion that both defendants were always aware of the terms of P.1 and knew that default in payment of interest exceeding 10 days could result in the plaintiff demanding full payment, as the plaintiff has now done.\nMr. Justice Ritchie, who did not agree with the learned trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the evidence, made the following observations in the course of his reasons for judgment:\nBy its conduct in accepting payments of interest after they were more than ten days in default and, over a period of sixteen months, not proceeding to enforce payment of the principal amount owing under P-1, the plaintiff gave the defendants a promise, or assurance, which it intended would affect the legal relations between them. Thereby, the plaintiff lulled the defendants into a false sense of security and misled them into the belief its strict right to enforce immediate payment of the principal amount of $42,000 would be held in abeyance or be suspended until they were informed otherwise. It was reasonable for the defendants so to interpret the plaintiff\u2019s conduct. As a result, the position of each defendant was prejudiced. In my respectful opinion, the evidence supports that conclusion.\nWith the greatest respect for the reasoning of the majority of the Court of Appeal, I prefer the interpretation placed on the evidence by the learned trial judge and by Chief Justice Bridges in his dissenting reasons for judgment where he said:\nFor estoppel to apply, I think we must be satisfied that the conduct of Burrows amounted to a promise or assurance, intended to affect the legal relations of the parties to the extent that if an interest instalment became in default for ten days the plaintiff would not claim the principal as due unless it had previously notified the defendants of its intention to do so or, if it had not so notified them, that notice would be given them the principal would be claimed if such instalment so in default were not paid. This is, I think, a great deal to infer.\nI do not think that the evidence warrants the inference that the appellant entered into any negotiations with the respondents which had the effect of leading them to suppose that the appellant had agreed to disregard or hold in suspense or abeyance that part of the contract which provided that:\n\u2026on default being made by both Subsurface Surveys Ltd. and the Debtor in paying any principal or interest due at any time according to the terms of the said note the Company may forthwith cause the pledged shares to be transferred to the name of the Company on the share register of Subsurface Surveys Ltd. and the pledged shares shall thereupon become the absolute property of the Company.\nI am on the other hand of opinion that the behaviour of Mr. Burrows is much more consistent with his having granted friendly indulgences to an old associate while retaining his right to insist on the letter of the obligation, which he did when he and Whitcomb became estranged and when the respondents were in default in payment of an interest payment for a period of 36 days.\nFor all these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant is entitled to its costs both here and in the Appeal Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs and trial judgment restored.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Hoyt, Mockler & Dixon, Fredericton.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: McKelvey, Macaulay, Machum & Fairweather, Saint John.\n[1] (1967), 53 M.P.R. 169, 62 D.L.R.

The appellant, taking the two infant children of the marriage with her, left the said matrimonial home, without the knowledge or consent of the respondent, and moved to Ontario. Upon the complaint of the appellant, a provisional maintenance order was made against the respondent, under the provisions of The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 105, and The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 346, by a judge of the Juvenile and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. On an application to the Winnipeg Juvenile and Family Court for confirmation, under The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1961 (Man.), c. 36, of the aforementioned order, it was held that the Court in Metropolitan Toronto was without jurisdiction to make the said order, on the ground that the matrimonial disputes alleged by the appellant took place outside Ontario. An appeal by way of stated case from the decision of the judge of the Winnipeg Juvenile and Family Court was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. With leave, an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the judge of the Winnipeg Juvenile and Family Court to be dealt with on the merits.\nThe object of the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders legislation was to enable a deserted wife, resident in a state or province the courts of which do not have jurisdiction over the husband who, allegedly, has deserted her and who is residing in a reciprocating state, to initiate proceedings in the province where she is and so to avoid the necessity of travelling to the province in which the husband is, a course which would often be a practical impossibility. To hold that a provisional order can be made only by a court which has jurisdiction to make a final and binding order of maintenance against the husband would be to defeat the whole purpose of this part of the legislative scheme.

Appeal allowed.\nL.R. Mitchell and J.D. Raichura, for the appellant.\nMurray D. Zaslov, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1 pronounced on June 14, 1967, dismissing an appeal by way of stated case from a decision of Her Honour N.M. Sanders, Judge of the Winnipeg Juvenile and Family Court, given on February 1, 1967, refusing to confirm a provisional order of the Juvenile and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto dated July 19, 1966.\nThe provisional order of July 19, 1966, recites that it was made under the provisions of The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 105, and The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 346, and that it appears \u201cthat the said Judith Bailey is entitled to the benefit of the said Act\u201d. It is signed by N.K. Bennett, Judge of the Juvenile and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. The operative portion of the order reads as follows:\nI, the undersigned, do hereby Order that the said Kenneth Rex Bailey do pay hereafter to his said wife at The Juvenile and Family Court, 311 Jarvis Street in the City of Toronto, the sum of $40.00 a week for the support of wife and two children of the said Kenneth Rex Bailey.\nThe first payment to be made on the day set by the Judge or Magistrate confirming this Provisional Order.\nTHIS ORDER is provisional only and shall have no force and effect until confirmed by a Court of Competent Jurisdiction where the Defendant is residing.\nGiven under my hand this 19th day of July, 1966.\nThe course followed in the Winnipeg Family Court is set out in the stated case submitted to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba by Her Honour Judge Sanders. The Court of Appeal, in dealing with the matter, confined itself to the facts as set out in the stated case and it will be convenient to set out the stated case in full. It is headed:\nIN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL BY WAY OF STATED-CASE FROM AN ORDER MADE UNDER SECTION 6 OF THE RECIPROCAL ENFORCEMENT OF MAINTENANCE ORDERS ACT, CHAPTER 36, STATUTES OF MANITOBA, 1961.\nBETWEEN:\nJUDITH BAILEY,\n(Complainant) Appellant\n\u2014AND\u2014\nKENNETH REX BAILEY,\n(Defendant) Respondent It is signed by Judge Sanders and reads as follows:\n1. On 19th day of July, 1966 upon the complaint of the Appellant, a Provisional Maintenance Order pursuant to the provisions contained in The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, Chapter 105 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1960 and The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, Chapter 346 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1960 was made against the Respondent by N.K. Bennett, Esq., Judge of the Juvenile and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.\n2. The said Provisional Order, together with the transcript of evidence heard in Toronto, was sent to this Court by the Department of the Attorney General of Manitoba for filing and confirmation, pursuant to Section 6 of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, Chapter 36, Statutes of Manitoba, 1961.\n3. On the 24th day of October, 1966, the date set for the hearing of this matter, and without my calling the Respondent on the merits herein, counsel for Respondent raised a preliminary objection to the effect that on the evidence of the locus of the alleged matrimonial disputes contained in the said transcript of evidence, the said Juvenile Court and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto was without jurisdiction to make the said Provisional Order, and asked me to refuse to confirm same.\n4. The said transcript of evidence was read by me for the limited purposes of determining the preliminary question of jurisdiction and said transcript of evidence shows that:\n(a) the Appellant and the Respondent are married and at all times material hereto had their matrimonial home in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba;\n(b) on the 19th day of May, 1966, the Appellant, taking the two infant children of the marriage with her, left the said matrimonial home, without the knowledge or consent of the Respondent;\n(c) at the time of the making of the said Provisional Order, the Appellant was residing in the City of Toronto, in Ontario.\n5. On the 24th day of October, 1966, legal submissions on the question of, jurisdiction were made to me by counsel for the Respondent and for the Crown. I reserved my ruling on this point, and I requested further submissions in writing which were subsequently provided by both counsel.\n6. On the 23rd day of January, 1967, I orally delivered my reserved ruling on the preliminary objection as to jurisdiction raised by counsel for the Respondent, and held that the said Juvenile and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto did not have jurisdiction to make the Provisional Maintenance Order hereinbefore referred to on the grounds that the matrimonial disputes alleged by the Appellant took place outside Ontario. I made no findings on the merits herein.\nThe Attorney General of Manitoba on behalf of the Appellant desires to question the validity of my said ruling on the ground that it is erroneous in point of law, and the points of the case being stated for the opinion and decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba are as follows:\n(1).Did I err in law in holding that the Juvenile and Family Court of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto was without jurisdiction to make the Provisional Maintenance Order dated the 19th day of July, 1966, on the ground that the alleged matrimonial disputes took place at the City of Winnipeg in Manitoba, and therefore the said Court in Ontario had no jurisdiction to make the said Provisional Order?\n(2) Did I err in law in holding that the said Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act of Ontario, claims no extra-territorial jurisdiction?\n(3) Did I err in holding that the matrimonial disputes between spouses should be adjudicated by the Courts of the Province of their matrimonial home, and one Province to which the wife may happen to go should not attempt to adjudicate such disputes particularly where the spouses were resident in another Province at the time of the break-up of the marriage?\n(4) Did I err in law in holding that the facts herein present a clear example of the first ground found in the statement of grounds of defence upon which the making of the Order could have been opposed in Ontario, namely that the Court had no jurisdiction to make the Order?\nThe question for the determination of the Court of Appeal is whether or not the Summary Conviction Court came to the correct determination and decision on these points of law, and if not, the Court of Appeal is respectfully requested to revise or amend the decision of the Summary Conviction Court insofar as it relates to the question of jurisdiction.\nUnder The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1961 (Man.), c. 36, Ontario has been declared to be a reciprocating State and under The Recriprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 346, Manitoba has been declared to be a reciprocating State.\nPursuant to s. 4(3) of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act of Ontario, a statement showing the grounds on which the making of the order might have been opposed was sent to the Attorney-General for transmission to the proper officer of Manitoba. These grounds were stated to be as follows:\n1. The Court had no jurisdiction to make the Order.\n2. The matter of the Complaint is not true.\n3. There is no valid marriage subsisting between the Complainant and the Defendant.\n4. A degree of judicial separation, or an Order having the effect of such a decree, is in force.\n5. The Complainant had deserted the Defendant.\n6. The Complainant had committed adultery which the Defendant has not condoned, connived at, or by wilful neglect and misconduct conduced to.\n7. The Defendant has reasonable cause to leave the Complainant.\n8. Under a decree or Order of a competent court, the Complainant is already entitled to alimony, and that such decree is being complied with. 9. The Defendant is not of sufficient ability to maintain the Complainant.\n10. That the children, namely, KEVIN BORN MARCH 17th, 1962 and KAREN BORN JANUARY 15th, 1965 being over the age of sixteen years, (sic) no provision in respect to can be included in the Order.\n11. The Defendant is not of sufficient ability to support the children.\nIt will be observed that the learned judge of the Winnipeg Family Court proceeded:\n\u2026on the ground that the alleged matrimonial disputes took place at the City of Winnipeg in Manitoba, and therefore the said Court in Ontario had no jurisdiction to make the said Provisional Order.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Guy J.A., who gave the unanimous reasons of the Court, contrasted the wording of s. 4(1) of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act of Ontario with s. 5(1) the corresponding section of the Manitoba Act. In the Manitoba Act, s. 5(1) opens with the words: \u201cWhere an application is made to a court in Manitoba by a dependent who is resident in the province\u201d, while in Ontario the words of s. 4(1) are: \u201cWhere an application is made to a court in Ontario for a maintenance order\u201d. Guy J.A. took the view that the absence in the Ontario Act of the words \u201cwho is resident in the province\u201d prevents the appellant from arguing that jurisdiction is specifically conferred on the Ontario Court by reason of her residence. With respect, this difference in wording does not appear to me to be of great significance; if a difference exists, the words of the Ontario statute are more general, not more restrictive, than those of the Manitoba Act. They are wide enough to include an applicant who is resident in Ontario as the appellant is.\nThe next matter with which Guy J.A. dealt was the English decision of Re Wheat[2], in which it was held that desertion was looked upon as a continuing offence, its local situs corresponding with the residence from time to time of the deserted spouse. Guy J.A. rejected the argument of the appellant that if a wife was deserted in Manitoba and went to live in Ontario, the desertion would be deemed to be continuing in her new place of residence so that the Courts of Ontario would be vested with jurisdiction to entertain an application by her for maintenance. He phrased his reasons for rejecting this argument as follows:\nConcerning that submission we make two comments. In the first place, on the facts as found by the learned Family Court Judge, it is not open to us to say that the wife was deserted in Manitoba, or indeed deserted at all. We merely know that on May 19th, 1966, the appellant took the two infant children of the marriage and left the Winnipeg matrimonial home, without the knowledge or consent of the husband. Such a statement of facts cannot support a conclusion that the wife was deserted. Accordingly an argument based on the Wheat case can have no application here.\nIn the second place this Court in Smith v. Smith, (1953), 9 W.W.R. (N.S.) 144, affirming a judgment of Tritschler J. (as he then was), held that the provisions of The Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act did not apply to persons resident in another province. \u201cThe offences of cruelty, desertion and non-support committed outside Manitoba are not acts \u2018over which the Legislature of the province has legislative authority\u2019\u2026\u201d, was the wording used in the Smith decision. Desertion in one province should not accordingly be regarded as giving a basis for jurisdiction of the courts of another province to which the deserted spouse may have gone.\nI find myself unable to agree with this reasoning. The depositions which were taken in Ontario are not before us and we should limit ourselves, as did the Court of Appeal, to the facts stated in the stated case.\nIn so far as the question is whether or not desertion occurred, all we know is what is set out in para. 4(b) of the stated case quoted above and which reads as follows:\n(b) on the 19th day of May, 1966, the Appellant, taking the two infant children of the marriage with her, left the said matrimonial home, without the knowledge or consent of the Respondent;\nUnder The Deserted Wives\u2019 Maintenance Act of Ontario, a married woman may be deemed to have been deserted by her husband although it is she who has left him. This is set out in s. 1(2) and (3) of the Act which read as follows:\n1(2) A married woman shall be deemed to have been deserted within the meaning of this section when she is living apart from her husband because of his acts of cruelty, or of his refusal or neglect, without sufficient cause, to supply her with food and other necessaries when able so to do, or of the husband having been guilty of adultery that has not been condoned and that is duly proved, notwithstanding the existence of a separation agreement where there has been default under it and whether or not it contains express provisions excluding the operation of this Act.\n(3) Without restricting in any way the generality of subsection 2, conduct causing reasonable apprehension of bodily injury, or of injury to health, without proof of actual personal violence, that renders the home an unfit place, either for a wife or a child, may be held to constitute acts of cruelty within the meaning of subsection 2. In my opinion we are bound to assume that there was evidence before the judge of the Family Court in Ontario which made out a prima facie case of desertion. Otherwise he would not have made the provisional order. It will of course be open to the respondent to contend at the hearing in Manitoba that in fact he has not deserted the appellant.\nGuy J.A. based his judgment to some extent on the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in Smith v. Smith[3], in which it was held that the Court in Manitoba had no jurisdiction to make an order for maintenance against a husband who was both resident and domiciled in British Columbia. With respect, I do not think this case, which dealt with a final order, is of assistance in deciding whether or not the Ontario Court had jurisdiction to make a provisional order.\nSection 17 of the Manitoba Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act directs that the Act shall be so interpreted as to effect its general purpose of making uniform the law of the provinces that enact it and, while there are minor differences in wording, the Ontario Act and the Manitoba Act are substantially the same. The purpose of the Acts appears to be to permit a dependent who is living in one jurisdiction to obtain a provisional order against her husband who is resident in another jurisdiction which is one of the reciprocating states referred to in the Acts. The order so made is expressly stated to be provisional only and the husband is given an opportunity to defend on any ground which would have been open to him in the state making the provisional order. It is clear that it is not in the contemplation of the legislative scheme that the provisional order shall be in any sense final or binding. It is in the nature of an ex parte proceeding to establish a prima facie case.\nIt is interesting to note that s. 6(2) of the Manitoba Act and the corresponding s. 5(2) of the Ontario Act both use the words \u201cat a hearing under this section the person on whom the summons was served may raise any defence that he might have raised in the original proceedings if he had been a party thereto but no other defence\u201d. Here, particularly in the words I have italicized, is clear statutory recognition of the fact that the husband is not a party to the proceedings for the granting of a provisional order; both statutes contemplate that this order may be made without any notice to him.\nThe question for the Manitoba Court under the first ground on which it is stated the husband can defend, is whether under the Ontario statute, the Ontario Court had jurisdiction to make the order which it made. In my view, it had that jurisdiction. It is scarcely necessary to repeat that all grounds of defence on the merits are open to the husband. It is difficult to think of any ground of defence which could be raised in any case which is not comprehended in the eleven grounds set out above and it has been held in Re Wheat, supra, at pp. 725 and 726, and appears from s. 6(2) of the Manitoba Act, that the list so furnished, while conclusive that the grounds specified exist, is not to be taken as excluding other proper grounds.\nI agree with the reasoning and conclusion of Pope D.C.J. in Andrie v. Andrie[4], which is accurately summarized in the headnote as follows:\nThe applicant was married in Saskatchewan and moved subsequently to Alberta where she was deserted by the respondent who then went to live in British Columbia. Applicant returned to live in Saskatchewan where she made the present application for an order under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.S. 1965, ch. 341, and The Maintenance Orders (Facilities for Enforcement) Act, R.S.S. 1965, ch. 93.\nIt was held that the applicant was entitled to an order, provisional and to be of no force or effect until confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction in British Columbia. It was not necessary for the applicant to initiate the proceedings in the state where the desertion took place and the legislation was not to be construed as containing this requirement.\nAt the risk of appearing repetitious I will summarize my views. The primary object of that branch of the legislation providing for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders with which we are concerned is to enable a deserted wife, resident in a state or province the courts of which do not have jurisdiction over the husband who has deserted her and is residing in a reciprocating state, to initiate proceedings in the province where she is and so to avoid the necessity of travelling to the province in which the husband is, a course which would often be a practical impossibility. To hold that a provisional order can be made only by a court which has jurisdiction to make a final and binding order of maintenance against the husband would be to defeat the whole purpose of this part of the legislative scheme.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, declare that the provisional order was made with jurisdiction and direct that the matter be remitted to the Judge of the Winnipeg Juvenile and Family Court to be dealt with on the merits. Pursuant to the terms of the order granting leave to appeal the respondent will recover from the appellant his costs in this Court including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal.\nAppeal allowed; costs to respondent pursuant to terms of order granting leave to appeal.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney-General of Manitoba.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Murray D.

Almost immediately, one of the deer bounded across the road. The defendant reacted by applying the brakes harder and turning slightly to the left. Sensing that the truck was skidding to the right, he attempted to counteract this movement by turning the wheel slightly to the right. The truck continued to skid, spun counterclockwise more than 180 degrees and toppled over on top of a car which was coming from the opposite direction on its own side of the road. The driver of the car was killed and his passenger was injured. The truck, the rear tires of which were substantially worn, was carrying a near maximum load. The collision occurred on a straight stretch of road and the pavement at the time was wet and very slippery.\nThe deceased\u2019s widow brought action against the defendant in her capacity as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate and in her own right. The passenger brought action on his own behalf. These actions were consolidated and tried together. The trial judge, having found the defendant wholly to blame for the accident, gave judgments in favour of the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed these judgments to the Court of Appeal which, by a majority, allowed the appeals. An appeal by the plaintiffs, limited to the question of liability only, was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgments restored.\nThe trial judge rightly decided that the defendant was driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances of this particular case and because of this could not keep control of his vehicle when he found it necessary to slow down.\nGauthier & Co. Ltd. v. The King, [1945)] S.C.R. 143, followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing three judgments of Aikins J. in consolidated actions for damages for negligence. Appeal allowed and trial judgments restored.\nRichard P. Anderson, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nDouglas McK. Brown, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 which reversed (Davey C.J.B.C. dissenting) three judgments given in favour of the appellants by Aikins J. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The litigation arose out of a road accident in which one Clifford Alley Fontaine was killed and a passenger in his automobile, Peter Diaz Curbello, was injured. The appellant Lillian Fontaine brought action against the respondent in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of Clifford Alley Fontaine and in her own right. Curbello brought action on his own behalf. The actions were consolidated for trial by order of Ruttan J. and were tried together by Aikins J., who awarded the appellant Fontaine damages in the sum of $38,287.85 in her personal action and $1,295.60 in her capacity as administratrix and the sum of $19,134.85 to the appellant Curbello. This appeal is limited to the question of liability only. The amount of the damages are not now in issue.\nThe facts are not in dispute and shortly are that at about 1:30 a.m. on September 26, 1961, the deceased Fontaine was driving his 1956 Chevrolet station wagon with the appellant Curbello as a passenger. He was heading south on the Trans-Canada Highway from Yale to Hope en route to Vancouver. He was driving on his own side of the road at a reasonable speed of about 40 miles an hour. No allegation or suggestion of negligence on the part of Fontaine is put forward.\nThe respondent was driving a four-ton G.M.C. truck from Vancouver northwards. The truck was almost loaded to capacity, the total weight of truck and load being 28,000 lbs.\nThe two vehicles met on the highway approximately two miles south of Yale. As they met, the truck toppled over on to the Fontaine vehicle while it was wholly on its own side of the road, crushing it. Fontaine was killed and Curbello injured. The respondent was uninjured. This event occurred on a straight stretch of road some 700 feet in length. At the north end of this straight stretch the road curved to the west and at the south end it curved to the east. The road was level, paved and 23 feet, 6 inches wide with a 10-foot gravel shoulder on each side of the pavement. The posted speed was 60 miles an hour. The vehicles met at a point on the straightaway about 200 feet north of the south curve. It was a cloudy night but visibility was good. Rain had fallen earlier. The road surface was wet and very slippery.\nAs to the accident itself, the learned trial judge said:\nThe two vehicles came to rest in these positions: the station wagon was upright, that is resting on its wheels, and facing south. The GMC truck had toppled over on its right side and the right side of the freight box (that is the enclosed box built on the deck of the truck for carrying freight) was resting on the top of the station wagon. The GMC truck was facing south-east. The truck, if righted from the position in which it lay resting on top of the station wagon, would have been brought upright with its wheels all on the east side of the centre line. The evidence establishes that before and at the time of the collision the GMC truck was sliding and out of the driver\u2019s control and that the truck during the course of sliding turned something better than 180 degrees, so as to wind up at rest facing south-east.\nThese circumstances called for an explanation from the respondent: Gauthier & Co. Ltd. v. The King[2].\nThe explanation given by the respondent was that he was travelling at 48 miles an hour as he entered the straightaway, and seeing a vehicle coming towards him from the north he dimmed his lights. Then he saw some deer on the east shoulder at which moment he applied his brakes moderately. Almost immediately, one of the deer bounded across the road. The respondent reacted by applying the brakes harder and turning slightly to the left. Sensing that the truck was skidding to the right, he attempted to counteract this movement by turning the wheel slightly to the right. The left front corner of the truck struck the deer, propelling it towards the west shoulder. The respondent did not suggest that the impact with the deer had any effect on the movement of the truck. There was little damage, if any, to the left front corner of the truck. The truck continued northward, spinning counterclockwise until it was facing south-east, having spun slightly more than 180 degrees by the time it toppled over on top of the Fontaine vehicle. The respondent admitted that he knew the road was wet and slippery, but said that he was not aware that it was very slippery until after the accident. He testified that the truck was in excellent mechanical condition, including good power brakes. The front tires were relatively new but the tires on the rear dual wheels were about 80 per cent worn with minimal tread left in the centre. The tires were still roadworthy and good for some 8,000 more miles according to the evidence. Respecting these rear tires, the learned trial judge said:\nThe opinions of the witnesses that the rear tires, despite their worn condition, were safe for highway use must be considered as relative. These questions must be considered: At what speed are such tires safe? Under what road conditions are they safe? What weight are such tires capable of carrying with safety? These questions must be considered not just separately but in combination. What may be safe at one speed on a dry road may be unsafe at the same speed on a wet road. What may be a safe speed at one load weight may be unsafe at another load weight. Patently, in my opinion, tires which have practically no tread in the centre are less efficient in stopping a vehicle without producing sliding than tires which have substantial tread on all the tire surface which comes in contact with the road surface. I think it probable, as I shall state later in these reasons, that the worn rear tires on the truck played a part in causing the skid which resulted in the collision with the station wagon.\nThe learned trial judge said that the respondent impressed him as a truthful witness. He found that the respondent was driving at a speed of approximately 50 miles an hour as he approached and rounded the curve immediately south of the straight stretch on which the collision occurred. Dealing with the actual impact, the learned trial judge said:\nThe defendant said that while sliding the truck did not cross over the centre line; that his turning to the right to try to get out of the skid or slide had the effect of keeping the truck on his right hand side of the road. The over-all length of the truck was 24 feet. The wheel base was 11 feet. Theoretically it is no doubt possible that the truck with its wheel base of 11 feet could, as to its wheels, have made better than a 180 degree turn on the road, which was 23 feet 6 inches in width, without the wheels crossing the centre line. There were no marks on the shoulders indicating that the truck had gone on to either shoulder of the road. I think it improbable that no part of the truck crossed the centre line. I think it probable that some part of the truck crossed the centre line and hit the station wagon and the truck then toppled over, coming to rest on top of the station wagon. While it may be theoretically possible that the truck, wholly on its own side of the road, toppled over because it was skidding and fell on the station wagon which was entirely on its own side of the road, I think this unlikely, and that some part of the turning and sliding truck struck the station wagon while the latter was wholly on its proper side of the road, and that the truck then toppled over on top of the station wagon. In any event I do not think it makes any material difference whether the truck hit the station wagon and then fell over, or, if, on the other hand it was wholly on its proper side of the road and because of skidding and turning it upset and fell on the station wagon without colliding with it before it started to topple over.\nHaving considered all the evidence, the learned trial judge concluded:\nSeparate aspects of the defendant\u2019s conduct should not, however, in my opinion, be taken and considered in isolation. All relevant aspects of the defendant\u2019s driving should be considered together and in relation to the existing relevant circumstances. The fact is that on braking the truck\u2019s speed in a quite ordinary way and on making a very slight turn to the left, and on braking again, harder, but still in an ordinary way, the truck went into a skid, and wholly out of control. It seems to me on a consideration of all the evidence that the truck skidding and going out of control in this case was due to a combination of circumstances which I summarize in this way:\n(a) The truck was being driven at a substantial although lawful speed: approximately fifty miles per hour. (b) The truck was carrying a heavy load, and was in fact loaded close to its maximum capacity.\n(c) The highway surface was wet and slippery.\n(d) The rear tires were substantially worn so that there was minimal tread in the centre of the tires. Patently I think such tires to be less efficient than tires with substantial tread over all the tire surface in contact with the road. In my view it is probable that the worn rear tires contributed to the truck skidding.\nThe truck skidded and went out of control on the driver applying the brakes in a quite ordinary way, and on the driver making a slight turn to his left, which involved nothing more than a vehicle moving closer to the centre line, and on a further and harder application of the brakes. I think it apparent that the defendant Thompson was driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances: he was driving at a speed at which he could not keep control of his vehicle when he found it necessary to apply his brakes, turn slightly to his left, and apply his brakes harder to slow down more quickly. The defendant driver must be held to have been negligent. I am satisfied that his negligence was the cause of the collision between the two vehicles.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Davey C.J.B.C. agreed with the learned trial judge, saying:\nHe (the trial judge) found that the truck skidded and went out of control because of the combination of speed, its near maximum load, the slippery surface of the road, and the worn rear tires which had substantially less traction on the road than ones with the whole tread intact; that because of those factors Thompson could not keep control of the truck when he attempted to make an ordinary manoeuvre of a slight turn to the left and a quick reduction in speed. From that the learned trial Judge concluded that Thompson\u2019s speed, although not exceeding the speed limit, was excessive in the circumstances. Those were all circumstances within Thompson\u2019s knowledge. He knew that the road had been seal coated; he knew it was wet; he ought to have known it was slippery, and he knew his rear tires were somewhat worn.\nIt was his duty to drive his vehicle at a speed which would permit him, under those conditions, to keep it under proper control when meeting the ordinary exigencies of highway travel. His speed was too great to allow him to swerve slightly and to slow the truck down quickly without skidding and losing control. In that he was negligent. That is what I understand the learned Judge\u2019s reasoning to be, and on the evidence I am unable to say that he was wrong in drawing that inference.\nLord and Maclean JJ.A. disagreed with Davey C.J.B.C., but it is of great importance to note that both erroneously appear to have accepted the following paragraph in the judgment of Aikins J.:\nAs I understood counsel for the defendant\u2019s argument, he put it that there was no one thing which the defendant driver did nor any one thing which the defendant driver failed to do which could be considered as amounting to negligence. Taking various aspects of the defendant driver\u2019s conduct each in isolation I could not find negligence on the part of the defendant driver. Taken by itself the defendant driver\u2019s speed of approximately fifty miles an hour on a main highway was not excessive. The defendant driver was keeping a reasonably careful lookout. The defendant driver, before the skid, was certainly driving on his proper side of the highway. The GMC truck was properly loaded and was not loaded beyond its proper carrying capacity. The truck was in excellent mechanical condition. The rear tires of the truck were substantially worn so that there was little tread left in the centre of the tires, but the evidence supports the conclusion that they were safe for use, although, as I have said, I think this to be a wholly relative conclusion. The defendant driver\u2019s reaction on seeing the deer, in braking and turning slightly to the left and braking again, does not indicate any lack of reasonable care. Taking all these aspects of the defendant driver\u2019s conduct individually and in isolation one could not say that he was guilty of any negligence.\nas conclusions arrived at by him. The paragraph just quoted is patently a recapitulation of counsel\u2019s argument. The learned trial judge rejected the argument that these several aspects of respondent\u2019s conduct should be considered in isolation because immediately after so summarizing counsel\u2019s argument he said:\nSeparate aspects of the defendant\u2019s conduct should not, however, in my opinion, be taken and considered in isolation.\nIt was also argued on behalf of the respondent that the learned trial judge found liability by the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in his determination of the case. It is clear to me that he did not do so but that he rightly decided the case on the evidence that was before him, concluding that the respondent was driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances of this particular case and because of this could not keep control of his vehicle when he found it necessary to slow down in the circumstances described by the respondent himself.\nThe appeal should, accordingly, be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. The judgments of Aikins J. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia should be restored.\nAppeal allowed and trial judgments restored.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Boughton, Anderson, Dunfee & Mortimer, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Russell and DuMoulin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 321, 64 D.L.R.

Driscoll Limited Respondent.\n1968: February 29; 1968: March 1; 1968: May 13.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nExpropriation\u2014Compensation\u2014Valuation\u2014Actual use not highest and best use of lands in question\u2014Necessary to remove buildings before lands could be utilized for highest and best use\u2014Valuation of buildings not to be added to potential value of lands\u2014Damages allowed for business disturbance but not for special value of lands to owner.\nThe appellant, by registration on April 21, 1966, of a resolution dated March 14, 1966, expropriated certain land owned by the respondent on the west side of the mouth of the Saint John River at Saint John, New Brunswick, near the docks of the National Harbours Board on the west side of Saint John Harbour. The respondent was a firm heretofore supplying dunnage, bracing and other wooden materials to ships taking cargo in the Port of Saint John, particularly during the winter season. It remained in possession of the expropriated property until July 1, 1966.\nBy the provisions of the Land Compensation Board Act, 1964 (N.B.), c. 6, the compensation for such expropriation was to be fixed by the Land Compensation Board and the Chairman of the Board, after a hearing, fixed the compensation to be paid to the respondent by the appellant at $124,500 together with interest at 5 per cent from July 1, 1966. An appeal by the respondent to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick was allowed and that Court by its order increased the compensation to which the respondent was entitled to $197,565. An appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the award amended as follows: for land value $135,565.00; for damages for business disturbance $7,710.69.\nThere was no error in the conclusion of the Appeal Division that the value of the land in question should be fixed at $1 per square foot. That figure represented the opinion of the respondent\u2019s appraiser as to the value of the land when put to its highest and best use, that is, for a large warehousing or manufacturing enterprise and did not represent the value of the land when used by a small business supplying lumber items to ships. Before any purchaser could utilize the land for that highest and best use, the purchaser would have to remove from the site the considerable number of frame buildings which existed at the time of the expropriation and which had been valuable and efficient for the use for which the owner was putting them at the time of expropriation.\nHaving adopted the rate of $1 per square foot as the value of the lands, it was an error in principle to add to that amount any valuation of the buildings. Accordingly, the award of the Appeal Division should be reduced by the sum of $62,000 representing the value of the buildings included in the amount awarded.\nNo amount should be allowed for special use to the owner. The Appeal Division were not fixing the value of the lands upon the use to which they were being put at the time of expropriation but found upon the evidence of the owner\u2019s appraiser the potential value of the land based on a higher and better use and thereby increased the value of the lands from 35\u00a2 per square foot to $1 per square foot. If there were an element added to the latter rate to compensate for the special value to the owner it would be in breach of the well-recognized principle that so far as the damages sustained as a result of expropriation are concerned, the owner is entitled to be fully compensated but not enriched thereby.\nThe respondent, having found it impossible to obtain other suitable premises and having had to wind up its business selling only the inventory and the personal property, which it had to accomplish in a very short time and in a disorderly fashion, was entitled to compensation for business disturbance.\nIrving Oil Co.

Gillis, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick pronounced on July 12, 1967. By that judgment the said Appeal Division had allowed an appeal from the decision of the Land Compensation Board pronounced on September 22, 1966.\nThe respondent company owned a parcel of land in the City of Saint John containing 135,565 square feet. These lands were on the west side of the Saint John River at the point where the river flowed into Saint John Harbour and had frontages on Market Street, King Street and on the river. Near the centre of the river frontage, a parcel 105 feet in width along the river by a depth of 400 feet was owned by Connor Brothers Limited, and the respondent had granted to that company a right-of-way 18 feet in width leading from the easterly end of this parcel of land to King Street, so that the respondent\u2019s lands were divided into two pieces, with, however, complete ease of access from one part to the other across the said right-of-way. The respondent was a firm heretofore supplying dunnage, bracing and other wooden materials to ships taking cargo in the Port of Saint John, particularly during the winter season. Before and after its incorporation, it has always been a business owned by the Driscoll family and operated by it for almost 100 years. Originally situate on the east side of the harbour in Saint John City proper, the business was moved to the west side after the fire of 1877. The property was enlarged by subsequent purchases over the years until about 1957 or 1958 it became possible to locate all its activities and its lumber yards in the one location under review.\nThe appellant, by registration on April 21, 1966, of a resolution dated March 14, 1966, expropriated the property; the respondent remained in possession only until July 1, 1966. By the provisions of the Land Compensation Board Act, 1964 (N.B.), c. 6, the compensation for such expropriation was to be fixed by the Land Compensation Board and Louis A. LeBel, Q.C., Chairman of the Board, after a hearing, fixed the compensation to be paid to the respondent by the appellant at $124,500 together with interest at 5 per cent from July 1, 1966.\nThe respondent appealed to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and that Court by its order aforesaid increased the compensation to which the respondent here was entitled to $197,565. Each of the three honourable members of the Court gave written reasons. Ritchie J.A. would have allowed a compensation of $165,621.50 and also an amount of $62,000 for the value of the buildings which amounted to a total of $227,621.50. West J.A. would have allowed the sum of $197,565 in full compensation, and Limerick J.A. would have allowed only the sum of $135,565, also in full compensation.\nIn its appeal to this Court, the Saint John Harbour Bridge Authority asks that the award of $124,500 made by the Land Compensation Board be restored or, alternatively, that the award should not be increased to any greater amount than $135,565 which Limerick J.A. would have awarded. The respondent J.M. Driscoll Limited asks that the award as made by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick at $197,565 be affirmed and that the respondent should be allowed further damages for business disturbance as found by Ritchie J.A. and for special value of the land to the owner as found by the Chairman of the Land Compensation Board as well as by Ritchie J.A. Of the amount of $227,621.50, Ritchie J.A. would have affirmed the allowance of $15,000 by the Chairman of the Land Compensation Board as being a proper amount to allow to the claimant for the special value to it of the land and he would also have awarded the sum of $15,056.50 as damages for business disturbance resulting from the expropriation.\nIn late years, the business of the respondent company was totally confined to the supplying of lumber and timber required by the cargo carrying vessels which from time to time docked in Saint John Harbour. The respondent\u2019s premises had at the river end several wharves and some years ago lumber was delivered to the respondent\u2019s premises from ships directly over these wharves, but in late years that had not been carried on and it would appear that silt had pretty well filled in the berths adjacent to the wharves. It was, however, quite possible by dredging to have restored deep water docking facilities on the respondent\u2019s river frontage, although the economic practicality of that step was a matter of some debate before the Land Compensation Board.\nThe entrance to the respondent\u2019s premises on King Street was said to be only 200 feet away from the entrance to the National Harbours Board\u2019s very extensive wharves, slips and railroad sidings, and the respondent made most of its sales to ships tied up at those wharves. The respondent carried on the only such business in west Saint John and its premises were excellently suited from the point of view of site and from the point of view of the buildings thereon to carry out the business of the company. The business, however, was not a particularly profitable one, the net profit for the six years preceding the expropriation having averaged only $13,189.\nAlthough the two chief shareholders of the respondent were most anxious to continue in business and preserve the firm for their sons, the respondent, after the expropriation, was not able to find a suitable location at which its business could continue. Therefore, the respondent was forced to sell not the business as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d but only its stock-in-trade and personal property to another company which operated from small nearby premises and delivered the supplies to the ships from its distant lumber yards. As I have pointed out, the respondent went out of possession of its premises on July 1, 1966, less than two and a half months after the registration of the resolution following the expropriation.\nThe task of an appellate court in considering the award made by an arbitrator upon an expropriation has been stated by this Court on frequent occasions and was summarized very shortly in Winnipeg Fuel and Supply Company Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg[1], at p. 338 as follows:\nSufficient to say that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to act when the arbitrator has proceeded on some incorrect principle or has overlooked or misapprehended some material evidence of fact.\nIt is the contention of the appellant in this Court that the arbitrator in fixing the sum of $124,500 as the total compensation payable to the claimant had not proceeded on any incorrect principle and had not overlooked or misapprehended material evidence of fact.\nThe arbitrator heard evidence of several persons upon the question of values. Dr. Peters, the chief shareholder and active managing head of the respondent, gave evidence in reference to its business. A Mr. Nevin Burnham gave evidence of an accounting character in an attempt to establish value for the lands by use of profit figures and other statistics. This evidence was not interpreted by the Chairman as having any probative value, nor did any member of the Appeal Division use it in coming to his conclusion. It was not urged in this Court.\nThe three persons who gave evidence of land values as experts upon the subject were Mr. Ross Corbett and Mr. J. L. Feeney for the respondent, and Mr. Walter Mitham for the appellant. Mr. Feeney attempted to ascertain the value of the lands by calculating the cost of building the lands up to their present contour. Such an approach did not find favour with the Courts below and it also was not urged in this Court. Therefore, this appeal revolves about the evidence given by Mr. Corbett for the respondent and Mr. Mitham for the appellant and the compensation which should be awarded based on a proper consideration of that evidence. As has been often repeated, the standard of valuation of compensation for expropriation of lands has been put concisely by Rand J. in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[2], at p. 715 as follows:\n\u2026the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nIt is to find the amount which should be fixed by that standard that is the task of the arbitrator. The arbitrator, of course, must consider the value of the land for its highest and best use. If that highest and best use is not the use to which the lands were put at the time of the expropriation then the potentiality of such highest and best use in the future gives to the lands their value and the present value of that potentiality must be considered. The highest and best use of the lands in question were given by Mr. Corbett in his report in these words:\nIn my opinion, the present site of the subject property, located so strategically on the corner of King Street and Market Place, with a 384 foot Street frontage on King, plus the frontage on Market Place, plus the Harbour frontage would have its highest and Best Use development as a large warehouse or manufacturing plant, taking advantage of the benefits of this site.\nTo arrive at the land value, several contributing factors must be taken into consideration. Harbour front property privately owned is at a premium in Saint John, at this time. In recent years, it has been generally accepted, that prices ranging from $1.00 to $1.85 per square foot have been paid depending on location, desirability, and consumer demand.\nBoth Mr. Corbett and Mr. Mitham agreed that it was very difficult to find lands comparable to those expropriated on the west side of Saint John Harbour. This situation may be easily explained when one examines the map of the area filed as an exhibit at the hearing and notes that by far the greatest part of the lands having access to the water in the immediate area of West Saint John were owned and occupied by the National Harbours Board. Under these circumstances, Mr. Mitham sought properties in West Saint John which had been the subject of recent sales. His method of obtaining this information was somewhat surprising and disturbed Ritchie J.A., as he seems merely to have discussed the size and sale price of these various properties with some solicitors. However, as Ritchie J.A. pointed out, it was said by this Court in City of Saint John v. Irving Oil Co. Ltd.[3], at p. 592:\nThe nature of the source upon which such an opinion [the opinion of the real estate expert] is based cannot, in my view, have any effect on the admissibility of the opinion itself. Any frailties which may be alleged concerning the information upon which the opinion was founded are in my view only relevant in assessing the weight to be attached to that opinion, and in the present case this was entirely a question for the arbitrators and not one upon which the Appeal Division could properly rest its decision.\nAs I shall point out hereafter in this case, it is not the credibility of the expert\u2019s opinion nor the soundness of the factual base therefor, but rather its applicability to the property expropriated which is the question before this Court.\nMr. Mitham cited five properties particularly, and his evidence thereon was dealt with by Ritchie J.A. in his reasons for judgment. Ritchie J.A. pointed out that four of the five were sales of small residential lots on Winslow and Tower Streets and Riverview Drive, all in west Saint John and some few blocks away from the subject property. The reported sale price of these four lots varied from 11 to 20.7\u00a2 per square foot. None of these lots had any harbour frontage, none were wider than 100 feet and some only 50 feet. They were typical small residential lots and the value could have no relationship to a piece of property over three acres in area bounded by two main streets, and with considerable frontage on the harbour. The fifth property cited by Mr. Mitham was a tract of land on the east side of the harbour having an area of some 186,600 square feet. Very little evidence was given as to this property, except that the appellant\u2019s officers had told Mr. Mitham that the appellant had purchased it at a price of 29\u00a2 per square foot. When Mr. Corbett was cross-examined in reference to this property, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any comparison between that piece of land and the subject property\u201d.\nMr. Corbett having testified, as I have pointed out, that there was no comparable property in west Saint John the sale of which he could examine and testify upon, referred to a series of properties on the east side of Saint John Harbour, and Ritchie J.A. also dealt with those properties in his reasons. One was a property known as the Thorne wharf, consisting of some 71,000 square feet which had been sold for $1.65 per square foot, the second, a parcel of land on Water and Prince William Streets in downtown Saint John which was sold at $4.11 per square foot, and which, of course, was in no way comparable. The third consisted of the various properties sold by the Eastern Coal Company to the National Harbours Board in 1947 at $1.70 per square foot. After a very careful analysis of all of the evidence given by these two experts, the members of the Court of Appeal were unanimous in their opinion that the evidence of Mr. Corbett should be accepted for the reason that he based his opinion on properties which had comparable advantages to that of the respondent\u2019s, while Mr. Mitham had, on the other hand, based his opinion on small residential lots lacking any of the advantages for commercial development possessed by the respondent\u2019s lands. That commercial development would, in the opinion of the appraiser as I have pointed out from his report, be for a large warehouse or manufacturing enterprise. Mr. Corbett had placed a value of $1 per square foot for that use upon the lands, and when such price is considered with the selling price of the various properties which he cited as comparable and which varied from $1.65 up, it will be seen that he appropriately discounted the value to make allowance only for the present potential.\nIt was the submission of counsel for the appellant that where experts\u2019 opinions vary the question of their competence, credibility and the weight to be given to their testimony is a matter to be determined by the tribunal which heard the witnesses and had an opportunity to weigh and compare the value of the various items given. In my opinion, in the present case, the Appeal Division has not trespassed upon that principle, despite some misgivings as to the weight of the evidence given by both experts, the Court of Appeal has considered them as being altogether creditable and as having the facts on which they might base their sometimes rather loosely expressed opinion. The Appeal Division, however, preferred to accept the opinion given by Mr. Corbett over that given by Mr. Mitham on the ground that the comparable properties cited by the latter were, in truth, not comparable properties while those cited by the former, although not exactly comparable, were of considerably greater assistance in finding the value of the type of property which was in question in the expropriation. In doing so, I am of the view that the Appeal Division found that the tribunal of first instance had misapprehended material evidence of fact and therefore had the right and the duty to make other findings.\nTo summarize, the Appeal Division were unanimous in accepting the figure of $1 per square foot as being the proper value to be attached to the respondent\u2019s lands. For the reasons which I have outlined, I am of the opinion that there was no error in that conclusion. To adopt it would result in the value of the lands for the purpose of the award being fixed at $135,565 but the formal order of the Appeal Division fixed the compensation at $197,565. The difference of $62,000 is the amount found by the arbitrators as being the fair value of the buildings upon the lands and which valuation was not contested before the Appeal Division. As I have already pointed out, Limerick J.A. would not have allowed that amount of $62,000 in addition to the sum of $135,565 being of the opinion that the buildings added nothing to the value of the lands for the purpose of fixing the award upon expropriation.\nThe value of the buildings at $62,000 had been part of the award made by the Land Compensation Board but it must be remembered that in that award the value of the land was being assessed at the rate of 35\u00a2 per square foot while as I have said the Appeal Division were unanimously of the opinion that it should be fixed at $1 per square foot. It must also be remembered that this latter figure of $1 per square foot represented the opinion of Mr. Corbett as to the value of the land when put to its highest and best use, that is, for a large warehousing or manufacturing enterprise and did not represent the value of the land when used by a small business supplying lumber items to ships. Before any purchaser could utilize the land for that highest and best use, the purchaser would have to remove from the site the considerable number of frame buildings which existed at the time of the expropriation and which had been valuable and efficient for the use for which the owner was putting them at the time of the expropriation. In these circumstances, I agree with the comment of Limerick J.A. in his reasons for judgment:\nThe test of this method of land valuation would be demonstrated if there were two identical lots side by side, one vacant and one with buildings such as were on the land expropriated; under such circumstances would a buyer wishing to establish a warehouse or manufacturing business pay more for the land with the buildings thereon which he would have to demolish than he would for the vacant land? The answer is obvious. It is possible that the cost of removal of the buildings should be deducted from the vacant land value, but as no evidence of what the cost would be was offered and it is possible that a purchaser might be prepared to absorb such cost, this Court would not be justified, in the circumstances, in making any allowance therefor.\nTherefore, I am of the view that having adopted the rate of $1 per square foot as the value of the lands, it was an error of principle to add to that amount any valuation of the buildings and that the award of the Appeal Division should be reduced by the sum of $62,000 representing the value of the buildings included in the amount awarded.\nRitchie J.A. would have added two further amounts to the award. Firstly, a sum of $15,000 to represent the special value of the lands to the owner, and secondly, a sum of $15,056.50 to represent damages for business disturbance resulting from the expropriation. The propriety of awarding either of these sums must be considered. It is, of course, true that if the lands have a special value to the particular owner who was in possession of them at the time of the expropriation, then there must be an element of the award to reflect such special value: Irving Oil Co. Ltd. v. The King[4], per Hudson J. at p. 558 and cases therein cited.\nIt is also true that the lands in so far as site and equipment were concerned were excellently suited for the use put by the owner and had a special value to him for such purpose. It must, however, be remembered that the Appeal Division are not fixing the value of those lands when used for such purpose but found upon the evidence of Mr. Corbett the potential value of the land based on a higher and better use and thereby increased the value of the lands from 35\u00a2 per square foot to $1 per square foot. I am of the opinion that if there were an element added to that latter rate to compensate for the special value to the owner it would be in breach of the well-recognized principle as stated by Abbott J. in Jutras v. Minister of Highways for Quebec[5], at p. 745:\nSo far as the damages sustained as a result of the expropriation are concerned, the appellant is entitled to be fully compensated but not enriched thereby.\n(The italicizing is my own.) I would, therefore, not allow any amount for special value to the owner.\nThe respondent claimed a 10 per cent addition to the award for forcible taking. Ritchie J.A., citing Drew v. The Queen[6], concluded:\nUntil such time as the Drew judgment is modified or varied, the allowance for compulsory taking is, for all practical purposes, abolished.\nIn so far as that decision ended the automatic addition of a 10 per cent amount to the award which had been arrived at by a careful consideration of the compensation to which the claimant was entitled, I agree with Ritchie J.A.\u2019s comment. However, I am also in agreement with his view that a displaced owner should be left as nearly as possible in the same position financially as he was prior to the taking. In the present case, the respondent having occupied its lands with this particular business then would expect to obtain a valuation of the lands by a sale on the open market at the amount found by the Appeal Division, i.e., $1 per square foot. It would also expect to be able to terminate his use of those lands for the purpose of carrying on the trade which the respondent carried on in an orderly fashion and, in all probability, to move the site of the enterprise elsewhere. In the present case, the respondent found it impossible to obtain other suitable premises and had to wind up its business selling only the inventory and the personal property. This it had to accomplish in a very short time. As I have pointed out, it was less than two and one-half months from the date of the resolution expropriating the lands to the date on which possession was surrendered.\nThe evidence as to the realization of the respondent\u2019s assets was most unsatisfactory. It would appear that a company known as Murray & Gregory Limited made an agreement to purchase the inventory and all the equipment other than the land and the buildings, but the amount to be paid under that agreement was in no way specified and even at the date of the hearing seems to have been fixed as to each individual item at the time it was required by Murray & Gregory Limited. I am of the opinion that this disorderly realization of the respondent\u2019s assets other than land does constitute an element of damage which should be considered under the heading of \u201cbusiness disturbance\u201d. Ritchie J.A., with respect, accurately termed it \u201can amount covering the damage resulting to the company by reason of being forced out of business\u201d. The calculation of that amount may be made with some accuracy from the evidence. As I have pointed out above, the average net profit of the company for the last six years was $13,189. It is reasonable to allow one year for the orderly realization of the assets of the business and therefore to postulate that in the year following April 21, 1966, the date of the registration of the resolution expropriating, the company would have earned $13,189. The company yielded possession on July 1, 1966, and from that date on the award would earn interest at 5 per cent. The appellant, therefore, should be debited with the amount of $13,189 for business disturbance less 5 per cent on $135,565 from July 1, 1966, to the end of the year commencing April 21, 1966, or $5,478.31. The compensation for business disturbance therefore would be $7,710.69.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and amend the award as follows:\nFor land value, 135,565 square feet at $1 per square foot...................\n$135,565.00\nFor damages for business disturbance...................................................\n7,710.69\nTotal...............................................................................................\n$143,275.69\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court but the costs in the Courts below should be disposed of as in the orders made by the Land Compensation Board and the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Drummie & Drummie, Saint John.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gilbert, McGloan & Gillis, Saint John.\n[1] [1966] S.C.R. 336.\n[2] [1949] S.C.R. 712.\n[3] [1966] S.C.R. 581.\n[4] [1946] S.C.R. 551.\n[5] [1966] S.C.R. 732.\n[6] [1961] S.C.R. 614.\n"

Under a written contract the male plaintiff ordered, inter alia, 45 gallons of a liquid fertilizer from the defendant manufacturer. It was provided in the contract that the manufacturer would make arrangements to apply the fertilizer to the plaintiffs\u2019 crop at local rates, and payment for spraying was to be made by the grower direct to the spraying service company. The chemical was to be applied at the rate of 2 gallons per acre.\nThe co-defendant, a custom sprayer, was instructed by a representative of the manufacturer that the crop was ready for spraying and he thereupon sent two of his employees to the plaintiffs\u2019 farm to carry out the operation. Having learned from these employees that, in accordance with their instructions, the chemical was to be applied at the rate of 1\u00bd rather than 2 gallons per acre, the plaintiff determined that with an additional 5 gallons of the product his entire crop could be sprayed instead of only part of it as he had originally intended. He asked the men if they could obtain from their employer additional fertilizer and upon being assured that they could do so asked if they would also spray endrin (a pesticide) at the same time as the fertilizer. One of the men departed for the sprayer\u2019s warehouse and, according to his evidence and that of the sprayer, he there picked up a 5-gallon can of the fertilizer and a 5\u2011gallon can of endrin. On his return the spraying commenced and on the completion thereof the men presented their account to the plaintiff and he paid them.\nA few days later the tobacco plants, following an abnormal increase in their rate of growth, became wilted. The evidence established that the crop was destroyed by a hormone herbicide of the 2-4-D type. At trial, judgment was given against both defendants, and, on appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the defendant manufacturer but dismissed the appeal of the defendant sprayer. Appeals from the judgments of the Court of Appeal were then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nFrom an examination of all the evidence it was concluded that the only possible source of the 2\u20114-D type of chemical which destroyed the plaintiffs\u2019 tobacco crop was the contents of the 5-gallon can which was supposed to have contained endrin. This can always was within the sole control of the sprayer and his employees. Having found, on the balance of probabilities, that the sprayer and his employees had sprayed the crop with such a deleterious substance they were liable in negligence.\nIt was unnecessary to decide the question as to whether or not the sprayer was the agent of the manufacturer for the purpose of applying the fertilizer to the crop. The arrangements made between the male plaintiff and the sprayer\u2019s employees were materially different from those that had been undertaken by the manufacturer, and were such as to absolve the manufacturer from responsibility for what later occurred. It was in the performance of the subsequent contract, to which the manufacturer was not a party, that the sprayer was negligent. That negligence could not be attributable to the manufacturer.\nLandels v. Christie, [1923] S.C.R. 39; British & Beningtons, Ltd. v. North Western Cachar Tea Co., Ltd., [1923] A.C. 48, referred to.\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal by the defendant company and dismissing an appeal by the co-defendant from a judgment of Ferguson J. in favour of the plaintiffs in an action for damages for negligence.

In those judgments, the said Court allowed an appeal by the defendant Na-Churs Plant Food Company (Canada) Ltd. from the judgment of Ferguson J. after trial which said judgment was pronounced on January 29 but dismissed the appeal from the judgment against the co-defendant Samuel Lammens. The plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of the action against the defendant Na\u2011Churs and the defendant Lammens appeals from the confirming of the trial Court judgment against him.\nIt is necessary to state the facts in some detail. The plaintiffs Julius and Audry Majorcsak, husband and wife, are the owners of a tobacco farm in the Township of Middleton and County of Norfolk.\nIn March 1962, two representatives of the defendant Na-Churs Plant Food Company Limited, which will be referred to hereafter as \u201cNa-Churs\u201d, called on Majorcsak and after conferring with them Majorcsak placed an order as follows.

In this action, we are concerned only with the second chemical in the list of three set out on the said order i.e., 45 gals. of 10-20-10. Majorcsak testified that he suggested to Na-Churs\u2019 representative that Mr. Jakobi, whose services had been satisfactory in the year 1961, should again be used to spray the said 10-20-10. On or about April 3, 1962, an employee of Na-Churs delivered to the premises of Majorcsak the three 45-gallon drums of chemicals and one Steve Vonga signed for their receipt. According to Majorcsak\u2019s evidence, those drums were then placed in what he described as his steam room, being one room in the pack barn on the tobacco farm. The building was not locked but, again according to Majorcsak\u2019s evidence, the drums were undisturbed until they were used. The first drum, i.e., that of 5-20-5, was used at the time Majorcsak planted his tobacco crop and we are not further concerned with it. Some time about a week before July 17, 1962, a representative from Na\u2011Churs came onto Majorcsak\u2019s farm and inspected it. He then went to one Samuel Lammens, who is a defendant in the action, and instructed him that Majorcsak\u2019s crop was ready for spraying with the 10\u201120-10. Majorcsak testified that no one told him when that spraying was to take place. On July 17, 1962, at about 5:30 p.m., two men arrived on Majorcsak\u2019s farm towing behind a truck an implement called a \u201chi-boy\u201d. This is a large, three\u2011wheeled piece of equipment the drive being upon the large front wheel with the two wheels one at each, side of the rear. It contains, in addition to the motor which drives the machine, a pump, a large tank said to be of 200 gallon capacity, and three booms each of which held three nozzles. The full width of the vehicle when the booms were opened and the nozzles ready to operate was thirty feet. Majorcsak recognized the purpose for which the equipment was there and asked these men if they came from Jakobi. They replied that they had been sent there by Mr. Lammens and were there for the purpose of spraying the Na-Churs plant fertilizer.\nIn further conversation, Majorcsak ascertained that their instructions were to spray the fertilizer at the rate of only one and a half gallons per acre. An inspection of the order which I have set out above, shows that the chemical was to be spread at the rate of two gallons per acre. Majorcsak realized that at the rate of only one and a half gallons per acre, his 45-gallon drum would not be used up in spraying the 24 acres which he had intended originally to cover and determined that with only five gallons more of 10-20-10 he could spray his whole crop which he believed to be about 33\u00bc acres but which turned out at a later measurement to be very little less than 35 acres. Majorcsak asked these two men who were Fish and Lauwerier if they could obtain from their employer additional 10-20-10 and upon being assured that they could do so asked if they would also spray endrin at the same time as the 10-20-10. The latter chemical is one for the destruction of worms which Majorcsak had noticed appeared in his crop and in the previous year he had Jakobi spray a mixture of 10-20-10 and endrin. Again Fish and Lauwerier agreed that they could spray the two chemicals at the same time and stated that Mr. Lammens had in his warehouse a supply of endrin. Thereupon, Lammens\u2019 employee drove the hi\u2011boy inside the pack barn, the three men rolled out the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 and the employee Lauwerier removed the bung which had sealed that drum. There is direct contradiction in the evidence as to what occurred when this bung was removed. According to Majorcsak, it could only be removed when the Lammens\u2019 employees obtained a larger wrench and when it did come free the movement was accompanied by a gushing or popping sound. On the other hand, according to Lammens\u2019 employees, the bung was so easily removed that Lauwerier who was operating the wrench fell backwards as it turned too freely. For reasons to which I shall refer hereafter, neither the learned judge nor I regard such contradiction as important.\nUpon the bung being removed, Majorcsak left for the fields intending to assist his men in removing the sprinkler heads of an irrigation system which were protruding above ground and which would have been in the way of the hi-boy as it proceeded down the rows of tobacco. Lammens\u2019 employee Lauwerier departed in the pick-up truck for Lammens\u2019 warehouse. According to the evidence given by that employee and by Lammens, he there picked up and put in the truck a five-gallon can of 10-20-10 and a five-gallon can of endrin and again, according to that evidence, both cans were sealed and the seal was removed by Lammens at his own warehouse. These employees of Lammens testified that in accordance with their usual practice, on the first occasion, they put into the tank on the hi-boy enough to do about one-half of the crop. This they did by inserting in the hole in the top of the drum of 10-20-10 a hose which ran from the pump on the hi-boy and then pumping from the drum into the tank in the machine, sufficient of the 10-20-10. They then took the hi-boy alongside the Majorcsak water tank and in the same fashion pumped from there sufficient water to make the mixture with the 10-20-10 the proper one for the purpose.\nLauwerier returned from Lammens\u2019 warehouse with the five-gallon can of endrin and the additional five-gallon can of 10-20-10. Although it is not definitely stated in the evidence, it appears to me a necessary conclusion that no spraying was done until Lauwerier had returned to the Majorcsak farm. Both men testified that they only filled the tank on the hi-boy twice; both testified that the chemical endrin was used in the mixture which covered the whole crop. Fish testified that for the first driving of the machine, he operated it while Lauwerier rode on the machine and watched the booms. Fish testified that they used the spray on the field close to the barn and south and east of it, and described in detail his course of operation up and down the rows of tobacco, including the folding of the three booms to permit the spraying of what he thought were the last two short rows close to the fence.\nThe spraying continued long after dark and was only completed about 1:00 a.m. At that time, the two men pre- sented their account to Majorcsak and he paid them. The receipt for the payment was produced at trial and reads:\nOne five-gallon can 10-20-10. $ 19.75\nSpraying 33 acres at $1.75. 57.75\nEndrin at $2.00. 64.00\nJulius Majorcsak $141.50\nPaid\nLarry and Roger\nDuring the two days which followed, Majorcsak observed what he believed to be a very abnormal increase in the growth of his tobacco plants, with the exception of the two rows close to the fence near the barn. By the 21st, the plants were definitely wilted and he went to Lammens warehouse to confer with Lammens. On the previous Thursday, July 19, in the forenoon, Majorcsak swore he telephoned to one Lelenko and asked Lelenko to get in touch with Mr. Geddes; Mr. Geddes was Na-Churs\u2019 representative who had attended Majorcsak and sold him the 10-20-10 chemical and his name appears on the order as a witness to Majorcsak\u2019s signature. Majorcsak swore that he knew Lelenko was also a representative of Na-Churs. He swore that he did not know Lammens and did not know how to contact the man who had done the spraying. Majorcsak\u2019s ability to read English is very limited.\nOn the 21st, Majorcsak complained to Lammens as to the state of his crop and asked Lammens to come to his farm and inspect it. When Lammens did so, a man named Wig-gars, also an employee of Na\u2011Churs, was present and together they went through the crop inspecting the damage. The condition of the crop is graphically illustrated in a photograph produced at trial as ex. 34 which, however, was not copied into the Appeal Case. The photograph, according to the evidence of the photographer, was taken on July 24 and it shows the two rows of tobacco plants in the foreground as appearing perfectly normal while all those from there to the far side of the field appear to be completely wilted. The damage to the crop need not be described in detail as I shall refer to the scientific evidence as to such damage and the cause thereof hereafter. Lammens\u2019 employees had departed from Majorcsak\u2019s premises in the early morning of July 18. They left the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 which had an unused residue of one gallon or a little more therein. They also left an empty five-gallon can of 10-20-10. They took with them, however, the tin of endrin which had in it some residue of the chemical which it had contained. According to the evidence of Lammens and of his employee Fish, that residue was used in the same hi-boy the very next morning, i.e., the morning of July 18, to spray about eight acres of Lammens\u2019 own crop with the pure endrin, i.e., not mixed with 10-20-10, and Lammens\u2019 crop was utterly unaffected. The learned trial judge made a finding of fact in reference to this evidence to which I shall refer hereafter. It will also be necessary to refer to certain other evidence from time to time but it would be more convenient to do so when considering the actual point as to which such evidence has any relation.\nAt trial, the only scientific evidence was called on behalf of the plaintiff. Professor Clayton M. Switzer, the professor of botany and plant physiology at the Agricultural College, Guelph, Ontario, and the chairman of the Ontario Weed Committee, gave evidence as an expert. The trial judge described him in these words:\nHe is perhaps, if not certainly, the person best qualified in this province to identify 2-4-D damage.\nHis opinion was corroborated by Norman Skeidow, B.Sc, a graduate of Macdonald College, McGill University, and then an employee of the Ontario Department of Agriculture at Delhi. That evidence was that the crop had been killed by a hormone herbicide of the 2-4-D type and that nothing else did so. The experts were in agreement that neither 10-20-10 nor endrin, no matter how inexpertly applied, would cause the type of damage which had occurred in the Majorcsaks\u2019 crop and which they refer to as systemic, i.e., it was through the whole plant as distinguished from any spotting or curling of leaves. Hereafter my reference to 2-4-D should be understood as referring to any hormone herbicide of that general chemical nature.\nAfter the trial, which lasted seven days, Ferguson J., the learned trial judge, reserved judgment, and subsequently, in very carefully detailed reasons, gave judgment against both the defendant Na-Churs and the defendant Lammens, being of the opinion that by the contract which I have quoted above, Na-Ghurs not only agreed to sell and deliver the chemical 10-20-10 to Majorcsak but to spray it on the crop and that there was an implied term of the agreement that it should be done without negligence. He found that, as agent of Na\u2011Churs, Lammens did spray the crop and due to negligence, either in his spraying or in the supplying of the chemical in the first place, the crop was ruined.\nMcGillivray J.A., giving reasons for the Court of Appeal, was of the opinion that Na-Churs\u2019 contract with Majorcsak was to supply him with chemical and to arrange that the fertilizer 10\u201120-10 be sprayed by some person who was chosen by them but who would be solely the agent of Majorcsak in carrying out his task. McGillivray J.A. therefore concluded:\nUpon these facts, with all deference to the learned trial judge who reached a contrary result, I must conclude that Na-Churs in its contract, did no more than agree to find for the plaintiff a custom sprayer to do the work and that neither in contract nor in tort had it any vicarious responsibility for the tortious act of Lammens.\nMcGillivray J.A. continued in his reasons to examine the case against the defendant Lammens and concluded that Lammens\u2019 liability in tort had been established and confirmed the judgment against this defendant.\nI think we may well start with the proposition that from wherever it came, the chemical which ruined the plaintiffs\u2019 tobacco crop was a hormone herbicide such as 2-4-D. That is the uncontradicted evidence of the experts and all of the other evidence confirms their opinion. It, therefore, becomes necessary to determine what was the source of that 2-4-D type of chemical and whether its application to the plaintiffs\u2019 crop of tobacco results in any liability on either one of the defendants. Seven different possible sources of the hormone chemical have been suggested, as follows:\n1. The creek from which the irrigation water was taken for Majorcsak\u2019s farm might have been contaminated with 2-4-D.\n2. The water in Majorcsak\u2019s water tank standing in their barnyard might have been contaminated with 2-4-D.\n3. There might have been minerals in the soil containing 2-4-D. 4. The tank on Lammens\u2019 hi-boy might have been contaminated through its previous use in application of 2-4-D to other crops.\n5. The 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 might have been so contaminated.\n6. The five-gallon can of 10-20-10 which came from Lammens might have been so contaminated.\n7. The five-gallon can of what was said to be endrin obtained from Lammens might have been contaminated, or it might have been a five-gallon can of 2-4-D.\nThe first three of these possibilities need only be mentioned. The complete answer to the possibility that the creek had been contaminated and that, therefore, the irrigation which had been done some three or four days before the plants were sprayed might have resulted in the destruction is the evidence that the whole crop was damaged well-nigh evenly while on Majorcsak\u2019s evidence his irrigation equipment only covered six of the roughly 34 to 35 acres of planting. As to the second possible source, the water used to mix with the chemical in the tank in the hi-boy came from Majorcsak\u2019s water storage tank standing in his barnyard. That water had been pumped there from a well in Majorcsak\u2019s cellar. The family all drank water from that well and the stock was watered from that tank. Moreover, the tank stood high\u2014one witness, I think, said twenty feet above the ground, and it would simply be fantastic to consider that anyone had climbed to that height in order to contaminate the water tank with what would have been a very considerable dose of a noxious chemical such as 2-4-D. I might add here that there was not the slightest evidence throughout the trial of any person having enmity for Majorcsak. As to the third possible source, there was no evidence whatsoever that there was any mineralization of the soil such as could possibly cause the damage which occurred to Majorcsak\u2019s crop. As to the fourth possible source of 2-4-D, i.e., the tank on the hi-boy being contaminated, a great deal of evidence was adduced in reference to this possibility. Lammens had owned and operated two different hi-boys\u2014one, an older smaller model, and a second, what he called the big hi-boy, which was a larger model with a 4\u2011cylinder motor and with a 200-gallon tank. He swore, and so did his employees that he had not used the larger hi-boy in the whole of that season for the spraying of 2-4-D although he had used the smaller hi-boy for such purpose as late as July 12.\nOf course, Majorcsak did not know whether the outfit which was used to spray his crop was the large hi-boy or the small, older piece of equipment. Although the evidence relied upon by Lammens to prove that the larger equipment alone has been used on Majorcsak\u2019s farm was somewhat confused and unconvincing, and although the fact that Lammens did not spray at all after the completion of the Majorcsak job at about 1:00 a.m. on the 18th until the 24th, while he had been busy using the same large hi-boy in spraying on the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th, would seem to be rather suspicious, I am unable to come to the conclusion that there is any convincing evidence that the tank on the outfit used by Lammens\u2019 men when they arrived at Majorcsak\u2019s farm was contaminated with a 2-4-D like chemical before it arrived upon the premises. It is true that Mr. Shedow, upon being asked what was the power of 2-4-D as a herbicide, replied that it takes very minute quantities to cause injury, adding \u201cI can\u2019t say in parts per million but it is very light\u201d. Dr. Switzer, on cross-examination, however, agreed that the particular damage to Majorcsak\u2019s crop as illustrated in the photographs would require 2-4-D in the proportions of a herbicidal weed spray and that it probably did represent about one pint per acre use.\nMuch more difficult is the consideration of the 5th, 6th and 7th possible sources of the 2-4-D contamination. The fifth dealt with a possibility that the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 purchased from the defendant Na-Churs was contaminated when it arrived at the farm of Majorcsaks or that it was contaminated by 2-4-D thereafter and prior to it being pumped into the tank of the hi-boy. It is significant that the defendant Na-Churs did not manufacture 2-4-D and had no 2\u20114-D around its plant. There seems not the slightest ground to even suspect that when the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 was delivered to Majorcsak it was anything but that same chemical and nothing else. As I have said, when the spraying work had been completed, there was still a small amount of chemical in that drum. A sample was taken from that residue by Klaus Mueller, an employee of S.R. Bennett Limited, chemical analysts, with Majorcsak assisting him. At the time the sample was removed the drum smelled very strongly of ammonia which is the typical smell of the chemical 10\u201120\u201110 and not of the chemical 2-4-D. Mueller took that sample to his laboratory and analyzed it. He testified that it contained 10.17 per cent of nitrogen, no nitrate nitrogen, 19.15 per cent of phosphoric acid, and 9.92 per cent of water soluble potash, in other words, it was 10-20-10 for commercial purposes. There was on the label of the drum a statement that there were traces of certain other chemicals. Mueller did not attempt to separate out in his analysis these traces, nor did he test the sample for 2-4-D\nI agree with McGillivray J.A. when he said:\nIt is difficult to believe that an analyst close to it as he would be failed to recognize the presence of 2-4-D.\nOf course, this evidence of analysis would rule out the presence of that 2-4-D contamination not only when the drum left Na-Churs plant but up to the time when the contents thereof had been used to fill the tank on the hi-boy. If the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 had been contaminated by a 2-4-D type of chemical after it left Na-Churs plant and before the contents were used to fill the tank on the hi-boy it would have had to have been done by either the plaintiff Majorcsak himself, by some of his hired men or by some stranger who had nefariously entered the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, probably by night, in order to contaminate the can. With deference, I agree with the learned trial judge when he said:\nNo one suggested or said that any 2-4-D was found in it. It is incredible that the plaintiff would deliberately contaminate the barrel. It is improbable that his hired men did so, as there was no suggestion that there was any 2-4-D on the premises or that any had been used by the plaintiff, or if there were any why they would dispose of it by pouring it into a full drum of 10-20-10.\nI add that it is equally incredible to picture some stranger with enmity toward the plaintiffs, and none was suggested, coming probably by night upon the plaintiffs\u2019 premises to put into a full barrel of 10-20-10 enough 2-4-D to cause the damage which was exhibited by the plaintiffs\u2019 crop. Therefore, in my view, whether the bung was removed on the 45-gallon drum with a pop or easily there is no evidence whatever to suggest that the contents of that drum contained anything except the 10-20-10 which it was supposed to contain.\nThe remaining two possible sources of contamination were the two five-gallon cans which were brought upon the plaintiffs\u2019 premises from Lammens\u2019 warehouse by Lauwerier on the evening of July 17. One of those cans it was said contained 10-20-10 and the other it was said was a can of endrin. Lammens testified that he took both of these cans from his warehouse to give them to his employee Lauwerier and that before Lauwerier left the warehouse he, Lammens, broke the seal on the can which was said to contain endrin. There was no evidence as to when the seal on the can which was said to contain 10-20-10 was broken. The reasons given by Lauwerier for the breaking of the seal on the can of endrin at Lammens\u2019 warehouse were that it was realized that the whole of the can would not be used and therefore the balance would have to be returned and it was necessary to take care in breaking the seal so as not to damage the spout which was inside the seal, and that Lammens had a knife handy. It is rather unusual that a five-gallon can of a rather valuable liquid should be opened at Lammens\u2019 warehouse and then carried by truck in that condition six miles to the plaintiffs\u2019 farm. The evidence as to the use of the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10, the five-gallon can of 10-20-10, and the five-gallon can which was said to contain endrin was given by the defendant Lammens\u2019 witnesses only as the plaintiff was not present when the contents of those cans were pumped or poured into the tank on the hi-boy. It was the evidence of these witnesses that the five-gallon can of 10-20-10 was used only for the second filling of that tank on the hi-boy. When the employees left the plaintiffs\u2019 premises that night, they left on the premises the 45-gallon drum and the five-gallon can of 10-20-10. As I have said, there was a residue in the 45-gallon drum but the five-gallon can was, on their evidence and on the evidence of both the plaintiff and the chemist Mueller, quite empty. On the other hand, the endrin had not been used up since it required only one pint per acre and since there were, at the most, nearly thirty-five acres to be sprayed, there would be not less than five pints of the chemical left in the five-gallon can. Therefore, the five-gallon can labelled \u201cendrin\u201d with its small residue of contents was returned by Lammens employees to his warehouse. Lammens and his employee Fish swore that it was used on the very next morning to spray eight acres of tobacco on Lammens\u2019 own farm and that the tobacco suffered no ill effects whatsoever from the spraying.\nAs McGillivray J.A. pointed out in his reasons for judgment, the learned trial judge misunderstood the evidence which I have restated above, as he said:\nThe empty can of 10-20-10 brought to the plaintiffs\u2019 farm by Lauwerier on his return trip from Lammens, warehouse, was taken back to Lammens. Why the empty 10-20-10 was not left on the plaintiffs\u2019 farm, if all of its contents had been used, was not explained. It is, of course, possible that the supposed five gallons of 10-20-10 was in fact 2-4-D and indeed this would seem to me to be the only reasonable explanation of the damage. The circumstances are such that they are, in my view, consistent only with that conclusion.\nAfter referring to other evidence, the learned trial judge continued:\nThere is some element of speculation in this, but it seems to me to be the only possible explanation of the two healthy rows and such a theory is consistent with the fresh can of supposed 10-20-10 being used after Lauwerier\u2019s return, and that it was not 10-20-10 but 2-4-D. It is also consistent with the fact that some 10-20-10 remained in the 45 gallon drum and, it is consistent with the two healthy rows being left unsprayed at one side of the field.\nThe learned trial judge then made this specific finding of fact based on credibility:\nBy all the standards of tests for credibility I reject the evidence of Lammens and his witness (I observed them carefully) that they did not spray 2-4-D on the plaintiffs\u2019 crop. I also reject their evidence that they sprayed Lammens\u2019 own crop without damage. If they did so, it must have been after the Hi-Boy was decontaminated.\nIt is evident that the learned trial judge made this finding of fact believing that the can which was purported to contain 10-20-10 had been returned by Lammens\u2019 employees to the Lammens\u2019 warehouse and believing that it was the evidence of Lammens and his employee that the balance of the contents of that can had been used to spray Lammens\u2019 own field the next day. Such belief was, of course, in error. It was the five-gallon can which was said to have contained endrin which was returned partly used to Lammens\u2019 warehouse, while the five-gallon can which was said to contain 10-20-10 had been completely used and the empty can had been left on the plaintiffs\u2019 farm. In my view, the error does not destroy or render of any less importance the direct finding of fact by the learned trial judge based on his assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. He was of the opinion that it was the partly-used five-gallon can which had been returned by Lammens\u2019 employees to Lammens\u2019 warehouse, and which they said they had used on Lammens\u2019 own field the next morning, which had contained the deleterious substance, and on their evidence he was ready to reject their claim that they did not spray 2-4-D on the plaintiffs\u2019 crop and that they sprayed Lammens\u2019 own crop without damage. It is realized that to find that that five-gallon can contained not endrin, as it was supposed to contain, and as Lammens and his witness first swore that it did contain, but rather a 2-4-D type of chemical is to reject the evidence of Lammens and his witness Fish but, in my view, the trial judge has made an unassailable finding of fact based upon credibility on that topic.\nThere are, moreover, several most important factors tending to corroborate that view. The plaintiff had full title to both the 45-gallon drum of 10-20-10 which he had purchased from Na\u2011Churs, and the five\u2011gallon can of 10-20-10 which he had purchased from Lammens. It was, therefore, perfectly proper that both of those containers with any contents remaining in them should be left with the plaintiff on the plaintiffs\u2019 property. On the other hand, the plaintiff had no title to any endrin. According to the contract made between the plaintiff and Lammens\u2019 employees on the evening of July 17, these employees were to spray endrin on the plaintiffs\u2019 crop at the rate of one pint per acre and were to charge by the acre. The account rendered and paid so demonstrates. Lammens would, therefore, be entitled to have taken back to his own warehouse any unused part of the five-gallon can said to have been endrin. It is significant that Lammens ordinarily sprayed 2-4-D under exactly the same arrangement. Page 21 of ex. 53 is a book of Lammens\u2019 invoices which Lammens produced and to which he referred in his testimony. It is a copy of an invoice to a farmer August Verhegghe dated July 12, 1962, just five days before the plaintiffs\u2019 crop was sprayed and it reads: \u201c19\u00bd acres 2-4-D sprayed at $2.25\u2014$43.87\u201d. It would be inevitable that with spraying sometimes endrin and sometimes 2-4-D in this fashion on fields of varying sizes there would be some small amounts left in the containers, and it matters not whether Lammens only received 2-4-D in the original containers of one-gallon size. The remains of both chemicals might well have been stored in odd empty five-gallon cans. In fact, the plaintiff testified that some two weeks after his crop was sprayed, he went to Lammens\u2019 warehouse and asked Lammens for a small quantity of endrin. Lammens took an empty five-gallon can and poured endrin from another open five-gallon can, which he had taken from amongst five in the back of his truck, in order to give to the plaintiff the small quantity of endrin required.\nAs I have said, the damage occurred over the whole crop with the exception of the two short rows in one corner where it would be most difficult to spray with such a large piece of equipment as the hi-boy. The five-gallon can of 10-20-10 was used only in the second spraying, and therefore if it had contained the deleterious substance it would not have covered the whole field. The so-called endrin, on the other hand, was used to spray the whole crop. Therefore, I have concluded from all of the evidence that the only possible source of the 2-4-D type of chemical which destroyed the plaintiffs\u2019 tobacco crop was the contents of the five-gallon can which was supposed to have contained endrin. This five-gallon can always was within the sole control of Lammens and his employees. The plaintiff never had possession of it or any property in it. One need not have recourse to the rule of evidence known as res ipsa loquitur to find that if Lammens and his employees sprayed the plaintiffs\u2019 crop with such a deleterious substance they are liable in negligence. That is a finding of fact based on the balance of probabilities. The balance of probabilities is the only standard which need be applied. To use the words of Duff J., as he then was, in Landels v. Christie[3], at p. 41:\nOther explanations were suggested but there was nothing in the facts pointing to any of them as an agency actually or probably operative and my conclusion is that there is sufficient preponderance of probability in the circumstances proved in favour of the trial judge\u2019s conclusion to cast the burden of explanation upon the appellants\u2014a burden of which the trial judge held they have not acquitted themselves.\nI would, therefore, dismiss Lammens\u2019 appeal with costs.\nI turn next to consider Majorcsaks\u2019 appeal from the dismissal of the action as against the defendant Na\u2011Churs.\nThe learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment found that Na-Churs were liable for the damages on the ground that Lammens was an agent of Na-Churs for the purpose of applying the 10-20-10 contained in the 45-gallon drum which had been purchased directly from Na\u2011Churs and delivered by that defendant directly to the plaintiffs. In his reasons, the learned trial judge said:\nIt is my view that the words of this contract amounted to an agreement by Na-Churs to do the spraying. The defendant company undertook to provide the spraying services, including the equipment and must accept whatever liability such an arrangement entails. I do not agree with counsel for the defendant company that their obligation ended with their nomination of Lammens as the person to do the spraying. The relationship turns on the proper interpretation to be given to the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant company. The defendant company agreed to supply the spraying service.\nMcGillivray J.A., giving judgment for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, said:\nThe key words in this contract are \u201cCompany will make arrangements to apply \u2018Na\u2011Churs\u2019 Liquid Fertilizer to the crop at local rates\u201d. An initial observation is that, if the agreement is, as submitted, one whereby the company undertakes to apply the fertilizer, the words \u201cmake arrangements for\u201d are redundant.\nMcGillivray J.A. also said:\n\u2026I must conclude that Na-Churs in its contract, did no more than agree to find for the plaintiff a custom sprayer to do the work and that neither in contract nor in tort had it any vicarious responsibility for the tortious act of Lammens.\nIn this Court, counsel for both Majorcsaks and Na-Churs presented detailed and able argument on this question of the status of Lammens as an agent of Na-Churs. In my opinion, the appellants Majorcsaks\u2019 appeal may be disposed of without deciding that question. Although I am far from convinced that Lammens could be held to be, when his men arrived on Majorcsaks\u2019 farm on. July 17, the agent not of Na-Churs with whom alone he had dealt but rather of Majorcsak who had never heard of him and who had not arranged when or how his crop was to be sprayed. I find myself in agreement with McGillivray J.A. when he concluded his reasons by saying:\nEven had I reached a contrary conclusion to the above, I am of the opinion that the subsequent arrangements made between the male plaintiff and Lammens\u2019 employees on July 17th, were materially different from those found by the trial judge to have been undertaken by Na-Churs in its contract, and were such as to absolve Na-Churs from responsibility for what later occurred.\nWhatever obligation arose under the contract of March 13th, it was effectively terminated on July 17th when the male plaintiff authorized what was, in effect, another contract, namely, to spray a different acreage at a different rate per acre and with some additional different materials. Na\u2011Churs can well assert that, had the original contract terms been observed, the contents of the 45-gallon drum having been declared free of contamination, no damage would have resulted to the crop.\nFor the reasons which I have already outlined, there seems to be no other possible conclusion than that the 2-4-D like chemical which caused the damage came from the five\u2011gallon can which was labelled \u201cendrin\u201d. This can was the property of the defendant Lammens and it was used by Lammens to spray the plaintiffs\u2019 crop of tobacco. It was no part of the contract between the plaintiffs and Na-Churs that endrin should be supplied. Endrin was not a product produced by the Na-Churs company. The chemical endrin is a product produced by the Chipman company. There is no way of determining whether if the Na-Churs representatives had had an opportunity they would have even agreed to the mixture of the chemical 10-20-10, which they supplied, with the chemical endrin. It is true that minor variations of a contract when made by an authorized agent, if Lammens might be considered an authorized agent, will result in a variation and not a rescission of the original contract: British & Beningtons, Ltd. v. North Western Cachar Tea Co., Ltd.[4], and many other cases may be cited in support of the same principle. In so far as the variation of the rate of application of the 10-20-10 from two gallons per acre, as set out in the original contract, to one and a half gallons per acre, such authority would apply to prevent the rescission of the contract. If Lammens were Na-Churs\u2019 agent, that variation was made by its agent on its instructions. The other variation, however, was not of any such inconsequential nature but was, in fact, a complete change in the contract and in the parties thereto. The original contract had been to spray the chemical sold by the Na-Churs company on, according to the contract, thirty acres of the plaintiffs\u2019 crop at the rate of two gallons per acre. It is difficult to understand how, under such circumstances, only 45 gallons of 10\u201120-10 were purchased, as that would permit spraying at the rate of only one and a half gallons per acre, the rate finally used. The contract as made between Lammens\u2019 agents and Majorcsak was for the spraying of about 35 acres of tobacco crop with a mixture of the 10-20-10, sold by the Na-Churs company, and endrin, which Lammens supplied and which had come from a different source. It was in the performance of the latter contract, to which Na-Churs was not a party, that Lammens was negligent. I cannot understand how that negligence can be attributable to the defendant Na-Churs. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the dismissal of the action against the latter defendant.\nIn the result, I would dismiss both appeals. The respondent Na-Churs is entitled to its costs against the appellants Majorcsaks, and the respondents Majorcsaks are entitled to costs as against the appellant Lammens.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Julius and Audry Majorcsak: Arnold Taylor, Delhi.\nSolicitors for Na-Churs Plant Food Co.

Bell and David Grey Bell and Marjorie Bell, Infants Under the Age of Twenty-one years, by Their Next Friend, Kenneth Bell, and the Said Kenneth Bell and The Ontario Hospital Services Commission (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nWilliam Samuel Smith and John William Charles Smith (Defendants) Respondents.\n1968: March 21; 1968: May 22.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nEvidence\u2014Evidence given by plaintiffs\u2019 former solicitor on behalf of defendants\u2014Duty of solicitor to refrain from disclosing confidential information unless client waives privilege\u2014Impropriety of putting to solicitor questions involving disclosure of confidential information without evidence of proper waiver\u2014Evidence in violation of privilege should not be received.\nTrial\u2014Plaintiffs interviewed by judge in chambers without counsel being present and without reporter\u2014Interference with clients\u2019 rights to benefit of advice of counsel\u2014Departure from rule of judicial conduct.\nThe defendants brought an application for judgment in accordance with an alleged settlement with the plaintiffs for claims made in an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The motion came on for hearing on February 10, 1966, and the proceedings continued throughout that day and again on May 27, 1966. Judgment for the adult plaintiffs was granted on May 27 in terms of the settlement alleged and judgment for an infant plaintiff was reserved. On appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and an appeal was then brought to this Court.\nAt the hearing on February 10, 1966, the solicitor who had acted for the plaintiffs until February 8, 1966, appeared under subpoena and gave evidence on behalf of the defendants. Conflicting sworn statements as to whether the then counsel for the plaintiffs objected to the giving of evidence by the former counsel were subsequently made.\nOn May 27, 1966, after the plaintiffs had given evidence, the judge requested that he interview the plaintiffs in his chambers, and he asked counsel to consent that this be done without the presence of counsel. Such consent was given, and the interview was held but without a court reporter being present.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed; new trial ordered.\nIt was improper for a client\u2019s former solicitor not to claim the privilege of refusing to disclose confidential information without showing that it had been properly waived. Also, doubt was expressed about the propriety of putting to a solicitor questions that involve the disclo- sure of confidential information without first bringing in evidence of a proper waiver. In any case, because the client\u2019s privilege is a duty owed to the Court, no objection ought to be necessary and the evidence in violation of the privilege should not be received.\nAs to the plaintiffs having been interviewed by the judge of first instance in his chambers without counsel being present and without a reporter, this was a serious interference with the clients\u2019 rights to the benefit of advice of counsel and was also a departure from the rule of judicial conduct that a judge ought never to put himself in a situation where one of the parties is apt to be induced to look upon him as an adviser rather than an impartial arbitrator.\nAn acceptable record as to what happened in the judge\u2019s chambers was lacking, and in view of the state of confusion as to whether there had been consent on which to base the judgment of the first instance, this Court was of the opinion that the plaintiffs should have a right to have their action tried in open court.\nBeer v. Ward (1821), Jacob 77, applied; Majcenic v. Natale [1968] 1 O.R. 189, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Richardson J. Appeal allowed.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJohn J. Fitzpatrick, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on June 6, 1967. By that judgment, the Court dismissed an appeal from Richardson J. who had given judgment on May 27, 1966. The appeal was carried in the aforesaid style of cause but it appears that Marjorie Bell, one of the plaintiffs, attained the age of 21 years during the course of the litigation. It also appears that the proper name of the infant plaintiff is David Guy Bell. These changes should be reflected in the style of cause and the formal order of this Court should be issued showing the plaintiffs as HELEN BELL, JAMES E. BELL, MARJORIE BELL and DAVID GUY BELL, infant under the age of twenty\u2011one years, by his next friend Kenneth Bell and the said KENNETH BELL and THE ONTARIO HOSPITAL SERVICES COMMISSION.\nThe circumstances involved are rather intricate and of the most unusual nature and it is, therefore, necessary to relate them in some detail. On August 27, 1962, the plain- tiff James Bell, was operating a motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff Kenneth Bell, his father, and with passengers. the plaintiffs Helen Bell, his mother, and David Grey Bell (properly called David Guy Bell) and Marjorie Bell. The vehicle came into contact with one owned by the defendant John William Charles Smith due, to what was alleged by the plaintiffs, to be the negligence of the said defendant Smith. One Commiski, an employee of the Pilot Insurance Company, recommended that the plaintiffs consult either Mr. Henry Schreiber, Q.C., or Mr. John Agro, Q.C., to act on their behalf. The plaintiffs chose to consult Mr. Henry Schreiber. Due, it was said, to the continued serious physical conditions of the various plaintiffs, a statement of claim was not issued until November 12, 1965. A statement of defence was issued on December 21, 1965, and issue was joined on December 22, 1965.\nOn January 6, 1966, the various plaintiffs were examined for discovery, and on January 11, 1966, the solicitors for the defendants gave notice of motion of an application for leave to make a payment into court in full satisfaction of the claims of the plaintiffs. These examinations for discovery and this notice of application for leave to pay into court seem to have very much increased the tempo of the discussions for settlement of the action between the solicitors for the plaintiffs and for the defendants. The solicitor for the plaintiffs conferred with his client Mrs. Helen Bell by telephone almost immediately after the examinations for discovery and then the various plaintiffs attended his office on January 10 and on January 12. During these latter occasions there were telephone conversations between the solicitors for the plaintiffs and for the defendants, and the amounts of the settlements were discussed in great detail. The record contains many long memoranda setting out how various amounts were arrived at.\nThe plaintiff Helen Bell has testified that, after a very long conference on January 12, 1966, she and her co-plaintiffs agreed to the settlement which was proposed and which her then solicitor, Mr. Schreiber, said was the utmost he could obtain from the solicitor for the defendants. Mr. Schreiber seems to have been greatly concerned at the possible penalty in costs which the plaintiffs would have incurred had the application for leave to pay into court been granted and then the payment made thereunder have exceeded what the plaintiffs would have recovered at trial.\nSo soon as the plaintiffs had, with great reluctance, expressed their agreement to settle in the amounts outlined by Mr. Schreiber in this conference, he telephoned at once to Mr. Agro, the solicitor for the defendants, to inform him of such agreement, and on the same day wrote a letter in which he set out the matter in these terms:\nThis will confirm the settlement in the above action on the following terms:\nMARJORIE BELL\n\u2014inclusive of special and general\u2014\n$15,550.00\nHELEN BELL\n\u2014inclusive of special and general\u2014\n10,700.00\nGUY BELL\n\u2014inclusive of special and general\u2014\n6,900.00\nJAMES BELL\n\u2014inclusive of special and general\u2014\n4,250.00\nCOSTS\n\u2014\n3,740.00\n$41,140.00\nIt will be noted that the figure of $3,740 for costs is 10 per cent of the total amount which was payable to the four different plaintiffs. That amount of $3,740 was to be paid by the defendants to Mr. Schreiber. It is the evidence of Mrs. Helen Bell, one of the plaintiffs, that having agreed to this settlement then for the first time Mr. Schreiber informed the plaintiffs that in addition to that amount of $3,740 which Mr. Schreiber was to receive from the defendants the plaintiffs would have to pay another 10 per cent to him on account of solicitor\u2011and-client costs and further that since the court would not approve of the deduction of any amount from that which was to go to the infant Guy Bell the other plaintiffs would have to divide the 10 per cent deduction on his account from their shares. This evidence Mr. Schreiber denies, although he does admit that it was his ordinary practice to charge a solicitor-and-client bill if he had to prepare for trial and in this case he certainly would have had to prepare for trial very shortly as the conversation took place on January 12 and the trial was to take place within a couple of weeks thereafter. It was further the evidence of Mrs. Helen Bell, and this was also corroborated by the other plaintiffs, that the whole basis of the settlement was that it should be accepted and approved in complete form and in fact that one of them could not settle without the others settling. This was not denied by Mr. Schreiber and it becomes important when one considers the judgment of the learned judge of first instance. The plaintiff Helen Bell testified that having attempted on that very day, January 12, 1966, to telephone to Mr. Schreiber to say that the plaintiffs had recanted from their agreement to settle on the basis outlined, she succeeded, on January 13, 1966, in giving that message to Mr. Schreiber\u2019s secretary who undertook to pass it on to her employer. She continued that then they were telephoned by the said secretary on January 14 and asked to come down to Mr. Schreiber\u2019s office immediately. Helen Bell continued in her testimony to outline a conference in Mr. Schreiber\u2019s office on January 20 and her letter later of the same date to Mr. Schreiber in which she demanded an increase in her claim in the amount of $75,000 and then her reattendance on Mr. Schreiber on January 21. At that time, Mr. Schreiber asked her to sign and have her co-plaintiffs sign a document which I quote hereunder in full:\nTO: HENRY L. SCHREIBER, Q.C.\n288 OTTAWA STREET NORTH\nHAMILTON, ONTARIO\nRE: BELL vs SMITH S.C.O. ACTION #653\/63\nAfter having all matters of the settlement fully explained to us and we understanding the same; and after having all matters fully explained to us with reference to the matter of \u201cPayment into Court\u201d by the Defendants of the said sums herein, and also with reference to all matters pertaining to our non-acceptance of the same and we fully understand the same.\nWe now hereby authorize and instruct you to rescind our original instructions of acceptance of the offers of settlement in this action hereinbefore given to you and upon which you acted pursuant to our instructions.\nWe hereby authorize and instruct you not to accept the offers of settlement in this action which offers were as follows, namely\nHELEN BELL\nKENNETH BELL\ninclusive of general and special damages and including O.H.S.C. expenditure......................................\n$10,700.00\nMARJORIE BELL\ninclusive of general and special damages and including O.H.S.C. expenditure......................................\n15,550.00\nJAMES E.

Agro Esq. Q.C, solicitor for the defendants of the aforementioned. We further authorize and instruct you that it the solicitor for the defendants shall pay the said sums of money hereinbefore set forth into Court in payment of the above claims, you are not to accept the same in settlement of this action and file the necessary documents to so indicate.\nWe further authorize and instruct you to proceed to trial with this action and this shall be your authority for carding out the above-mentioned instructions.\nDated at Hamilton this 21st day of January, 1956.\nWitness:\nKenneth Bell\nHelen Bell\nMarjorie Bell\nJames E. Bell\nMrs. Bell testified that she did not understand that document and that she refused to sign it. It was never signed by any plaintiff.\nOn February 4, 1966, Mr. Schreiber wrote to the plaintiff Mrs. Helen Bell in the following words:\nPlease be advised\u201d that your case is No. 10 on the peremptory list of the Supreme Court.\nI have told you on numerous occasions the position you now find yourself in and have asked you on numerous occasions to sign the document of instruction which I have prepared and which you have had in your possession for the past two weeks. I must insist you give me your instructions not later than Monday afternoon, February 7th, 1966, at 4:00 p.m.\nOn February 7, 1966, a notice of motion was served on the various plaintiffs. This was for an application to be presented on February 10, 1966, at 10:00 a.m. for judgment in accordance with the settlement purported to have been made on January 12, 1966. So soon as the plaintiff Helen Bell received service of notice of that application, she wrote to Mr. Schreiber. The last two sentences of that letter read:\nThe notice of motion contains an affidavit of John L. Agro setting out certain facts we believe to be incorrect.\nThe matter is of serious interest and Unless we receive a reply of your intentions by telephone (No. 772-3224) arrangements will be made to have counsel defend the motion and have you removed as solicitor on the record.\nOn February 8, 1966, that is, the next day, Mr. Schreiber served a notice of motion on the solicitor for the defendants to be heard at the same time as the motion for judgment. The relief asked in Mr. Sehreiber\u2019s motion was for an order to set aside the settlement in the action and to restore the said action to the list of actions to be tried at this sitting of the Court. Also on that 8th day of February Helen Bell and the other plaintiffs signed a notice of change of solicitors from Mr. Schreiber to Messrs. Ballachey, Moore and Hart. I should add that by a document entitled \u201cNotice of Dispute\u201d and dated February 4, 1966, the various plaintiffs had given notice to both Mr. Schreiber and Mr. Agro that \u201cout of court settlement offered in full satisfaction of each of their claims is not acceptable and is refused and further take notice that it is their desire to proceed to trial by judge and jury for proper and just assessment for specific and general damages\u201d. On February 10, 1966, the motion for judgment in accordance with the settlement came on for hearing before Richardson J., in Hamilton. Mr. Agro appeared for the applicants and Mr. Ballachey for the respondents.\nIt would appear that the first witness called by the applicants on the application was Henry L. Schreiber, the solicitor who had acted, until February 8, 1966, for the plaintiffs. It is Mr. Ballachey\u2019s recollection that he objected to Mr. Schreiber\u2019s giving evidence. Mr. Ballachey so testified on examination upon an affidavit which he had filed and to which reference will be made hereafter. The record in the appeal case shows no such objection but that record purports to be only \u201cExtract from Proceedings viva voce evidence submitted on the motion\u201d. Mr. Agro executed an affidavit on June 2, 1967, and he states in para. 5 thereof:\nH.L Schreiber, Esq., the former counsel for the Plaintiffs, appeared under subpoena and gave evidence on behalf of the Defendants. Mr. Ballachey raised no objection to giving of evidence by Mr. Schreiber.\n\u201cCounsel should not give a proof of evidence of what occurred at a hearing in which he was professionally engaged.\u201d This quotation is from Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 3, p. 68, referring to the Annual Statement of the General Council of the Bar, 1937, p. 7. Under the circumstances of this case, counsel for both parties no doubt felt that they could not properly discharge their duty to their clients without submitting to the Court of Appeal evidence by affidavit followed on one side by cross-examination. I am not suggesting that this was improper under the circumstances. However, this shows how important it is to have all court proceedings conducted in such way that there can be no justification for such a course of action. That this resulted in the Court being invited to choose between conflicting statements made under oath by distinguished members of the Bar clearly demonstrates the wisdom of the aforementioned rule and the desirability of taking every precaution to ensure that the paramount interests of the clients will not require it to be broken.\nThis regrettable occurrence was occasioned by insufficient concern for a fundamental rule, namely, the duty of a solicitor to refrain from disclosing confidential information unless his client waives the privilege.\nIt is rather astounding that Mr. Schreiber should be subpoenaed to give evidence on behalf of the defendants as against his former clients and that he should produce his complete file including many memoranda and other material all of which were privileged as against the plaintiffs and whether the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected or not that he should be permitted to so testify and so produce without the consent of the plaintiffs being requested and obtained.\nLord Chancellor Eldon said, in Beer v. Ward[1], at p. 80:\n\u2026it would be the duty of any Court to stop him if he was about to disclose confidential matters\u2026the Court knows the privilege of the client, and it must be taken for granted that the attorney will act rightly, and claim that privilege; or that if he does not, the Court will make him claim it.\nBecause the solicitor owes to his former client a duty to claim the privilege when applicable, it is improper for him not to claim it without showing that it has been properly waived. Especially is this so when, as here, the circumstances are such as to make it most unlikely that a waiver would be given. Also, because it is improper to induce a breach of duty, I have serious doubts about the propriety of putting to a solicitor questions that involve the disclosure of confidential information without first bringing in evidence of a proper waiver. In any case, because the client\u2019s privilege is a duty owed to the Court, no objection ought to be necessary and the evidence in violation of the privilege should not be received. The proceedings continued throughout February 10 and again on May 27, 1966. Mr. Ballachey, in his affidavit, to which reference has been made above, has testified:\n5. That the matter came on again on the 27th of May 1966 and after considerable evidence, had been given by the plaintiffs, the learned judge requested that he interview the plaintiffs, in His Chambers, and asked counsel to consent that this be done without counsel being present, and such interview did take place, but to the best of the writer\u2019s recollection, the infant, David Guy Bell, was not present at the said interview.\n6. That to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, no Court reporter was present during the interview in the learned Judge\u2019s Chambers between the learned trial judge and the Plaintiffs.\nIn Majcenic v. Natale[2], Evans J.A., giving judgment for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, was dealing with a case where certain conversations with counsel had taken place in judge\u2019s chambers and were not recorded. At p. 200, he said:\nThe necessity for filing in this Court the material to which I have referred would have been eliminated if the procedure recommended in Berends et al. v. Taylor, an unreported decision of this Court dated April 5, 1966, had been followed. The procedure recommended therein (in which the propriety of striking out the jury notice was in question) was that the trial Judge should either hear argument in open Court in the absence of the jury panel or have the reporter in Chambers to record the discussion on the question of whether or not he should dispense with the jury.\nThat injunction is even more applicable in such a case as the present where not the counsel but the clients themselves were interviewed by the learned judge in his chambers without counsel being present and without a reporter. Indeed it is difficult to understand why counsel should ever be excluded from the judge\u2019s chambers when their clients are being interviewed by the judge. Counsel is thereby put in an impossible situation. He cannot object without risk of offence to the Court and perhaps raising suspicion in the minds of his clients. Also such a request is apt to reflect adversely against him, or to be considered in this light by his clients. Even more serious is the fact that it makes it practically impossible for him to discharge his duty to advise his clients: how can he tell them that they should refuse the Court\u2019s invitation? On final analysis, this is nothing less than a serious interference with the clients\u2019 rights to the benefit of the advice of counsel besides being a depar- ture from the rule of judicial conduct that a judge ought never to put himself in a situation where one of the parties is apt to be induced to look upon him as an adviser rather than an impartial arbitrator. Even if the trial judge was convinced that the proposed settlement was in the plaintiffs\u2019 best interests and they were apt to suffer great detriment by refusing it, a commendable concern for the interests of the infant plaintiff could not justify a departure from the rules of judicial behaviour with respect to the plaintiffs of full age. The importance of the regrettable lack of any acceptable record as to what occurred in the learned judge\u2019s chambers is made plain immediately hereafter.\nFrom what appears in the record in the appeal case, upon such conference having been completed counsel for the defendants turned to the question of the quantum of damages of the infant. That was discussed for several pages and then the learned judge inquired \u201canything else?\u201d to which Mr. Ballachey replied, \u201cIt is unnecessary to deal with the motion of the matter of the amendment to the statement of claim under these circumstances\u201d. His Lordship agreed and then Mr. Ballachey requested \u201cWill Your Lordship give consideration to the carriage of the matter of the issue of the judgment?\u201d The learned judge replied \u201cI think the record is here, let Mr. Agro draft the judgment and send it to you\u2026and it is here in Hamilton\u2026\u201d\nIt would appear therefore that at some time after the recess and conference to which I have referred the learned judge must have endorsed the record. That endorsement was in these words:\nOn consent of parties and without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs judgment to issue for the adult plaintiffs\u2026\nThe formal judgment dated May 27, 1966, but not issued until June 8, 1966, in para. 1 provides:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the action herein was settled by the solicitors for the parties so far as it respects the plaintiffs Helen Bell, James E. Bell and Marjorie Bell, who is now of the full age of twenty-one years, in accordance with the aforesaid minutes of settlement filed.\nA search of the appeal case and also the original papers shows that the only consent minutes of settlement deal with the proposed judgment to be given in relation to the claim of the infant David Guy Bell which, of course, was subject to the approval of the Court and approval of which was reserved by Richardson J. in his judgment of May 27, 1966.\nWhen one considers the wording of the formal judgment which I have recited above and compares it with the wording on the endorsement of the record signed by the learned trial judge, it seems quite plain that the formal judgment is simply an error. There were no consent minutes filed and the evidence plainly was that the plaintiffs had never signed any consent. The consent of the then plaintiffs\u2019 solicitor, Mr. Schreiber, had been in the form of his letter of January 12, 1966, which I have quoted above. I am of the view that that letter could not, on May 27, 1966, be accepted as a consent to judgment by the solicitors for the plaintiffs when counsel for the plaintiffs, who had come upon the record by a notice of change of solicitors as early as February 8th previous, was in court opposing any judgment on consent and insisting that the trial should go on. This is not one of the many cases where a solicitor, either acting without instructions or contrary to his instructions, had consented to an order which had been made and then his clients sought, in further proceedings, to have that order set aside. There had in this case been no judgment of the Court prior to the judgment of Richardson J. on May 27, 1966, and any consent to such a judgment as was given by that learned judge was being strongly opposed by the person who was then counsel, on the record, for the plaintiffs.\nIf one accepts as final the form of the endorsement made by the learned judge on the record then, as pointed out, that endorsement reads: \u201cOn consent of the parties\u2026\u201d The import of those words is not that it was on the consent of Mr. Schreiber but on the consent of the appellants here Helen Bell, James E. Bell and Marjorie Bell. So understood, those words avoid what, in my view, is the quite untenable inference that the learned judge purported to act on the consent of a solicitor when the clients were in court denying that they consented and doing so through the mouth of a different counsel. The difficulty is to find the consent of those parties to such settlement. There is not one word in the record as printed in the appeal case which would indicate that either the parties or the then counsel, Mr. Ballachey, made any consent whatsoever. If the consent occurred when the learned judge conferred with the clients in his chambers, neither counsel nor reporter being present, then certainly the conduct of the plaintiffs in carrying an appeal, first to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and then to this Court, indicates that they do not understand that they consented before His Lordship in his chambers to any such judgment.\nWhen the disposition in the Court of Appeal for Ontario is considered, there arises a similar difficulty in understanding what occurred. The Court gave no written reasons. Among the material filed in this Court was the appeal book used by McLennan J.A., and on the face of that appeal book there are written these words: \u201cAppeal dismissed without costs on grounds that Mr. Ballachey was representing his clients in open court. 6th June 1967.\u201d If those words represent the ground upon which the appeal was dismissed, and there can be no certainty of this, then they give rise to another basis for understanding the judgment of the first instance. The inference from those words must be that the judgment of the learned judge was based not on any consent minutes signed by Mr. Schreiber, not on any consent made by the parties in the judge\u2019s chambers, but on Mr. Ballachey\u2019s consent in court. Mr. Ballachey, in his affidavit, has denied that he gave such consent. Mr. Agro, who appeared as counsel for the defendants, has testified in his affidavit that Mr. Ballachey did consent. In the \u201cExtract from Proceedings viva voce evidence submitted on the motion\u201d, there appear no words of consent attributed to Mr. Ballachey and certainly he signed no such consent.\nIn view of this state of most regrettable confusion, I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs should have a right to have their action tried in open court and that the appeal must be allowed.\nI would award to the appellants the costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The costs of the new trial and of the application for judgment from which this appeal arises should be reserved to the judge presiding at such new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs; new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Ballachey, Moore & Hart, Brantford.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Agro, Cooper, Zaffiro, Parente & Orzel, Hamilton.\n[1] (1821), Jacob 77, 37 E.R. 779.\n[2] [1968] 1 O.R. 189, 66 D.L.R.

Basing its claim on s. 3(1) (f) of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55, the plaintiff complained that the defendants had infringed the Copyright Act in some seven named musical works by \u201ccommunicating the same by radio communication throughout Canada, or by causing or authorizing the said musical works to be communicated by radio communication throughout Canada, without the licence or authority of the plaintiff\u201d. The Exchequer Court dismissed the action and held that there was no infringement for the reason that there was no transmission or communication of the musical works, and that since the affiliated stations were authorized by licence from the plaintiff to make use of the subject matter of the copyright it could not be an infringement for the defendant CTV to authorize the affiliated stations to do it. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendants had infringed s. 3(1)(f) of the Copyright Act by communicating the named musical works by radio communication could not be supported on the literal meaning of the statute because, in view of the statutory definitions, what was communicated was not \u201cthe works\u201d but \u201ca performance of the works\u201d. Nor could the action be supported on the construction of the enactment in the light of the intention revealed by the whole Act. This provision was obviously inspired by para. 1 of Article 11 bis of the Rome Convention which is set out in a schedule referred to in the Act (s. 53). That article clearly contemplates only public performances by radio broadcasting (\u201ccommunication\u2026au public par la radiodiffusion\u201d). \u201cRadiocommunication\u201d in the statute was an obvious error carried from the English translation of the Convention which is in French only.\nThe action could not be supported on the contention that CTV \u201cauthorized\u201d the television broadcasts because it only provided the means of doing that which CAPAC had authorized the affiliated stations to do.\nDroit d\u2019auteur\u2014Violation\u2014T\u00e9l\u00e9vision\u2014R\u00e9seau de television fournissant par micro-ondes des programmes de musique \u00e0 des stations affili\u00e9es\u2014Y a-t-il transmission radiophonique d\u2019une \u0153uvre musicale\u2014Loi sur le droit d\u2019auteur, S.R.C. 1952, c. 55, arts. 2(p), (q), 3(1)(f).\nDans l\u2019exploitation de son r\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, la d\u00e9fenderesse CTV obtient des programmes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision enregistr\u00e9s sur ruban magn\u00e9tique et les fournit \u00e0 des stations priv\u00e9es de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui lui sont affili\u00e9es. Dans la plupart des cas, ces programmes sont transmis au moyen de micro-ondes par l\u2019autre d\u00e9fenderesse, la Bell Telephone Co. of Canada. Se basant sur l\u2019art. 3(1)(f) de la Loi sur le droit d\u2019auteur, S.R.C. 1952, c. 55, la demanderesse se plaint que les d\u00e9fenderesses ont viol\u00e9 la Loi sur le droit d\u2019auteur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sept \u0153uvres musicales \u00aben transmettant ces \u0153uvres au moyen de la radiophonie \u00e0 travers le Canada ou, en occasionnant ou autorisant la transmission de ces \u0153uvres par radiophonie \u00e0 travers le Canada, sans s\u2019\u00eatre procur\u00e9 une licence ou la permission de la demanderesse\u00bb. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action et a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu violation parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de transmission des \u0153uvres musicales, et que, puisque les stations affili\u00e9es avaient une licence de la demanderesse pour reproduire ces \u0153uvres, la d\u00e9fenderesse CTV ne pouvait pas \u00eatre coupable de violation de droit lorsqu\u2019elle avait autoris\u00e9 les stations affili\u00e9es \u00e0 les reproduire. La demanderesse en appella \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de la demanderesse que les d\u00e9fenderesses ont enfreint l\u2019art. 3(1)(f) de la Loi sur le droit d\u2019auteur en transmettant les \u0153uvres musicales au moyen de la radiophonie ne peut \u00eatre admise au sens litt\u00e9ral du statut parce que suivant les d\u00e9finitions statutaires, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00abl\u2019\u0153uvre\u00bb mais \u00abune repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019\u0153uvre\u00bb. L\u2019action ne peut pas non plus \u00eatre maintenue en se basant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la disposition en regard de l\u2019ensemble de la loi. Cette disposition est \u00e9videmment inspir\u00e9e du para. 1 de l\u2019article 11 (bis) de la Convention de Rome reproduite dans l\u2019annexe vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 de la loi. Il est clair que cet article ne vise que la repr\u00e9sentation publique par la radio (\u00abcommunication. au public par la radiodiffusion\u00bb). \u00abRadiophonie\u00bb dans la loi est une erreur \u00e9vidente provenant de la traduction incorrecte de \u00abradiodiffusion\u00bb par \u00abradiocommunication\u00bb au lieu de \u00abradiobroadcasting\u00bb. La convention est en fran\u00e7ais seulement.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que CTV aurait enfreint les droits de CAPAC en autorisant les \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision ne peut pas \u00eatre admise. C\u2019est que CTV n\u2019a pas fait autre chose que fournir un moyen de faire ce que CAPAC avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment autoris\u00e9 les stations affili\u00e9es \u00e0 faire.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an action for infringement of copyright. Appeal dismissed.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and J.E. Sexton, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW.Z. Estey, Q.C., and F.E. Armstrong, for the defendant, respondent, CTV Television Network Ltd.\nA.S. Pattillo, Q.C., and J.W. Garrow, for the defendant, respondent, Bell Telephone Co. of Canada.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The plaintiff appellant, Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada Ltd. (hereinafter called \u201cCAPAC\u201d) is a performing rights society contemplated in ss. 48 to 51 of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55 (hereinafter called the \u201cAct\u201d). In accordance with those provisions it has filed statements of fees which have been approved by the Copyright Appeal Board and published in the Canada Gazette. In those statements Tariff No. 3 entitled \u201cTelevision Broadcasting\u201d sets the fee payable for a general licence by an operator of television station other than the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at 1\u00bd per cent of the gross amount paid for the use of the operator\u2019s services or facilities.\nDefendant CTV Television Network Ltd. (hereinafter called \u201cCTV\u201d) has, since October 1, 1961, been operating a private television network in the following way. It acquires, or maybe produces, television programs recorded on videotape. It contracts with advertisers for payment in consideration of the addition of commercials. It also contracts with private affiliated television stations for having the programs broadcast at a proper time in consideration of stipulated payments. The programs are supplied to the affiliated stations in some cases by shipping a copy of the videotape but, in most cases, by using facilities provided by the defendant The Bell Telephone Company of Canada (hereinafter called \u201cBell\u201d). These facilities over short distances include cable only but, over long distances, the transmission is effected mostly by microwave.\nIt is obvious that CTV\u2019s gross revenue from the operations above described must be very substantially larger than the amount that it pays to the affiliated stations, seeing that this revenue has to cover the cost of the programs and the cost of transmission to the affiliated stations in addition to what is paid for broadcasting same and also provide for general expenses and profit. CAPAC has been trying to obtain a 1\u00bd per cent fee on the larger amount. With that end in view, it has filed in November 1962 a tariff providing under the heading of \u201cTelevision Broadcasting\u201d, in addition to the general licence above mentioned, for a general licence to CTV \u201cfor all network television broadcast\u201d. The fee for such licence is 11\/2 per cent of the gross amount paid to CTV for the use of the network less the amount in turn paid by CTV to its affiliated stations.\nCTV objected to the tariff and, after it was approved, refused to take a licence. Thereupon CAPAC brought action in May 1963 alleging in substance the facts above recited and complaining of infringement of copyright in some seven named musical works by \u201ccommunicating the same by radio communication throughout Canada, or by causing or authorizing the said musical works to be communicated by radio communication throughout Canada, without the licence or authority of the Plaintiff\u201d.\nIt is admitted that CAPAC is the owner of the copyright in the musical works in question. It is also admitted that these \u201cmusical numbers\u201d as they are called in the admission were included in the programs transmitted for broadcasting to the affiliated network stations and effectively broadcast by them. It is also admitted that the transmission in several cases was effected by means of cable and microwave facilities of Bell. The question is was this an infringement of CAPAC\u2019s copyright?\nIn the Exchequer Court[2] it was held that there was no infringement for the reason that there was no transmission nor communication of the musical \u201cworks\u201d from CTV to the affiliated stations and that the latter being authorized by licence from CAPAC to make use of the subject matter of the copyright, it could not be an infringement for CTV to authorize them to do it. As the learned President put it, \u201cit cannot be a tort merely to authorize or cause a person to do something that that person has a right to do\u201d.\nCAPAC\u2019s claim is based essentially on sub-para. (f) and the concluding words of subs. (1) of s. 3 of the Act, whereby it is enacted that \u201ccopyright\u201d includes the sole right\n\u2026f) in case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to communicate such work by radio communication; and to authorize any such acts as aforesaid.\nIn considering this provision, it is essential to note the following definitions in s. 2 of the Act:\n(p) \u201cmusical work\u201d means any combination of melody and harmony, or either of them, printed, reduced to writing, or otherwise graphically produced or reproduced;\n(q) \u201cperformance\u201d means any acoustic representation of a work or any visual representation of any dramatic action in a work, including a representation made by means of any mechanical instrument or by radio communication.\nIn the light of the above definitions, it is obvious that what was done on the occasion described in the action is not the communication of the \u201cmusical works\u201d. Leaving aside any technical considerations respecting the nature of the signals transmitted from CTV to the affiliated stations, these signals did not communicate the \u201cmusical works\u201d as defined in the Act, that is graphic reproductions of melody and harmony. What was communicated was not the \u201cworks\u201d but \u201ca performance of the works\u201d. Thus, on a literal construction of the Act, CAPAC\u2019s case fails in so far as it rests on sub-para. (f).\nThe next question is: Should the enactment be read otherwise than literally? Counsel for CAPAC has drawn attention to the French version of the Act in which subpara. (f) reads as follows:\nf) s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u0153uvre litt\u00e9raire, dramatique, musicale ou artistique, de transmettre cette \u0153uvre au moyen de la radiophonie. Le droit d\u2019auteur comprend aussi le droit exclusif d\u2019autoriser les actes mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus.\nIn this connection, the following facts should be noted. Section 53 of the Act refers to the Rome Convention which is set out in the Third Schedule. From this it appears that the Convention is in French only: the Schedule annexed to the English version is expressly stated to be a translation. The history of the legislation further shows that sub-para. (f) as well as s. 53 and the Third Schedule were all added to the Act by the Copyright Amendment Act 1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 8. This makes it obvious that sub-para. (f) was inspired by para. 1 of Article 11bis of the Convention, which is in the following terms:\n(1) Les auteurs d\u2019\u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires et artistiques jouissent du droit exclusif d\u2019autoriser la communication de leurs \u0153uvres au public par la radiodiffusion.\nIn the Schedule this is translated as follows:\n(1) Authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing the communication of their works to the public by radiocommunication.\nIt will be noted that where the Convention speaks of \u201cradiodiffusion\u201d i.e. radio broadcasting, the unfortunate translation reads \u201cradiocommunication\u201d. The error in translation of the Convention was obviously carried into the statute intended to implement it, and, as happened in the case of the Hague Rules annexed to the Water Carriage of Goods Act, the English text was translated into French.\nIt is apparent that the above cited article of the Convention contemplates public performances by radio broadcasting. Such is the clear meaning of \u201cla communication de leurs \u0153uvres au public par la radiodiffusion\u201d (communication of their works to the public by radio broadcasting). In the Convention \u201c\u0153uvres\u201d (works) is not defined, therefore, as applied to musical works, it is properly taken in the primary sense of the composition itself, not its graphic representation as in the Act. Also, while \u201ccommunication\u201d does not usually mean \u201ca performance\u201d it is apt to include performances in its meaning along with other modes of representation applicable to other kinds of artistic or literary works that are not \u201cperformed\u201d.\nIt must be noted that in the Convention it is doubly indicated by \u201cau public\u201d and by \u201cradiodiffusion\u201d that public performances or communications only are aimed at. This is consonant with the general definition of \u201ccopyright\u201d which, as stated in subs. 1 of s. 3 of the Act, applies to any reproduction of the work but, as respect performances, applies only to those that are \u201cin public\u201d. Is it to be inferred that Parliament intended to depart from this principle in enacting subs. 2(f) simply because the words \u201cto the public\u201d are not found in it? Of course, if the provision was clear, if it could be applied literally to give this result, effect would have to be given to the intention. However, as previously noted, the material part of the provision does not read \u201cto communicate a performance of such work by radio communication\u201d but \u201cto communicate such work by radio communication\u201d. In view of the statutory definitions of \u201cmusical work\u201d and of \u201cperformance\u201d the insertion of the word \u201cperformance\u201d in the enactment is a very substantial departure from the text as written. Bearing in mind that the reproduction of a work as distinguished from a performance thereof is always within the definition of \u201ccopyright\u201d while a performance is outside the scope of the definition if not in public, it is only through the insertion of the word \u201cperformance\u201d without the words \u201cin public\u201d that a departure from principle would be effected.\nOn the assumption that the provision is not clear and that it must not be applied literally, it is not at all obvious that it must be read as suggested to give effect to CAPAC\u2019s contention. Once it is ascertained that interpretation has to be resorted to, the intention must be gathered from the statute as a whole and this certainly includes the Schedule that is referred to in the body of the Act and is printed with it. Upon such consideration it becomes apparent that sub\u2011para. (f) is intended to achieve the result contemplated in paragraph 1 of article 11 bis. Bearing in mind that the Rome Convention is in French no other conclusion is possible but that the intent is to provide that copyright includes the exclusive right of public performance or representation by radio broadcasting (\u201ccommunication au public par la radiodiffusion\u201d).\nThe contention advanced by CAPAC would have the anomalous result that the extent of the copyright with respect to the communication or transmission of performances of musical works, would depend on the means employed for such communication or transmission. If it was by physical delivery of magnetic tape or by transmission of an electrical signal by cable, there would be no monopoly in favour of the owner of the copyright in the works per* formed. However, such monopoly would exist if the transmission was by microwave, although such transmission would be as private as in the other cases.\nI therefore come to the conclusion on the first point, that CAPAC\u2019s contention cannot be supported either on the literal meaning of the statute or on construction in the light of the intention revealed by the whole Act, including the Schedule.\nAs to the second point, it seems to me that the trial judge has effectively disposed of it. The authorization to make use of the copyright by performing the works through television broadcasts was given by CAPAC to the affiliated stations and it cannot be said to proceed from CTV. CTV effectively provided the means of doing that which CAPAC had authorized. In this connection it must be observed that the licences contemplated in ss. 48 and following of the Copyright Act are throughout described as performing licences or licences in respect of the \u201cperformance\u201d of works.\nIt may well be that if CAPAC cannot collect fees from CTV under its tariff, it is because under the authority of legal provisions respecting fees for performances it is seeking to recover such fees from someone who does not effect performances. It may be significant in this respect that CAPAC is claiming infringement not by performance, but by radio communication of the work or by. authorizing such communication.\nCAPAC has pressed at the hearing the argument that if the law was not applied as it contends, it would be deprived of the economic advantage that the Act and the tariff were intended to provide to it. If such an argument could be considered, it would have to be observed that nothing in the Act appears to restrict the quantum and the modalities of the fees to be required under an approved tariff. If by reason of the setting-up of the CTV network the fee prescribed in the tariff applicable to television broadcasting stations has become inadequate, this is a matter for the Copyright Appeal Board on the submission of an appropriate tariff at which time it may have to be considered whether some special treatment should be provided to avoid a duplicate fee on the cost of programs recorded in the United States. It has not been shown that the Board could not approve a tariff under which, if it appeared proper and just, the fee payable for a licence in respect of network broadcasts would be higher than the present 1\u00bd per cent.\nI conclude that the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: John V.

It imported some of the components made in the U.S.A. and these together with other components made in Canada were assembled and erected on its behalf by a third party into precipitators at the plant in question. Alleging that the precipitators were manufactured in Canada, the respondent claimed a drawback of customs duties paid on the importation of the components made in U.S.A. and based its claim on s. 11(1) of the Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 60, and drawback items 1056 and 1059 of the Schedule B. The Deputy Minister refused the claim on the ground that the respondent did not perform any manufacturing operation in connection with the precipitators and that, while the precipitators had been erected on its behalf, the components had been fabricated previously. An appeal to the Tariff Board was rejected on the ground that the work carried out at Copper Cliff was assembly and erection rather than manufacture. A further appeal to the Exchequer Court was allowed on the ground that the Board had erred in law. The Deputy Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Pigeon J. dissenting): The appeal of the Deputy Minister should be allowed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.: The Tariff Board did not misdirect itself as to the law. It could not be held, as a matter of law, that what was done on behalf of respondent at the site constituted manufacture by the respondent of eight precipitators. On the facts, it was open to the Board to find, as it did, that the assembly and erection of the fabricated components was not, in this case, manufacture within the meaning of the relevant tariff items.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Pigeon J., dissenting: The Exchequer Court rightly held that the Board had erred in law. Assembly is undoubtedly a part of the manufacturing process of any manufactured object made up of several component parts.\nFurthermore, the Tariff Board did not find that the precipitators as such had been manufactured prior to importation. It follows that it should have come to the conclusion that they had been manufactured in Canada since, being manufactured objects, they could not have been manufactured elsewhere.\nRevenu\u2014Douane et accise\u2014Pi\u00e8ces import\u00e9es\u2014Pi\u00e8ces fabriqu\u00e9es au pays\u2014Assemblage de d\u00e9poussi\u00e9reurs\u2014Ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9s au Canada\u2014Tarif des douanes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 60, art. 11(1).\nEn 1961, l\u2019intim\u00e9e Research-Cottrell (Canada) Ltd. s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir et construire huit d\u00e9poussi\u00e9reurs \u00e9lectrostatiques \u00e0 l\u2019usine d\u2019une compagnie mini\u00e8re \u00e0 Copper Cliff, Ontario.

Appel accueilli, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et le Juge Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL by the Deputy Minister from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing an appeal from the Tariff Board. Appeal allowed, Cartwright C.J. and Pigeon J. dissenting.\nC.R.O. Munro, Q.C. and A.M. Garneau, for the appellant.\nG.F. Henderson, Q.C., and B.A. Crane, for the respondent, Research-Cottrell (Canada) Ltd.\nR. Belfoi, for the respondent, Joy Manufacturing Co.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Pigeon J. was delivered by\nPIGEON J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts of this case are really quite simple and undisputed. The respondent, Research-Cottrell (Canada) Ltd. in May 1961 contracted with International Nickel Company of Canada Ltd. to \u201cdesign, furnish and erect\u201d, at the latter\u2019s plant in Copper Cliff, Ontario, for a total cost of $1,000,000 eight electrical precipitators. The precipitators were designed in the United States by respondent\u2019s parent company. That company also supplied some of the component parts which were made in the United States. It ordered other parts from United States suppliers and some from Canadian suppliers. The erection was made by a Canadian company under contract for the lump sum of $94,000. The operations performed under that contract with respondent\u2019s parent company were said to include \u201ccutting, fitting, welding, wiring, joining, bolting and fabricating\u201d.\nRespondent claimed drawback of customs duty under Drawback Items 1056 and 1059. The items cover \u201cmaterials\u201d, \u201cwhen used in the manufacture of articles entitled to entry\u201d under specified tariff items and it was contended that one of these tariff items, namely 410z, covered the precipitators in question. Appellant denied the claim for drawback and on an appeal from his decision to the Tariff Board only one question was considered, namely \u201cwhether or not the precipitators were \u2018manufactured\u2019 in Canada within the drawback items in issue\u201d. The Tariff Board held that:\nThe intent of the drawback items 1056 and 1059 is clearly the encouragement of the manufacture in Canada of the goods or articles described in tariff item 410z as opposed to their acquisition abroad. In such a context it hardly seems a reasonable construction of the word manufacture to extend the benefits of the drawback items to imported goods which are simply assembled and erected on site.\nIn referring to the making of blast furnaces, oxygen furnaces, blast furnace stoves, open hearth furnaces and soaking pit furnaces, the word used in drawback item 1044 (now item number 97044-1) is \u201cconstruction\u201d; similarly, the word used to describe the making of bridges is \u201cconstruction\u201d in tariff item 460 (now item number 46000-1). Nor do the contracts for the installation of the precipitators use the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d, rather they use the words \u201cerect\u201d and \u201cinstall\u201d.\nIn the present case, the Board finds the work carried out at Copper Cliff, Ontario, to be assembly and erection rather than manufacture.\nOn appeal to the Exchequer Court[2], Cattanach J. held that the Board had erred in law. After pointing out that there was no evidence before the Board upon which it could have concluded that the precipitators were in existence before ultimate assembly and erection, he said:\nIn the absence of a finding by the Board either express or implied, that the precipitators had an existence outside Canada, then I am of the opinion that a finding that the precipitators were not \u201cmanufactured\u201d in Canada because they were merely \u201cassembled and erected\u201d in Canada, is wrong in law. I am of the opinion that the Board erred as a matter of law in concluding, as they did, that if what was done in Canada can properly be described as assembly and erection, it follows that the ultimate article was not manufactured in Canada. Where the article never existed until after the acts performed by the appellant on the site, then in my view, as a matter of law the article must be regarded as having been manufactured in Canada.\nThis conclusion was challenged essentially on the basis that the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d in its ordinary meaning and as used in the relevant legislation does not embrace all the processes by which things come into existence. It was also contended that in the context of the relevant tariff item the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d can hardly include mere assembly and erection of equipment which, because of its size, must be imported in pieces and erected at the purchaser\u2019s site.\nIn dealing first with the last mentioned contention it must be said that \u201cassembly\u201d is undoubtedly a part of the manufacturing process of any manufactured object made up of several component parts. The decision of the Tariff Board cannot be supported on the basis that assembly is not a part of the manufacturing process. No such finding was made.\nAs to the other point, it must be noted that the Tariff Board did not find that the precipitators as such had been manufactured prior to importation. There can be no doubt that in a proper case such a finding could be made and in such case the thing itself would be imported, not the materials for making it, although it might be imported in several pieces. Here the Tariff Board made no such finding. On the contrary, it proceeded to consider in effect whether assembly and erection were of sufficient importance to justify the benefit of the drawback. This is a factor which ought not to enter into consideration on the construction of the tariff item. Unless Parliament sees fit to specify the relative importance of the process carried on in Canada as opposed to the part carried on in producing the imported materials or parts, the only question to be considered in construing the enactment is whether what is done in Canada is substantially a part of the manufacturing process. From this it follows that, on the basis of its finding of facts, the Tariff Board could not come to the conclusion that the precipitators were not manufactured in Canada unless it could find that they were not manufactured. If they were manufactured they cannot have been manufactured elsewhere, seeing that they were not imported, what was imported was materials and parts used in making them up.\nIn support of the contention that the precipitators were not manufactured, reference was made to the fact that with reference to furnaces and bridges the word used in the applicable items is \u201cconstruction\u201d not \u201cmanufacture\u201d. In my view, this means only that \u201cconstruction\u201d was considered as the appropriate word to describe the process whereby furnaces and bridges are brought into existence, while \u201cmanufacture\u201d was considered the appropriate word for precipitators. Any other view would result in precipitators of such size that they can be shipped whole being considered as manufactured objects and larger precipitators as not manufactured. Nobody would contend that precipitators shipped in one piece are not manufactured items. It is hard to see how larger size articles of the same nature would have to be classified as constructions.\nFor those reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014Under the terms of a sub-contract, dated June 5, 1961, the respondent Research-Cottrell (Canada) Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \u201cCottrell (Canada)\u201d, agreed with The Foundation Company of Canada, Limited, to\nSupply all labour, materials, plant and tools necessary to supply and install \u201cEight Only Precipitators\u201d on subject project\u2026\nThe project was the subject-matter of a contract dated March 11, 1961, between The Foundation Company, as contractor, and The International Nickel Company of Canada Limited. The sub-contract provided for a price of $1,000,000 to Cottrell (Canada). Each precipitator has an overall height and overall width of approximately 40 feet, and is about 17 feet across the end. The precipitators are known as electrostatic precipitators and their function is to remove solid or liquid particles from gases generated at the International Nickel Company plant at Copper Cliff.\nCottrell (Canada) maintains only a sales office in Canada, in Toronto, the only permanent employees being a manager and his secretary.\nThe precipitators were designed in the U.S.A. by Research-Cottrell Inc., hereinafter called \u201cCottrell Inc.\u201d, of which Cottrell (Canada) is a wholly owned subsidiary. Cottrell Inc. manufactured in the United States some of the essential components of the precipitators; namely, wire components, the electrical control system and transformers. Some of the components were ordered by Cottrell Inc. from manufacturers and suppliers in the United States. It also selected and ordered other components from manufacturers and suppliers in Canada.\nAll the various components were shipped to the site of the International Nickel Company plant at Copper Cliff. They were assembled and erected by Noront Steel Construction Co., Ltd., of Sudbury, Ontario, pursuant to an agreement between Noront and Cottrell Inc. dated March 29, 1962, whereby Noront was to \u201cfurnish all labor, tools and construction equipment to receive, unload and completely erect eight (8) precipitators.\u201d The price was $94,000.\nAfter the contract between Cottrell (Canada) and the Foundation Company had been completed, Cottrell (Canada) claimed a drawback of customs duties paid on the importation of those components of the precipitators which had been supplied from the United States.\nThe claim was based upon s. 11(1) of the Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 60:\n11. (1) On the materials set forth in Schedule B, when used for consumption in Canada for the purpose specified in that Schedule, there may be paid, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the several rates of drawback of Customs duties set opposite to each item respectively in that Schedule, under regulations by the Governor in Council. The relevant portions of Schedule B are as follows:\nGOODS SUBJECT TO DRAWBACK FOR HOME CONSUMPTION\nItem No.\nGoods\nWhen Subject to Drawback\nPortion of Duty Payable as Drawback\n1056\nMaterials, including all parts, wholly or in chief part of metal, of a class or kind not made in Canada.\nWhen used in the manufacture of goods entitled to entry under tariff items 410z\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n99 p.c.\n1059\nMaterials\nWhen used in the manufacture of articles entitled to entry under tariff items 410b and 410z, when such articles are used as specified in said items\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n70 p.c.\nThe distinction between items 1056 and 1059 is that to fall in item 1056 the materials must be \u201cof a class or kind not made in Canada\u201d whereas that is not a requirement of item 1059.\nTariff item 410z appears in Schedule A to the Customs Tariff:\nGOODS SUBJECT TO DUTY AND FREE GOODS\nTariff Item\nBritish Preferential Tariff\nMost-Favoured-Nation Tariff\nGeneral Tariff\n410z\nMachinery and apparatus, n.o.p., and parts thereof, for the recovery of solid or liquid particles from flue or other waste gases at metallurgical or industrial plants, not to include motive power, tanks for gas, nor pipes and valves 10\u00bd inches or less in diameter\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n5 p.c.\n10 p.c.\n12\u00bd p.c.\nThe contention of Cottrell (Canada) is that the components of the precipitator obtained from the United States were articles entitled to entry under Item 410z and that they had been used in the manufacture of articles entitled to entry under that item within the meaning of Items 1056 and 1059 of Schedule B.\nThe claim of Cottrell (Canada) for a drawback was refused by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise on the ground that Cottrell (Canada) did not perform any manufacturing operation in connec- tion with the precipitators and that, while the precipitators were erected on. its behalf by Noront, the components had been fabricated previously. Cottrell (Canada) appealed from his decision to the Tariff Board, and the respondent Joy Manufacturing Company (Canada) Limited entered an appearance.\nThe appeal was rejected by the Tariff Board, for the following reasons:\nThe Board adopts the observation of Sir Lyman Duff, C.J.C., in King v. Vandeweghe Ltd. 1934 S.C.R. 244:\nThe words \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d are not words of any very precise meaning and consequently we must look to the context for the purpose of ascertaining their meaning and application in the provisions we have to construe.\nIt will not, for the purposes of this appeal, seek to establish any definition of general application to all cases but rather to declare whether or not the actions performed in this case constituted manufacturing.\nThe intent of tariff item 410z appears to be to benefit metallurgical or industrial plants in their acquisition of a certain type of machinery and apparatus by the imposition of lower rates of customs duties than would be levied were item 410z not in the Customs Tariff.\nThe intent of the drawback items 1056 and 1059 is clearly the encouragement of the manufacture in Canada of the goods or articles described in tariff item 410z as opposed to their acquisition abroad. In such a context it hardly seems a reasonable construction of the word manufacture to extend the benefits of the drawback items to imported goods which are simply assembled and erected on site.\nIn referring to the making of blast furnaces, oxygen furnaces, blast furnace stoves, open hearth furnaces and soaking pit furnaces, the word used in drawback item 1044 (now item number 97044-1) is \u201cconstruction\u201d; similarly, the word used to describe the making of bridges is \u201cconstruction\u201d in tariff item 460 (now item number 46000-1). Nor do the contracts for the installation of the precipitators use the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d, rather they use the words \u201cerect\u201d and \u201cinstall\u201d.\nIn the present case, the Board finds the work carried out at Copper Cliff, Ontario, to be assembly and erection rather than manufacture.\nAn appeal was then taken to the Exchequer Court. The right to appeal to that Court is limited, by s. 45(1) of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58, as enacted by Statutes of Canada, 1958, c. 26, s. 2(1), to a question of law.\nThe appeal was allowed. The reason for this decision is stated as follows:\nIn the absence of a finding by the Board either express or implied, that the precipitators had an existence outside Canada, then I am of the opinion that a finding that the precipitators were not \u201cmanufactured\u201d in Canada because they were merely \u201cassembled and erected\u201d in Canada, is wrong in law. I am of the opinion that the Board erred as a matter of law in concluding, as they did, that if what was done in Canada can properly be described as assembly and erection, it follows that the ultimate article was not manufactured in Canada. Where the article never existed until after the acts performed by the appellant on the site, then in my view, as a matter of law the article must be regarded as having been manufactured in Canada.\nIn Canadian Lift Truck Co. Ltd. v. Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise[3], Kellock J., speaking for the Court, said, at p. 498:\nThe question of law above propounded involves at least two questions, namely, the question as to whether or not the Tariff Board was properly instructed in law as to the construction of the statutory items, and the further question as to whether or not there was evidence which enabled the Board, thus instructed, to reach the conclusion it did.\nWhile the construction of a statutory enactment is a question of law, and the question as to whether a particular matter or thing is of such a nature or kind as to fall within the legal definition is a question of fact, nevertheless if it appears to the appellate Court that the tribunal of fact had acted either without any evidence or that no person, properly instructed as to the law and acting judicially, could have reached the particular determination, the Court may proceed on the assumption that a misconception of law has been responsible for the determination; Edwards v. Bairstow, (1955) 3 All E.R. 48.\nThe judgment of the Court below has held that the Tariff Board erred in construing the statutory items, because, as a matter of law, where the articles did not exist until after the acts performed at the site, they must be regarded as having been manufactured in Canada. It follows, from this proposition, that in every case, where fabricated parts are assembled in Canada into a whole, the article which then comes into existence must have been manufactured in Canada.\nWith respect, I am not prepared to accept this broad proposition when considering the meaning of the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d in the relevant tariff items under consideration. The assembly of parts may, in certain circumstances, constitute manufacture, but I do not agree that this must be so in all circumstances.\nThe Tariff Board, in its reasons, stated:\nIt will not, for the purposes of this appeal, seek to establish any definition of general application to all cases but rather to declare whether or not the actions performed in this case constituted manufacturing. For the respondent it was contended that the Tariff Board misdirected itself when it stated the issue to be whether what was done by Cottrell (Canada) constituted manufacture in Canada, and that the only issue was, in the words of the relevant tariff items, \u201cwere the materials used in the manufacture of\u201d the precipitators? But the tariff items must be read with s. 11(1) which authorizes drawbacks on materials \u201cwhen used for consumption in Canada for the purpose specified\u201d. In the light of that wording I think it was proper for the Tariff Board to decide whether the action of Cottrell (Canada) constituted manufacture of the precipitators in Canada.\nThe evidence before the Board showed that the agreement of Cottrell (Canada) with the Foundation Company was to supply and erect eight precipitators. They were designed and all components built or ordered by Cottrell Inc., to be delivered at the site. The erection was done by Noront, by agreement with Cottrell Inc.\nIn these circumstances I do not think it should be held, as a matter of law, that what Noront did at the site constituted manufacture by Cottrell (Canada) of eight precipitators. On the facts, it was open to the Board to find, as it did, that the assembly and erection of the fabricated components was not, in this case, manufacture within the meaning of the relevant tariff items.\nMy conclusion is that the Board did not misdirect itself as to the law, and that there was evidence on which its finding of fact could properly be made.\nThis being so, the appeal should be allowed, and the declaration of the Tariff Board restored, with costs to the appellant as against Cottrell (Canada), in this Court and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and PIGEON J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

The action arose out of an automobile accident, which occurred on June 15, 1964, when a motor vehicle owned by the defendant C, and operated by the defendant D, ran into the back of the motor vehicle of S while it was stopped at a stop street, causing personal injuries to S and property damage to her vehicle. The defendants alleged that the brakes of C\u2019s vehicle had failed owing to faulty repair work. D stated that C\u2019s automobile had been taken to the appellant\u2019s service station two or three days before the accident with instructions to examine and, if necessary, repair the braking system. After the vehicle was returned D drove it without difficulty up to the time when the accident occurred, when the brakes failed completely.\nAn application made on June 3, 1966, to add the appellant as a party defendant was resisted on the ground that any claim against the appellant was barred by s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, which provides that, subject to two provisoes not applicable here, \u201cno action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained\u201d. The judge of first instance was of the opinion that the subsection applied if the damages claimed were physically caused by the motor vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that the provision applied only if the legal basis of the claim is the use or operation of the motor vehicle.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal reversed. Per Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Hall and Spence JJ.: The subsection did not purport to apply only to causes of action of a particular nature. It did not refer to the use or operation of a motor vehicle. It stated specifically that no action shall be brought to recover damages occasioned by a motor vehicle. If a motor vehicle was the occasion for the damage, i.e., if it was the vehicle which brought it, about, then the limitation period applied.\nThere could be no question in this case but that the motor vehicle was the occasion for the damage sustained by the plaintiff. Any claim against the appellant would have to allege that her damage was caused by her vehicle being struck by that motor vehicle. That the nature of the negligence which would be alleged against the appellant would be different from that alleged against the other two defendants had no bearing, in view of the way in which the subsection is worded.\nDufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v.

Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nW.L.N. Somerville, Q.C., and D.J.S. McDowell, for the appellant.\nJ. Douglas Walker, for the respondent, Margaret Stewart.\nN. Douglas Coo, Q.C., for the respondents, Dias Domingos and Leonard Cordery.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, which allowed an appeal by the present respondent, Margaret Stewart, and which added the appellant as a party defendant in an action in which she is the plaintiff. The other respondents are defendants in that action.\nThe action arises out of an automobile accident, which occurred on June 15, 1964, when a motor vehicle owned by the defendant Cordery, and operated by the defendant Domingos, ran into the back of the motor vehicle of the plaintiff Stewart while it was stopped at a stop street, causing personal injuries to the plaintiff and property damage to her vehicle.\nThe writ of summons was issued on April 21, 1965, and was served on May 3, 1965. The statement of defence was delivered on June 17, 1965, alleging that the brakes of the defendant\u2019s vehicle had failed owing to faulty repair work.\nOn the examination for discovery of the defendant Domingos, held on March 21, 1966, he stated that the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle had been taken to the appellant\u2019s service station two or three days before the accident, with instructions to examine and, if necessary, repair the braking system. He also stated that, after the vehicle was returned, he drove it without difficulty up to the time the accident occurred, when the brakes failed completely.\nApplication to add the appellant as a party defendant was made on June 3, 1966. The application was resisted on the ground that any claim against the appellant was barred by s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172. Section 147 provides as follows:\n147. (1) Subject to subsections 2 and 3, no action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained.\n(2) Where death is caused, the action may be brought within the time limited by The Fatal Accidents Act.,\n(3) Notwithstanding subsections 1 and 2, when an action is brought within the time limited by this Act for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle and a counterclaim is made or third party proceedings are instituted by a defendant in respect of damages occasioned in the same accident, the lapse of time herein limited is not a bar to the counterclaim or third party proceedings.\nThe only question in issue is whether the plaintiff\u2019s damages were \u201coccasioned by a motor vehicle\u201d.\nThe learned judge of first instance was of the opinion that the subsection applied if the damages claimed were physically caused by the motor vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that the provision applied only if the legal basis of the claim is the use of operation of the motor vehicle.\nWith respect, I do not agree with this interpretation of the subsection. It does not purport to apply only to causes of action of a particular nature. It does not refer to the use or operation of a motor vehicle. It states specifically that no action shall be brought to recover damages occasioned by a motor vehicle. If a motor vehicle is the occasion for the damage, i.e., if it is the vehicle which brings it about, then the limitation period applies.\nThere can be no question in this case but that the motor vehicle in question was the occasion for the damage sustained by the plaintiff. Any claim against the appellant would have to allege that her damage was caused by her vehicle being struck by that motor vehicle. That the nature of the negligence which would be alleged against the appellant would be different from that alleged against the other two defendants has no bearing, in view of the way in which the subsection is worded.\nThe meaning of the section of The Highway Traffic Act which preceded the present s. 147 (R.S.O. 1927, c. 251, s. 53, as amended by 1930, c. 48, s. 11) was considered by this Court in Dufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger and Derbyshire[2]. The main question which had to be determined was as to whether the limitation section applied to a claim, founded in nuisance, for damage to a dwelling house through vibration caused by the operation of the defendant\u2019s cement mixing motor trucks in the street, in front of the house. It was held unanimously that the section applied.\nThe Court did not accept the contention that the section was not applicable to a claim at common law as distinct from a claim founded under the statute, or that it applied only to traffic accidents.\nIn holding that the section did apply, Davis J., with whom Duff C.J. and Hudson J. concurred, said, at p. 180:\nIt is difficult for me, therefore, to accept the contention that the limitation section (now sec. 60) in the statute is not applicable to this action. It very plainly states that, subject to two provisoes which do not affect this action,\nno action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained.\nThe rule of construction is plain:\nIf the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver.\nThis is the rule declared by the Judges in advising the House of Lords in the Sussex Peerage case, (1844) 11 Cl. & F. 85, at 143, which was accepted by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Cargo ex \u201cArgos\u201d, (1873) L.R. 5 P.C. 134, at 153, and recently referred to by Slesser, L.J., in Birmingham Corporation v. Barnes, [1934] 1 K.B. 484, at 500.\nCrockett J. and Kerwin J., as he then was, applied similar reasoning. I would refer to what is said by the latter at p.189:\nTaken by themselves the words used in this subsection are clear and unambiguous. In terms they are not limited to circumstances where damages are occasioned by a motor vehicle on a highway; they are not restricted to cases where damages are caused by a motor vehicle coming in contact with a person or thing; they do not state that the damages must have been occasioned by negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle or by reason of the violation of any of the provisions of the Act. It is contended on behalf of the respondents that the subsection must be construed in a narrower sense and that such a claim as the present, based as it is on an alleged nuisance at common law, is not within its purview.\nHe then went on, at p. 190, to reject that contention.\nI agree with this interpretation of the subsection and, in my opinion, in terms, it covers the circumstances in the present case. In fact, in the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the appellant clearly is founded upon the use and operation of a motor vehicle; i.e., one with defective brakes. Even if the provision applied only to damage resulting from the use and operation of a motor vehicle, this case would be within it, for there is nothing to say that its benefits accrue solely to a negligent operator, and not to someone whose negligence may have rendered such operation unsafe.\nI would allow the appeal, and reverse the order of the Court of Appeal, with costs to the appellant in this Court and in the Court below.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal. My opinion is that there is a valid distinction between this case and Dufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger and Derbyshire[3]. This was stated by the Court of Appeal in the following terms:\nIn dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s application to add Heppel as a party defendant, the learned County Judge relied on the case of Dufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger and Derbyshire, [1940] S.C.R. 174. In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was that his house was damaged by vibrations caused by operation of the defendant\u2019s heavy trucks on the adjoining highway. In the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action against Heppel is not in relation to the use or operation of the motor car. It is for negligence in the repair of a car owned by the defendant Cordery and operated by the defendant Domingos, so that, in so far as the claim against Heppel is concerned, while the car in a physical sense was the instrument inflicting the damage, the cause of the damage in the legal sense was the negligence, if proved, of Heppel in repairing the car and delivering it to the defendant Cordery in a state in which it might cause damage or injury not only to the defendants, but to other users of the highway.\nA motor car is an inanimate object that cannot cause damage unless it is used or operated. The Highway Traffic Act regulates the use and operation of motor vehicles and I think that the scope of s. 147(1) consistently with its setting in the Act, is limited to cases in which damage is occasioned as a result of the use or operation of a motor car and is not available to a defendant in a case such as the present one, where the allegation is that the accident was caused by the antecedent negligence of a repairer, who was neither the owner nor the operator of the motor car, any more than it would be available to a person sued for negligently shooting a motorist, whose car, as a result, caused damage to the person or property of another.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Borden, Elliot, Kelley & Palmer, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent; Margaret Stewart: Thompson, Brown, Proudfoot & Walker, London.\nSolicitors for the respondents, D. Domingos and L. Cordery: Shearer & Coo, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 37, 62 D.L.R. (2d) 282, sub nom. Stewart v. Domingos et al.\n[2] [1940] S.C.R. 174.\n[3] [1940] S.C.R. 174.\n"

His appeal by trial de novo was dismissed. He then appealed to the Court of Appeal where his submission that the information charged two offences was accepted. The Court of Appeal held that the information was bad for duplicity and that ss. 704(1) and 727(4) of the Code were not applicable. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nSection 222 of the Criminal Code does not create one offence of driving while intoxicated and another offence of driving while under the influence of a narcotic drug. The essence of the offence is driving while in a certain condition, there being two different ways in which the prohibited condition may be brought about. Consequently, there was no duplicity in the information.\nDroit criminel\u2014Conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur ou en avoir la garde, \u00e9tant en \u00e9tat d\u2019ivresse ou sous l\u2019influence d\u2019un narcotique\u2014S\u2019agit-il de deux infractions\u2014L\u2019acte d\u2019accusation est-il d\u00e9fectueux parce qu\u2019il est double\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 222, 492, 703, 704, 727.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable sur un acte d\u2019accusation l\u2019accusant d\u2019avoir conduit un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur ou d\u2019en avoir eu la garde alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat d\u2019ivresse ou sous l\u2019influence d\u2019un narcotique, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 222 du Code criminel.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan setting aside the respondent\u2019s conviction. Appeal allowed.\nSerge Kujaiva, for the appellant.\nLeslie R. Meiklejohn, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Urgel R. Brunet was convicted by a magistrate on the charge that he\non the 15th day of October, A.D. 1965, at Prince Albert, in the said Province, while intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic drug, did unlawfully have the care and control of a motor vehicle, to wit, a 1960 station wagon, on 6th Avenue East, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, contrary to the provisions of section 222 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nHis appeal by trial de novo was dismissed and he appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan where the only point raised was that the conviction could not stand because the information charged two offences.\nThe Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan accepted this submission and held that the information was bad for duplicity, and that ss. 704(1) and 727(4) of the Criminal Code were not applicable. The appeal was accordingly allowed.\nThis Court granted leave to appeal on the following grounds:\n(a) That the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan erred in law in holding that duplicity is not a defect as contemplated by s. 727(4) and s. 704(1) of the Criminal Code;\n(b) That the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan erred in law in quashing the conviction herein on the basis that the information is bad in law there being no such concept in criminal law; (c) That the said Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan erred in law in holding that there was in fact duplicity in the information herein.\nThe only question that arises on this appeal is whether there was, in fact, duplicity in this information. In my opinion there was not. This information follows the wording in s. 222 of the Criminal Code. That section does not create one offence of driving while intoxicated and another offence of driving while under the influence of a narcotic drug. The essence of the offence is driving while in a certain condition, there being two different ways in which the prohibited condition may be brought about. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are:\n492. (1) Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable offence therein specified.\n(2) The statement referred to in subsection (1) may be (b) in the words of the enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable offence, or\u2026\n703. No information, summons, conviction, order or process shall be deemed to charge two offences or to be uncertain by reason only that it states that the alleged offence was committed\n(a) in different modes, or\n(b) in respect of one or other of several articles, either conjunctively or disjunctively.\nRecent illustrations of the application of this principle are R. v. Schultz[1]; Cox and Paton v. The Queen[2]; and Kipp v. Attorney General for Ontario[3]. The case is distinct from Rex v. Archer[4].\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction. There is provision for the respondent\u2019s costs in the order granting leave to appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for Saskatchewan, Regina.\nSocilitor for the respondent: Koch, Meiklejohn & Scrivens, Regina.\n[1] (1962), 133 C.C.C. 174 at 182, 38 C.R. 76.\n[2] [1963] S.C.R. 500, 40 C.R. 52, 2 C.C.C. 148.\n[3] [1965] S.C.R. 57, 45 C.R. 1, 2 C.C.C. 133.\n[4] [1955] S.C.R. 33, 20 C.R. 181, 110 C.C.C. 321, 2 D.L.R. 621.\n"

They separated in 1958. It was agreed that the wife was entitled to half the value of the hotel, estimated at $90,000. Four documents were executed to implement the agreement reached. These documents included a separation agreement under which the wife agreed to accept a second mortgage for $45,000 on the hotel property in full settlement of all claims for an allowance from her husband and her dower rights. In 1961, the appellant sought to deduct, as alimony under the provisions of s. 11(1)(l) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, the monthly payments thereafter made by him to his wife under the agreement. The Minister disallowed the deduction and his contention, which had been reversed by the Income Tax Appeal Board, was upheld by the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe monthly payments did not fall within the terms of s. 11(1)(l) of the Income Tax Act. Reading the four documents together, it appeared that the agreement between the parties was not that the husband should pay his wife a periodic allowance for maintenance and that his agreement to do so should be collaterally secured by a second mortgage; it was rather a release by her of all her claims for an allowance and the giving by her of an irrevocable power of attorney to bar her dower in her husband\u2019s lands in exchange for a single consideration: the giving of the mortgage for $45,000. The obligation to make the payments under the mortgage was not dependent on the wife continuing to live. She was free to assign it at any time. The separation agreement terminated all claims arising from the status of the parties as husband and wife. The payments made thereafter were in satisfaction of obligations arising not as between husband and wife but as between mortgagor and mortgagee.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Pension alimentaire\u2014Paiements mensuels \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse s\u00e9par\u00e9e garantis par hypoth\u00e8que\u2014Sont-ils d\u00e9ductibles comme \u00e9tant une pension alimentaire\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 11(1)(l).\nL\u2019appelant \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un h\u00f4tel qu\u2019il exploitait depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es avec l\u2019aide de son \u00e9pouse.

Andrew Brewin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nM.A. Mogan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment[2] of Cattanach J. allowing an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board and upholding the contention of the Minister that the appellant was not entitled to deduct from his income for his 1961 taxation year the sum of $3,150 paid by him to his wife in nine monthly instalments.\nThe question to be determined is whether the payments made by the appellant fell within the terms of clause (l) of s. 11(1) of the Income Tax Act which reads as follows:\n(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year: \u2026\n(l) an amount paid by the taxpayer in the year, pursuant to a decree, order or judgment of a competent tribunal or pursuant to a written agreement, as alimony or other allowance payable on a periodic basis for the maintenance of the recipient thereof, children of the marriage, or both the recipient and children of the marriage, if he was living apart from, and was separated pursuant to a divorce, judicial separation or written separation agreement from, his spouse or former spouse to whom he was required to make the payment at the time the payment was made and throughout the remainder of the year.\nIt is common ground that, during the relevant period, the appellant was living apart from and was separated from his wife pursuant to a written separation agreement and that during the taxation year in question he made nine payments of $350 each to her. The dispute is as to whether these amounts were paid \u201cpursuant to\u2026 a written agreement as alimony or other allowance payable on a periodic basis for the maintenance of the recipient thereof\u201d, these being the words of s. 11(1) (l) relied on by the appellant.\nIt is necessary to state the facts in some detail. The appellant and his wife were married in 1929 and lived together as man and wife until they separated some time in 1957 or 1958. From 1944 to 1947 the appellant was, with his brother, the joint owner of a hotel in Chelmsford, Ontario, known as the Algoma Hotel. In 1947 the appellant purchased his brother\u2019s interest and became and remains the sole owner of the hotel. The appellant and his wife lived together at the hotel until the time of their separation. The wife kept the books of the business, looked after the kitchen and dining room and the rental of the bedrooms. The appellant looked after the beverage rooms. The appellant kept the beverage room receipts; the wife kept the other hotel receipts and applied them either on expenses or improvements or for her own use and maintenance. At the time of the separation the hotel was valued at $90,000 to $100,000. The wife taught school at various times during her married life and contributed an undetermined amount of her earnings toward the upkeep and improvement of the hotel.\nIn 1958 the parties agreed to separate. The wife retained Mr. J.L. McMahon as her solicitor. On August 7, 1958, the appellant and his wife went to Mr. McMahon\u2019s office. The appellant was not independently represented. Four documents were drawn by Mr. McMahon and signed either then or later by the appellant and his wife. These documents were attached as schedules to a joint statement of facts on behalf of the parties, which was filed at the hearing in the Exchequer Court.\nThe first document is headed \u201cMemorandum of Agreement between Dorila Trottier and Yvonne Trottier\u201d. It was signed and sealed by both parties in the presence of Mr. McMahon on August 7, 1958. So far as relevant it reads:\nIt is agreed that the parties will sign a Separation Agreement when the first payment of ($12,000.00) Twelve Thousand Dollars, on a mortgage to Yvonne Trottier is made. The Separation Agreement shall include the mortgage given by Dorila Trottier to Yvonne Trottier for Forty-Five Thousand ($45,000.00) Dollars, dated the 7th day of August, 1958, in full settlement. Yvonne Trottier will sign a permanent Bar of Dower.\nThe second document is a Charge under the Land Titles Act on the hotel property made by the appellant to his wife. It provides for payment of $45,000 with interest at 5 per cent per annum. The wording of the payment clause is as follows:\nPROVIDED THIS CHARGE TO BE VOID on payment of the said sum of\u2014FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND\u2014($45,000.00)\u201400\/00 dollars in lawful money of Canada, with interest at FIVE (5%) per cent. per annum as follows:\nTHE sum of Twelve Thousand Dollars ($12,000.00) shall be paid when the proceeds of a first mortgage loan to Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation dated July 29th, 1958, are available, or within one month from the date of execution of the Charge, which ever is the sooner. The balance of Thirty-Three Thousand ($33,000.00) Dollars shall be paid in equal consecutive monthly instalments of Three Hundred and Fifty ($350.00) Dollars, including interest, commencing on the 1st day of October, 1958, and on the 1st day of each and every month thereafter until all arrears of principal and interest monies hereby secured are fully paid and satisfied. The interest at the rate of Five per cent (5%) per annum shall be calculated half yearly, not in advance, on the unpaid balance of principal outstanding. Not withstanding, anything written above the interest shall not be calculated at any time on a principal sum greater than Twenty-One Thousand ($21,000.00) Dollars. Such monthly instalments when received by the mortgagee shall be applied firstly on account of interest and interest in arrears, if any, and secondly upon the unpaid balance of the Principal. The interest payable shall be calculated from the 1st day of September, 1958.\nThe Charge contains the following clause:\nPROVIDED the Mortgagors, when not in default, shall have the privilege of paying the whole or any part of the mortgage money hereby secured without notice or bonus at any time.\nIt also contains an acceleration clause providing that on default of payment of any instalment the balance of the principal shall at the option of the mortgagee become due and payable.\nThe third document is a direction, signed by the appellant, directing the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation to pay $12,165 to Yvonne Trottier out of the first mortgage on the hotel property made to that company.\nThe fourth document is headed \u201cSeparation Agreement\u201d. It is dated August 7, 1958, and executed under seal by the appellant and his wife. It was signed in the month of October 1958 when the wife received the payment of $12,000 provided for in the Charge.\nParagraph 7 provides for payments of $50 a month by the husband to the wife for the maintenance of their daughter \u201cfor a period of two years or until such time as her education is completed\u201d. No issue is raised as to this paragraph.\nThe only other provision in the agreement dealing with payment is para. 2, which reads as follows:\nThe wife accepts in full settlement a second mortgage upon the property known as Lot number (2) TWO, in the Fourth concession in the Township of Balfour, for the sum of Forty-Five Thousand ($45,000.00) Dollars in full settlement of all claims for an allowance for herself from her husband. This is provided the convenants in the mortgage are observed.\nThe main contention of the appellant is that the separation agreement and the mortgage must be read together and, so read, constitute an agreement imposing upon the appel- lant an obligation to make payments of an allowance on a periodic basis for the maintenance of his wife, within the terms of s. 11(1)(l).\nI agree that these documents which were prepared contemporaneously and relate to the same transaction should be read together; but, so reading them, it appears that the agreement between the parties was not that the husband should pay his wife a periodic allowance for maintenance and that his agreement to do so should be collaterally secured by a second mortgage; it was rather a release by her of all her claims for an allowance and the giving by her (in para. 4 of the agreement) of an irrevocable power of attorney to bar her dower in her husband\u2019s lands in exchange for a single consideration, the giving of the mortgage for $45,000. The obligation to make the payments under the mortgage was not dependent on the wife continuing to live. She was free to assign it at any time.\nThe giving of the mortgage was analogous to the payment of a lump sum by which once and for all the husband was released from liability to support his wife. The mortgage was given because the husband was not in a position to pay the lump sum in cash. While the facts differ from those in Minister of National Revenue v. Armstrong[3], the case at bar appears to me to fall within the principle on which that case was decided.\nParagraph 2 of the separation agreement has already been quoted. Paragraph 1 reads as follows:\n1. The husband and wife will henceforth live separate from each other, and neither of them will take proceedings of any kind against the other for restitution of conjugal rights, or molest or annoy or in any way interefere with the other or make any demands whatsoever upon the other arising from their status as husband and wife.\nThe agreement, in consideration of the giving of the mortgage, terminates all claims arising from the status of the parties as husband and wife. The payments made thereafter were in satisfaction of obligations arising not as between husband and wife but as between mortgagor and mortgagee.\nIt may be observed in passing that part of each monthly payment was made up of interest on the capital sum which the appellant had undertaken to pay. On a consideration of the documents, read together and without giving effect to any extrinsic evidence, it is my opinion that the appeal fails and it becomes unnecessary to consider the alternative argument of counsel for the respondent that the payments agreed to be made by the appellant were not for maintenance but in satisfaction of the wife\u2019s claim that she was entitled to a fair share in the hotel property. That this was so was deposed to by the wife and it was submitted by counsel for the respondent that, even if her evidence would have the effect of varying the wording of the documents, it was admissible on the principle stated as follows in Phipson on Evidence, 10th ed., at p. 724, para. 1789:\nWhere a transaction has been reduced into writing merely by agreement of the parties, extrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the writing is excluded only in proceedings between such parties or their privies, and not in those between strangers, or a party and a stranger; since strangers cannot be precluded from proving the truth by the ignorance, carelessness or fraud of the parties; nor, in proceedings between a party and a stranger will the former be estopped, since there would be no mutuality.\nHowever, as mentioned above, I do not find it necessary to deal with this branch of the argument.\nWhile I have stated my reasons in my own words, I wish to express my substantial agreement with the reasons of Cattanach J.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hawkins & Gratton, Sudbury.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

Their intention was to camp along the route and the plaintiff supplied the larger portion of the necessary camping equipment. They agreed to share all food and other costs, and in so far as the costs of gas and oil were concerned it was decided that the defendant would obtain a credit card and at the end of the trip the plaintiff would pay to the defendant one-half of the amount payable to the oil company. They also arranged to take turns in driving the car.\nSome hours after they had left on their journey the car turned over on a curve due to the defendant\u2019s negligent driving and the plaintiff was seriously injured. The plaintiff sued claiming damages for the said negligence and at trial judgment was given in his favour. On appeal, the Court of Appeal by a majority reversed the trial judgment. An appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. The arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendant was not an arrangement of a commercial nature and therefore the defendant was not within the exception in s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172. The said s. 105(2) prevented the plaintiff\u2019s recovery from the defendant.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Judson J., dissenting: The many cases in which s. 105 of The Highway Traffic Act, supra, has been considered established the rule that a driver, who by negligent driving causes injuries to a passenger in his car, is not relieved from liability if there is a. contract in existence between the driver and the passenger by the terms of which the passenger is under a legal obligation to pay the driver for carrying him. In the present case there was an arrangement under which an enforceable obligation to pay was assumed by the passenger.\n[Ouelette v. Johnson, [1963] S.C.R. 96, referred to.] APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of King J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Judson J. dissenting.\nBernard L. Eastman, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC.F. McKeon, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Judson J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are undisputed. They are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence.\nThe only question to be decided is whether the respondent is relieved, by the terms of s. 105 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, from liability for the damages caused to the appellant by the negligent driving of the respondent.\nSince the predecessor of that section was first enacted, by 1935 (Ont.), c. 26, s. 11, it has been considered in many cases, one of the most recent being Ouelette v. Johnson[2].\nIn my opinion, these cases establish the rule that a driver, who by negligent driving causes injuries to a passenger in his car, is not relieved from liability if there is a contract in existence between the driver and the passenger by the terms of which the passenger is under a legal obligation to pay the driver for carrying him. This rule is applicable although the agreement to pay relates to a single and isolated journey and the driver is not otherwise engaged in the business of carrying passengers for compensation and regardless of the manner in which the amount to be paid is to be calculated.\nIn the case at bar I think it clear that the appellant had undertaken to pay to the respondent one-half of the amount which the respondent would become liable to pay for the gas and oil used on the journey which the appellant and respondent were taking in the automobile belonging to the respondent. The circumstance that the object of that journey was pleasure and not business appears to me to be irrelevant. I find myself unable to distinguish the case at bar from that of Ouelette v. Johnson, supra. It may be that the choice of the phrase \u201can arrangement of a commercial nature\u201d in that case was not a particularly happy one but read in context it is equivalent to \u201can arrangement under which an enforceable obligation to pay is assumed by the passenger\u201d.\nFor these reasons and those given by Laskin J.A. in the Court of Appeal, with which I am in complete agreement, I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] pronounced on April 10, 1967. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial which had been in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $9,754.55; the interest on that amount prior to the decision of the Court of Appeal brought the total within the appealable limit to this Court.\nThe facts may be simply stated. The plaintiff and the defendant were fellow students in accounting working in the same office in the City of Toronto. Neither one of them was affluent and neither one owned a car, but both planned to purchase automobiles. From some time in the spring of the year 1963, the two young men had discussed the possibility of taking a motor holiday together. Neither one of them could afford to go away on such a holiday alone. The respondent Maclntyre purchased a Triumph TR.3 sports car and it was agreed that that would be the vehicle which they would use on their intended trip. As the appellant put it in the evidence, \u201cat that time when we discussed it, we were going to take Neil\u2019s car. I did not have a car at the time\u201d. The two agreed that they would travel by automobile from Toronto easterly through Kingston to Montreal, on to Quebec City, and then down through the eastern United States to the Atlantic Seaboard, and return through the United States to Toronto, their point of commencement. Each of them supplied certain equipment. Since it was their intention to camp along the route, equipment for that purpose was necessary, and the appellant seems to have supplied the larger portion of that equipment. They agreed that they would share equally the costs of food on the way; as each put it in his evidence, one at trial and the other on examination for discovery, it was just about who would get his wallet out first. As they agreed to share equally all other costs, they agreed to share equally the costs of the gas and oil. Again, quoting the appellant, \u201cfor the transportation, well, it was arranged that Neil was to get a credit card and at the end of the trip we were going to split gas and oil costs on a 50\u201150 basis of the actual cost of the trip. If there had been any major repairs, well, we would have\u2014would have\u2014probably kicked in. If there was, we would each have paid part of it\u201d. It was further arranged that both of them would drive the car just as their particular desire of the moment dictated.\nThe trip was to be solely for vacation purposes, there being no commercial purpose to be served. Again, quoting the appellant, \u201cand, well, I guess being friends, and there was a fair cost involved, we had to make an arrangement or deal so that we could have gone on the trip\u201d.\nThe respondent obtained his credit card from the oil company; the two men packed their goods and in midmorning on July 15, 1963, left Toronto on their holiday. For the first 100 or so miles, the respondent drove, then they stopped, purchased gasoline using the credit card on that occasion, and changed drivers so that the appellant drove from that point, which was evidently somewhat west of Kingston, to Cornwall. During the trip, they had stopped on several occasions to purchase refreshments at small cost and sometimes one and sometimes the other paid for those refreshments. In Cornwall, having had a cup of coffee, they again changed drivers so that the respondent resumed the driving of the automobile. About fifteen miles east of Cornwall, the car turned over on a curve and the appellant was seriously injured.\nThe learned trial judge held, and there has been no appeal from this finding, that the accident occurred solely due to the negligence of the respondent. The appellant sued claiming damages for such negligence. It is, therefore, apparent that the sole question to be determined upon this appeal is whether or not the appellant is entitled to such damages in view of the provisions of s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172. That section provides:\n105 (1) The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle on a highway unless the motor vehicle was without the owner\u2019s consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner is liable to the same extent as the owner.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from the motor vehicle.\nThat section and its predecessors have been the subject of many judgments in the Courts of the Province of Ontario and other sections with like intent have been the subject of decisions in the Courts of many of the other provinces. I see, however, no need to quote and analyze those many judgments, in view of the fact that this Court only in 1963 has authoritatively pronounced its interpretation. The judgment in Ouelette v. Johnson[4] was recognized by both the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal in this case as being such an authoritative pronouncement upon the subject, and both the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal sought to apply it to the circumstances which I have outlined above. In that case Ouelette, Johnson and one Kennefic, were all employees of the Consolidated Denison Mine in Elliott Lake, in the Province of Ontario, and they all lived in Sudbury. During the week they resided near the mine head in accommodation provided by the company but they desired to return home each week-end. Johnson and Kennefic had from time to time travelled with one Dionne in the latter\u2019s automobile who charged them $2 each one way for the trip. When Ouelette purchased an automobile, Johnson approached him and proposed that the two should make the same arrangement. Ouelette, on several occasions after he had purchased his automobile, had travelled to Sudbury alone. The trial judge found as a fact that the arrangement for the $2 charge one way for the trip was made not in relation to the cost of the gas and oil but rather because Johnson had paid the same amount to Dionne previously. During a trip by Ouelette, with Johnson and Kennefic as his passengers under this arrangement, an accident occurred due solely to the negligence of Ouelette. As in the present case, the only issue in this Court was whether or not Ouelette\u2019s liability was prevented by the provisions of the same s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act. Cartwright J. (as he then was) said at p. 100:\nIn my opinion the principle enunciated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Lemieux v. Bedard, [1953] O.R. 837, is correct. It is accurately summarized in the headnote as follows:\nOne who enters into an agreement to transport other persons in the automobile on a particular journey, in return for payment of an agreed sum of money, and proceeds to carry out the agreement, makes it his business on that occasion to carry passengers for compensation, and will not be relieved by s. 50(2) (now s. 105(2)) of The Highway Traffic Act from liability for his negligence, even if there is no evidence that he has engaged in the business on any other occasion.\nThis principle applies a fortiori to the case at bar in which the arrangement was carried out week after week.\nI do not wish to be understood as approving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Csehi v. Dixon, [1953] O.W.N. 238, 2 D.L.R. 202. In that case the Court accepted the decision in Wing v. Banks but found themselves able to distinguish it on the ground that the amount of the fixed fee agreed to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant for transporting him was arrived at by estimating a portion of the cost of the gasoline and oil used by the defendant. In my respectful view, once it has been determined that the arrangement between the parties was of a commercial nature the manner in which the amount of the fee to be paid was decided upon becomes irrelevant.\nI would dismiss both appeals with costs.\nI point out that the tests as put in that judgment occurring in the last few lines is this, that once it has been determined that the arrangement between the parties was of a commercial nature the manner in which the amount of the fee to be paid was decided becomes irrelevant. The question to be resolved, therefore, is whether under the circumstances outlined above \u201cthe arrangement between the parties was of a commercial nature\u201d. It must be remembered that if it is found that such an arrangement was of a commercial nature then it is a finding that the respondent was \u201cin the business of carrying passengers for compensation\u201d. I use the words of subs. (2) of s. 105 of The Highway Traffic Act. I am unable to regard the evidence in this case, and which I have outlined in some detail above, as showing that there had occurred \u201can arrangement of a commercial nature\u201d. With respect, I share the views enunciated in the Court of Appeal for Ontario by Evans J.A. There was, in my opinion, no element of a contract of carriage. The arrangement, rather, in my view, was that of a joint adventure, not, in this particular case, an adventure in trade but an adventure in recreation. It would seem to me that every word of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is corroborative of that view. As I have pointed out above, the plaintiff (here appellant) did not testify that the respondent took his car, he testified, \u201cWe were going to take Neil\u2019s car\u201d. I emphasize the word \u201cwe\u201d. Then the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in reference to the obtaining of the credit card was not that the respondent obtained a credit card and that he then charged to the appellant one-half of the amount which would be payable on the account but rather, and again I quote, \u201c\u2026it was arranged that Neil was to get a credit card and at the end of the trip we were going to split the gas and oil costs on a 50-50 basis of actual cost of the trip\u201d. It was the arrangement of the two of them that the respondent should obtain the credit card; since the car was his the credit card would naturally be carried in his name, but it was surely only for the purpose of keeping the account in a convenient form, not so one could charge the other but so they could both pay the same amount toward the discharge of the amount payable to the oil company. As the appellant said time after time, \u201cWe were to split\u201d. The arrangement as to the driving of the vehicle, although in no way conclusive, is another indication of the intent of the arrangement, for, again, the plaintiff said, \u201cWe were going to share driving depending on whoever got tired\u201d. All other costs of the trip were to be shared, or to use the words of the litigant, \u201csplit\u201d in the same fashion; those costs being of smaller individual amounts, it was easy enough to divide them informally and the more formal method of the credit card was necessary to keep proper account of the largest cost which the two of them in their joint adventure would incur, that is, the cost of the gasoline and oil for use in the respondent\u2019s automobile.\nFor these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the arrangement between the appellant and the respondent was not \u201can arrangement of a commercial nature\u201d and s. 105 of The Highway Traffic Act by subs. (2) prevents the appellant\u2019s recovery from the respondent. Counsel for the appellant stressed that the finding of the learned trial judge that the \u201carrangement was of a commercial character\u201d was a finding of fact which should not be disturbed on appeal. It must be remembered that in the present case there is not the slightest conflict of testimony. The evidence was given on behalf of the plaintiff alone and the evidence, so far as the present topic is concerned, consisted of the examination and cross\u2011examination of the plaintiff and a reading by his counsel of excerpts from the cross-examination of the defendant (the present respondent). Not only is there no question of credibility, but there is no question of what the evidence, and all the evidence, was, and, in my view, the Court of Appeal was quite entitled, considering that uncontradicted evidence, to come to a conclusion which differed from that of the trial judge as to the nature of the arrangement.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Du Vernet, Carruthers, Beard and Eastman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: McGarry & McKeon, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 169, 62 D.L.R.

The agreement defined the total value of the granite contract as follows: \u201cthe value of the contract being based upon the total cost of the granite delivered to the job, and including all costs except the actual cost of installing the granite on the building\u201d. The trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to 4 per cent of the cladding contract (that is, for the facing of the building) less the cost of installation of the cladding. The remuneration payable to the plaintiff upon this basis was $22,570.46. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to 4 per cent of the granite (in the form of granite chip or granite slab) delivered to the job, less the cost of installation of the granite. The remuneration payable to the plaintiff on this basis was $574.80.

The antenna was some 7 feet high and over 13 feet wide. The wire was some 11 feet away from the part of the roof where the plaintiff was situated when the accident occurred. The installation of that power line had been authorized by the Provincial Electricity Board and, as prescribed by the Board, complied with the National Electrical Safety Code of the U.S. The evidence showed that the clearance required, under the regulations of Hydro-Quebec, between a building and that kind of line was greater than that required by the said Code. The trial judge apportioned the liability at 75 per cent against the defendant company and 25 per cent against the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The defendant company should not be considered to have been in breach of the duty to maintain a reasonable clearance between its line and the house merely because another electrical transmission company adopted a different standard. Assuming, however, that the Hydro-Quebec standards ought to apply, the defendant was not required reasonably to anticipate injury to a person located more than 11 feet from its line. In the circumstance of this case, it was not an undue proximity of the defendant\u2019s line to the house which was the effective cause of the accident.\nPer Pigeon J.: The trial judge did not err in holding that the plaintiff had been at fault. The latter\u2019s imprudence was unquestionable. On the other hand, the defendant company could not be considered to have committed a fault merely because it did not follow the standards established by Hydro-Quebec. The evidence does not disclose that these standards were generally considered as the only ones acceptable.\nFaute\u2014Fil \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 haute tension\u2014Installation par un gar\u00e7on de 16 ans d\u2019une antenne de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision sur le toit d\u2019une maison\u2014Contact de l\u2019antenne avec le fil\u2014Absence de responsabilit\u00e9 de la compagnie d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\u2014Code civil, art. 1053. Le demandeur, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 16 ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019une antenne de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qu\u2019il avait entrepris d\u2019installer sur le toit de la maison de son p\u00e8re est venue en contact avec un fil \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 haute tension appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse. L\u2019antenne avait 7 pieds de haut et plus de 13 pieds de large. La partie du toit de la maison o\u00f9 se trouvait le demandeur quand il a re\u00e7u le choc n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 moins de 11 pieds du fil charg\u00e9. L\u2019installation du fil avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et, tel que prescrit par la R\u00e9gie, \u00e9tait conforme au National Electrical Safety Code des \u00c9tats-Unis. La preuve est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec exigeait que la distance entre un immeuble et un fil de ce genre devait \u00eatre plus grande que celle exig\u00e9e par ledit Code. Le Juge au proc\u00e8s a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu faute commune et a fait porter \u00e0 la victime un quart de la responsabilit\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action. Le demandeur en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: On ne peut pas consid\u00e9rer que la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de maintenir un espace libre raisonnable entre son fil et la maison pour la seule raison qu\u2019une autre compagnie d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 une norme diff\u00e9rente. Cependant, prenant pour acquis que les normes de l\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec doivent s\u2019appliquer, on ne pouvait pas raisonnablement exiger que la d\u00e9fenderesse pr\u00e9voie qu\u2019une personne plac\u00e9e \u00e0 plus de 11 pieds de sa ligne pourrait \u00eatre bless\u00e9e. Dans les circonstances, la cause effective de l\u2019accident n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la proximit\u00e9 indue du fil de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nLe Juge Pigeon: Le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas fait erreur en statuant que le demandeur avait commis une faute. L\u2019imprudence de ce dernier est incontestable. Par contre, la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en faute du seul fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas suivi les normes \u00e9tablies par l\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que ces normes \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme les seules acceptables.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], infirmant un jugement du Juge Laroche. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Laroche J. Appeal dismissed.\nGeorges Emery, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nCharles Gonthier, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by MARTLAND J.:\u2014The facts in this case are fully outlined in the reasons of my brother, Pigeon, and do not require to be repeated here.\nI agree with the reasons delivered by Mr. Justice Choquette, in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side)[2], with which the other four members of that Court agreed.\nMy brother, Pigeon, points out that it was stated, in those reasons, that the clearance required, under the regulations of Hydro-Quebec, between a building and an electrical transmission line with a voltage exceeding 4,000 volts was 8\u20196\u201d, whereas the clearance actually required by those regulations, for a voltage of 7,200, was 10\u201911\u201d.\nThe evidence on this matter was given by the witness, Godin. Choquette J. refers to this testimony in the following passage from his judgment:\nCet expert dit, p. 250: \u00abLa norme\u2026 pour un circuit \u00e0 4000 volts\u2026 veut que l\u2019espacement soit de 8\u20196\u201d d\u2019une b\u00e2tisse, sans exception.\u00bb (Ce sont l\u00e0 les normes de l\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, qui diff\u00e8rent de celles du National Electrical Safety Code.)\nIt is of interest to note that, later in his evidence, Godin was asked about this matter again and testified as follows:\nQ. Apr\u00e8s tout ce que vous avez dit, l\u00e0, \u00e0 quelle distance doit \u00eatre un fil de la maison que vous voyez sur la photographie, s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fil monophas\u00e9 portant quatre mille (4,000) volts et plus?\nR. Nos normes indiquent huit pieds et six pouces (8\u20196\u201d), approximativement.\nOn the other hand, in the material before us there appeared, as Exhibit P-21, a graph entitled \u201cNormes de Construction de Lignes de Transmission de l\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec\u201d, which indicates a clearance requirement of 10\u201911\u201d for a line with a force of 7,200 volts.\nOn the basis of the plan of the house prepared by the witness, Lindsey, which was put in evidence, and placing the electrical transmission wire at the location shown by him, a computation discloses that the distance from the wire, at its nearest point, to the base of the old aerial (where the appellant was situated) was some 11\u00bd\u2019. Assuming the electrical wire was situated in the position stated by the appellant\u2019s witness, Gaudreau, that distance would be slightly greater. I agree with my brother Pigeon that the respondent should not be considered to have been in breach of the duty to maintain a reasonable clearance between its line and the house merely because another electrical transmission company adopted a different standard.\nBut, even assuming that the Hydro-Quebec rules ought to be applied to determine the requisite clearance from a building in locating the respondent\u2019s electrical transmission line, the reasoning of Choquette J. applies whether that standard called for a clearance of 8\u20196\u201d or 10\u201911\u201d. The respondent was not required reasonably to anticipate injury to a person located more than 11 feet from its line. In the circumstances of this case, it was not an undue proximity of the respondent\u2019s line to the house which was the effective cause of the accident.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal, with costs.\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu invalide par un choc \u00e9lectrique qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u le 7 mai 1958, alors qu\u2019\u00e2g\u00e9 de 16 ans, il avait entrepris d\u2019installer au-dessus d\u2019une antenne de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision fix\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison de son p\u00e8re, une seconde antenne destin\u00e9e \u00e0 permettre la r\u00e9ception d\u2019\u00e9missions sur le canal 4.\nPour faire cette op\u00e9ration le demandeur avait d\u2019abord gagn\u00e9 le toit de la v\u00e9randa en partant du balcon. L\u00e0, accroupi \u00e0 genoux, il avait saisi l\u2019antenne que son beau-fr\u00e8re lui avait tendue d\u2019en bas. Celui-ci \u00e9tant rentr\u00e9 dans la maison, le demandeur a grimp\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre pattes une distance de quelques pieds sur le toit de la maison inclin\u00e9 \u00e0 40\u00b0, il s\u2019y est assis les jambes repli\u00e9es devant lui et chauss\u00e9 de bottes de caoutchouc, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019antenne existante dont le support \u00e0 sa gauche \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 la corniche et s\u2019\u00e9levait environ 4 pieds au-dessus du toit. Il a alors pris la nouvelle antenne \u00e0 deux mains pour la soulever afin de pouvoir ensuite en ins\u00e9rer la tige dans le support de l\u2019autre.\nLa nouvelle antenne \u00e9tait un objet fort encombrant fait de tubes d\u2019aluminium. Elle se composait d\u2019une tige de 7\u20191\u00bd\u201d destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre plac\u00e9e en position verticale et au sommet de laquelle \u00e9tait fix\u00e9e perpendiculairement par le milieu une autre tige mesurant 13\u20197\u00bd\u201d. Cette tige horizontale \u00e9tait garnie de 9 barres transversales espac\u00e9es presque r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 partir de chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 et mesurant environ 4\u2019 de longueur. Ces barres transversales \u00e9taient \u00e9galement perpendiculaires \u00e0 la tige verticale de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 se trouver, une fois celle-ci fix\u00e9e au support vertical, dans le m\u00eame plan horizontal que la tige les supportant.\nEn face de la maison, il y avait une ligne de distribution d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique comprenant deux conducteurs, un fil charg\u00e9 \u00e0 7,200 volts tendu \u00e0 environ vingt-cinq pieds du sol, et quelque trois pieds plus bas, un fil reli\u00e9 \u00e0 la terre. Il y avait \u00e9galement fix\u00e9s aux m\u00eames poteaux, six ou sept pieds plus bas, deux fils t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Tous ces fils se trouvaient \u00e0 une faible distance en avant de la maison et couraient dans une direction \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s parall\u00e8le \u00e0 la fa\u00e7ade. La distance mesur\u00e9e horizontalement entre le fil charg\u00e9 et la corniche du toit du balcon \u00e0 la hauteur de laquelle il se trouvait, \u00e9tait d\u2019un peu moins de 6 pieds d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019arpenteur de la compagnie intim\u00e9e alors que d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur de l\u2019appelant, cette distance serait d\u2019environ 4\u00bd pieds. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que ce fil charg\u00e9 se trouvait un peu plus haut que le sommet de la tige verticale de l\u2019antenne existante et \u00e0 9.35 pieds de distance horizontale. Il se trouvait \u00e9galement \u00e0 quelque 11 pieds du toit \u00e0 la base de cette antenne.\nEn partant des mesures ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9es, on voit combien il \u00e9tait difficile pour l\u2019appelant de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 soulever la nouvelle antenne plus haut que les fils sans accident. Les photographies vers\u00e9es au dossier font voir que la tige horizontale de l\u2019antenne existante s\u2019avan\u00e7ait en biais au-dessus du toit en s\u2019en rapprochant derri\u00e8re l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le demandeur y \u00e9tait assis et cette tige \u00e9tait comme l\u2019autre garnie de barres transversales mais d\u2019une longueur moindre. Il est donc \u00e9vident que le demandeur ne pouvait pas reculer plus loin sur le toit au moment o\u00f9 il soulevait la nouvelle antenne. M\u00eame s\u2019il la pla\u00e7ait dans la position la plus favorable, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la tige horizontale parall\u00e8le aux fils \u00e9lectriques, il ne pouvait \u00e9viter de passer tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s. En effet, les barres transversales de quatre pieds de longueur ajoutaient plusieurs pouces aux 7 pieds de la tige verticale. De plus, le demandeur devait n\u00e9cessairement tenir la nouvelle antenne devant lui alors que l\u2019autre dans son dos l\u2019emp\u00eachait de reculer. Cela pla\u00e7ait l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la tige \u00e0 au moins un pied du toit ce qui, th\u00e9oriquement, laissait quand m\u00eame un espace suffisant. Mais il semble bien que ce n\u2019est pas ce que le demandeur a fait si l\u2019on tient compte de ce qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident l\u2019antenne, comme des photographies le d\u00e9montrent, s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e \u00e0 rester accroch\u00e9e au fil inf\u00e9rieur par la barre transversale d\u2019une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9. De plus, le demandeur a dit qu\u2019il regardait \u00able bout\u00bb de l\u2019antenne pour ne pas toucher aux fils. S\u2019il avait tenu la tige horizontale parall\u00e8le aux fils, il aurait d\u00fb regarder les deux bouts. Il est donc pratiquement certain que le malheureux a tenu l\u2019antenne de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 placer cette tige dans une position presque perpendiculaire aux fils \u00e9lectriques. En faisant l\u2019op\u00e9ration de cette mani\u00e8re, le demandeur devait presque fatalement subir le terrible accident dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. En effet, l\u2019hypot\u00e9nuse du triangle form\u00e9 par la tige verticale de l\u2019antenne (7\u20191\u00bd\u201d) et la moiti\u00e9 de la tige horizontale (\u00bd de 13\u20197\u00bd\u201d) atteint bien pr\u00e8s de 10 pieds.\nLe demandeur a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 il regardait le bout de l\u2019antenne pour ne pas toucher au fil et que celui-ci s\u2019en trouvait \u00e0 \u00bd\u201d \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s. Il est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vident que personne ne peut dans les conditions o\u00f9 se faisait cette op\u00e9ration, appr\u00e9cier avec exactitude une distance de cet ordre. L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur \u00e9lectricien, t\u00e9moin expert de la demande, ayant relev\u00e9 \u00e0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de l\u2019antenne \u00abune marque qui peut indiquer un court circuit\u00bb, il faut en d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il y a eu contact avec le fil charg\u00e9. Il est \u00e9galement clair qu\u2019un fort courant a alors travers\u00e9 le demandeur, la r\u00e9sistance de son corps \u00e9tant d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve environ 1,000 ohms alors que le fil \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 \u00e0 7,200 volts. L\u2019intensit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9charge a fait sauter le fusible de 10 amp\u00e8res qui prot\u00e9geait la ligne, le demandeur a \u00e9chapp\u00e9 l\u2019antenne et il est tomb\u00e9 sur le sol.\nEn Cour sup\u00e9rieure, le proc\u00e8s a port\u00e9 uniquement sur la responsabilit\u00e9, le montant des dommages subis \u00e9tant fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $45,000 par admission des parties. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu qu\u2019il y avait faute commune et fait porter \u00e0 la victime un quart de la responsabilit\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action.\nIl est \u00e9vident que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas fait erreur en statuant que le demandeur avait commis une faute. L\u2019imprudence de ce dernier est incontestable.\nDe m\u00eame il faut dire aussi que c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que le premier juge a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait \u00eatre question en l\u2019occurrence de la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait de la chose (1054 c.c.). Tout en ne niant pas que l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une chose au sens de cet article, il faut dire que notre jurisprudence est depuis longtemps fix\u00e9e dans le sens suivant: cette responsabilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux dommages caus\u00e9s par le fait autonome de la chose. Comme le dit le juge Anglin dans Curley c. Latreille[3]:\nResponsibility for damage caused by a thing which he has under his care (Art. 1054 C.C. par. 1) arises only when the occurrence is due to the thing itself, not when it is ascribable to the conduct of the person by whom it is put in motion, controlled or directed.\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 par lui alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait devenu juge en chef de cette Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat unanime Lacombe c. Power[4].\nLa seule question \u00e0 \u00e9tudier est donc de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis une faute. Les fils charg\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 haute tension sont des objets extr\u00eamement dangereux. Plus on augmente la tension, comme on le fait sans cesse, plus le danger est grand. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019en septembre 1951, soit un peu plus de six ans avant l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est fait autoriser par la R\u00e9gie de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9am\u00e9nager \u00e0 6,900 volts au lieu de 2,300 la ligne dont il s\u2019agit. (L\u2019expression employ\u00e9e dans le document r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en anglais est \u00abreframe\u00bb, quant au voltage, on l\u2019a subs\u00e9quemment normalis\u00e9 \u00e0 7,200 au lieu de 6,900.) Dans cette autorisation il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que l\u2019installation devait \u00eatre conforme au National Electrical Safety Code, une publication du minist\u00e8re du Commerce des \u00c9tats-Unis datant de 1948.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que ce code n\u2019exige qu\u2019une distance horizontale de 3 pieds entre tous b\u00e2timents et des fils conducteurs dont le voltage est de 300 \u00e0 8,700 volts. De plus, lorsque cet \u00e9cartement est observ\u00e9, ce code-l\u00e0 n\u2019exige que les conducteurs soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s que dans le seul cas o\u00f9 ils sont si proches de fen\u00eatres, balcons, escaliers de sauvetage ou autres lieux accessibles qu\u2019il y a danger qu\u2019ils viennent en contact avec des personnes (\u00abwhere such supply conductors are placed near enough to windows, verandahs, fire escapes or ordinarily accessible places, to be exposed to contact by persons\u00bb).\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019appelant fait \u00e9tat de ce que depuis longtemps (le t\u00e9moin Pierre Godin dit avant 1952) Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec avait \u00e9tabli des standards beaucoup plus rigoureux. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ceux-ci, l\u2019espace libre \u00e0 laisser entre la partie la plus rapproch\u00e9e d\u2019un b\u00e2timent et des fils conducteurs est de 10\u201911\u201d pour une ligne dont le voltage exc\u00e8de 4,000 volts. Il faut noter que c\u2019est par erreur que dans le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure on dit que d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce t\u00e9moin, l\u2019espace libre doit \u00eatre de 8\u00bd\u2019 dans le cas d\u2019un circuit monophas\u00e9 \u00e0 7,200 volts. C\u2019est pour le cas d\u2019un circuit \u00e0 4,000 volts que le t\u00e9moin a fait cette affirmation. Pour le cas d\u2019une ligne \u00e0 7,200 volts il a bien dit qu\u2019il fallait, suivant les standards d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, un espace libre de pr\u00e8s de 11 pieds, soit l\u2019espace libre prescrit pour une tension allant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12,000 volts. Il a du reste ajout\u00e9 que si l\u2019on exigeait cet espacement, c\u2019est que l\u2019on consid\u00e9rait qu\u2019en tout \u00e9tat de cause un tel circuit devait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme susceptible d\u2019atteindre 12,000 volts dans certaines conditions anormales. En cons\u00e9quence, il y avait lieu d\u2019adopter comme mesure de prudence la protection requise pour le voltage plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\nPeut-on juger l\u2019intim\u00e9e en faute parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas suivi cet exemple et s\u2019en est tenue au code \u00e9tabli par le minist\u00e8re du Commerce des \u00c9tats-Unis et prescrit par la R\u00e9gie de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9? M\u00eame en prenant pour acquis que les pr\u00e9cautions prescrites par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 administrative ne constituent pas une d\u00e9finition limitative des devoirs des entreprises assujetties \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le administratif, il faudrait pour en venir \u00e0 cette conclusion beaucoup plus que la seule preuve qu\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9tabli des standards plus rigoureux. La faute se d\u00e9finit en regard du soin que doit apporter un citoyen d\u2019une vigilance et d\u2019une prudence normales. Comme on l\u2019a fait observer dans de nombreux arr\u00eats, celui qui est accus\u00e9 de n\u00e9gligence se disculpe en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il a agi suivant ce qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 acceptable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il faut se placer pour appr\u00e9cier sa conduite. The London & Lancashire c. La Compagnie F.X. Drolet[5]. Rien ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9am\u00e9nag\u00e9 la ligne en en triplant le voltage, les normes d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme les seules acceptables et celles du Code prescrit par la R\u00e9gie de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 comme insuffisantes ou p\u00e9rim\u00e9es.\nOn dit que le danger que pr\u00e9sentait l\u2019installation en face de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du p\u00e8re du demandeur \u00e9tait tel que le con- trema\u00eetre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sentait le devoir de pr\u00e9venir ce dernier de voir \u00e0 prendre des pr\u00e9cautions sp\u00e9ciales s\u2019il devait entreprendre du peinturage ou une autre op\u00e9ration de ce genre autour de sa maison. Il est bien \u00e9vident qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0 en effet un danger r\u00e9el que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu supprimer par des moyens courants \u00e0 sa disposition soit en \u00e9loignant le fil charg\u00e9 par une traverse, soit en l\u2019isolant dans une enveloppe protectrice. Cependant cela ne suffit pas \u00e0 la constituer en faute car elle n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9liminer tous les risques de ce genre mais seulement le devoir de prendre des pr\u00e9cautions raisonnables. En d\u00e9terminant ce qui est raisonnable il faut consid\u00e9rer que les travaux de peinturage comme ceux d\u2019installation d\u2019antennes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision sont ordinairement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par des ouvriers qualifi\u00e9s. La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que pour un tel ouvrier, l\u2019installation pr\u00e9sentait un danger excessif contre lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le devoir de le pr\u00e9munir.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le r\u00e8glement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e interdit \u00e0 tous ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entretien des lignes de s\u2019approcher \u00e0 moins de 2 pieds d\u2019un fil charg\u00e9; cependant, elle ne d\u00e9montre pas que l\u2019installation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du p\u00e8re du demandeur \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019un ouvrier charg\u00e9 d\u2019y ex\u00e9cuter des travaux ne pouvait pas le faire tout en respectant cette r\u00e8gle de prudence. Il est vrai qu\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec va plus loin: son r\u00e8glement exige 4 pieds. L\u00e0 encore la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que cette norme soit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnue comme seule acceptable.\n\u00c9tant venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en faute du seul fait de n\u2019avoir pas suivi les normes d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si elle a raison de soutenir, comme la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019a admis, que m\u00eame s\u2019il en \u00e9tait autrement, sa faute n\u2019aurait pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accident parce que la partie du toit de la maison o\u00f9 se trouvait le demandeur quand il a re\u00e7u le choc n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 moins de 11 pieds du fil charg\u00e9.\nCependant je dois dire que je suis loin d\u2019\u00eatre convaincu que ce raisonnement soit juste. Tout d\u2019abord, il est contraire au fait brutal que la proximit\u00e9 du fil charg\u00e9 est un facteur essentiel de l\u2019accident. Si lorsque l\u2019on a hauss\u00e9 le voltage de la ligne on l\u2019avait plac\u00e9e suivant les standards d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, il y aurait eu 5 ou 6 pieds de plus entre la fa\u00e7ade de la maison et le fil charg\u00e9, et l\u2019accident ne se serait pas produit. Ensuite, il ne faut pas oublier que ce pour quoi une distance est \u00e0 observer, c\u2019est une ligne de transmission, pas une cl\u00f4ture ou un mur entourant un b\u00e2timent. S\u2019il fallait envisager des conducteurs charg\u00e9s tout le tour de la maison, la situation serait s\u00fbrement diff\u00e9rente et rien ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas un espace beaucoup plus consid\u00e9rable. Autrement dit, la r\u00e8gle de prudence adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c\u2019est de ne pas placer une ligne portant le voltage dont il s\u2019agit de fa\u00e7on telle qu\u2019un conducteur soit \u00e0 moins de 10\u201911\u201d de la partie la plus rapproch\u00e9e du b\u00e2timent. \u00c9videmment, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019un espace libre plus consid\u00e9rable va exister pour tout le reste du b\u00e2timent mais n\u2019est-ce pas un facteur important qu\u2019il ne faut pas \u00e9liminer. Dans Thatcher c. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[6], la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario a admis comme une faute cause d\u2019un accident \u00e0 une traverse \u00e0 niveau dans une localit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la vitesse des trains n\u2019\u00e9tait pas limit\u00e9e, le fait d\u2019y circuler \u00e0 une vitesse telle qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de ne pas d\u00e9passer la limite permise dans la ville voisine vers laquelle le train se dirigeait. On a donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le public avait droit de compter sur toutes les cons\u00e9quences normales des mesures de protection jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires et non seulement sur ce qui est formellement prescrit.\nJe suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Blain, Pich\u00e9, Bergeron, Godbout & Emery, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Chisholm, Smith, Davis, Anglin, Laing, Weldon & Courtois, Montreal.\n[1] [1964] Que.

By virtue of s. 3(1) of the Government Companies Operation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 133, the defendant is \u201cfor all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty\u201d. The defendant pleaded that the relief sought by the plaintiff was not available by virtue of s. 19 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, which provides that \u201cthe Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof...\u201d. The action was dismissed by the trial judge whose judgment was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nBy virtue of s. 19 of the Patent Act, the defendant had statutory authority to use the patent. The words \u201cGovernment of Canada\u201d in that section are equivalent to \u201cthe Crown\u201d. The submission that the rights conferred by the section are not sufficient to empower the sale of a product to the public which is, or has been produced by the use of, a patented invention, could not be entertained. The word \u201cuse\u201d covers sale. The use by the defendant of the patent was, in the circumstances, a use by the Crown within s. 19. There was therefore no infringement.\nBrevets\u2014Contrefa\u00e7on\u2014Compagnie de l\u2019\u00c9tat, mandataire de la Couronne\u2014Action pour violation d\u2019un brevet contre cette compagnie\u2014Peut-elle \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e par voie d\u2019injonction et en dommages\u2014La Couronne ayant droit de se servir d\u2019une invention brevet\u00e9e\u2014La compagnie de l\u2019Etat a-t-elle ce m\u00eame droit\u2014Loi sur les brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, arts. 19, 56\u2014Loi sur le fonctionnement des compagnies de l\u2019\u00c9tat, S.R.C. 1952, c. 133, art. 3(1).\nLa demanderesse, comme cessionnaire d\u2019un brevet, a institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures contre la d\u00e9fenderesse, une compagnie de l\u2019Etat, pour violation d\u2019un brevet devant la Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Parker J. Appeal dismissed.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., and R.J. Fraser, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and John Richard, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, which, by a majority decision, dismissed an appeal by the appellant, initially restricted by order of the Court of Appeal to certain points of law raised in the notice of appeal from the judgment at trial which had dismissed the appellant\u2019s action against the respondent. The present appeal involves only the appellant\u2019s claim for relief by way of injunction and damages for alleged infringement by the respondent of the appellant\u2019s patent. The patent in question, no. 453,251 and entitled \u201cPolymeric Compositions and Methods of Making the Same\u201d, was granted on December 14, 1948, to T.A. TeGrotenhuis, W.C. McCoy and L.L. Evans. It was assigned by the patentees to the respondent on February 18, 1949, pursuant to an agreement whereby the respondent undertook to pay to the patentees royalties on material produced under the patent. The agreement provided that the respondent, if not in default, had the option to reassign the patent to the patentees, without prejudice to the respondent\u2019s right thereafter to contest the scope and validity of the patent.\nThis option was exercised by the respondent on January 9, 1953, after receiving an opinion of counsel that the patent did not cover the materials being produced by the respondent.\nThe patentees, on May 3, 1955, assigned the patent to the appellant, which commenced these infringement proceedings in respect of materials produced by the respondent subsequent to January 9, 1953.\nThe respondent was incorporated on February 13, 1942, under Part I of The Companies Act, 1934, c. 33, Statutes of Canada, 1934. Its objects included the manufacturing, selling and generally dealing in synthetic rubber. At all material times all of its issued shares, other than directors\u2019 qualifying shares, were held by the Minister of Munitions and Supply, and later by the Minister of Defence Production. By proclamation dated August 1, 1946, made pursuant to s. 6 of the Government Companies Operation Act, c. 24, Statutes of Canada, 1946 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 133), that Act was made applicable to the respondent. That Act provides, by s. 3(1), that\nEvery Company is for all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.\nThe respondent, in its statement of defence, pleaded that the relief sought by the appellant in respect of the alleged infringement was not available to the appellant by virtue of s. 19 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. That section provides that:\nThe Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof, and any decision of the Commissioner under this section is subject to appeal to the Exchequer Court. The proceedings in this case were brought in the Supreme Court of Ontario, in reliance upon s. 56(1) of the Patent Act. Section 56 reads as follows:\n56. (1) An action for the infringement of a patent may be brought in that court of record that, in the province wherein the infringement is said to have occurred, has jurisdiction, pecuniarily, to the amount of the damages claimed and that, with relation to the other courts of the province holds its sittings nearest to the place of residence or of business of the defendant; such court shall decide the case and determine as to costs, and assumption of jurisdiction by the court is of itself sufficient proof of jurisdiction.\n(2) Nothing in this section impairs the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court under section 21 of the Exchequer Court Act or otherwise.\nThe learned trial judge reached the following conclusions:\nIt would appear that this court could assume jurisdiction under the Patent Act so long as a right to claim for infringement exists. Since the Crown has a right to use any patented invention, subject to paying compensation, such use cannot be an infringement to provide this Court with jurisdiction under section 56(1) of the Patent Act.\nHaving decided that the Crown has a right to use any patented invention, subject to paying compensation, also disposes of the submission that use by the Crown is a tort which would give this Court jurisdiction.\nHe also held that neither of the products, in the making of which the appellant alleged that the respondent had infringed the patent, was covered by the patent.\nThe appeal from this judgment was initially restricted, by order of the Court of Appeal, to certain points of law referred to in the notice of appeal.\nThe only points of law stated in the notice of appeal which were argued by the appellant in the Court of Appeal were points 2 and 3:\n2. The learned trial judge erred in law in considering that the defendant is \u201cthe Government of Canada\u201d within the meaning of s. 19 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, Ch. 203 and that the defendant has \u201cused the patented inventions\u201d within the meaning of that section. The learned trial judge thereby erred in law in his conclusion that this Honourable Court has no power to assess compensation.\n3. The learned trial judge erred in law in concluding that the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain that part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim (Polysar SS-250) which seeks damages for alleged infringement of patent.\nThe Court of Appeal, by a majority of two to one, dismissed the appeal. McLennan J.A., who delivered the reasons of the majority, after stating that the real issue was raised in ground 3, reached the following conclusion, which he considered decisive:\nMy conclusion is that at common law an action for infringement of patent being an action in tort is not maintainable against the respondent because it is an agent of the Crown and its powers may be exercised only as such agent and although the Crown Liabilities Act, Statutes of Canada, 1952-3, Cap. 30, provides that the Crown is liable for damages in respect of a tort, a saving clause in the section imposing liability is applicable to this case, and the common law rule is not affected.\nThe saving clause to which he refers, and on which he relies in his judgment, is subs. (6) of s. 3.\nWells J.A., as he then was, dissented and was of the opinion that the commercial sale by the respondent to the public of its products was not the \u201cuse\u201d of a patented invention within the meaning of s. 19 of the Patent Act, that such sales would constitute an infringement of a patent, and that the respondent, though a Crown agent, if it exceeded its powers could be made liable in tort for such an infringement by virtue of s. 3(3) of the Government Companies Operation Act, which provides that:\n3. (3) Actions, suits or other legal proceedings in respect of any right or obligation acquired or incurred by a Company on behalf of Her Majesty, whether in its name or in the name of Her Majesty, may be brought or taken by or against the Company in the name of the Company in any court that would have jurisdiction if the Company were not an agent of Her Majesty.\nWhile I have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails, my reasons are not the same as those of the majority in the Court of Appeal.\nIt is unnecessary to determine, in the circumstances of the present case, what may be the liability of an agent of the Crown, which, without lawful authority, infringes upon the rights of others. I do not base my decision upon, nor do I adopt the general proposition that an action in tort will not lie as against an agent of the Crown.\nIn my opinion, the appellant\u2019s claim for an infringement of its patent fails because the respondent, by virtue of s. 19 of the Patent Act, had statutory authority to use the patent. That section confers the right to use any patented invention upon the \u201cGovernment of Canada\u201d. I agree with Wells J.A. that this phrase is equivalent to \u201cthe Crown\u201d. He refers, on this point, to ss. 9 to 13 of the British North America Act. It is also implicit in the judgment of this Court in The King v. Bradley[2] that the two terms are equivalent. That case involved a petition of right against the Crown in respect of compensation claimed to be payable under s. 19, which claim had been denied by the Crown.\nThe submission of the appellant, which found favour with Wells J.A., is that the rights conferred by s. 19 are not sufficient to empower the sale of a product to the public which is, or has been produced by the use of, a patented invention. In reaching this conclusion he traces the history of the Crown\u2019s rights, in relation to patents, in England, and relies upon the recent decision of the House of Lords in Pfizer Corporation v. Ministry of Health[3].\nIn England, the granting of a patent for an invention was an exercise of the Royal Prerogative. In Feather v. The Queen[4], it was held that:\nLetters patent, in the usual form, for an invention, whereby, on the prayer of the patentee, the Crown of its \u201cspecial grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion,\u201d grants to him \u201cspecial licence, full power, sole privilege and authority to\u201d \u201cmake, use, exercise and vend\u201d the invention, and \u201cenjoy the whole profit, benefit, commodity and advantage from time to time coming, growing, accruing, and arising by reason of the said invention,\u201d and prohibits \u201call and every person and persons, bodies politic and corporate, and all other our subjects whatsoever, of what estate, quality, degree, name or condition soever,\u201d directly or indirectly, from making, using or practising the same \u201cwithout the consent, licence or agreement\u201d of the patentee, with the condition that the patentee should supply articles of the invention for the use of the Crown, at and upon such reasonable prices and terms as should be settled by the officers of the Crown requiring them; and that the letters patent should be \u201ctaken, construed and adjudged in the most favourable and beneficial sense for the best advantage of\u201d the patentee, do not preclude the Crown from the use of the invention protected by the patent, even without the assent of or compensation made to the patentee.\nAt p. 268, Chief Justice Cockburn, delivering the judgment of the Court, said:\nThis appears to shew that in granting a privilege, otherwise of universal application, the Crown will not be bound unless it expressly declares its intention to that effect, and that grants of a privilege, however general in their terms, can, in the absence of express words to bind the Crown, be taken only as conferring the privilege as against the subject, exclusive of the Crown. In 1876, in the House of Lords, in Dixon v. The London Small Arms Company Limited[5], it was held that a company which employed a patented process in the manufacture of small arms for the Crown, and which was not a servant or agent of the Crown, was liable in a suit for infringement.\nLord Cairns L.C. said, at p. 641:\nMy Lords, I have used the words \u201cservants or the agents of the Crown\u201d for this reason. The case of Feather v. The Queen, 6 B. & S. 257; 35 L.J. (Q.B.) 200, decided that although every grant of letters patent communicates in general terms to the patentee the right, and the sole right, to use and to exercise the invention, and prohibits other persons from using or exercising that invention, yet that a grant of that kind, being a Crown grant, must be construed with reference to those principles which regulate Crown grants, and that that which appears from its wording to be a general privilege and a general prohibition must be read with an exception in favour of the Crown itself; and inasmuch as an exception in favour of the Crown itself cannot be a personal exception, for the Crown itself could not exercise patent rights, the exception must be not only in favour of the Crown, but in favour also of those who act on behalf of, and as the agents of, the Crown. I, therefore, in the course of the argument, took the liberty of proposing to the Solicitor-General the insertion of words in the letters patent which would indicate the decision of the Court in the case of Feather v. The Queen; and, with the exception of one word which the Solicitor-General proposed to add, I did not find that he took any exception or made any objection to the words which I proposed to insert. I propose to read, my Lords, and I submit to your Lordships that it is the proper course that we should read, the grant of the letters patent as a grant by the Crown to the patentee of a \u201clicense, full power, sole privilege and authority that he\u201d the patentee, \u201chis executors, administrators, and assigns, and every of them, by himself and themselves, or by his and their deputy or deputies, servants, or agents, or such others as he\u201d the patentee, \u201chis executors, administrators, or assigns, shall at any time agree with, and no others.\u201d I propose there to insert these words, \u201cexcepting officers, agents, and servants of the Crown, acting on behalf of and for the use of the Crown\u201d \u201cfrom time to time, and at all times hereafter, for the term of years herein expressed, shall and lawfully may make, use, exercise, and vend the said invention within our United Kingdom, &c.\u201d My Lords, I say I did not understand the Solicitor-General to object to the words which I proposed to insert, except that he added to the words which I have proposed the word \u201cagents,\u201d I having used simply the words \u201cofficers and servants of the Crown\u201d.\nWhat the Court was concerned with in the passage quoted was this. Accepting the proposition established in Feather v. The Queen, that letters patent for an invention, though general in terms, must be construed as subject to an exception in favour of the Crown, such exception was not purely personal to the Crown, but extended to officers, agents and servants of the Crown acting on behalf of and for the use of the Crown. I do not, as did Wells J.A., construe this as \u201ca substantial limitation of the Royal Prerogative\u201d. The position of the Crown was still the same, i.e., the letters patent of invention did not affect it. But, in addition, as Lord Cairns said in the passage quoted:\n\u2026the exception must be not only in favour of the Crown, but in favour also of those who act on behalf of, and as the agents of, the Crown.\nIn 1883 a new Patent Act was passed in England (46 & 47 Vict., c. 57), which, in effect, reversed the decision in Feather v. The Queen, and which altered the law as to the use of a patent by an agent or servant of the Crown, as stated in the Dixon case, by extending the right of use to contractors, and also by making provision for compensation.\nIt provided as follows:\n27. (1). A patent shall have to all intents the like effect as against Her Majesty the Queen, her heirs and successors, as it has against a subject.\n(2). But the officers or authorities administering any department of the service of the Crown may, by themselves, their agents, contractors, or others, at any time after the application, use the invention for the services of the Crown on terms to be before or after the use thereof agreed on, with the approval of the Treasury, between those officers or authorities and the patentee, or, in default of such agreement, on such terms as may be settled by the Treasury after hearing all parties interested.\nThese provisions were carried forward, in substantially the same terms, in subsequent legislation. The Patents Act, 1949, which was under consideration in the Pfizer case, contains the following provisions:\n21. (2). Subject to the provisions of this Act and of subsection (3) of section three of the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947, a patent shall have the same effect against the Crown as it has against a subject.\n46. (1). Notwithstanding anything in this Act, any Government department, and any person authorised in writing by a Government department, may make, use and exercise any patented invention for the services of the Crown in accordance with the following provisions of this section.\nThe subsequent provisions of s. 46, inter alia, provide for compensation.\nCanadian legislation with respect to these matters has been substantially different. In 1869 there was enacted an Act Respecting Patents of Invention (c. 11, Statutes of Canada, 1869). It provided for the granting of patents of invention by the Commissioner of Patents of Invention. Section 21 provided that:\nThe Government of Canada may always use any patented invention or discovery, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner may report to be reasonable compensation for the use thereof.\nSection 19 of the present Act, previously quoted, is to the same effect. The rights of a patentee in Canada are defined by s. 46 of the Act. It is this section which, subject to the conditions of the Act, confers exclusive rights upon the patentee.\nThere was not then, and there is not now any provision, similar to the English legislation, declaring that a patent has the like effect against the Crown as it has against a subject. In the absence of such a provision, and in the light of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, it is questionable whether a patent does have effect against the Crown. Section 16 provides that\nNo provision or enactment in any Act affects, in any manner whatsoever, the rights of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty is bound thereby.\nIn McDonald v. The King[6], it was stated that, apart from statute, the Crown has power, if it sees fit to do so, to use a patented invention without the assent of the patentee and without making compensation to him therefor.\nThis point was left open in the decision of this Court in The King v. Bradley, supra. I do not think it is necessary to determine it in these proceedings because of the opinion I have reached as to the scope of s. 19.\nThe differences between s. 19 of the Canadian Act and s. 46(1) of the English Act are material. The former confers upon the Crown an unrestricted right to use a patent. The latter confers on a Government department the right to make, use and exercise a patent \u201cfor the services of the Crown.\u201d\nIt is in the light of these differences that I now turn to a consideration of the Pfizer case. The question in issue there was as to whether the Ministry of Health was within the protection offered by s. 46(1) of the English Patent Act when it purchased supplies of a drug for National Health Service hospitals from an English company, which imported the drug from abroad and which had no licence from the holder of the English patent in respect of that drug. The drug was used by the hospitals for both inpatients and out-patients. It was supplied by the hospitals to out-patients on payment of a nominal charge made under the National Health Service regulations.\nThe main issue, in both the Court of Appeal[7] and in the House of Lords[8] was as to whether this supplying of drugs was \u201cfor the services of the Crown.\u201d It was held that it was. Another issue was as to whether the Ministry of Health was authorized under the section to sell the drug to out-patients. The House of Lords determined this issue by deciding that the relationship of the Ministry to the out-patients was a statutory relationship and not a sale, in the sense of a consensual contract. This was also the view taken by the Court of Appeal, but, in addition, it was held there that the word \u201cuse\u201d was broad enough to cover a sale by the Ministry.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the reasoning of the House of Lords indicates that, unlike the Court of Appeal, they held the opinion that \u201cuse\u201d in s. 46(1) did not authorize sale. I think the proper interpretation of their reasons is that, holding the view that there had been no sale, they preferred not to deal with the matter. Thus, for example, Lord Evershed says, at p. 541:\nIt was the view of Diplock L.J. that nonetheless the true implication of the word \u201cuse\u201d in the 1883 Act and repeated in the subsequent legislation involved, as a proper and essential aspect or exercise of \u201cusing\u201d, a power also to vend, that is, so that a Government department could give authority to \u201cvend\u201d articles which were the subject of letters patent. I wish to acknowledge the attraction of the argument of the learned Lord Justice which was, as I understand, accepted also by his colleagues in the Court of Appeal. But for my own part while I greatly respect the reasoning of the Lord Justice I would prefer to express no view upon it.\nIn any event, it is my opinion that the word \u201cuse\u201d in s. 19 of the Canadian Act has a broader application than it has in the context of s. 46(1) of the English Act. In s. 19 the Crown is given an unrestricted power at any time to use any patented invention. In s. 46(1) no power is conferred upon the Crown (which is bound by the patent by s. 21(2)), but a power is given to a Government department to use a patent \u201cfor the services of the Crown.\u201d\nIn relation to s. 19 I would adopt the statement of Diplock L.J. at p. 658:\nThe verb \u201cuse,\u201d in relation to the object \u201cany patented invention,\u201d is in its ordinary connotation wide enough to comprehend selling the patented articles if the invention is itself a product or articles manufactured by patented process if the invention is a process of manufacture.\nIn my opinion the Crown, under s. 19, has an unrestricted right to use a patent. It caused the respondent to be incorporated to manufacture, sell and deal in synthetic rubber and made the respondent, for all its purposes, its agent. The use by the respondent of the patent was, in the circumstances, a use by the Crown within s. 19. This being so, there was no infringement by the respondent of such patent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Rowland, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1967] 1 O.R. 546, 35 Fox Pat.

A motion to quash the information on the ground that it was defective was refused, but, before the start of the trial, Crown counsel told the defence what question was alleged to have been answered falsely. On appeal to a district judge, the information was again attacked and the conviction was quashed. A further appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court by the Crown was allowed and the judgment of the magistrate was reinstated. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the questions of law as to (1) whether the information was fatally defective and (2) whether the judgment of the magistrate should have been reinstated on the assumption that the information was not fatally defective.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the case remitted to the district judge for a hearing on the merits by way of trial de novo.\nThe information was not fatally defective. The appellant knew that he was charged with making a false statement in his application. The charge as framed was not so lacking in detail of the circumstances that it did not identify the transaction. There was a right to demand particulars and, in fact, oral particulars were given. Defence counsel appeared to have been content to proceed with these oral particulars.\nAs conceded by the Crown, the Court of Appeal erred in reinstating the judgment of the magistrate.

Crane, for the appellant.\nJohn A. Scollin and C.D. MacKinnon, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant, Robert John Corcoran, was charged by information dated August 10, 1966, that\non or about the 11th day of February, A.D. 1966 at the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, Robert John Corcoran, Advertising agent, of 205 Wolf Street, Townsite of Banff, Province of Alberta, did knowingly and unlawfully make a false statement in connection with the application for admission of himself to Canada, the said offence being contrary to Subsection (f) of Section 50 of the Immigration Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, being Chapter 325 as amended.\nThe magistrate convicted the appellant.\nAt the beginning of this trial, counsel for the appellant moved to quash on the ground that the information was defective. The magistrate refused to grant this application and proceeded to hear the evidence, but before the magistrate went on with the trial, counsel for the Crown told counsel for the appellant which question and answer alleged to be false in the appellant\u2019s application for permanent admission to Canada was in issue in the case. In other words, he gave him oral particulars.\nOn appeal to a District Judge, the appellant\u2019s counsel again moved against the information. It is apparent from the record of the proceedings before the judge that it was made clear to him, as it had been to the magistrate, what question was involved in this information. No evidence was taken before the judge and after argument, he granted the application and quashed the conviction.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and ordered that the judgment of the District Judge be set aside and that the judgment of the magistrate be reinstated.\nLeave to appeal was granted by this Court on the following questions of law:\n(1) Whether the information is fatally defective.\n(2) Whether on the view that the information is not fatally defective the Court of Appeal erred in reinstating the judgment of His Honour Magistrate Stillwell rather than remitting the case to the Appeal Court having jurisdiction under Section 719 to hear a trial de novo under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code.\nThe question in the application for admission to Canada which gives rise to the difficulty in this case is the following:\n13. Have you or has any member of your family suffered from mental illness, tuberculosis, or been convicted of a criminal offence, refused admission or deported from Canada? (If \u201cyes\u201d to any of these, give details) Answer\u2014No.\nThe Crown\u2019s allegation was that the applicant had been convicted of a criminal offence in the United States which he failed to disclose. This was the oral information given by counsel for the Crown to the accused before the trial began both before the magistrate and at the trial de novo before the District Judge.\nSection 50(f) of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, under which the accused was charged, reads as follows:\n50. Every person who\n(f) knowingly makes any false or misleading statement at an examination or inquiry under this Act or in connection with the admission of any person to Canada or the application for admission by any person\nis guilty of an offence\u2026\nMy opinion is that this information was not fatally defective. It charges an offence punishable upon summary conviction. Section 701(1) dealing with summary convictions makes applicable ss. 492 and 493 of the Criminal Code. Section 492, subs. (3), provides:\n(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.\nThe accused here knew that he was charged with making a false or misleading statement in his application for admission to Canada. I do not think that the charge as framed is so lacking in detail of the circumstances that it does not identify the transaction. There would have been no difficulty in stating in the information that what was held against the accused was that he falsely stated that he had not been convicted of a criminal offence. Failure to do this was not a fatal defect in the information.\nThe accused had a right to demand particulars and, in fact, oral particulars were given to him and, as the record of what happened before the magistrate indicates, whatever merits counsel for the accused may have attributed to his motion to quash, he appears to have been content to proceed with the trial with these oral particulars. The appeal cannot succeed on this ground.\nHowever, and as conceded by the respondent, there was error in the order of the Court of Appeal in reinstating the judgment of the magistrate. I would allow the appeal, remit the case to the District Judge for a hearing on the merits, by way of a trial de novo, on the information as amended by the oral particulars given before the magistrate.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

They instituted an action for infringement against the defendant and applied to Jackett P. for an interlocutory injunction. The defendant apparently does not deny having copied, with minor variations, the design of the plaintiffs, but in its defence, raised questions as to the lack of originality of the registered design and as to the plaintiffs\u2019 proprietary right. The interlocutory injunction was granted by the President. The defendant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux and Martland JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the interlocutory injunction dissolved.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Pigeon JJ.: There were substantial grounds of defence to the action. It was therefore necessary to consider the question of the balance of convenience. The effect of the injunction will be to prevent the defendant from dealing with a large quantity of sprinklers it has on hand until after the selling season while the plaintiffs are not marketing in Canada sprinklers bearing the registered design. The injunction should not have been granted.\nPer Fauteux and Martland JJ., dissenting: The granting of the interlocutory injunction was a matter of discretion. In the circumstances the President exercised his discretion in accordance with the proper principles and this Court should not interfere with it.

Appel accueilli, les Juges Fauteux et Martland \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada granting an interlocutory injunction. Appeal allowed, Fauteux and Martland JJ. dissenting.\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and Weldon F. Green, for the defendant, appellant.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and James D. Kokonis, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by my brother Pigeon, from an order of the President of the Exchequer Court made on April 26, 1968, granting an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant until the trial of the action from applying a design registered by the plaintiffs under No. 226\/29037 to any article for the purpose of sale and from selling or offering for sale or use any article to which any such design has been applied.\nThe appeal was argued at considerable length and the merits of the questions raised in the action were gone into in greater detail than is usual on such an application.\nThe defendant apparently does not deny having copied, with minor variations, the design of the plaintiffs. The main defence to the action is that the registration of the design is invalid as it lacks originality. A further defence raised is that the assignor under whom the plaintiffs claim, was never the proprietor of the design.\nIt is desirable that in dealing with this appeal we should refrain as far as possible from expressing an opinion on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as the action remains to be tried.\nOn reading the reasons of the learned President as a whole it appears to me that he proceeded on the basis not only that it was clear that the defendant had copied the plaintiffs\u2019 design but that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the exclusive use of the design could not be seriously questioned. The learned President said in part:\nThis being a case of piracy of the defendant\u2019s rights without colour of right, it is not a case, in my view, where the granting of an interlocutory injunction depends upon balance of convenience.\nI cannot think that the learned President would have so expressed himself unless he had concluded that there was little, if any, doubt as to the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive right to the use of the design. The applicable rule is conveniently summarized in Halsbury 3rd ed., vol. 21 at p. 366, as follows:\nWhere any doubt exists as to the plaintiff\u2019s right, or if his right is not disputed, but its violation is denied, the Court, in determining whether an interlocutory injunction should be granted, takes into consideration the balance of convenience to the parties and the nature of the injury which the defendant, on the one hand, would suffer if the injunction was granted and he should ultimately turn out to be right, and that which the plaintiff, on the other hand, might sustain if the injunction was refused and he should ultimately turn out to be right. The burden of proof that the inconvenience which the plaintiff will suffer by the refusal of the injunction is greater than that which the defendant will suffer, if it is granted, lies on the plaintiff. On the argument before us several sprinklers were produced for our inspection and it was conceded, but only for the purposes of this appeal, that the design of the end of the sprinkler Ex. 17 (if it was a design capable of being registered) was in the public domain in Canada at the time when it is alleged that the defendant copied the plaintiffs\u2019 design.\nWithout expressing anything in the nature of a final opinion, I find it very difficult to see how it could be successfully suggested that there was any such difference between Ex. 17 and the plaintiff\u2019s sprinkler as would warrant a finding that the latter was possessed of any originality. If, on the other hand, it could be said that a sufficient difference exists between the shape of Ex. 17 and that of the plaintiffs\u2019 sprinkler to warrant a finding that the latter possesses originality, it would appear to me to be difficult to maintain that the difference between the shape of the plaintiff\u2019s sprinkler and that of the defendant\u2019s is not equally pronounced. The other defence mentioned above is also one which cannot be regarded as unsubstantial or trivial. In my opinion very serious doubts exist as to the plaintiffs\u2019 right.\nWith the greatest respect it seems to me that the learned President was in error in holding that he did not have to consider the question of the balance of convenience.\nThe effect of the injunction will be to prevent the defendant from dealing with some seventy thousand sprinklers which it has on hand until after the trial: and the evidence given on behalf of the plaintiffs indicates that the season for selling lawn sprinklers is \u201cessentially finished by the end of June in any year there being only small reorders after that\u201d.\nThe plaintiffs are not marketing and do not at present intend to market in Canada sprinklers bearing the design which they have registered. They claim that the sale by the defendant of its sprinklers will reduce the sales of sprinklers of a more expensive type which are marketed by the plaintiffs.\nWith respect, I do not think that the learned President would have granted this interlocutory injunction if he had been of the view, which in my opinion is inescapable, that there are very substantial grounds of defence to the action and had gone on to consider where the balance of convenience lies.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that the interlocutory injunction be dissolved. Our order should recite an undertaking by the defendant to keep an account of its sales of the sprinklers alleged to infringe the plaintiffs\u2019 design until the trial of the action. I would direct that the costs of the appeal should be in the cause.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the learned President of the Exchequer Court granting an interlocutory injunction to restrain the appellant from applying to any article, for the purpose of sale, the design registered under No. 226\/29037 in the Register of Industrial Designs, for which a certificate of registration had been given to the respondents\u2019 assignor.\nThe respondents are assignees, under a registered assignment of that design. They allege an infringement of it.\nSections 7(3) and 9 of the Industrial Design and Union Label Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 150, provide as follows:\n7. (3) The said certificate, in the absence of proof to the contrary, is sufficient evidence of the design, of the originality of the design, of the name of the proprietor, of the person named as proprietor being proprietor, of the commencement and term of registry, and of compliance with the provisions of this Act.\n9. An exclusive right for an industrial design may be acquired by registration of the same under this Part.\nOn the question of infringement, the learned President said this:\nWith regard to the question of infringement, in my view, the plaintiff has made out a very strong prima facie case that the defendant has, contrary to section 11 of the Industrial Design and Union Label Act, R.S.C. 1952, chapter 150, without the licence in writing of the registered proprietor or of his assignee, applied for the purposes of sale \u201ca fraudulent imitation\u201d of the registered design, if it has not applied the registered design itself, to the ornamenting of its sprinklers. Furthermore, it has done so, and persists in doing so, some time after it has been formally advised of the plaintiffs\u2019 registered trade mark. In the absence of any evidence or explanation from the defendant, I can only conclude that the defendant was guilty of unashamed appropriation of the plaintiffs\u2019 legal rights or that it was under the impression that the minor changes it made in the course of appropriating the plaintiffs\u2019 design were sufficient to convert that design into a new and different design, a point of view I find it impossible to appreciate. I have examined a sprinkler to which the registered design has admittedly been applied and the defendant\u2019s sprinkler that is part of the Statement of Claim from every different angle and, apart from a direct head-on view, their similarity is, in my view, incontrovertible. Even from a direct head-on view, the defendant\u2019s sprinkler is an obvious adaptation of the plaintiffs\u2019.\nIn answer to the respondents\u2019 motion, the appellant filed no material. It relied upon the contention that the respondents\u2019 design was invalid. Each of the grounds alleged by the appellant was considered by the learned President. I am not prepared, at this stage of the proceedings and on the evidence before us, to disagree with his reasons in respect of these matters.\nHe had in mind the practice in respect of the granting of interlocutory injunctions, and he said this:\nI have in mind, of course, the long established practice in patent matters that an interlocutory injunction will not ordinarily be granted on the basis of a recent patent where there is a genuine case to be decided as to its validity. (Compare Smith v. Grigg Ld., (1924) 1 K.B. 655.) I realize that, in an appropriate case, this practice is applicable in industrial design matters. I should, however, be very hesitant about applying that practice in an industrial design case where there is, as I am convinced there is here, a clear case of appropriation by the defendant of the plaintiffs\u2019 industrial design which, I must assume, is ordinarily a valuable property acquired at some expense as other property is acquired, knowing that he is appropriating something to the exclusive use of which, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, the plaintiff has a duly registered title; and, I am none the less hesitant about applying the practice because the defendant has managed to raise some very tenuous arguments based upon an interpretation of the statute that possibly might lead to the invalidation of the title.\nHis final conclusion was as follows:\nThis being a case of piracy of the defendant\u2019s rights without colour of right, it is not a case, in my view, where the granting of an interlocutory injunction depends upon balance of convenience.\nThe granting of the interlocutory injunction was a matter of discretion. In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, the learned President exercised his discretion in accordance with the proper principles, and I am not prepared to interfere with it. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed; costs in the cause; FAUTEUX and MARTLAND JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: W.F. Green, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\n"

The said company, the rights and liabilities of which in relation to the unit were purchased by the plaintiff respondent, drilled an off-target or off-pattern producing well in a part of the lands described in the unitization agreement as the \u201cBuffer Zone\u201d. It had previously drilled what, for practical purposes, was a dry hole within the target area.\nS P Co. applied for the admission to the unit of the tract on which both wells were situated. It was not admitted. The company then sued for a declaration that it was entitled to have the tract admitted into the unit area as at March 1, 1964, without the application of any penalty factor and with an interim and final participation factor of certain amounts, for specific performance of the unit agreement and the unit operating agreement and damages in lieu of or in addition to specific performance.\nThe trial judge found that the plaintiff was entitled to have its tract admitted as of March 1, 1964, with a producibility factor of.5, that is with the application of the penalty factor applied by the Oil and Gas Conservation Board to the producing well on the tract. The Board had reduced the economic allowable of this well to 33 barrels per day, as a result of the well having been drilled off target; 66 barrels per day was the economic allowable for on-target wells in this field. The trial judge found that the tract porosity-footage of this well was 81. He awarded the plaintiff damages in the sum of $60,000.\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta varied the trial judgment to permit the plaintiff a full, unpenalized participation in the unit with a tract porosity\u2011footage of 107, and referred the case back to the Trial Division for assessment of the additional sums payable to the plaintiff.

The automobile was owned by the defendant JE who had entrusted it to his son ME. The latter was a licensed operator and was occupy- ing a seat in the automobile beside the driver. While driving at an excessive rate of speed, K was dazzled by the headlights of a car approaching from the opposite direction and although her vision was thus impaired she failed to reduce her speed. After the other car had passed, the subject car swerved to the left and ran for some 75 yards with its left wheels off the pavement until it struck a culvert. It passed over the culvert and then crashed into an embankment. The car was completely demolished and the plaintiff was seriously injured.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s action for damages was dismissed by the trial judge who found that K\u2019s negligence was not in the wilful or wanton category. An appeal from the trial judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal and the plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed against the respondents JE and K; the appeal against the respondent ME should be dismissed.\nNo question arose as to the veracity of the appellant\u2019s witnesses and the question being one as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence, this Court was in as good a position to decide as were the Courts below. Accordingly, considering the evidence as a whole, the Court was of the view that the appellant did establish that the driver K, in the manner in which she was driving at the time of the accident, showed \u201ca very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d, and thus there was on her part \u201cwilful and wanton misconduct\u201d within the meaning of s. 168(2) of The Vehicles Act, R.S.S. 1965, c. 377. The respondents JE and K were, therefore, liable under the said s. 168(2). No view was expressed as to the liability of ME. The question of liability, if any, of a licensed operator accompanying the holder of a learner\u2019s licence pursuant to s. 66(3) of the Act for the negligence or for the wilful and wanton misconduct of that person was left open.\nMcCulloch v.

Rees, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.B. Goetz, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1 which upheld the judgment of MacPherson J. in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Saskatchewan, dismissing an action by the appellant for damages sustained by Roseann Markling (now Crooks) in an automobile accident near Domremy in Saskatchewan at about 12:30 a.m. on June 2, 1963.\nRoseann Markling was a gratuitous passenger in an automobile being driven by the respondent Evelyn Kolendreski, age 18, who was the holder of a learner\u2019s licence. Section 66 of The Vehicles Act, R.S.S. 1965, c. 377, which reads as it did in 1963 relating to learners, is as follows:\n(3) A person holding a learner\u2019s licence shall not drive a motor vehicle on a public highway unless accompanied by a licensed instructor, operator or chauffeur occupying a seat beside the driver.\nThe automobile was owned by the respondent John Ewaniuk who had entrusted it to his son Morris Ewaniuk. Morris was a licensed operator and was occupying a seat in the automobile beside the driver.\nThe law relating to the liability of a driver and of an owner when any loss, damage or injury is caused by a motor vehicle is set out in s. 168(1) of The Vehicles Act of Saskatchewan and the law relating to liability to a gratuitous passenger is set out in s. 168(2). Section 168 reads as follows:\n(1) Subject to subsection (2), when any loss, damage or injury is caused to a person by a motor vehicle, the person driving it at the time is liable for the loss, damage or injury, if it was caused by his negligence or improper conduct, and the owner thereof is also liable to the same extent as the driver unless at the time of the incident causing the loss, damage or injury the motor vehicle had been stolen from the owner or otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession or out of the possession of a person entrusted by him with the care thereof.\n(2) The owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle ordinarily used for carrying passengers for hire or gain, is not liable for loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or the death of a person being carried in or upon or entering, or getting onto, or alighting from the motor vehicle, unless there has been wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless the wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury.\nThe liability of the owner John Ewaniuk and of the driver Evelyn Kolendreski is governed by s. 168(2) above. The appellant had, therefore, to establish that there had been \u201cwilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver of the vehicle and that such wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury\u201d. It is now accepted that the statement by Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. in McCulloch v. Murray[2], that:\nAll these phrases, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, imply conduct in which, if there is not conscious wrongdoing, there is a very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves.\nis the ruling definition or test of what can constitute wilful and wanton misconduct within the meaning of said s. 168 (2): Studer v. Cowper[3].\nTo succeed the appellant had to establish as against the driver and owner that at the time she was injured the automobile was being driven in a manner indicating \u201ca very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge made the following findings of fact:\nThis is an action for personal damages arising from an automobile accident which occurred at 12:30 a.m. on June 2, 1963. The plaintiff was a gratuitous passenger in an automobile owned by the defendant John Ewaniuk in the care of his son Morris Ewaniuk, who was in the car, and driven by Evelyn Kolendreski, a young lady with whom he was then keeping company. Another young lady, Darlene Youzwa, and a young man were also in the car at the time.\n* * *\nThese young people got together in Wakaw in the early evening of Saturday, June 1, 1963. They first drove to Cudworth, a distance of about 11 miles, where 12 bottles of beer were purchased for them by a friend because they were too young to buy it legally for themselves. The boys apparently had some other beer in the car because they consumed 2 bottles on the way back to Wakaw without touching the dozen purchased. Having returned to Wakaw, they went to the home of Miss Youzwa where each of the 5 of them consumed 2 bottles of beer of the dozen purchased and the remaining 2 were left behind at Miss Youzwa\u2019s home. In the aimless sort of way that young people pursue pleasure they went to the centre of Wakaw and then decided to go to Hoey to a dance, it being then about midnight. There is little doubt in my mind that the suggestion that they go to Hoey came from the plaintiff who was looking for a particular young man. Having decided to go to Hoey they all got back into the car and Miss Kolendreski got behind the wheel as if to drive. The plaintiff and Miss Youzwa then suggested that Morris Ewaniuk should drive because of his greater experience and the fact that they were going on a main highway. To this Miss Kolendreski replied that she would drive only as far as the highway and turn over to Morris. In fact, she did not do this but arriving at the highway turned onto it and proceeded toward Hoey. The plaintiff and Miss Youzwa remonstrated with her concerning her speed but this had little effect. Eleven miles from Wakaw the car went into the ditch on the lefthand side of the road, rolled and the passengers were injured in varying degrees, the plaintiff most seriously.\n* * *\nAs she drove on the highway Miss Kolendreski remained quite properly in her own lane until shortly before the accident. Eleven miles from Wakaw a car coming from the opposite direction bore extremely bright lights which dazzled Miss Kolendreski and the plaintiff. Morris Ewaniuk who was sitting in the front seat between Miss Kolendreski and the plaintiff was either asleep or paying little attention because he has no vivid recollection of the lights as do the others. I am inclined to find, as the plaintiff and Miss Youzwa suggest, that both he, in the front, and the other young man in the back were asleep.\nIn order to encourage the approaching driver to lower his lights, Miss Kolendreski in accordance with well-known practise, raised and lowered her own two or three times but to no avail. After the other car had passed, the subject car swerved to the left, drove for at least 75 yards with the left wheels off the pavement and the right wheels on the pavement until it came to a culvert over an irrigation ditch. The car jumped the culvert and crashed into the embankment on the other side and was completely demolished. It ended up 30 or 40 feet northwest of the culvert in the left ditch.\n* * *\nThere are two factors of negligence, therefore, which have been proved. Firstly, her failure to slow down significantly when her vision was impaired by the brilliance of the approaching lights; secondly, her swerve to the left.\nand he concluded:\nIn my view the accident was due to the inexperience of Miss Kolendreski in handling what to experienced drivers is a not unusual situation, namely, the negligence of another driver failing to dim glaring lights. Her negligence was due to inexperience and is not in the wilful or wanton category.\nAs to credibility, he said:\nAt the time of the accident the plaintiff was 16, Miss Youzwa was 17, Miss Kolendreski and Morris Ewaniuk were 18. There was considerable conflict in the evidence between the plaintiff and Miss Youzwa on the one hand and Miss Kolendreski and Morris Ewaniuk on the other. The former were very clear and definite whereas the latter were extremely vague and uncertain and for this reason in determining the facts I have chosen to accept the evidence of the plaintiff and Miss Youzwa where it is in conflict with that of the defendants, except in the instances mentioned below. These defendants seemed unable to recall even the principal facts of the evening.\nThe appellant accepts these findings, but contends that the learned trial judge erred in certain other findings of fact as follows:\n(1) When he said:\nI have difficulty in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s statement that Miss Kolendreski was driving the car at 70 miles an hour and faster. It is difficult enough for an experienced person to determine the speed of a car in which he is travelling. At that time the plaintiff was 16 years of age and quite inexperienced. She says she looked from her position on the extreme righthand side of the driver\u2019s seat and saw the speedometer needle at 70 m.p.h. I have no doubt that she looked but I do not believe that the angle of her view would give her an accurate reading. I have no doubt that the car which was a new one of the current year, and powerful, was capable of considerable speed but I cannot accept the evidence of great speed which comes from the plaintiff alone. If I have her evidence noted correctly, Miss Youzwa felt that Miss Kolendreski was driving too fast but did not attempt to estimate the speed.\nAs to this, it must be noted that there was no evidence as to the location of the speedometer or as to what a person in the position of Roseann Markling could see, and consequently nothing which would justify the learned trial judge in rejecting her evidence. Then, as to the witness Miss Darlene Youzwa, he was in error in stating that she had not attempted to estimate the speed. Her evidence on this point is as follows:\nQ. Said nothing. Well now from there on what speed did you attain in your estimation on that trip?\nA. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d say at least 70, 75 even, you know to me this is what I thought it was at least.\nTHE COURT: HOW old were you at that time?\nA. I was 17.\nTHE COURT: Did you have any particular experience in judging speed of vehicles?\nA. Not really no but I don\u2019t know I still feel that you can more or less feel the speed you are going at if you are speeding, I think you can more or less tell that you are speeding, that you don\u2019t have to look at a speedometer in order to see if you are going over 60 or whatever it is.\n(2) That the accident appears to have occurred some 75 yards north of where the vehicles met.\nThe learned trial judge did not make a finding as to where the automobile being driven by the respondent Evelyn Kolendreski met the southbound vehicle with the bright lights. The evidence appears to establish quite conclusively that the vehicles met just south of the railway crossing. Miss Youzwa testified that they met \u201cabout a car length before the tracks\u201d. Roseann Markling testified that the vehicles met right at the railroad crossing. There was no other evidence on the point. The accident occurred some 450 yards north of the railway crossing so that the vehicle with the bright lights had gone its way and disappeared southwards before the Ewaniuk automobile continuing northward eventually went across the centre of the highway and ran for some 75 yards partly in the west ditch and partly on the pavement and then struck a culvert, passing over the culvert and crashing into the embankment on the other side. The impact was a severe one, for as the learned trial judge said, the automobile was completely demolished.\nThe appellant contends that the circumstances established in evidence which may be summarized as set out below speak for themselves and constitute prima facie evidence that the driver Evelyn Kolendreski showed \u201ca very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d. The circumstances relied on in this regard by the appellant are:\n(1) The driver was inexperienced and possessed only a learner\u2019s licence;\n(2) She was driving at an excessive speed;\n(3) She continued to drive at an excessive speed when asked to slow down by her passengers Roseann Markling and Darlene Youzwa;\n(4) She continued to drive at an excessive speed when it must have been apparent to her that the licensed operator who, by s. 66 of The Vehicles Act of Saskatchewan was required to be beside her, was asleep;\n(5) She continued to drive after reaching the highway when she had undertaken to drive only to the highway;\n(6) She failed to slow down significantly when her vision was impaired by the lights of the approaching vehicle, but instead increased her speed, saying \u201cI must speed up to get away from these lights\u201d.\n(7) She ran off the left side of the road and into the west ditch on a straight stretch of road without the intervention of any other traffic, obstacle or object some 375 yards north of where the vehicles met.\nThis case is similar in many respects to the case of Walker v. Coates et al.[4] The facts in Walker v. Coates were that Barry Alan Coates was driving his Volkswagen automobile when, at about 3:30 a.m. on September 22, 1963, when the vehicle was being driven south towards Banff on a two-lane paved highway 36\u00bd feet in width, had crossed the centre double traffic line and struck a direction sign pointing to the entrance of Buffalo Paddock which was 18 inches off the eastern or left edge of the highway. There were no skid marks where the car approached the sign and the force of the impact was evidently very great. The driver Barry Alan Coates was killed and the passenger Walker injured. Walker was asleep in the back seat of the car at the time and could give no evidence as to how the accident had happened. It was contended on behalf of the appellant Walker that the circumstances of the accident spoke for themselves and constituted prima facie evidence of the fact that in driving his Volkswagen as he did at a high rate of speed across the centre line of the highway and across the left lanes so as to collide forcibly with the road sign, the driver Barry Alan Coates showed \u201ca very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d. Speaking for the Court, Ritchie J. said in this regard:\nThe application of the rule which is usually referred to as res ipsa loquitur to cases of negligence has been accepted in this Court in the cases of Ottawa Electric Co. v. Crepin, [1931] S.C.R. 407 at p. 411 and Parent v. Lapointe, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 376 at p. 381, in the terms in which it was stated by the Exchequer Chamber in Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Company, (1865), 3 H. & C. 596, where it was said:\nThere must be reasonable evidence of negligence.\nBut where the thing is shewn to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.\nThere can be no doubt in the present case that the motor vehicle was under the management of Coates and that the accident was one which in the ordinary course of things would not have happened if he had used proper care, but it is contended on behalf of the respondent that the rule does not extend to proof of gross negligence.\nThis proposition was advanced by Ruttan J. sitting at trial in the case of Ball v. Kraft, (1967), 60 D.L.R. (2d) 35, where he said, at p. 39:\n\u2026Kerr v. Cummings, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 846, 6 W.W.R. (N.S.) 451 (affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, [1953] 2 D.L.R. 1, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 147) is authority for the principle that res ipsa loquitur does not apply to create a presumption of gross negligence. Negligence, as that authority holds, may be inferred when the circumstances \u201cwarrant the view that the fact of the accident is relevant to infer negligence.\u201d [[1952] 2 D.L.R. at p. 852]. But the plaintiff must still prove gross negligence. Robertson J.A. in our Court of Appeal in Kerr v. Cummings, [1952] 2 D.L.R. at p. 853, said:\n\u201cUnless the plaintiff in an action for gross negligence, when the cause of the accident is unknown, suggests a reason showing a greater probability that the accident may have happened from gross negligence than from the reason suggested by the defendant, the plaintiff must fail.\u201d And in the Supreme Court of Canada, [1953] 2 D.L.R. at p. 2, Kerwin J., in giving the judgment of the Court said:\n\u201c\u2026it is impossible, in my view, to say that the mere happening of the occurrence in the present case gives rise to a presumption that it was caused by very great negligence\u2026\u201d\nIt is, in my view, clear that Mr. Justice Kerwin intended his observations to be limited, as he says himself, to the facts of the case with which he was dealing, and although those facts were similar to the facts in the present case, there were marked differences amongst which was the fact that in the Kerr case, supra, there was \u201ca governor on the car which precluded a speed exceeding 40 miles per hour\u201d. In the Kerr case Mr. Justice Kerwin also made an express finding to the effect that he could not read the evidence as indicating either that the driver had been without sleep during the previous night or that he had fallen asleep at the wheel.\nThe passage from the judgment of Robertson J.A. in the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Kerr v. Cummings to which Ruttan J. referred in Ball v. Kraft is based on the authority of an English Admiralty case The Kite, [1933] P. 154, where Langton J., sitting alone, approved the dissenting judgment of Lord Dunedin in the Scottish case of Ballard v. North British Railway, Co., [1923] S.C. (H.L.) 43 at 54. The passage which he approved reads, in part, as follows:\nI think this is a case where the circumstances warrant the view that the fact of the accident is relevant to infer negligence. But what is the next step? I think that, if the defenders can show a way in which the accident may have occurred without negligence, the cogency of the fact of the accident by itself disappears, and the pursuer is left as he began, namely, that he has to show negligence. I need scarcely add that the suggestion of how the accident may have occurred must be a reasonable suggestion.\nIf the rule of res ipsa loquitur is accepted in cases where proof of \u201cnegligence\u201d is in issue, I can see no logical reason why it should not apply with equal force when the issue is whether or not there was \u201cvery great negligence\u201d provided, of course, that the facts of themselves afford \u201creasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose\u201d as a result of \u201ca very marked departure from the standards\u201d to which Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. referred in the McCulloch case.\nIn the Walker v. Coates case it was established in evidence that Barry Alan Coates knew he was tired and sleepy when he set out for Banff, and it was established that he had had very little sleep for 36 hours before the accident.\nI am aware that this is an appeal in which neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan was prepared to draw an inference of wilful and wanton misconduct, but as no question arises as to the veracity of the appellant\u2019s witnesses this is, I think, a case which is governed by the language of Lord Halsbury in Montgomerie & Co., Ltd. v. Wallace-James[5], which was affirmed by the Privy Council in Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Insurance Co.[6] Lord Halsbury said in part:\n\u2026where no question arises as to truthfulness, and where the question is as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence, then the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges of an Appellate Court.\nAccordingly, considering the evidence as a whole, I am of the view that the appellant did establish that the driver Evelyn Kolendreski, in the manner in which she was driving at the time of the accident, showed \u201ca very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\u201d.\nThe respondents John Ewaniuk and Evelyn Kolendreski are, therefore, liable under s. 168(2) of The Vehicles Act of Saskatchewan. I express no view as to the liability of Morris Ewaniuk. The question of the liability, if any, of a licensed operator accompanying the holder of a learner\u2019s licence pursuant to s. 66(3) of The Vehicles Act of Saskatchewan for the negligence or for the wilful and wanton misconduct of that person is left open.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed against the respondents John Ewaniuk and Evelyn Kolendreski with costs here and in the Courts below and judgment should be entered against them in favour of the appellant for the amount fixed by the learned trial judge, namely, the sum of $12,000. The appeal and the action against the respondent Morris Ewaniuk should be dismissed without costs here or in the Courts below.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Hall and I fully agree that this appeal should be disposed of in the manner which he suggests, but I would like to make it plain that I do not consider this to be a case to which the maxim res ipsa loquitur is applicable. Here there is direct evidence of the negligence which forms the basis of the finding of liability against Evelyn Kolendreski and it is therefore unnecessary to have resort to the rule which is embodied in the maxim to which I have referred.\nAppeal allowed against owner and driver with costs; appeal against licensed operator accompanying driver dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Rees, Shmigelsky, Angene & Carey, Saskatoon.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Goetz & Murphy, Regina.\n[1] (1967), 62 W.W.R. 383.\n[2] [1942] S.C.R. 141 at 145.\n[3] [1951] S.C.R. 450 at 451.\n[4] [1968] S.C.R. 599.\n[5] [1904] A.C. 73 at 75.\n[6] [1919] A.C. 254 at 257.\n"

The game played was bridge; and fees were charged to the players. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and ruled that bridge was a game of mixed chance and skill. The appellants obtained leave to appeal to this Court where the question raised was as to whether there was any evidence upon which the Court of Appeal could find that the game of bridge was a game within the definition of \u201cgame\u201d in s. 168(1)(f) of the Criminal Code.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: Bridge is a game containing an element of chance and an element of skill and is, therefore, a \u201cgame\u201d within the meaning of s. 168(1)(f) of the Code. It was clear that Parliament intended to avoid the uncertainties involved in determining what is the dominant element and deliberately chose to include in the definition of \u201cgame\u201d all mixed games as well as games of chance.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: In the game of bridge the only chance involved is the chance in the dealing of the cards. The element of skill predominates in the playing of the game. On that basis, the game of bridge is not a game of chance or mixed chance and skill. The predominance of skill indicates that it should not be considered as being within the words of the statute \u201ca game of mixed chance and skill\u201d.

Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Spence \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the appellants\u2019 conviction. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nG. Arthur Martin, Q.C., for the appellants.\nClay M. Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by PIGEON J.:\u2014The appellants have been convicted on the charge of keeping \u201ca common gaming house\u201d. The agreed statement of facts shows that they were officers of an unincorporated bridge and social club. The game played was bridge and the players were charged for playing it the following fees:\nFor one pivot, which is the equivalent of three rubbers, the charge of $1.00; for more than one pivot but less than two pivots, the charge of $1.25; for two complete pivots, a charge of $1.50; for more than two pivots but less than three pivots, a charge of $1.75; and for three pivots or more, a maximum charge of $2.00.\nThe question raised on the appeal is the following:\nWas there any evidence upon which the Court of Appeal for Ontario could find that the game of bridge was a \u201cgame\u201d within the definition of \u201cgame\u201d in section 168(1) (f) of the Criminal Code?\nThe following provisions of s. 168 of the Criminal Code should be considered:\n168. (1) In this Part,\n* * *\n(d) \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d means a place that is\n(i) kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or\n(ii) kept or used for the purpose of playing games\n(A) in which a bank is kept by one or more but not all of the players,\n(B) in which all or any portion of the bets on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly, to the keeper of the place,\n(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged by the players for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or\n(D) in which the chances of winning are not equally favourable to all persons who play the game, including the person, if any, who conducts the game;\n* * *\n(f) \u201cgame\u201d means a game of chance or mixed chance and skill;\n* * *\n(2) A place is not a common gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)\n(a) while it is occupied and used by an incorporated bona fide social club or branch thereof if\n(i) the whole or any portion of the bets on or proceeds from games played therein is not directly or indirectly paid to the keeper thereof, and\n(ii) no fee in excess of ten cents an hour or fifty cents a day is charged to persons for the right or privilege of participating in the games played therein; or\u2026 A brief description of the game of bridge, more precisely contract bridge, was given in evidence. It is sufficient to say that it shows that the cards in the hands of each of the four players are determined by chance but that afterwards the outcome of the game depends in substantial measure upon the skill of the players in bidding and in playing their hands. In this the only element of chance is that which results from the deal and the fact that only the hand of the dummy is disclosed to the other players after the bidding. The opinion of an expert bridge player heard as the only witness was that, on the whole, the element of skill outweighs the element of chance. Appellants\u2019 contention is that this takes the game of bridge out of the category of games of mixed chance and skill.\nIn considering this submission, it is convenient to start by examining the language used in the enactment. Taken by themselves the words used in the definition of \u201cgame\u201d are not ambiguous. They apply to any game of chance only or of mixed chance and skill. The word \u201cmixed\u201d implies no indication of the respective proportions of the two elements. Nothing shows that they must be equal or nearly so. Nothing indicates which is to be preponderant. The first rule to observe in construing any legislative enactment is that unless there is ambiguity, it is to be applied literally.\nIn the Encyclopedia Britannica, under the heading \u201cgaming and wagering\u201d, one reads:\nIn England and the United States a general distinction between lawful and unlawful gaming seems to be that where skill predominates, the gaming is lawful; where chance does, it is unlawful (27 Corpus Juris p. 969). A court must decide which is the predominant factor in the case of each game in question. Cases show that one cannot rely on the record, for it is full of reversals and contradictions.\nIt seems clear that the Parliament of Canada sought to avoid the uncertainties involved in trying to ascertain the predominant factor in mixed games by enacting that they would be treated in the same way as games of pure chance. The law in force prior to the enactment of the 1892 Criminal Code was the Gaming Houses Act originally enacted by 38 Vict., c. 41, reproduced in R.S.C. 1886, c. 158. As in the United Kingdom act, 17-18 Vict., c. 38, \u201cunlawful game\u201d was not defined. From the decision of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division in Jenks v. Turpin[2], it would appear that card games were considered \u201cunlawful\u201d if they were games of chance, or games of chance and skill combined which cannot be called games of mere skill.\nWhen the first criminal code was enacted (55-56 Vict., c. 29), s. 196 read as follows:\n196. A common gaming-house is\u2014\n(a) a house, room or place kept by any person for gain, to which persons resort for the purpose of playing at any game of chance; or\n(b) a house, room or place kept or used for playing therein at any game of chance, or any mixed game of chance and skill, in which\u2014\n(i) a hand is kept by one or more of the players exclusively of the others; or\n(ii) in which any game is played the chances of which are not alike favourable to all the players, including among the players the banker or other person by whom the game is managed, or against whom the game is managed, or against whom the other players stake, play or bet.\nThree years later, chapter 40 of 58-59 Vict, added to paragraph a \u201cor at any mixed game of chance and skill\u201d, thus making the two paragraphs identical in that respect.\nWhat is now subpara. B of para, (ii) of the definition of \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d was added in 1919 by 8-9 Geo. V, c. 16. Sections 4 and 5 of the same statute also replaced the words \u201cany unlawful game\u201d by \u201cany game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill\u201d in s. 985 (702 of the 1892 Criminal Code, 169 of the present Criminal Code) and made a similar change in s. 986 (703 of the 1892 Code). Those two sections had their origin in ss. 4 and 8 of the Gaming Houses Act and it is apparent that the purpose of the amendment was to preclude any possibility of construction by reference to the law prior to the Criminal Code.\nWhat is now in substance subpara. (C) of para, (ii) of the definition of \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d as well as subs. 2 of article 168 was added in 1938 (c. 44, s. 12). This came shortly after a decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, Rex v. Williamson[3], in which it held that a certain club could no longer be considered as not operating for gain as this Court had on different facts decided, a few years before, in Bampton v. The King[4]. No changes of substance have been made since that time and in the present Criminal Code, the maximum fees for playing games in clubs remain those that were established by the 1938 statute.\nTo support their contention that in classifying games, one has to ascertain what is the dominant element, appellants contend that there is an element of chance in every game, even in those that are admittedly games of skill such as chess, tennis and golf. This argument overlooks the principle that statutes must be read in accordance with the usual and accepted meaning of the words used. It is undoubtedly true that there are chances involved in any human activity and that, statistically, results are never predictable with complete certainty. However, when the statute speaks of chance as opposed to skill, it is clear that it contemplates not the unpredictables that may occasionally defeat skill but the systematic resort to chance involved in many games such as the throw of dice, the deal of cards.\nAmong dictionary definitions, the following appear to be of some interest:\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary:\nThe expression games of chance is used to describe those contests the outcome of which is largely governed by chance, as in cards, dice and gambling games generally; and in opposition to games of skill the result of which depends largely upon the dexterity of the contestant.\nBouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary. Vo Gaming:\nThere are some games which depend altogether upon skill, others which depend upon chance, and others which are of a mixed nature. Billiards is an example of the first; lottery, of the second; and backgammon, of the last.\nLarousse XXe si\u00e8cle:\nJeu de hasard. Jeu dans lequel le hasard seul d\u00e9cide de la perte ou du gain.\nJeux d\u2019adresse. Jeux o\u00f9 l\u2019adresse a la principale part, comme le billard, la balle, etc.\nRobert Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise:\nJeux mixtes, o\u00f9 le hasard peut \u00eatre plus ou moins corrig\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide du calcul ou de certaines combinaisons.\nHaving cited the above definition of \u201cjeux mixtes\u201d (mixed games) given by a French lexicographer, I must add that French courts having to apply criminal code provisions aimed at games of chance (\u201cjeux de hasard\u201d) only, have held those provisions applicable to games in which chance is the predominating element, not to those in which skill predominates, and have placed bridge among the latter.\nDalloz Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire. Vo Jeu.\nN\u00b0 37. Depuis 1877, la jurisprudence attribue le caract\u00e8re de jeu de hasard \u00e0 tous les jeux dans lesquels la chance pr\u00e9domine sur l\u2019adresse et les combinaisons de l\u2019intelligence. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re comme jeux de hasard: le loto, le poker, le baccara, les petits chevaux.

However, granting that, in the application of legislative provisions aimed at games of chance (\u201cjeux de hasard\u201d) the generally accepted view is that these include only games of pure chance or games in which chance is the dominating element, it does not follow that all other games must be considered as games of skill within the meaning of a code provision contemplating not only games of chance, but games of mixed chance and skill as well. To admit appellants\u2019 contention that mixed games in which skill is a dominant element are to be considered as games of skill really means to deprive of any effect the words \u201cor mixed chance and skill\u201d.\nIn my opinion this would be contrary to Parliament\u2019s clearly expressed intention. It is clear that Parliament intended to avoid the uncertainties involved in determining what is the dominant element and deliberately chose to include in the definition of \u201cgame\u201d all mixed games as well as games of chance.\nConcerning Wurtele J.\u2019s dictum in The King v. Fortier[5], it must be noted that it is not only obiter but entirely unsupported by any reference or analysis of the enactment.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] pronounced on July 4, 1967, wherein that Court dismissed an appeal from the conviction of the three accused by the police magistrate at Toronto on September 22, 1966. The three accused were convicted on the charge that:\nwithin six months ending on the 12th day of March, A.D. 1966, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did keep a common gaming house situate and known as 3101 Bathurst Street, Suite 201, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nAlthough the Crown, at the commencement of the trial, adduced the evidence of detective John Frederick Ley-bourne, upon the continuation of the trial on a later date, an agreed statement of facts was submitted. That statement with the evidence of Mr. Eric Murray, who was called as the only defence witness, comprised the complete record considered by the learned magistrate. Mr. Murray was described by McLennan J.A., in the Court of Appeal, as follows: \u201cHis qualifications as an expert on the game of bridge are impressive.\u201d In view of the offices held by Mr. Murray, as taken from his own evidence, that description may be said to be, at any rate, not put too strongly. Upon such evidence, and after the submission of argument in writing, the learned magistrate convicted the three accused. That conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, McLennan J.A. giving in writing the reasons of the Court.\nThe three accused applied for and obtained leave to appeal to this Court, and served a notice of appeal in which was set out the following ground of law:\nWas there any evidence upon which the Court of Appeal for Ontario could find that the game of bridge was a \u201cgame\u201d within the definition of \u201cgame\u201d in section 168(1) (f) of the Criminal Code?\nMcLennan J.A., in giving the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nThe narrow question is whether a card game called \u201cBridge\u201d is a game of skill, in which event the convictions cannot stand, or whether it is a game of chance or of mixed chance and skill, and if so, the convictions must be affirmed.\nSection 176(1) of the Criminal Code provides:\n176. (1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\nSection 168(1) of the Criminal Code provides, in part:\n168. (1) In this Part,\n* * *\n(d) \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d means a place that is\n(i) kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or (ii) kept or used for the purpose of playing games\n(A) in which a bank is kept by one or more but not all of the players,\n(B) in which all or any portion of the bets on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly, to the keeper of the place,\n(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or\n(D) in which the chances of winning are not equally favourable to all persons who play the game, including the person, if any, who conducts the game;\n* * *\n(f) \u201cgame\u201d means a game of chance or mixed chance and skill;\nIt will be seen from a perusal of this section that the ground of law cited by the appellants for the determination of this Court is essentially the same question as that set out by McLennan J.A. and which I have quoted above.\nCounsel for the Crown before this Court took the position that whether or not the game of bridge was one of skill, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, a game of chance, or mixed chance and skill, was a question of fact and not a question of law, that that question of fact had been resolved by the magistrate and therefore there was no question of law to submit to this Court. Counsel cited authority for that proposition: R. v. Thompson[7], per Lewis J. at p. 94. I am of the opinion that such objection is not well based. What this Court must do is interpret the words in s. 168(1) (f) of the Criminal Code \u201cmeans a game of chance or mixed chance and skill\u201d and that interpretation is a question of law. As I have said, the magistrate came to his decision upon consideration of the agreed statement of facts and of the evidence of Mr. Murray. That agreed statement of facts must be set out in full. It is as follows:\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nThe North York Bridge and Social Club is located at 3101 Bathurst Street, Toronto, in Suite 201 of an office building and its name is listed as a tenant on the main directory in the lobby of the building. The facilities and amenities provided by the Club are as indicated in the photographs of the Club premises filed as exhibits. These facilities include: one long room with card tables; an area where a restaurant is set up with tables on which food may be served; a partitioned area used as an office; and a room used as a lounge with television and other amenities. The Club premises are open from twelve noon until midnight, and sometimes later, seven days per week. The premises, during the six months prior to March 11, 1966 were used primarily for the playing of card games.\nDuring the period in question, the accused, George Banks, who is aged 42, married, with one child, and is a local Toronto business man was elected President of the Club. Mr. Banks is of previous good character and has carried on business in the city of Toronto as a purse and belt manufacturer for some twenty-five years. The accused, Leo Ross, who is aged 32, married, and of previous good character, was employed as a Bridge Instructor and was also elected an officer of the Club. Mr. Ross is a recognized bridge expert in the city of Toronto and has worked as a Bridge Instructor in several bridge clubs in the city. He was at various times in charge of the premises. The accused, Floyd Dyson, was employed as a Bridge Director sometime in the month of February 1966 and at a meeting of the Club members was elected a member of the executive.\nA copy of the minutes of the said meeting have been filed as an exhibit. Mr. Dyson is of previous good character and has been a recognized bridge player in the city of Toronto for a number of years and has instructed in the game of bridge.\nIn accordance with various invoices and the ledger book of the Club filed as exhibits, all of the furniture and fixtures in and about the Club premises are owned by the North York Bridge and Social Club; and were paid for by the North York Bridge and Social Club. The Club maintains a bank account and all monies received are deposited to the credit of the Club and all disbursements are paid out of Club funds. The four officers of the Club are George Banks, Leo Ross, Floyd Dyson and Morris Taylor; and any two of the said officers have signing privileges on the Club account for the disbursal of funds.\nSometime during the month of December, 1964, the accused Banks contacted Sergeant of Detectives, John Wilson, respecting the proposed operation of a bridge and social club. Sergeant Wilson advised Banks as to the means of becoming incorporated.\nOn December 29, 1964, one Louis Silver, a Solicitor acting on behalf of Banks and other proposed incorporators also contacted Sergeant Wilson as to the proposed club. As a result, Mr. Silver, on January 4, 1965, sent a letter to the Ontario Provincial Secretary\u2019s Office as to the proposed incorporation. Further correspondence was exchanged between Silver and the Provincial Secretary\u2019s Office leading to an application for incorporation being submitted on January 14, 1965. Photostatic copies of this correspondence have been filed as exhibits. A copy of the final application for incorporation as submitted to the Provincial Secretary\u2019s department has also been filed as an exhibit.\nIn March of 1965, the Club began actual operations, On September 24, 1965, the Provincial Secretary\u2019s Office advised Mr. Silver that it would not approve the application for incorporation at that time. Meanwhile, on August 12, 1965, officers from the Morality Squad of the Metropolitan Toronto Police force attended at the Club premises. It was observed that there were approximately 40 men playing cards at the time. In some of the games, the officers observed that there was an exchange of money between players taking part in the games. It was learned that the Club charged an annual membership fee of $35.00, an amount arrived at by the auditors of the Club as being appropriate to cover the then expenses of running the Club and to be adjusted as required for this purpose.\nThere were seven additional attendances by various members of the Morality Squad from December 13, 1965 to and including March 11, 1966. All these attendances were pursuant to warrants to search filed as exhibits in this case. During all these attendances, card games were observed to be played. All the visits made by the police to the premises were made during the afternoon hours with the exception of one visit which was made during the evening hours. During the afternoon visits, the officers did not observe any bridge being played, however, at the time of the evening attendances upon the premises, two games of bridge were in fact in progress.\nIt would appear that the fees charged for playing bridge are as follows: for one pivot, which is the equivalent of three rubbers, the charge of $1.00; for more than one pivot but less than two pivots, the charge of $1.25; for two complete pivots, a charge of $1.50, for more than two pivots but less than three pivots, a charge of $1.75; and for three pivots or more, a maximum charge of $2.00. The length of a rubber would be approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, and consequently, an average pivot would be about one hour.\nOn March 11, 1966, various articles on the premises were seized pursuant to a warrant to search. Among those articles were decks of playing cards. During the last seven visits, either the accused Banks or the accused Ross was warned by the officers attending that in their opinion, the operation of the Club violated the Canadian Criminal Code. It seems, on the other hand, that Mr. Silver had previously advised Banks and other members of the Club including Ross, that in his opinion, the operation of the Club on the basis of instructions given to him were not in contravention of the provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code.\nThe ledger of the Club was seized on March 11, 1966 and filed as an exhibit. This ledger was prepared by a chartered accountant and is admittedly in good order. It has one sheet entitled \u201cCard Fees\u201d which sheet reveals the amounts that were collected for card fees during the time of the operation of the Club. The yearly dues supplemented by the above card fees constituted the only revenues to the Club. The restaurant facilities are provided to the operator of the restaurant and all profits derived from the operation of the restaurant are retained by the operator without any payment being made to the Club.\nI shall attempt to summarize the evidence given by Mr. Murray. Having outlined his qualifications, he very tersely described the game of bridge in a few paragraphs as follows:\nQ. Now, will you explain to the Court how bridge is played and the basis on which it\u2019s played?\nA. Well, very briefly, bridge is a card game and it\u2019s played with the full deck of fifty-two cards. Thirteen cards are dealt to each four players who participate in partnerships, one partnership against the other.\nThe cards are dealt thirteen face down to each player and thereafter the partnerships bid\u2014the players bid in rotation, attempting to reach certain contracts.\nWhen a final contract has been determined, then a person who has named the suit first becomes the declarer. His partner spreads his hand face up on the table, which becomes the dummy, and the play commences and you can play through by tricks, each trick consisting of four cards, one card from each player\u2019s hand, including the dummy, to each trick. You bid and achieve game contracts or parts of contracts. With slam contracts you receive points bonuses so that your end result is correlated into points, and these points are kept on a tabulation.\nMr. Murray continued to testify that the literature as to the game of bridge was voluminous consisting of many hundreds of books and a very large number of magazines, monthly publications in Canada, North America and throughout Europe. He pointed out that bridge was now played on a basis of international competition, likening it to the Davis Cup in tennis. Mr. Murray then dealt with the elements of chance and skill in the playing of the game of bridge. He quite freely admitted that the dealing of the cards was altogether a matter of chance. He described the deal as \u201cthat is merely putting the weapons in the players\u2019 hands\u201d and continued, \u201cwell, once the cards are dealt, the game is entirely skill, in my opinion\u201d. Mr. Murray contrasted the game of bridge with other card games such as poker and pointed out that in the latter there was, what he described, as the co-mingling throughout the game of skill and chance, and then testified, \u201cthis isn\u2019t true of bridge at all; once the cards are dealt it becomes a question of conveying information between a partnership within the limits of the rules of the game and then once the cards are dealt the dummy becomes a question of playing the hand the most skilful way you can\u201d. The latter part of this sentence is an accurate quotation from the evidence as certified but the word \u201cdummy\u201d must be an error. Mr. Murray was of the opinion that after the deal theoretically there is no opportunity for chance to enter into the playing of the game. He remarked that it was possible for an individual to play a hand that, in his opinion, might be played badly and yet he might succeed, but that had nothing to do with chance because a skilful player, even in a short game, is going to succeed. Then, in cross-examination, he added: \u201cCertainly over any lengthy period of time it\u2019s virtually a certainty, if the period of time is long, you have control of the situation if you have skill\u201d.\nMr. Murray gave as his opinion that in any game there was some element of chance however small and he used as an example two games which could easily be considered those of pure skill: firstly, a chess game between masters, and, secondly, a finely played tennis match. In the first case, he pointed out that the chance slamming of a door nearby when a chess master was in deep concentration might disturb his thinking and cause him to make a poor move, and, in the second case, a chance pebble on an otherwise perfectly prepared court, might cause a ball to twist out of line. Those are both examples of what I might term accidental hazards. An example had occurred to me of tournament professional golf, where a bad lie on a fairway 285 yards away from the tee and quite imperceptible might cause difficulty to even the most skilful and cautious player.\nMcLennan J.A., in giving the reasons for the Court of Appeal, expressed the view that the element of chance caused originally by the deal continued to affect the play of the game thereafter. In short, that there was the same co-mingling of chance and skill as Mr. Murray had pointed out would occur in a poker game. The learned justice in appeal said:\nThe play of the hand follows the bidding. The play consists of each of the players, in some order or other, which has not been described in the evidence, placing a card on the table with one from the exposed hand and such cards constitute a \u201ctrick\u201d. As each player has 13 cards to start with there must be 13 tricks, won or lost, following each deal. One must assume, because it was not otherwise stated, that the play of 13 tricks following a deal is an individual game or part of a game. It seems a reasonable inference from the reference in Mr. Murray\u2019s evidence to \u201cbidding\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d that the partnership making the highest bid undertakes or contracts to win a certain number of the 13 tricks. The winning of a trick must be based upon some values determined either by certain differences between the cards or some rule of the game giving values to groups of cards. It is obvious that such values, and they may be the same or different values from the bidding values, must determine whether a trick is won or lost, and since what particular cards and the playing values thereof each player has is determined by the chance of the deal, the play of the cards or the way in which they can be played are substantially affected by chance. The defensive play, no doubt, refers to the play of the cards by the partnership opposing the partnership making the highest bid and defensive play would also be substantially affected by chance for the same reasons as the play.\nWith respect, these conclusions do not seem to be in accordance with the evidence given by Mr. Murray. Once the cards were, by chance, dealt thirteen to each player, then it was the task of each of those players by the exercise of his skill to inform his partner with a very considerable degree of accuracy what thirteen cards, which had been so dealt to him by chance, he held in his hand. It is also the part of each pair of players, by the process of bidding, to deceive their two opponents as to the values of the cards which they held in their hands. When the bidding was completed, it was the part of each of the players to so play the thirteen cards in his hand as to arrive, in the case of those successful in the bidding, at the contract which they had declared and in the case of those who were unsuccessful in the bidding to defeat that contract.\nI am of the opinion that once the cards had been dealt then in the progress of the play all element of chance disappears and any chance thereafter can only result from the deal. In these circumstances, therefore, I believe it must be taken as established that in the game of bridge the only chance involved is the chance in the dealing of the cards and that certainly the element of skill predominates in the playing of the game. It is the submission of counsel for the appellants that on that basis the game of bridge is not \u201ca game of chance or mixed chance and skill\u201d.\nI am of the view that there is some aid in interpretation in the submission made to us by counsel for the appellants that in a very complete research of prosecution as to gaming in Canada and the United Kingdom he had not found a single case where the playing of a game of bridge had been the subject of prosecution. There is a series of cases dealing with other games where remarks have been made, perhaps obiter, by the courts indicating that in the view of those courts the game of bridge was a game of skill or even of pure skill. So, in Woolf v. Freeman[8], Macnaghten J. remarked at p. 181:\nIt is certainly lawful to play bridge. In playing games of cards some skill is required. Bridge is a game of skill, but whether poker is a game of skill is more questionable.\nIn D\u2019Orio v. Leigh & Cuthbertson Ltd.[9], Ellis, Co. Ct. J., said at p. 156:\nAfter the problem to be played is determined by the method above stated, it appears that skill, if it is not entirely necessary to win the game, predominates and the element of chance if, not negligible, is a no greater factor than it is in any game of skill such as bridge.\nIn re Betty Loeb Allen[10], Gibson C.J. said, at p. 281:\nThe rules of the game of bridge, which have been established on an international basis, are set forth in encyclopedias and other texts, and we are satisfied from the rules and from the many publications on the subject that the game is predominantly one of skill. In Regina v. Thompson[11], Lewis J. said:\nBearing in mind that all games of cards are made unlawful by statute and that the Gaming Act, 1845, did not repeal specifically that part of the statute of 33 Hen. 8 which dealt with \u201ccarding\u201d, we are of opinion that the proper question for a jury, when dealing with a game of cards, is: Is this a game of skill, i.e., a game in which the element of chance is so slight as to render the game one which can properly be said to be a game of mere skill?\n(The underlining is my own.)\nIn my view, we are not assisted by a general statement as to games of cards, such as made by Chancellor Boyd in The King v. Laird[12]:\nEuchre is a well known game at cards, imported from the States and it is a game of chance.\nNor that made by Harvey C.J., dissenting, in the Supreme Court of Alberta, in Rex v. Ring Hoy[13]:\nThe ordinary game of cards in which there is a chance in the deal of the cards as to the value of the hands dealt to each player is a game in which chance and skill are combined, and that is no doubt what is meant by the expression \u201cmixed game of chance and skill\u201d.\nIt may be noted that the actual game involved in this case was that of fan-tan which is surely a game of chance alone.\nCounsel for the appellant stressed in his argument to this Court a statement made by Wurtele J. in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, in the Province of Quebec, in The King v. Fortier[14]:\nA game of chance is one in which hazard entirely predominates; and a mixed game of chance and skill is one in which the element of hazard prevails notwithstanding the skill and adroitness of the gamesters and the combinations brought to bear by their understanding and ability.\nIt is the submission of counsel that the interpretation of the words in s. 168(1) of the Criminal Code \u201cor mixed chance and skill\u201d should therefore be that in order to fall within such classification the game must be one in which chance prevails over skill or predominates and that, therefore, a game of bridge in which any element of chance ends with the deal and where that element of chance is overcome and very much subordinated by the exhibition of skill thereafter should not be classed as such a mixed game. Although in the Fortier case the game of bridge was not being considered at all, certainly the element of predominance of one factor or the other was considered by the learned justice in appeal to be a telling and important element. On the basis that there must be some chance in every game, as Mr. Murray testified, I am of the opinion that the statements made in the Woolf case, in the D\u2019Orio case, and in the Betty Loeb Allen case support the contention that the predominance of skill in the game of bridge should indicate that it is not properly considered a game of mixed chance and skill. Indeed in the Betty Loeb Allen case a conviction for permitting an illegal game to be played was quashed by the Supreme Court of California for that exact reason. I have come to this conclusion much assisted by the test stated by Lewis J., giving judgment for the Court of Criminal Appeals in R. v. Thompson, supra, when he put the question \u201cIs this a game of skill, i.e., a game in which the element of chance is so slight as to render the game one which can properly be said to be a game of mere skill?\u201d\nThe question arises, of course, that if a game is a game of chance, when although skill is present chance predominates, then what is the necessity of the words in the statute \u201ca game of mixed chance and skill\u201d. The explanation may well be found in the judgment of Salmond J. in Weathered v. Fitzgibbon[15]:\nThe term \u201cgame of chance\u201d is, however, ambiguous. It may be limited to games which are pure games of chance, or it may also include games, such as most games of cards, which are games of chance and skill combined. The question as to the true interpretation in this respect of s. 10 of the Gaming Act was considered and determined by this Court in Scott v. Jackson, [1911] N.Z.L.R. 1025. There, if I understand the decision aright, it was held that the term \u201cgame of chance\u201d as used in s. 10 of the Gaming Act is limited to games of pure chance, and does not include games of mixed chance and skill. This decision is chiefly based on the provisions in pari materia of s. 163 of the Crimes Act, 1908, defining the indictable offence of keeping a common gaming\u2011house, in which a distinction is drawn by the Legislature between games of chance and games of mixed chance and skill. It was held accordingly that the term \u201cgame of chance\u201d as used in the corresponding provisions of the Gaming Act was similarly used by the Legislature as distinguished from games in which chance was combined with skill. By a game of pure chance I understand to be meant a game in which there is either no element of skill whatever, or an element of skill so unsubstantial and unimportant that for all practical purposes the game is one of chance exclusively. All such games are unlawful games within the meaning of s. 10 of the Gaming Act. But this section has no application to games of mixed skill and chance\u2014that is to say, to games in which there exists a substantially operative element of skill\u2014for example, most games of cards.\nThe legislator, therefore, desiring to include in the prohibition not only games of pure chance but games where, although a degree of skill was present, the predominating element was chance, used the words as they appear in the present statute. I am none the less of the opinion that in the game of bridge, where the element of skill far outweighs any element of chance and where in fact the element of chance is a mere coincidental preliminary, it should not be considered as being within the words of the statute \u201ca game of mixed chance and skill\u201d.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.\nAppeal dismissed, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellants: G.A.

The trial judge instructed the jury that they did not have to accept the explanations given to the police by the accused because they had not been given under oath. Upon counsel for the accused taking objection to that portion of the charge, the trial judge recharged the jury that they were not to take the previous charge as meaning that the onus was upon the accused to testify, and that the jury was not to be influenced by their failure to testify. It was argued before the Court of Appeal that these observations offended against the provisions of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, as being a comment on the failure of the accused to testify, and that a new trial should necessarily be had. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The language used by the trial judge was not so much a \u201ccomment\u201d on the failure of the accused to testify as a statement of their right to refrain from doing so, and it should not be taken to have been the intention of Parliament in enacting s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act to preclude judges from explaining to juries the law with respect to the rights of accused persons in this regard. The remarks of the judge viewed in context and on a reasonable interpretation do not amount to a comment in breach of the section. That section was enacted for the protection of accused persons against the danger of having their right not to testify presented to the jury in such fashion as to suggest that their silence is being used as a cloak for their guilt. It would be \u201cmost naive\u201d to ignore the fact that when an accused fails to testify, there must be at least some jurors who say to themselves \u201cif he didn\u2019t do it, why didn\u2019t he say so\u201d. It is for this reason that it is of the greatest importance that a trial judge should remain unhampered in his right to point out to the jury that there is no onus on the accused to prove his innocence by going into the witness box. To construe s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act as interfering with that right not to testify would run contrary to the purpose of the section itself.\nEven if the comment was a violation of s. 4(5), this was a proper case for the application of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.\nPer Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge\u2019s explanations clearly violated s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act. Consequently, an error fatal to the validity of the proceedings has occurred and the remedy is not in trying to speculate whether it had a material or no effect on the jury, but in a new trial.\nDroit criminel\u2014Proc\u00e8s par jury\u2014Possession d\u2019instruments d\u2019effraction\u2014Les directives du juge au jury \u00e9taient-elles des commentaires sur l\u2019abstention des accus\u00e9s de t\u00e9moigner\u2014Est-ce qu\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s est le seul rem\u00e8de\u2014Loi sur la preuve au Canada, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, art. 4(5)\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 295(1), 592(1)(b)(iii).\nLes appelants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables d\u2019avoir eu en leur possession des instruments d\u2019effraction, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 295(1) du Code criminel. Dans ses directives, le juge au proc\u00e8s a dit aux jur\u00e9s qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s d\u2019accepter les explications donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la police par les accus\u00e9s parce que ces explications n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es sous serment. Lorsque le procureur des accus\u00e9s s\u2019est object\u00e9 \u00e0 cette partie des directives, le juge au proc\u00e8s, dans de nouvelles directives, a dit aux jur\u00e9s qu\u2019ils ne devaient pas consid\u00e9rer les instructions ant\u00e9rieures comme voulant dire qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de t\u00e9moigner, et que les jur\u00e9s ne devaient pas \u00eatre influenc\u00e9s par l\u2019abstention des accus\u00e9s de t\u00e9moigner. En Cour d\u2019appel, on a soutenu que ces remarques allaient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des dispositions de l\u2019art. 4(5) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, S.R.C. 1952, c. 307, comme \u00e9tant un commentaire sur l\u2019abstention des accus\u00e9s de t\u00e9moigner, et qu\u2019il fallait n\u00e9cessairement un nouveau proc\u00e8s. La Cour d\u2019appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Les accus\u00e9s en ont appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Judson et Ritchie: Le langage employ\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 du droit des accus\u00e9s de s\u2019abstenir de t\u00e9moigner qu\u2019un \u00abcommentaire\u00bb sur leur abstention de le faire, et on ne doit pas consid\u00e9rer que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention, par l\u2019art. 4(5) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, d\u2019emp\u00eacher les juges d\u2019expliquer au jury la loi concernant les droits des accus\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les remarques du juge, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es dans leur contexte et raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es, ne sont pas un commentaire en violation de l\u2019article. Le but de cet article est de prot\u00e9ger les accus\u00e9s contre le danger d\u2019avoir leur droit de ne pas t\u00e9moigner pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au jury de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer que leur silence est utilis\u00e9 pour masquer leur culpabilit\u00e9. On serait des plus na\u00effs si on mettait de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le fait que lorsqu\u2019un accus\u00e9 ne t\u00e9moigne pas il y a au moins quelquesuns des jur\u00e9s qui se disent \u00abs\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas fait, pourquoi ne le dit-il pas\u00bb.

Interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 4(5) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada comme portant atteinte \u00e0 ce droit de ne pas t\u00e9moigner irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du but de l\u2019article lui-m\u00eame.\nM\u00eame si le commentaire \u00e9tait une violation de l\u2019art. 4(5), il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on doit appliquer l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code criminel.\nLes Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: Les explications donn\u00e9es par le juge au proc\u00e8s \u00e9taient clairement une violation de l\u2019art. 4(5) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada.

Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the appellants\u2019 conviction. Appeal dismissed, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nJohn O\u2019Driscoll, for the appellants.\nRonald G. Thomas, for the respondent. The judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 affirming the conviction of the appellants on a charge that they did, without lawful excuse, have in their possession instruments for housebreaking contrary to s. 295 (1) of the Criminal Code.\nIt should be said at the outset that this is an appeal brought pursuant to the provisions of s. 597(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and that the jurisdiction of this Court rests upon the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Wells in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe facts which gave rise to this prosecution were that at 12:35 a.m. on September 3, 1966, the appellant Beer was sitting behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle owned by his wife which was parked at the rear of some dry cleaning premises in Sault Ste. Marie. The head lights were turned off, the motor was running and the appellant McConnell was some 60 feet away under an open window of the premises in question. A search of the motor vehicle revealed an iron bar, a screw driver and a table knife either on or under the front seat of the vehicle. Beer admitted ownership of these instruments and told the police that the screw driver was being used because they were having trouble with the ignition and that the bar was used for taking off hub caps. Mrs. Beer gave evidence to the effect that her husband had been using the screw driver to work on the car and that the bar had been moved from the trunk to underneath the front seat at the time of a camping trip during the previous summer when the table knife had also been used. The arrangements that Beer may have made during the previous summer do not appear to me to be an explanation for having the tools where they were found at the time and place in question, and the fact that at the time of the arrest, a complete jack, including a wheel nut wrench with a chisel affair on the other end of it was found in the back trunk of the car, appears to me to weaken considerably the explanation for the presence of the bar under the front seat. In addition to this, Beer\u2019s evidence in explanation of the presence of the bar was elicited on cross-examination of a Crown witness and is self-serving so that in my view its admissibility was highly questionable.\nMcConnell admitted his association with Beer but explained his presence under the open window of the dry cleaning establishment by saying that he was relieving himself. While this may afford a reason for his being where he was, it does not seem to me to afford any explanation for being associated with Beer in the possession of the instruments in question.\nI do not think that it is open to question that the instruments found by the police were capable of being used for housebreaking and it appears to me desirable in this regard to refer to the final paragraph of the reasons for judgment of Judson J., with which the majority of this Court concurred, in Tupper v. The Queen[2] where he spoke of the effect of s. 295(1) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Justice Judson there said:\nOnce possession of an instrument capable of being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.\nIn the present case neither of the accused gave evidence at the trial, and in the course of his charge the learned trial judge pointed out to the jury that they did not have to accept the unsworn explanation which McConnell had given to the police for his presence under the open window.\nUpon counsel for the accused taking objection to this portion of the charge, the learned trial judge recalled the jury and said:\nGentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either of the accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court does point out that these explanations were given and when made were not made under oath and it is not only for that reason alone but for any other number of reasons that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept these explanations.\nIt was argued before the Court of Appeal, as it was before this Court, that these observations offended against the provision of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act and that a new trial should accordingly be had. Section 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act reads as follows:\nThe failure of the person charged or of the wife or husband of such person to testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution.\nMr. Justice Evans, in the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, with which MacKay J.A. agreed, expressed himself in the following terms:\nThe principle underlying the prohibition in Section 4(5) is the protection of the accused. Originally it was part of the same enactment by which the disability of an accused person to testify was removed. R. v. Romano 24 C.C.C. 30. In a jury case when an accused does not testify on his own behalf, this fact is immediately known to the jury and one would be most naive to believe that it is not considered by them in their deliberations. To hold that an accidental slip or an innocuous statement indicating the failure of the accused to testify must ipso facto result in a reversible error does violence to the intent and meaning of the Statute.\nI am of the opinion that the impugned statement must be considered solely in the light of possible prejudice to the accused. If there is no possibility of prejudice then it does not amount to misdirection because it is a statement of law and amounts to an explanation of the legal rights of an accused who has already adopted a position of which the jury is aware. The absence of such a legal explanation might well react unfavourably to the accused particularly when defence counsel fails to explain to the jury his client\u2019s legal right to remain silent.\n* * *\nIn the present case I have carefully considered the \u201ccomment\u201d objected to and I am unable to find that it could be considered in any way prejudicial to the appellants. It is favourable to the accused since it is an explanation of the legal right of the accused persons to adopt the position which they did adopt coupled with a clear warning by the Trial Judge that no prejudicial inference is to be drawn from their election to remain out of the witness box. There is no suggestion in the remarks of the Trial Judge that there was evidence peculiarly within the knowledge of the appellants which they could give and which they failed to give.\nMr. Justice Evans did, however, express the view that \u201conce it was determined that the comment violated the statutory provisions it was a fatal defect and a new trial was mandatory\u201d. Although Mr. Justice MacKay agreed with Evans J.A. that the remarks of the trial judge did not constitute a \u201ccomment\u201d so as to offend against s. 4(5), he did not agree that the effect of such a comment, if made, was to make \u201ca new trial mandatory.\u201d Mr. Justice MacKay said:\nI desire, however, to express the view that even if the comments of the learned trial judge in reference to the appellants not giving evidence could be construed as offending against section 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, that this would be a proper case to apply the provisions of section 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.\nIn his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Wells took the view that in recharging the jury as he did the learned trial judge had made a direct comment on the failure of the accused to testify and that in so doing he had violated the provisions of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, and that a new trial was accordingly necessary. Mr. Justice Wells, who found the matter to be concluded by the decision of this Court in Bigaouette v. The King[3], expressed himself as follows:\nLooking at what the learned trial judge said in the case at bar, it would appear to me that in this case there is a much more direct comment on the failure of the accused to testify in their own defence. It is not a mere pointing out that certain matters are not contradicted, it deals directly with their failure to testify at their trial. In my opinion, this direct comment comes squarely within the prohibition of the Statute and renders a new trial necessary. The matter is decisively concluded in my opinion by the judgment of the late Chief Justice which I have quoted from in Bigaouette v. The King.\nIn the Bigaouette case Sir Lyman Duff, at p. 114, speaking on behalf on this Court, adopted the law as being\n\u2026 correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stewart in Rex v. Gallagher, 1922 37 C.C.C. 83 in these words:\n\u2018\u2026it is not what the judge intended but what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of a jury which is the decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.\u2019\nIt is, I think, pertinent to observe that at the conclusion of his reasons for judgment in Wright v. The King[4] Chief Justice Rinfret, speaking for the majority of this Court, said:\nWe think the Bigaouette case certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to go\u2026\nIn the Bigaouette case the accused was charged with the murder of his mother and he admitted that he was in the house at the time when the death was said to have occurred and in the Gallagher case the accused was the last person known to have been seen with the deceased whose murder he was accused of having committed; in each case the learned trial judge was found to have commented on the accused\u2019s failure to testify in explanation of these circumstances. There is nothing of this kind in the present case. Here the language used by the trial judge to which objection is taken was not so much a \u201ccomment\u201d on the failure of the persons charged to testify as a statement of their right to refrain from doing so, and it does not appear to me that it should be taken to have been the intention of Parliament in enacting s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act to preclude judges from explaining to juries the law with respect to the rights of accused persons in this regard. I am accordingly in agreement with Mr. Justice Evans \u201cthat the remarks of the trial judge viewed in context and on a reasonable interpretation do not amount to a comment in breach of the section\u201d.\nI think it is to be assumed that the section in question was enacted for the protection of accused persons against the danger of having their right not to testify presented to the jury in such fashion as to suggest that their silence is being used as a cloak for their guilt.\nAs has been indicated by Mr. Justice Evans, it would be \u201cmost naive\u201d to ignore the fact that when an accused fails to testify after some evidence of guilt has been tendered against him by the Crown, there must be at least some jurors who say to themselves \u201cIf he didn\u2019t do it, why didn\u2019t he say so\u201d. It is for this reason that it seems to me to be of the greatest importance that a trial judge should remain unhampered in his right to point out to the jury, when the occasion arises to do so in order to protect the rights of the accused, that there is no onus on the accused to prove his innocence by going into the witness box. To construe s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act as interfering with that right would, in my opinion, run contrary to the purpose of the section itself.\nIt was stressed in the course of the argument that by referring to the fact that the explanations of the accused were not given under oath, the trial judge was indirectly commenting on their failure to testify, and in my view this reasoning runs contrary to the decision of this Court in Kelly v. The King[5] where the accused had not gone onto the witness stand but had been permitted to address the jury and in so doing had made a number of statements of fact. In the course of his charge to the jury the trial judge said: (See 27 C.C.C. 138 at 166 and 167):\nBut as far as facts are concerned the only way to bring them properly before a jury is to bring them out from the lips of the witnesses or documents submitted to you which have been proved. You should have the guarantee of the religious sanction of an oath backing up the statement before you should consider them. I am bound to say that, because I do not know whether I was quite justified in allowing the accused to make several of the statements he made. Any statements of facts made by the accused you should dispel from your minds.\nAnd he later said:\nThese matters could have been brought out in cross-examination and have been brought out from certain witnesses. I am not laying stress upon that not being done, but laying stress upon the facts laid before you without your having the sanction of an oath to commend them to you. These statements should be expunged from your mind.\nIt will be remembered that the facts to which the judge was referring were facts laid before the jury in the unsworn statement of the accused. One of the points raised in the case reserved by the trial judge and which was argued on the appeal to this Court was whether this language constituted a comment on the failure of the accused to testify, contrary to s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, and in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court, Mr. Justice Anglin said, at page 263:\nThere was no comment whatever on the failure of the accused to testify. His right to do so was not mentioned during the trial. The learned judge merely discharged his duty in warning the jury against treating the statement which he had allowed the accused to make as the equivalent of sworn testimony;\u2026\nIn the same case Mr. Justice Duff, speaking for himself at page 259, said:\n\u2026 I can find nothing, which, when fairly construed, amounts to such comment within the meaning of the statutory prohibition.\nIf any further authority were needed, I would adopt the language used by Mr. Justice Longley in The King v. McLean[6] as being applicable to the present case. In that case the trial judge, in the course of his charge to the jury, had said:\nNow you are not to consider the prisoner at all in this matter. He has the right to do as he did; that is to sit there and say nothing\u2026\nand Mr. Justice Longley, speaking on an equal division of the Court, said:\nI am aware that in both Canada and the United States decisions have gone very far in the direction of shutting out anything which bore the semblance of comment on the part of judge or counsel in respect of the non-testifying of the prisoner on his trial. But it seems to me there should be some limit to this doctrine, and I think the limit should be where the reference could not be construed as unfavorable to the prisoner, nor its effect as occasioning any substantial wrong or miscarriage on the trial. What the learned judge said, on this trial, could only be regarded, I think as favorable to the prisoner, since it instructed the jury that the prisoner had a clear right, under the law, to remain silent.\nAs I have indicated, I agree with the opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the remarks of the trial judge to which objection is here taken do not constitute a \u201ccomment\u201d in contravention of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, but I am bound to say, with the greatest respect for those who may hold a contrary view, that I do not agree with the suggestion in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Evans to the effect that the case of Bigaouette v. The King[7] is to be treated as authority for the proposition that whenever a breach of that section occurs it constitutes a \u201cfatal defect\u201d in the proceedings making a new trial \u201cmandatory\u201d so that the curative provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) cannot be applied.\nNo one would, I think, question the binding effect of the decision rendered by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., on behalf of this Court in the Bigaouette case. That was a case of murder in which the evidence was almost entirely circumstantial and the language used by the learned trial judge, which was construed as relating \u201cto the failure of the accused to testify\u201d was, in my opinion, such that it could not have been said with any certainty whether or not the jury would necessarily have convicted on the circumstantial evidence if the offending words had been omitted. It was no doubt for this reason that the Chief Justice made no mention whatever of the provisions of the curative section of the Criminal Code What the Chief Justice did say before adopting the language used by Mr. Justice Stuart in Gallagher\u2019s case, was:\nIt seems to be reasonably clear that, according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure of la defense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely, that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such language might be understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145.\nI do not think that the meaning of any of the language employed by the Chief Justice in that case should be so enlarged as to be treated as authority for the general proposition that all \u201ccomments\u201d which contravene s. 4(5), however innocuous they may be, are \u201cfatal\u201d in the sense that they are not curable by the application of the curative provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. As is indicated in the excerpt above quoted from the reasons for judgment of Rinfret C.J. in Wright v. The King, the case of Bigaouette marks the limit to which \u201cthis Court would care to go\u201d on the subject.\nIt is true that since the Bigaouette case three cases have been decided in the Court of Appeal of Ontario which hold that the provisions of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act constitute an arbitrary rule leaving no discretion to the court and that any breach of that section is fatal to the proceedings. These cases are Rex v. McNulty and Courtney[8] and Reg. v. Groulx and Nevers[9] and R. v. Lizotte[10], but the contrary view has been adopted in British Columbia in R. v. Darlyn[11] and in New Brunswick in Rex v. MacDonald[12] and in Ayles v. The Queen[13]. In the case of Molleur v. The King[14], which was decided in 1948, Mr. Justice Casey, speaking on behalf of the majority of the Quebec Court of King\u2019s Bench at page 43, applied the curative section where crown counsel had made a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\nI am in agreement with the decision in the last three cited cases and would adopt the view expressed by Mr. Justice MacKay in the Court of Appeal in the present case to the effect that the provisions of s. 592(1) of the Criminal Code could be invoked in such a case as this even if the comment had been found to be in breach of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:\n592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the Court of Appeal\n(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that\u2026\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law,\u2026\n(b) may dismiss the appeal where\u2026\n(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;\u2026\nThere are a number of authorities concerned with the proper application of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) which are to the effect that once an error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred.\nIt appears to me that if the remarks of the learned trial judge in the present case could have been construed as a \u201ccomment\u201d which offended against the provisions of s. 4(5), his error would have been an error in law and I can see no logical reason why the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) should not apply to an error in law which consists in the breach of the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act in the same way as they would apply to any other such error.\nAs I do not consider that the remarks made by the learned trial judge concerning the accused\u2019s right to keep silent were obnoxious to the statutory direction contained in s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, I would dismiss this appeal on that ground, but I am in any event satisfied that even if they could have been so construed, they could not have had any effect upon the outcome in the present case.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie and I agree that the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury was unexceptional in all but the one material respect in which, when he recalled the jury, he said:\nGentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either of the accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court does point out that these explanations were given and when made were not made under oath and it is not only for that reason alone, but for any number of reasons that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept those explanations.\nHe recalled the jury because counsel for the accused, at the conclusion of the charge, had said:\nYour Honour, you said when referring to the explanation of Mr. McConnell that the statement was not made under oath, and you said it is up to you to decide, was he there for that reason only. I believe it is not incumbent upon the accused to prove that was the only reason. The onus would be on the Crown to prove that that was not the only reason.\nCounsel\u2019s objection to the charge related to the following:\nThe explanations of Mr. Beer were not made under oath and you do not have to accept them. Consider the circumstances under which they were made and then decide. If you have any reasonable doubt, then you must give the accused the benefit of that doubt.\nIn my view there was no reason to recall the jury because the sentences just quoted did not call for any further explanation. The judge was merely stating what was the fact, namely, that the accused were not under oath when they gave their explanations to the police officers when first seen and that, of course, was clearly apparent to everyone. Statements made by an accused in circumstances which require him to make an immediate explanation, as was the case here, are clearly admissible and cannot, in the circumstances, be made under oath and, therefore, it is up to the jury to decide whether or not the explanation is to be believed or is one that might probably be true. The learned judge in the present case had said towards the close of his charge:\nThirdly, if in possession of the accused, if they are instruments of housebreaking, did the accused give you an explanation of having them with lawful excuse which might probably be true?\nIf you have any reasonable doubt as to whether the explanation is probably true, you must give the accused the benefit of that doubt.\nHowever, having recalled the jury, the learned judge then, in my view, clearly violated s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act when he said:\nGentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either of the accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court does point out that these explanations were given and when made were not made under oath and it is not only for that reason alone, but for any number of reasons that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept these explanations.\n(Emphasis added.)\nSection 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act reads:\n(5) The failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution. R.S., c. 59, s. 4; 1948, c. 33, s. 1; 1953-54, c. 51, s. 749.\nThe question for decision is whether the learned judge, having contravened the provisions of s. 4(5) above, the error is fatal to the validity of the trial.\nCourts of appeal in Canada have taken opposite views on this question. The decisions of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Rex v. McNulty and Courtney[15] and Reg. v. Groulx and Nevers[16] and in Reg. v. Lizotte[17] are to the effect that the curative provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) have no application where there has been a breach of the section. The contrary view was expressed in British Columbia in R. v. Darlyn[18] and in New Brunswick in R. v. Ayles[19] and the same view was accepted in Rex v. MacDonald[20] and Moleur v. The King[21].\nThe matter has been dealt with in this Court in several cases including Bigaouette v. The King[22] and in Wright v. The King[23]. In the Bigaouette case, Sir Lyman Duff, at p. 114, speaking for the Court, said:\nIt seems to be reasonably clear that, according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure of la d\u00e9fense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely, that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such language might be understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C, c. 145. The law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher, (1922) 37 Can. Cr. C. 83, in these words:\n\u2026it is not what the judge intended but what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.\nThere must be a new trial.\nIn the Wright case, Chief Justice Rinfret, speaking for the majority of the Court, said:\nWe think the Bigaouette case (1927) S.C.R. 112 certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to go and, like the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are unable to find that the remarks here complained of could have any effect on the jury as being a comment \u201cobnoxious to the statutory direction\u201d.\nThe pith of the decision in Wright was that what the learned trial judge had said was not a \u201ccomment\u201d within the meaning of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act. The phrase \u201cobnoxious to the statutory direction\u201d used within quotation marks by Rinfret C.J.C. in the above extract from his reasons obviously referred to the phrase used by Duff J. (later C.J.C.) in Bigaouette as \u201cplainly obnoxious to the enactment\u201d. The Wright case is authority only for the proposition that what was said in that case at the trial was not a comment and consequently the Court did not have to deal with whether, if there had been a comment, a new trial would necessarily have to be ordered. The case of Kelly v. The King[24], referred to by my brother Ritchie, is to the same effect. There the accused who was a building contractor, having dispensed with counsel, addressed the jury on his own behalf, and in so doing introduced topics and statements of fact which had nothing to do with the issues before the Court and made charges against prosecution counsel which had no relation to the issues being tried. The learned trial judge had permitted him to make these statements and charges and subsequently, in charging the jury, the learned judge pointed out to them that the statements of the accused so made in his address were not evidence and were to be disregarded, not having been given under oath. This Court held that in so doing, the learned trial judge had not commented in violation of the Canada Evidence Act. Duff J. (later C.J.C.) at p. 259 said:\nAs to the first of these grounds I can find nothing, which, when fairly construed, amounts to such comment within the meaning of the statutory prohibition.\nIn his reasons, speaking for the majority in the Court of Appeal, Evans J.A. said:\nIn a jury case when an accused does not testify on his own behalf, this fact is immediately known to the jury and one would be most naive to believe that it is not considered by them in their deliberations.\nMy brother Ritchie, in referring to this, states that it was in part to protect the accused from such speculations that s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act was enacted. With deference, I cannot agree. The accused is accorded the protection he is entitled to by the mandatory directions which the trial judge must give that an accused is presumed to be innocent and that the burden of proving the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt rests upon the Crown. The learned trial judge adequately discharged his duty to the accused in the instant case when he said:\nFor these reasons, therefore, both Mr. McConnell and Mr. Beer are presumed to be innocent until the Crown, his accuser, proves him guilty, and this presumption of innocence remains with the accused from the time they were charged and throughout this trial until the end and this presumption of innocence only ceases to apply at the end of the trial if, after hearing all evidence, you are satisfied that Mr. McConnell or Mr. Beer is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe onus or burden of proving the guilt of these two accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt rests upon the Crown and never shifts. There is no burden upon either of these two persons to prove his innocence. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are guilty of the offence before they can be convicted.\nThe protection which an accused is entitled to under s. 4(5) is compliance with the positive injunction not to comment imposed upon the judge and counsel for the prosecution, in other words, no comment on the subject from either of them.\nIn the present case, Wells J.A. (now C.J.H.C.) took the view that in recharging the jury as he did, the learned judge had made a comment on the failure of the accused to testify, and in so doing, had violated the provisions of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act and that a new trial was, accordingly, necessary.\nI am in full agreement with Wells J.A. Section 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act is clear and unambiguous. In it Parliament has defined an area that is forbidden ground to the judge and to counsel for the prosecution. It is not a difficult matter for either or both to keep from entering the prohibited zone. If they refrain from doing what Parliament says they must not do, Courts of appeal and this Court will not be required to rationalize and refine these transgressions as they try to measure the depth of the imprint left on the minds of jurors as being consequential or inconsequential. No measurement of the effect of departing from the standards set by Parliament becomes necessary where the judge and counsel for the prosecution obey the law.\nWhat the learned judge said in the instant case was clearly a comment. In my view, in dealing with a case of this kind, it is a case of comment or no comment. If there was no comment within the meaning of the statute as in the Wright and Kelly cases, that ends the matter. If there was a comment as in Bigaouette, an error fatal to the validity of the proceedings has occurred and the remedy is not in trying to speculate whether it had a material or no effect on the jury, but in a new trial. The accused in no way contributed to the result. It flows solely from the failure of the judge or of counsel for the prosecution to obey the law which Parliament has clearly laid down.\nAs long as the doctrine of stare decisis is applicable, it is, I think, not open to this Court to refuse to follow Bigaouette. Bigaouette came to this Court by way of appeal from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Quebec which Court had affirmed Bigaouette\u2019s conviction for murder, Allard J. dissenting. The dissent was on several grounds, including one that the learned trial judge had violated s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act. Allard J. expressed this dissent as follows:\n4\u00b0 Le savant Juge, dans mon opinion, a aussi err\u00e9 en droit, quand au bas de la page 30 il dit:\n\u00abIl \u00e9tait donc seul avec sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 la maison, quand la mort est arriv\u00e9e, et si l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait seul avec sa m\u00e8re quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9e et \u00e9gorg\u00e9e, la d\u00e9fense aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre capable d\u2019expliquer par qui ce meurtre a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Car une pareille boucherie n\u2019a pas d\u00fb se faire sans que l\u2019accus\u00e9 en eut connaissance.\u00bb\nEt continuant dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, il ajoute \u00e0 la page 32 dans deux phrases qui se suivent, dont la premi\u00e8re commence par les mots:\n\u00abIl ne viendra \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de personne et surtout\u2026 et dont la deuxi\u00e8me commence par les mots:\n\u00abIl ne vous viendra pas \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e\u2026\nDans ces deux derni\u00e8res phrases le savant juge \u00e9carte comme auteur possible du crime tous les gens du voisinage, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des appartements voisins de celui de la victime pour ne laisser devant le jury que l\u2019accus\u00e9 comme l\u2019auteur certain. Et dans la partie tir\u00e9e du bas de la page 30 le savant juge, apr\u00e8s avoir affirm\u00e9 et conclu que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait seul \u00e0 la maison avec sa m\u00e8re quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9e, il ajoute que la d\u00e9fense aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre capable d\u2019expliquer par qui ce meurtre a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, car dit-il, pareille boucherie n\u2019a p\u00fb se faire sans que l\u2019accus\u00e9 en eut connaissance.\nN\u2019est-ce pas l\u00e0 reprocher \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de ne pas avoir rendu t\u00e9moignage en sa faveur pour \u00e9tablir son innocence ou au moins d\u00e9noncer l\u2019auteur du crime, n\u2019est-ce pas l\u00e0 au moins sugg\u00e9rer au jury que l\u2019accus\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00e9tablir, par son t\u00e9moignage, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas tu\u00e9 sa m\u00e8re et de plus donner le nom du coupable, s\u2019il ne l\u2019est pas lui-m\u00eame.\nLe savant Juge affirme que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait seul avec sa m\u00e8re quand le crime a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Or, reprochant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de ne pas avoir expliqu\u00e9 ce meurtre et d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 le coupable, c\u2019\u00e9tait lui reprocher de ne pas avoir rendu t\u00e9moignage lui-m\u00eame. Ce commentaire du savant Juge constitue une violation formelle de l\u2019acte de la preuve du Canada. Sec. 4 Sous-Section 5. La Couronne devait prouver la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Ce dernier n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir son innocence. Cette seule partie de la charge du savant Juge est suffisante pour vicier le verdict du jury et lui donner droit \u00e0 un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Nos recueils judiciaires contiennent plusieurs d\u00e9cisions en ce sens.\nJe me contenterai de citer un jugement de La Cour d\u2019Appel de l\u2019Alberta re Rex vs Gallagher, 37 C.C.C., page 83, o\u00f9 le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\n\u201cWhere the trial judge, in his charge to the Jury, in a criminal trial, suggests that evidence ought to have been given, which only the accused could have given, he commits a breach of sub-section 5 of section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act which provides that the failure of the person charged \u2026to testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge \u2026and the accused is entitled to a new trial.\u201d\nIt is of particular significance that the decision in this Court setting aside the conviction for murder and granting a new trial was solely on this ground. Duff J. (as he then was) said at p. 113:\nIt should be said at the outset that the jurisdiction of this court rests upon the dissent of Mr. Justice Allard, and in particular upon his view, in which he was not in agreement with his colleagues, that the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had failed to observe the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act, which, in effect, requires the trial judge to abstain from any comment upon the failure of the accused to take advantage of the privilege which the law gives him to be a witness at the trial in his own behalf.\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe only question dealt with in the judgment of this Court was in relation to subs. (5) of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act and Duff J., speaking for the Court, concluded: \u201cThe law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher\u201d[25] and he quotes the very passage relied upon by Allard J. in his dissent. It is pertinent to quote the whole paragraph in the judgment of Stuart J.A. in Gallagher from which the quote just mentioned was taken. He said:\nI agree with what my brother Beck has said. But I would like to add that it is quite possible\u2014or rather of course very probable\u2014that the trial Judge did not intend to refer, even indirectly, to the failure of the accused to testify at the trial. The situation seems to me to be this that the trial Judge inadvertently used language which was, on the face of it, to say the least, clearly capable of being understood as a reference to the failure of the accused to testify although it seems tolerably clear that, in their proper meaning, the words used must be taken as a reference to such failure. But it is not what the Judge intended but what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.\n(Emphasis added.) My brother Ritchie says, regarding the fact that Duff J. did not refer to s. 1014(2) in Bigaouette: \u201cThat was a case of murder in which the evidence was almost entirely circumstantial and the language used by the learned trial judge, which was construed as relating \u2018to the failure of the accused to testify\u2019 was, in my opinion, such that it could not have been said with any certainty whether or not the jury would necessarily have convicted on the circumstantial evidence if the offending words had been omitted. It was no doubt for this reason that the Chief Justice made no mention whatever of the provisions of the curative section of the Criminal Code.\u201d That ignores, in my view, the acceptance by Duff J. of the word \u2018fatal\u2019 in the quotation from Gallagher in which Duff J. says: \u201cThe law in our opinion is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher\u2026\u201d and it ignores also Duff J.\u2019s description of Allard J.\u2019s dissent as, \u201cThe learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had failed to observe the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act\u201d (Emphasis added) I fail to see how the use of the word \u2018imperative\u2019 and acceptance of the word \u2018fatal\u2019 by Duff J. can be explained away by conjecture as to the reason why Duff J. did not refer to the curative section of the Code. It is more logical, I think, with deference to contrary opinion, to accept that Duff J. knew and appreciated that \u2018fatal\u2019 meant \u2018not curable\u2019.\nIf the law is as so stated by Stuart J.A. in Gallagher and proclaimed as correct in this Court by Duff J. in Bigaouette, it should not be departed from as would appear to be the effect of the majority opinion. The statement by Cartwright J. (as he then was) in Binus v. The Queen[26] states the circumstances in which this Court may depart from a previous judgment of its own. He said:\nI do not doubt the power of this Court to depart from a previous judgment of its own but, where the earlier decision has not been made per incuriam, and especially in cases in which Parliament or the Legislature is free to alter the law on the point decided, I think that such a departure should be made only for compelling reasons. The ancient warning, repeated by Anglin C.J.C. in Daoust, Lalonde & Cie Lt\u00e9e v. Ferland, (1932) S.C.R. 343 at 351, 2 D.L.R. 642, ubi jus est aut vagum aut incertum, ibi maxima servitus prevalebit, should not be forgotten. There are no compelling reasons in the instant case to depart from the law as laid down in Bigaouette in 1927.\nIf Parliament intended to qualify the word \u201ccomment\u201d in the said section to have it mean \u201ccomment adversely or prejudicially\u201d, it could have amended the statute accordingly or may still do so. It is not for the Court to do it.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed, HALL and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: O\u2019Driscoll, Kelly & McRae, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 527, (1968), 2 C.R.N.S. 50, 1 C.C.C. 368.\n[2] [1967] S.C.R. 589 at 593, 2 C.R.N.S. 35, 63 D.L.R.

A well was completed and production obtained but M was heavily in debt both to the drilling contractor and many other creditors. The drilling contractor filed a mechanics\u2019 lien with the result that M\u2019s interest in the operation was in danger of forfeiture. To avoid this forfeiture and to protect its assets and creditors M entered into an agreement with X to assign its 30 per cent interest in the net proceeds of production. X then assigned the same 30 per cent to R.M and the creditor drilling company joined in this agreement. The drilling company\u2019s account was settled at $39,596.22, which R agreed to pay.\nFrom the proceeds of production, R was (a) to reimburse itself for the $39,596.22; (b) after such payment, to distribute the proceeds among the creditors of M up to the sum of $52,000; and (c) to retain the balance after those two sums had been paid. R agreed to deposit the proceeds in a separate account in a named bank and the same were to be distributed monthly as set out above. These agreements were all executed at the same time and dated May 1, 1953. There was a further assignment of the 30 per cent interest on April 1, 1954, from R to the defendant I. The latter entered into the same agreement that R had made, the only difference being that when I took the assignment, $12,811.95 had been paid on the drilling account thus leaving unpaid and subject to retainer under (a) above, the sum of $26,774.27. This sum had been received and retained by the end of February 1956. The drilling account had then been fully satisfied. From February 1956 to September 1962, I received a further $50,000. It never kept a separate account of the moneys received. It paid some creditors, made compromises with others and left some claims unpaid.\nAn action brought by M against I to recover moneys alleged to be held in trust and misappropriated by the defendant was dismissed by the trial judge on the ground that no trust was established. This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The defendant then appealed to this Court claiming a restoration of the judgment at trial. A cross-appeal relating to the allowance of set-offs by the Court of Appeal and claiming a return of M\u2019s interest in the oil well was also made.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the Appellate Division that there was a trust for payment and that the matter did not simply rest in contract as found by the trial judge.

Appeal and cross\u2011appeal dismissed.\nJ.C. Major, for the defendant, appellant.\nM. Millard, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This action was brought by Maralta Oil Co. Ltd., against Industrial Incomes Limited to recover certain moneys alleged to be held in trust and misappropriated by the defendant. The learned trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that there was no trust established. This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The defendant now appeals to this Court claiming a restoration of the judgment at trial.\nThe facts are set out in detail in the reasons for judgment of the Appellate Division1. Maralta had a 30 per cent interest in a farm-out agreement acquired from Mutual Holdings Limited. A well was completed and production obtained but Maralta was heavily in debt both to the drilling contractor and many other creditors. The drilling contractor filed a mechanics\u2019 lien with the result that Maralta\u2019s interest in the operation was in danger of forfeiture. To avoid this forfeiture and to protect its assets and creditors Maralta entered into an agreement with Mutual Holdings Limited to assign its 30 per cent interest in the net proceeds of production. Mutual Holdings Limited then assigned the same 30 per cent to Rocky Mountain Supply Company Limited. Maralta and the creditor drilling company joined in this agreement. The drilling company\u2019s account was settled at $39,596.22, which Rocky Mountain agreed to pay.\nFrom the proceeds of production, Rocky Mountain was\n(a) to reimburse itself for this $39,596.22;\n(b) after such payment, to distribute the proceeds among the creditors of Maralta up to the sum of $52,000; and\n(c) to retain the balance after those two sums had been paid.\nThe full terms of the agreement are next set out. Rocky Mountain agreed that:\n\u2026it will deposit the share of proceeds of production from the well\u2026 in a separate account in The Royal Bank of Canada, Third Street West Branch, Calgary, Alberta, and will distribute the same on the last business day of each month, commencing with the last business day of May, 1953, as follows:\n(a) To its own account until it has received the sum of Thirty-nine Thousand, Five Hundred and Ninety-six Dollars and Twenty-two Cents ($39,596.22); then\n(b) rateably among the creditors of Maralta\u2026, until such creditors have received an aggregate amount not in excess of Fifty-two Thousand ($52,000) dollars, or such lesser amount as may be owing to such creditors by Maralta as at the date hereof;\nand thereafter the separate account shall be closed and Rocky shall own and be entitled to all further amounts as may be received by it in respect of the said share of proceeds.\nThese agreements were all executed at the same time and dated May 1, 1953. There was a further assignment of the 30 per cent interest on April 1, 1954, from Rocky Mountain Supply Company Limited to Industrial Incomes Limited, the defendant in this action and the appellant before this Court. Industrial Incomes entered into the same agreement that Rocky Mountain had made. The only difference is that when Industrial Incomes took the assignment, $12,811.95 had been paid on the drilling account thus leaving unpaid and subject to retainer under para. (a). of the above agreement, the sum of $26,774.27. This sum had been received and retained by the end of February 1956. The drilling account had then been fully satisfied. From February 1956 to September 1962 the date when the action was instituted, Industrial Incomes received a further $50,000. It never kept a separate account of the moneys received. It paid some creditors, made compromises with others but left unpaid creditors\u2019 claims which on a reference were ascertained at $19,781.70, and for that amount judgment was given.\nThe learned trial judge held that no trust was created by the documents which are outlined above. A unanimous Court in the Appellate Division disagreed with this conclusion. With respect, I agree with the conclusion of the Appellate Division that there was a trust. The Appellate Division emphasized, and rightly so, that these moneys were to be kept in a separate account in a certain bank until the drilling account and the creditors\u2019 claims up to $52,000 had been paid. It was only after this time that the account was to be closed and the assignee entitled to all further amounts that might be received. These assignments did not enable the assignee to refrain from paying certain accounts and retain the money. I agree that there was a trust for payment and that the matter did not simply rest in contract as the learned trial judge found.\nOne of the difficulties in this case is the judgment of Kirby J. in the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta given on September 10, 1963. This judgment is Seller v. Industrial Incomes Limited[2] Seller was one of the creditors and he had purchased a number of claims against Maralta and taken assignments of them. In his action he alleged that there was a trust for creditors. The judgment of Kirby J. was that there was no such trust for creditors and he dismissed the action.\nHe came to this conclusion because there was, in his opinion, no evidence that the creditors had been notified of the transfer or that a trust had been created for particular creditors even without communication to or assent by them. This judgment was not appealed. According to ex. 6, which was filed in the present action, there came into existence, at some time, a complete list of some 30 trade creditors with claims totalling $48,086.64. There were, in addition, on this list, claims of $3,000 by Maralta\u2019s associates in the drilling venture and claims of $2,000 by two officers of Maralta. There was no proof that this list was a schedule to the documents that are said to have created the trust for creditors but Seller, when he brought his action, was obviously aware of the provision that he thought had been made for creditors. It is difficult for me to understand why this knowledge on the part of creditors, who were not a large body, would not be in existence on May 1, 1953, when the documents were signed.\nThe present action which is now under appeal was instituted on September 20, 1962. The judgment at trial in this action is dated November 14, 1963, two months after the dismissal of the creditors\u2019 action, Seller v. Industrial Incomes Limited.\nAlthough the Court of Appeal in the present action said that the question whether these documents constituted a trust for the creditors or whether Maralta itself was the beneficiary of the trust, was not argued before them, nevertheless their judgment must be based on the conclusion that Maralta was the beneficiary of this trust and that it was revocable by Maralta for non-compliance with its terms. Industrial Incomes never made any attempt to keep the moneys received from the production of the well in a separate account as required by the agreement and left unpaid claims amounting to the sum for which judgment was given.\nThe principle is stated in 38 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 840, in the following terms:\nTrusts for creditors. If a debtor conveys property in trust for the benefit of his creditors who are not parties to the conveyance, and to whom the fact of its execution is not communicated, the conveyance merely operates as a power to the trustee to apply the property in satisfying their claims; and inasmuch as the debtor himself is in fact the only cestui que trust, it is revocable by him before the property is so applied, and cannot be enforced by the creditors. A trust in favour of creditors is not, however, revocable if the creditors are parties to or assent to the conveyance or if the fact of its execution is communicated to them. The order of the Court of Appeal was made in the following terms:\nOnce the amount owing to creditors as at the 1st day of May, 1953 is ascertained, then from such amount or $52,000, whichever is the lesser, the respondent may deduct the aggregate of amounts paid by it to the creditors either in payment of such claims or in purchase of such claims. The appellant will be entitled to the balance. Where the respondent has purchased a claim at less than the actual amount owing, it may only claim credit for the amount actually paid and not the original amount owing, for a trustee may not benefit by buying up debts. See Lewin on Trusts, 15th ed., p. 202.\nAs this is an express trust, The Limitation of Actions Act has no application.\nThere will be judgment for the appellant for the amount so ascertained with costs\u2026.\nIf counsel are unable to agree as to the amount of this judgment, the matter shall be referred to the trial judge.\nAs a result of this order for reference, certain agreements were made between counsel. The Court of Appeal also advised counsel that it intended to allow set-offs as well as payments made and that its judgment was to be read accordingly.\nOnly two items came before the trial judge on the reference. The first was the cost of defending the law suit, Seller v. Industrial Incomes Limited, above referred to. The second was extra payments for auditors\u2019 work. Both these items were allowed by the trial judge and credit was given for them under the judgment as entered. The result was that the Court of Appeal directed the entry of judgment in favour of Maralta for $19,781.70.\nWe are now faced in this Court with a cross-appeal. First, it is said that there was error in allowing set-offs other than payments made in cash. I agree with the Court of Appeal on this point.\nSecond, it is said that if set-offs are allowed, then certain allowances were not made for two deliveries of oil well casings. If Maralta had intended to open up this matter, it should have done so on the reference back to the trial judge, who could have taken evidence and made an adjudication. I am unable on this record at this stage to make any finding on the validity of this claim. I am in the same position with the extra allowance for auditors\u2019 claims.\nThe cross-appeal also claims a return of Maralta\u2019s interest in the oil well. This must be dismissed. Maralta entered into the agreement to save its interest in the oil well from being lost in mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings. To do this it had to agree, first, to the payment of the drilling costs, and then to the release of any surplus after the payment of creditors\u2019 claims. The trust is only for the payment of these creditors\u2019 claims and it is being enforced.\nThe appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Chambers, Saucier, Jones, Peacock, Black, Gain & Stratton, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Millard, Johnson & Maxwell, Calgary.\n[1] (1964), 49 W.W.R. 175, 46 D.L.R.

The objects and powers of the company as set out in its letters patent included owning and dealing in mortgages of realty. It was declared to be a private company with the number of shareholders limited to fifty. At no time did it issue securities or debentures or accept money on deposit or borrow money on the security of its property. The defendant did not limit its investments to first mortgages nor was it concerned that any loan made by it should not exceed two-thirds of the value of the land mortgaged. The defendant was not registered under The Loan and Trust Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 222, but was registered at all relevant times under The Mortgage Brokers Registration Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 244.\nAlthough there was evidence that the defendant was engaged in the business of lending money on the security of real estate there was no evidence that it was doing anything else which could be regarded as carrying on the business of a loan or trust corporation within the meaning of The Loan and Trust Corporations Act or that it ever held itself out to be a loan or trust corporation within the meaning of that Act.\nIn an action brought by the plaintiffs for a declaration that a certain mortgage made by the first plaintiff to the defendant and that certain other mortgages collateral thereto were void and unenforceable, the trial judge held that the defendant was carrying on the business of a loan and trust corporation contrary to The Loan and Trust Corporations Act and that the effect of that Act was to render the prime mortgage and the collateral mortgages null and void. He decided that no term as to repayment of the moneys advanced could be imposed on the plaintiffs and made the declaration for which they asked. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed a reference to determine the amount owing by the plaintiffs to the defendant under the said mortgages. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defendant company was not at the relevant times transacting the business of a loan corporation in contravention of s. 133(1) of The Loan and Trust Corporations Act and that Act did not invalidate the impugned mortgage.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Grant J. Appeal dismissed.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and W.M.H. Grover, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and S.G.M. Grange, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1 allowing an appeal from a judgment of Grant J. and directing a reference to the Master at Toronto to determine the amount owing by the appellants to respondent and that in all other respects the action be dismissed.\nThere is no dispute as to the relevant facts. By an agreement dated May 5, 1964, Sidmay Limited, Gordon and Benjamin agreed to borrow from the respondent the sum of $308,250 on the security of lands in Burlington. This was short-term financing to enable the construction of maisonnettes pending the arrangement of long-term mortgage financing. The term of the proposed mortgage was six months from May 1, 1964, and interest was to be calculated monthly at the rate of 12 per cent per annum on the whole of the loan amount, to be payable at the time of each advance notwithstanding that the total loan amount had not been advanced. Pursuant to the said agreement the plaintiff Sidmay Limited executed and delivered to Wehttam the mortgage in question in this appeal. It is dated May 8, 1964, and contemplates the advance of $308,250. It provides for payment of interest at 12 per cent per annum monthly on the whole of the principal amount. The mortgage contains a covenant by the mortgagor to pay and also a guarantee by the plaintiffs Gordon and Benjamin to pay the amount loaned. Moneys were advanced under the mortgage by the mortgagee to the mortgagor or to third persons on the direction of the mortgagor. There is a disagreement between the parties as to whether the full amount of $308,250 was advanced but this question will be determined on the reference directed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants or some of them also executed and delivered to the respondent the following mortgages as collateral security for payment of the mortgage for $308,250 referred to above:\n(a) Collateral mortgage Black Duke Investments to the respondent dated June 5, 1964;\n(b) Collateral mortgage from G.B.L. Holdings Limited to the respondent dated August 5, 1964;\n(c) Collateral mortgage from Dundas Terrace Apartments Limited to the respondent dated August 5, 1964;\n(d) Collateral mortgage from Aldershot Apartments Limited to the respondent dated August 11, 1964.\nThe respondent was incorporated on July 10, 1956, by letters patent under The Corporations Act, 1953 (Ont.), c. 19. The objects and powers of the respondent as set out in its letters patent include owning and dealing in mortgages of realty. It was declared to be a private company with the number of shareholders limited to fifty. The respondent is a small corporation; except for a qualifying share held by a Mr. Gotfrid all its shareholders are members of the family of one Matthew Elman. At no time did it issue securities or debentures or accept money on deposit or borrow money on the security of its property; it did not advertise; its business was carried on from Mr. Elman\u2019s residence.\nThe respondent did not limit its investments to first mortgages nor was it concerned that any loan made by it should not exceed two-thirds of the value of the land mortgaged.\nThe respondent was not registered under The Loan and Trust Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 222, but was registered at all relevant times under The Mortgage Brokers Registration Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 244.\nAlthough there was evidence that the defendant was engaged in the business of lending money on the security of real estate there was no evidence that it was doing anything else which could be regarded as carrying on the business of a loan or trust corporation within the meaning of The Loan and Trust Corporations Act, or that it ever held itself out to be a loan or trust corporation within the meaning of that Act.\nThe statement of claim delivered by the appellants is a lengthy document but, in view of a reference having been directed to ascertain the amount owing on the mortgage and the claim that the mortgage transaction is unconscionable having been withdrawn, the claim requiring consideration is pleaded as follows in paras. 24 and 25 and clause (a) of the prayer for relief in the statement of claim:\n24. The plaintiffs further allege that the said mortgage referred to in paragraph 6 and the said collateral mortgages referred to in paragraphs 10, 11 and 15 hereof were taken by the defendant in the course of carrying on the business of lending money on the security of real estate, which the said defendant was prohibited from carrying on by virtue of the provisions of The Loan and Trust Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, chapter 222 and the plaintiffs allege that the said mortgages are accordingly void and unenforceable.\n25. The plaintiffs plead the provisions of sections 1(h), 2, 133 and 161 of the said Loan and Trust Corporations Act and sections 1(f), 2, 3 and 340 of The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, chapter 71. THE PLAINTIFFS THEREFORE CLAIM:\n(a) a declaration that the said mortgage from Sidmay Limited to the defendant dated the 8th day of May, 1964 and the said collateral mortgages are void and unenforceable;\nGrant J. held that the defendant was carrying on the business of a loan and trust corporation contrary to The Loan and Trust Corporations Act and that the effect of that Act was to render the prime mortgage and the collateral mortgages null and void. He decided that no term as to repayment of the moneys advanced could be imposed on the plaintiffs and made the declaration for which they asked in clause (a) quoted above. He made no order as to costs.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the defendant was not carrying on the business of a loan or trust corporation within the meaning of The Loan and Trust Corporations Act and that in any event the effect of that Act was not to render the mortgages invalid. The Court of Appeal went on to express the opinion that if the mortgages were held to be illegal and void the declaration asked for by the plaintiffs should not in any event be made except on the condition of the payment back to the defendant by the plaintiffs of the moneys advanced by the defendant.\nKelly J.A. after a careful review of many decisions and of the history of the statutes which may be regarded as the predecessors of The Loan and Trust Corporations Act, hereinafter referred to as the Act, came to the following conclusions:\n1. That the defendant was not at the relevant times transacting the business of a loan corporation in contravention of s. 133(1) of the Act and that the Act does not invalidate the impugned mortgage.\n2. That even if it were held that the defendant had contravened s. 133(1), the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief because they are not persons for whose protection the prohibition in s. 133(1) was enacted.\n3. That even if the plaintiffs had not been barred from the relief they claimed on the grounds set out in 1 and 2 above the Court should grant them that relief only on the terms that they repay to the defendant the moneys they had borrowed from it. Wells J.A., as he then was, agreed with Kelly J.A.\nLaskin J.A. opened his reasons as follows:\nI have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Kelly and I agree with him that The Loan and Trust Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 222, does not invalidate the impugned mortgage. I am also in substantial agreement with him on the alternative view that he has taken of the case, but would like to express my own opinion thereon.\nI share the view, held unanimously by the Court of Appeal, that the Act does not invalidate the impugned mortgage and I find myself so fully in agreement with the reasons of Kelly J.A. for reaching this conclusion that I am content to adopt them and will not attempt to repeat or summarize them. This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal and consequently I refrain from dealing with grounds 2 and 3 above upon which also Kelly J.A. was prepared to base his judgment. I do not intend by this to cast any doubt upon the validity of his reasons; but while it was desirable for the Court of Appeal to consider these alternative matters in case on a further appeal there should be disagreement as to ground 1 there is now no necessity to consider them.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 1 O.R. 508, 61 D.L.R.

The parties were married on January 31, 1957, and lived together as man and wife until the wife died on May 1, 1964. She left a will dated July 3, 1957. Her estate was valued for taxation purposes at $228,000. Nothing was left to the appellant. He purported to take under The Dower Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 65, then in force under which he claimed to be entitled to a life estate in the homestead of the deceased and also to one-third of the net estate.\nAn action brought by the appellant to set aside the pre-nuptial agreement was dismissed at trial, and on appeal the trial judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal. An appeal was then brought to this Court. The substantial ground argued in the Court of Appeal and in this Court was that the pre-nuptial agreement of January 29, 1957, was void as being contrary to public policy.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court adopted the reasons of Monnin J.A. who had dealt fully and correctly with the public policy issue.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming a judgment of Bastin J. Appeal dismissed. Maurice J. Arpin, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nFrancis C. Muldoon and R\u00e9mi Lafreni\u00e8re, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant Albert Stern was a bachelor age 57 who, in January 1957, was the manager of a large department store in St. Paul, Alberta. He learned through a traveller who came to the store of one Mrs. Minnie Koslovsky, a widow, who resided in Winnipeg. The appellant had not known of her prior to this. He telephoned Mrs. Koslovsky and she suggested that he should come to Winnipeg to see her. They had several conversations in which the appellant states that he told Mrs. Koslovsky he would want from $25,000 to $30,000 to start a business in Winnipeg. She promised, according to appellant, that she would provide $25,000. They agreed to get married. The appellant returned to St. Paul, resigned his position, shipped his personal belongings to Winnipeg and moved there.\nOn January 29, 1957, two days prior to the marriage, the appellant and Mrs. Koslovsky entered into a pre-nuptial agreement which is the subject of this litigation. The agreement which was under seal was executed in the office of Mrs. Koslovsky\u2019s solicitor, Mr. David Levin, Q.C. It contained covenants as follows:\n1. The said Minnie Koslovsky and the said Albert Stern hereby covenant and agree with each other that during their marriage, each of them shall be completely independent of the other as regards the enjoyment, control, administration and disposal of all property, both real and personal, whether owned at the commencement of the said marriage or acquired thereafter.\n2. The said Albert Stern for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns respectively, further covenants and agrees with the said Minnie Koslovsky that if the said Minnie Koslovsky should predecease him, he will, and does hereby waive, remise, release, renounce and stands debarred of all right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever to the present and\/or future estate of the said Minnie Koslovsky, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, both at law and in equity or by statute or otherwise howsoever, whether in possession or expectancy or whether by or under the Dower Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 65, and amendments thereto, the Devolution of Estates Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 63 and amendments thereto, The Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 264 and amendments thereto, and\/or any other Act or law whatsoever and wheresoever, either now or hereafter in force, and whether or not the said Minnie Koslovsky predeceases testate or intestate the said Albert Stern, including all rights of election to take under the Will of the said Minnie Koslovsky or not, and any life estate in any homestead of the said Minnie Koslovsky, and of, in, to and out of which the said Albert Stern now has or may hereafter have any right, title, estate, claim or interest.\n3. The said Albert Stern hereby covenants and agrees with the said Minnie Koslovsky that neither he nor his heirs, executors, administrators, trustees or assigns, nor any person or persons, or corporations whatsoever for him and in his name or on his behalf shall at any time hereafter bring or carry on or prosecute any or any manner of actions, causes of actions, suits, proceedings, claims or demands whatsoever or howsoever against the said Minnie Koslovsky, her estate or effects, or for or by reason or in respect of any act, matter, cause, or thing waived, remised, released, renounced or barred by this indenture.\nMinnie Koslovsky covenanted to the same effect with the appellant.\nThe appellant, who at one time considered qualifying for the law profession, had attended McGill University for one year. He acknowledged that he had read the agreement and understood it and that it was signed of his own free will and without any compulsion.\nThe parties were married on January 31, 1957, and lived together as man and wife until the wife died on May 1, 1964. She left a will dated July 3, 1957. Her estate was valued for taxation purposes at $228,000. Nothing was left to the appellant. He purported to take under The Dower Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 65, then in force under which he claimed to be entitled to a life estate in the homestead of the deceased, 25 O\u2019Meara Street, Winnipeg, where the parties had cohabited since their marriage. This property was valued at $17,500 and he also claimed to be entitled to one-third of the net estate.\nHe brought action against the respondents as executors and trustees of the last will and testament of Minnie Koslovsky-Stern claiming:\n(a) A declaration that the document of the 29th of January, 1957, is contrary to public policy, is null and void and of no effect.\n(b) A declaration that the plaintiff\u2019s signature to the said document was procured by the undue influence and misrepresentation of the deceased and ought to be set aside, either wholly or as to the portions in conflict with the plaintiff\u2019s rights under sections 12, 13, 14 and 22 of The Dower Act.\n(c) Alternatively, recision of the said document of the 29th of January, 1957, or of so much thereof as purports to affect the plaintiff\u2019s rights under The Dower Act, on the grounds of undue influence and misrepresentation.\n(d) A declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to a one-third interest in the deceased\u2019s net estate and to a life estate in the deceased\u2019s homestead, in addition, pursuant to The Dower Act.\nThe action was tried by Bastin J. and his judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2]. Bastin J. found as follows:\nThe first ground is that the covenant by plaintiff waiving any claim to his wife\u2019s property, contained in the agreement (Ex. 1), is without consideration. I hold that the consideration to support this covenant is the similar covenant by Mrs. Minnie Koslovsky. There was great disparity between the rights being relinquished by plaintiff and those being given up by Mrs. Koslovsky; but consideration, even if it appears inadequate, is effective in the absence of fraud or undue influence.\nThe second ground is a claim by the plaintiff that by a verbal agreement made prior to the pre-nuptial agreement, Mrs. Koslovsky promised she would give the plaintiff between $20,000 and $25,000 to establish a business in Winnipeg and that she failed to do so. According to plaintiff, Mrs. Koslovsky explained to him that she required the pre-nuptial agreement to satisfy her relatives but that it would not govern her relationship with the plaintiff. It is in evidence that the plaintiff received from his wife a cheque dated March 26, 1957, for $2,000; another dated April 10, 1957, for $2,000; and a third dated May 1, 1957, for $1,000\u2014a total of $5,000\u2014which he claims was not a gift but a loan, which he has since repaid with interest. It is the contention of plaintiff that this verbal agreement to give him $20,000 or $25,000 was part of the consideration for him signing the pre\u2011nuptial agreement and that his wife\u2019s failure to make the gift was a repudiation of the written agreement. If any such promise were made, plaintiff waived its performance by accepting and repaying the loan of $5,000. There is no evidence that plaintiff ever made a demand on his wife to perform such a promise and this renders his story quite improbable, and I reject it.\nHis third ground is that the pre-nuptial agreement is contrary to public policy and to the intent of The Dower Act. At common law an adult is presumed to be sui juris and entitled to contract freely. This is a fundamental principle of law which can only be affected by express legislation. I can find nothing in The Dower Act to show an intention on the part of the Legislature to interfere with the freedom of spouses to contract themselves out of the benefits of this Act.\n* * * Another ground is that of undue influence. The relationship of husband and wife does not create a presumption of undue influence, and in any case plaintiff has admitted he understood the terms of the agreement and entered into it without any compulsion and of his own free will.\nThe final ground is that in April 1959 plaintiff and his wife verbally agreed to cancel the pre-nuptial agreement and that, relying on this verbal agreement, he made a will on April 26, 1959, under which his wife was to benefit. The existence of such a verbal agreement is a matter of credibility and I consider that all the surrounding circumstances make this story improbable. The fact that his story is improbable in the circumstances, the existence of discrepancies in his evidence, and his demeanour, all combine to make his story as to this agreement completely incredible.\nThe substantial ground argued in the Court of Appeal and in this Court was that the pre\u2011nuptial agreement of January 29, 1957, was void as being contrary to public policy. The findings of Bastin J. on the other points are fully supported by the evidence.\nMonnin J.A. dealt fully and correctly with the public policy issue and I adopt his reasons. I do not think that I can usefully add anything to what he has said on this issue.\nIt was also urged that the pre-nuptial agreement was voidable on the ground that it was an agreement classed as a contract uberrimae fidei. Freedman J.A. appears to accept the proposition that the agreement in question here was in that class although also holding that the appellant had in no way been misled. I cannot accept the view that all pre-nuptial agreements are to be categorized as uberrimae fidei. Williams v. Moody Bible Institute of Chicago[3], cited by Freedman J.A., deals with an agreement in which a wife was not given full disclosure and in fact was misled by her prospective husband as to his assets and financial condition at the time she entered into the pre-nuptial agreement. There well may be a substantial difference between a case such as Williams and a case where it is the husband and not the wife who is attacking the agreement on the ground of failure to disclose and particularly in the case of a husband to a marriage of convenience who knows and agrees in advance that he will not participate in the wife\u2019s estate. I do not find it necessary to go into this phase of the matter in view of the finding by Freedman J.A. that the appellant in this case was not in fact misled.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Arpin, Rich & Houston, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Graffton, Dowhan, Muldoon & Lafreni\u00e8re, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1966), 58 W.W.R. 612, 61 D.L.R.

Two days after his entry and while waiting to board a plane to Panama, he was arrested. An inquiry was ordered under s. 26 of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, and the appellant was ordered deported. The deportation order did not specify the country to which he was to be deported, but the Minister has stated that he intends to direct that the appellant be deported to the United States. An appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board was dismissed. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The discretion of the Director under s. 26 of the Immigration Act to order an inquiry is purely administrative and not subject to judicial review. The Special Inquiry Officer had jurisdiction to make the deportation order since the appellant was unlawfully in Canada. It is not necessary that the destination be stated in the order of deportation.\nThe appellant had no right to choose his destination. The choice rests with the Minister and not with the person to be deported. The Minister has that power and his mode of exercising that choice does not raise a question of law which is reviewable by this Court.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland J.: The onus of proving that a deportation order valid on its face is in fact not made bona fide, is on the party who alleges it. In the case at bar the appellant has not discharged that onus.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The purpose of the deportation provisions in the Immigration Act is to prevent the entry into Canada of a person who is not entitled under the provisions of the statute to enter and to evict from Canada any person who is remaining in Canada and is not entitled under the provisions of the Act to so remain. The discretion given to the Director under s. 26 of the Act is semi-judicial in character. In view of the circumstances of this case, no inquiry could, in the terms of s. 26, have been \u201cwarranted\u201d. All that had to be done in order to carry out the purposes of deportation, i.e., the getting out of Canada of a person not entitled to remain, was to let the appellant proceed to board the plane.\nImmigration\u2014Expulsion\u2014Personne \u00e9tant dans le pays ill\u00e9galement\u2014Personne mise sous arr\u00eat alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait sur le point de quitter le pays volontairement\u2014Enqu\u00eate et ordonnance d\u2019expulsion\u2014Ordonnance ne sp\u00e9cifiant pas la destination\u2014Ordonnance a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 validement \u00e9mise\u2014La personne expuls\u00e9e a-t-elle le droit de choisir sa destination\u2014Loi sur l\u2019immigration, S.R.C. 1952, c. 325, art. 2(d), 26, 36, 40.\nL\u2019appelant, un citoyen des \u00c9tats-Unis ayant un dossier criminel dans ce pays et qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 du Canada en 1959, est entr\u00e9 au Canada en 1967, venant du Panama par avion, et \u00e9tant en possession d\u2019un passeport canadien indiquant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9 au Canada et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un citoyen canadien.

Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Spence \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Immigration Appeal Board affirming a deportation order. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nBernard Chernos, for the appellant.\nC.R.O. Munro, Q.C., and N.M. Thurm, for the respondent.\nMartland J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court on May 27, 1968, from a decision of the Immigration Appeal Board given on April 9, 1968, which dismissed an appeal from a deportation order made against the appellant by a Special Inquiry Officer dated February 1, 1968. The facts are succinctly stated in the reasons of my brother Judson. I agree with his conclusions that a decision of the Director, pursuant to s. 26 of the Immigration Act, to cause an inquiry to be held is not subject to judicial review and that the Special Inquiry Officer had jurisdiction to make the deportation order.\nIt is clear since the decision of this Court in Rebrin v. Bird[1] that a deportation order is valid in form although it does not name the country to which the person named is to be deported but it does not follow from this that it would be improper for the order to specify that country. The wording of s. 40(2) of the Immigration Act quoted by my brother Judson appears to contemplate the destination being named in either the deportation order or a separate order or direction made by the Minister, Director, a Special Inquiry Officer or an immigration officer.\nIn the case at bar no such separate order appears to have as yet been made but the Minister has stated, in a letter to the solicitor for the appellant, that if the deportation order is upheld he intends to direct that the appellant be deported to the United States.\nThere was no doubt ample evidence before the Special Inquiry Officer to warrant and indeed to require the making of a deportation order. The Minister has not as yet made an order naming the country to which the appellant is to be deported but the question as to whether the Minister or the appellant has the right to choose that destination is one of law depending on the construction of the Act and the regulations and was fully argued before us and should now be decided.\nIt is to be regretted that the words of the Statute do not deal explicitly with the question. It would have been easy to do so. I agree, for the reasons he has given, with the view of my brother Judson that the conclusion to be drawn from the wording of the Act is that the choice rests with the Minister.\nIt remains to consider the argument addressed to us by Mr. Chernos which is summarized in his factum as follows:\nThe true purpose of these deportation proceedings has been to surrender the appellant to a foreign state because he is an alleged fugitive criminal sought by such foreign state. For that purpose it was necessary to arrest the appellant to prevent his return to Panama and to institute deportation proceedings against him although he neither desired nor intended to come into or remain in Canada. Since November 26, 1967, the appellant has been attempting to quit Canada to return at his own expense to Panama from whence he came. The only proper inference from this evidence is that the real object of these deportation proceedings is the surrender of a \u2018fugitive criminal\u2019 to the United States of America because the United States of America wants him. An exercise of the power to deport for the purpose of extradition is an abuse which should be restrained by this Court. An order of deportation for such purpose is \u2018ultra vires\u2019 the Minister, not made in good faith, neither genuine nor bona fide, and but a sham and a device to perpetrate an illegal act.\nSection 22 of the Immigration Appeal Board Act is as follows:\n22. Subject to this Act and except as provided in the Immigration Act, the Board has sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of fact or law, including questions of jurisdiction, that may arise in relation to the making of an order of deportation or the making of an application for the admission to Canada of a relative pursuant to regulations made under the Immigration Act.\nBy s. 23(1) of that Act, which gives a right of appeal to this Court with leave, our jurisdiction is limited to dealing with questions of law.\nThe appellant\u2019s submission quoted above is made on the supposition that the appellant has been ordered not merely to be deported but to be deported to the United States. I have already pointed out that no irrevocable decision has been made by the Minister in regard to this but I propose to consider the submission on the basis that such a direction has been made. That was the basis on which this branch of the argument proceeded.\nI agree with the view expressed by Stephenson J. in Regina v. Governor of Brixton Prison Ex parte Soblen[2], that the onus of proving that a deportation order valid on its face is in fact a sham, or not made bona fide, is on the party who alleges it, \u201chowever difficult it may be for him to discharge the onus\u201d.\nIn the case at bar that onus has not, in my opinion, been discharged. It was urged by Mr. Chernos in the course of his forceful argument that only one inference can be drawn from the combined circumstances that the appellant has both the desire and the means of returning to Panama the country whence he came, that the Minister has announced his intention of deporting him to the United States and that that country has requested his return as a fugitive criminal. I am unable to agree. To decide that the deportation proceedings are a sham or not bona fide it would be necessary to hold that the Minister did not genuinely consider it in the public interest to expel the appellant. This is the view expressed in Soblen\u2019s case, supra, and I agree with it.\nIn the case at bar, there are good reasons for expelling the appellant as is shown in the reasons of my brother Judson. A person who is unlawfully in Canada cannot exempt himself from liability to have an inquiry directed and to be ordered to be deported by demonstrating his desire to leave Canada voluntarily. The question whether, in such circumstances, deportation proceedings should be initiated is not committed to the Courts.\nOnce it has been held that a valid deportation order has been made which does not name the destination to which the deportee is to be sent, and that in such circumstances Parliament has committed to the Minister the choice as to what that destination shall be, I agree with my brother Judson that the Minister\u2019s mode of exercising that choice does not raise a question of law which is reviewable by this Court on an appeal brought pursuant to s. 23(1) of the Immigration Appeal Board Act,\nI wish to guard myself against being supposed to say that if the facts were found to be as suggested by Mr. Chernos the Courts would be powerless to intervene and to declare that an act having the appearance of being done under the authority of the Immigration Act and in accordance with its provisions is ultra vires because in reality done for a purpose other than that specified by the Statute.\nSince the facts established do not warrant a finding that the order appealed from was wrong in law, or that the proceedings and decisions of which the appellant complains were not taken and made in good faith it follows that this appeal cannot succeed. For the reasons given by my brother Judson and those stated above, I would dismiss the appeal.\nMartland and Ritchie JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant, Donald Edwin Moore, entered Canada on November 24, 1967. He came from the Republic of Panama by way of Mexico. On November 26, 1967, he went to the Toronto International Airport to return to Panama. He had a return ticket for this purpose. He was waiting to board the aircraft when he was arrested. He was notified on November 28, 1967, that the Director of Immigration had directed an enquiry under s. 26 of the Immigration Act. On February 1, 1968, following the enquiry, the appellant was ordered to be deported. The deportation order did not specify the country to which he was to be deported. On February 1, 1968, the appellant served Notice of Appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board. The Board dismissed the appeal on April 9, 1968. The appeal to this Court is, with leave, from the dismissal of the appeal by the Immigration Appeal Board.\nThe first submission of the appellant is that the Special Inquiry Officer should have declined to act and permitted him to leave Canada as he was trying to do. It is argued that the Special Inquiry Officer had no jurisdiction since the appellant was neither seeking to come into Canada nor seeking to remain in Canada. The answer to this submission is that the appellant was unlawfully in Canada contrary to the Immigration Act. On May 8, 1959, a deportation order had been made against him and he was deported to the United States on May 22, 1959. He was therefore in breach of s. 19(e) (ix) of the Immigration Act. He was also in possession of a Canadian passport which stated that he was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen. He was, in fact, born in the United States and was a citizen of that country. When he was trying to leave, he produced that passport for the purpose of obtaining from Canadian Pacific Airlines a tourist card to enable him to enter Mexico on his return journey. He also had a serious criminal record in the United States. This was the reason for his deportation in 1959. There can be no doubt that the deportation order was properly made.\nThe next submission is that the deportation order should have stated the Republic of Panama as the destination, as the appellant requested. The deportation order simply orders a deportation and does not specify any destination. The answer to this submission is that the order was made in accordance with the terms of the Act and Regulation 22. Regulation 22 provides that a Special Inquiry Officer making a deportation order shall make the deportation order in the form prescribed by the Minister. This form does not provide for a destination being stated. It was considered in Rebrin v. Bird and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration[3] and was held to be valid.\nThe only question in this appeal is whether the person being deported has a right to choose his destination after a deportation order has been validly made. \u201cDeportation\u201d is defined by the Act in s. 2(d):\n2. In this Act\n(d) \u201cdeportation\u201d means the removal under this Act of a person from any place in Canada to the place whence he came to Canada or to the country of his nationality or citizenship or to the country of his birth or to such country as may be approved by the Minister under this Act, as the case may be.\nSection 36 provides:\n(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person against whom a deportation order has been issued shall be deported to the place whence he came to Canada or to the country of which he is a national or citizen or to the country of his birth or to such country as may be approved by the Minister under this Act.\n(2) Unless otherwise directed by the Minister or an immigration officer in charge, a person against whom a deportation order has been made may be requested or allowed to leave Canada voluntarily.\nThe only provisions for voluntary departure in the Act are contained in s. 36(2), just quoted, and s. 40(2), which imposes a liability for the costs of deportation on a transportation company in certain events. Section 40(2) reads:\n(2) Where a deportation order or rejection order is made against a person other than a person described in subsection (1), the transportation company that brought him to Canada shall, where he is deported, pay the costs of deportation or rejection from the port of entry from which he will leave Canada and shall at its expense convey him or cause him to be conveyed to the place whence he came to Canada or to the country of which he is a national or citizen or to the country of his birth as directed in the deportation order, rejection order or other order or direction made by the Minister, Director, a Special Inquiry Officer or an immigration officer or at the request of the transportation company and subject to the approval of the Minister, to a country that is acceptable to such person and that is willing to receive him.\nSection 36(2) and the concluding words of s. 40(2) are permissive only and do not compel the Minister to act under them. The definition of \u201cdeportation\u201d and s. 36(1) state four possible destinations:\n(a) the place whence he came;\n(b) the country of which he is a national or citizen;\n(c) the country of birth;\n(d) such country as may be approved by the Minister under this Act.\nThe sections do not state that the Minister may make the choice, if the facts of a given case permit a choice. Neither do they impose any limitation on the power of the Minister. We have here a valid deportation order. There are four stated destinations. My conclusion on this legislation is that the choice rests with the Minister and not with the person to be deported. He has the power and its mode of exercise does not raise a question of law which is reviewable by this Court.\nIt has been stated that the discretion given to the Director under s. 26 of the Act is quasi judicial in character and subject to review by a court if it thinks that he acted on insufficient information. I cannot agree with this. The discretion is purely administrative and not subject to judicial review.\nThis matter was fully dealt with in this Court in Calgary Power Limited v. Copithorne[4] and the above proposition decisively rejected. The implications of any such doctrine are serious. The administration of the Immigration Act would be paralysed. There would be repercussions on the laying of informations and the preferring of indictments under the Criminal Code, and, in all probability, on the powers of arrest.\nI state this conclusion without finding it necessary to consider s. 22, 14-15-16 Eliz. II, c. 90, the Immigration Appeal Board Act enacted in 1967. It reads as follows:\n22. Subject to this Act and except as provided in the Immigration Act, the Board has sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of fact or law, including questions of jurisdiction, that may arise in relation to the making of an order of deportation or the making of an application for the admission to Canada of a relative pursuant to regulations made under the Immigration Act.\nand replaces s. 39 of the old Act, which read as follows:\n39. No court and no judge or officer thereof has jurisdiction to review, quash, reverse, restrain or otherwise interfere with any proceeding, decision or order of the Minister, Deputy Minister, Director, Immigration Appeal Board, Special Inquiry Officer or immigration officer had, made or given under the authority and in accordance with the provisions of this Act relating to the detention or deportation of any person, upon any ground whatsoever, unless such person is a Canadian citizen or has Canadian domicile.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and Judson J. I am unable to agree with the conclusions therein for the following reasons.\nThe purpose of the deportation provisions in the Immigration Act is to prevent the entry into Canada of a person who is not entitled under the provisions of the statute to enter and to evict from Canada any person who is remaining in Canada and is not entitled under the provisions of the Act to so remain. The definition of \u201cdeportation\u201d in s. 2(d) commences with the words \u201c \u2018deportation\u2019 means the removal under this Act of a person from any place in Canada\u2026\u201d\nSection 11(2) of the statute provides:\n11. (2) A Special Inquiry Officer has authority to inquire into and determine whether any person shall be allowed to come into Canada or to remain in Canada or shall be deported. The special inquiry officer in the present case informed the appellant of such purpose of the inquiry. As pointed out by Judson J., the appellant was arrested under the provisions of s. 16 of the Immigration Act, and I agree with my learned brother that he was properly so arrested.\nSection 19(1)(a) of said statute provides:\n19. (1) Where he has knowledge thereof, the clerk or secretary of a municipality in Canada in which a person hereinafter described resides or may be, an immigration officer or a constable or other peace officer shall send a written report to the Director, with full particulars, concerning\n(a) any person, other than a Canadian citizen, who engages in, advocates or is a member of or associated with any organization, group or body of any kind that engages in or advocates subversion by force or other means of democratic government, institutions or processes, as they are understood in Canada;\nIn compliance with that section, R.G. Lynn, Immigration Officer in Toronto, Ontario, on November 27, 1967, reported by telegram and that report was produced as an exhibit before the special inquiry officer. It reads as follows:\nIMM TOR\n27-11-67 1:35 195\nDIST ADMIN TOR URGENT ATTN ENFORCEMENT\nTO DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION\nPURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPHS (IV), (VIII) AND (IX) OF PARAGRAPH (E) OF SUBSECTION (1) OF SECTION 19 OF THE IMMIGRATION ACT, THIS IS A REPORT CONCERNING DONALD EDWIN MOORE A PERSON OTHER THAN A CANADIAN CITIZEN OR A PERSON WITH CANADIAN DOMICILE WHO WAS A MEMBER OF A PROHIBITED CLASS AT THE TIME OF HIS ADMISSION TO CANADA, NAMELY THE PROHIBITED CLASS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (D) OF SECTION 5, WHO CAME TO CANADA OR REMAINS THEREIN WITH A FALSE OR IMPROPERLY ISSUED PASSPORT OR BY REASON OF ANY FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION, FORCE, STEALTH OR OTHER FRAUDULENT OR IMPROPER MEANS WHETHER EXERCISED OR GIVEN BY HIMSELF OR BY ANY OTHER PERSONS AND WHO RETURNS TO OR REMAINS IN CANADA CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT AFTER A DEPORTATION ORDER HAS BEEN MADE AGAINST HIM\nSIGNED R G LYNN\nIMMIGRATION OFFICER\nTORONTO ONTARIO 27 NOVEMBER 1967 The duty of the Director of Immigration to whom such report was made is set out in s. 26 of the Immigration Act as follows:\n26. Subject to any order or direction by the Minister, the Director shall, upon receiving a written report under section 19 and where he considers that an inquiry is warranted, cause an inquiry to be held concerning the person respecting whom the report was made.\n(The emphasis is my own.)\nThere was no order or direction by the Minister in the present case. Acting upon this report, one J.B. Bissett, the Chief Enforcement Officer, Home Branch, purporting to act for the Director of Immigration, on the 28th of November 1967, telegraphed to the District Administrator of Immigration in Toronto largely repeating from Lynn\u2019s telegram report which I have set out above and concluding, \u201cI direct that an inquiry be held\u201d. I shall presume, without further investigation, that Mr. Bissett could so act for the Director of Immigration as that issue was not referred to by counsel in argument before this Court. Presuming Mr. Bissett\u2019s act to be that of the Director, it is quite evident that he was purporting to exercise a discretion given to the Director by the provisions of s. 26 of the Immigration Act which I have quoted. The words \u201cand where he considers that an inquiry is warranted\u201d expressly provide for such discretion. The discretion, in my view, is semi-judicial in character because its exercise results in the setting up of an inquiry to determine whether the appellant should be permitted to remain in Canada or to be deported. I need cite no authority for the proposition that in such a quasi-judicial exercise of discretion the person purporting to exercise the discretion must do so judicially. It is, surely, the essence of a judicial exercise of discretion that a person receive proper and complete information upon the matter as to which he is to exercise the said discretion.\nMr. Lynn, in his written report which I have quoted, made no mention whatsoever that at the time when the appellant was arrested he was in the Malton Airport at Toronto awaiting the opportunity to board the plane to Panama or that he always has insisted and still does insist that he desires not to remain in Canada but to leave Canada and to leave Canada just as quickly as he is permitted. Had the Director or Mr. Bissett acting in his place and stead been so informed it would seem inevitable that he would have come to the conclusion that an inquiry was not \u201cwarranted\u201d. All that had to be done in order to carry out the purposes of deportation, i.e., the getting out of Canada of a person not entitled to remain, was to let the appellant proceed and therefore no inquiry could, in the terms of s. 26, have been \u201cwarranted\u201d.\nCounsel for the Minister pointed out that the appellant had been guilty of several serious infractions of the provisions of the Immigration Act for which he was subject to prosecution. Of course, the complete answer to that submission is that under Part VI of the Immigration Act there is not only a statement of the various offences but detailed provision as to their prosecution and to date there has been no attempt to institute any such prosecution. Any such purpose for the arrest of the appellant would seem to have been long since forgotten. Counsel for the Minister also pointed out that the appellant is said to have committed various offences in the United States of America and that the authorities there seek his return for the purpose of prosecuting him upon such offences. Again, there is a procedure recognized in international law and made statutory in Canada by the provisions of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 322, as amended, a procedure which has been used on very many occasions for the purpose of delivering to the authorities of the United States of America persons who are charged with extraditable offences thereunder. In the present case, this Court has not been informed of any attempt to commence proceedings under the provisions of the Extradition Act.\nCounsel for the Minister argued that if this appeal were allowed and the deportation order quashed the appellant would be free and could change his mind about his desire to leave Canada and could disappear. Of course, there are means both legal and practical to prevent that. I am sure that the Department of Manpower and Immigration could provide a sufficiently alert guard to make certain that the appellant boarded the plane for Panama from which he came through Mexico and once he was aboard and the plane was in flight it would be a little difficult for him to change his mind and return to Canada. Secondly, at the slightest indication of a change of mind, the appellant would become a person who being in Canada and not being entitled to be in Canada sought to remain in Canada, and then would be a proper subject for a hearing by an inquiry officer, and could, of course, be detained for such purpose. Thirdly, there are always the possible charges under the Immigration Act hanging over the head of the appellant.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and quash the deportation order.\nUnder the provisions of s. 23(3) of the Immigration Appeal Board Act, 14-15-16 Eliz. II, c. 90, no order as to costs should be made.\nAppeal dismissed, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.C. Bazos, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

At the same time A executed an encumbrance which gave K and his wife and the survivor of them a \u201cliferent\u201d in the land, with an equal remainder interest to each of their three daughters (the female appellants) and A. A petroleum and natural gas lease which A entered into with CS Co., following the discovery of oil in the area in 1947, provided that the lessor was to receive a royalty of 12\u00bd per cent on production. K consented to the lease but no consent thereto was obtained by A from his three sisters. They contested the validity of the lease but later a settlement was effected and they ratified the lease. In 1948 K assigned various portions of the royalty to his son J and members of J\u2019s family and A, and, later in the same year, he entered into a royalty trust agreement with a trust company. In 1952 K made assignments to two of his daughters.\nDrilling on the land was successful and oil and gas came into production. The royalties were paid to the trust company and were disbursed by it to K and to his various assignees, according to their interests, until June 14, 1957, when K purported to revoke the assignments which he had made in favour of J and members of J\u2019s family. Thereafter, no payments were made to them and the moneys were accumulated, until April 20, 1959, in a fund known as Fund 1. The trust company obtained an interpleader order on March 13, 1958, respecting the moneys affected by the purported revocation. Pleadings were filed but the action was not proceeded with to judgment.\nThe other moneys received by the trust company, not affected by the revocation, were paid out until April 20, 1959. At that time the trust company was advised of a dispute as to K\u2019s right to receive or dispose of the royalties. An interpleader order was obtained on June 9, 1960, and this gave rise to two actions which were tried together. Since April 20, 1959, the trust company ceased all payments, and the entire royalty payments received by it were all accumulated in a second fund, known as Fund 2.\nK died in 1961, having been predeceased by his wife in 1945.\nThe submission of the appellants was that K never, at any time, had the right to receive or dispose of the 12\u00bd per cent royalty payable under the CS lease. It was contended that, under the provisions of the encumbrance, he had only a \u201cliferent\u201d, thereby being in the position of a tenant for life. As such, he was not entitled to the proceeds, received by way of royalty, from the lease of the petroleum substances, because such receipts were capital and not income, and, therefore, rightly belonged to the remaindermen.\nThe trial judge, while acknowledging that the term \u201cliferent\u201d conveys the conception of a life tenancy and that normally the proceeds of a royalty would not be included, found as a fact that K\u2019s family had agreed that K should be entitled to receive the royalties paid pursuant to the lease as his own income during his lifetime. Accordingly, he dismissed both actions. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that he was justified in making this finding and agreed with his reasons. Appeals in the two actions were then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: In essence what had occurred here was the creation of a trust by K, with A as trustee, of which the beneficiaries were K and his wife, A and the three appellants. K, the settlor, reserved to himself a \u201cliferent\u201d and some additional benefits. The meaning of the word \u201cliferent\u201d in the encumbrance was ambiguous and in determining what the parties meant by that term it was proper to consider the evidence as to what had subsequently occurred. As held by the Courts below, the members of K\u2019s family had agreed as to his right to the royalties. This was not, therefore, a matter of acquiescence by. a beneficiary in a breach of trust by a trustee. It was a matter of agreement by all parties as to the intention of a settlement agreement which provided for their interests in the land.\nCampbell v. Wardlaw (1883), 8 App. Cas. 641; Gowan v. Christie (1873), L.R. 2 H.L. Sc. & Div. 273; McColl Frontenac Oil Co. Ltd. v. Hamilton, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 127; Berkheiser v. Berkheiser and Glaister, [1957] S.C.R. 387; Watcham v. Attorney-General of East Africa Protectorate, [1919] A.C. 533, referred to.\nPer Cartwright C.J., dissenting: It was the duty of the trustee to hold the proceeds of the royalties as forming part of the capital of the trust, to invest them, to pay the income from the investments to K during his lifetime and on his death to distribute the capital amongst the remaindermen. It was not proved that the appellants had entered into a binding agreement the effect of which was to alter the rights of the parties so that K became entitled to receive as his own the whole of the royalties so long as he lived. The evidence established only that after the discovery of oil, the parties were in doubt as to what were the true rights of K in respect of the royalties, that he took the view that he was entitled to receive them as his own and that the three appellants acquiesced in this primarily because they \u201cdid not wish to disturb or upset their father\u201d.\nThe payments of the royalties to K as if he was entitled to them for his own use were breaches of trust but breaches in which each of the appellants acquiesced. A beneficiary who has consented to a breach of trust may retract the consent so given at any time before the consent has been acted upon. In regard to the money in the two funds, whatever consent had been given by the three appellants was withdrawn before it was acted upon and those moneys remained in the hands of the trust company.\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming the decision at trial dismissing two actions which arose out of the same facts and were tried together. Appeals dismissed, Cartwright C.J. dissenting.\nJ.C. Cavanagh, Q.C., and R.J. Biamonte, for the plaintiff, appellant, Annie Hayduk.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., and Gordon S.D. Wright, for the plaintiffs, appellants, Katherine Flechuk et al.\nW.A. Stevenson, for the defendant, respondent, Elizabeth Sereda.\nJ.T. Joyce and J.A. Hustwick, for the defendants, respondents, John Sereda et al.\nJ.J. Stratton and G.A.I. Lucas, for the defendant, respondent, Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts, the course of the proceedings in the Courts below and the questions raised in these appeals are set out in the reasons of my brother Martland which I have had the advantage of reading.\nI agree that the appellants cannot successfully question the payments made by Andrew Sereda and later by the Prudential Trust Company Limited out of the proceeds of the royalties derived from the sale of the oil found in the land described in the \u201cencumbrance\u201d dated August 24, 1943, executed under seal by Andrew Sereda. Each of the appellants was well aware that these payments were being made and acquiesced therein.\nI have, however, reached a different conclusion as to the rights of the parties in regard to the two funds held by the Trust Company pending the result of the proceedings in relation thereto.\nAs a matter of construction, it is my opinion, as it was that of the learned trial judge, that the legal effect of the \u201cencumbrance\u201d was as follows: Andrew Sereda remained the owner in fee simple of the legal estate in the lands which Kost Sereda had conveyed to him and held the same in trust for the benefit of Kost Sereda and Eva Sereda as life tenants with remainder in fee of one-quarter share each for himself, the appellant Annie Hayduk, the appellant Katherine Flechuk and the appellant Mary Waterton. Whatever meaning the draftsman or Andrew Sereda intended should be given to the word \u201cliferent\u201d I am unable to find any ground for holding that it conferred on Kost Sereda rights higher than those of a tenant for life.\nThe \u201cencumbrance\u201d also contained provisions for additional payments for the support of Kost Sereda and Eva Sereda during their lifetime but these provisions do not require further consideration. It is established that the proceeds of oil extracted from land form, as between the life tenants and the remaindermen, capital and not income. I find nothing in the words of the \u201cencumbrance\u201d to justify a departure from that rule. It was therefore the duty of the trustee to hold the proceeds of the royalties as forming part of the capital of the trust, to invest them, to pay the income from the investments to Kost Sereda during his lifetime and on his death to distribute the capital amongst the remaindermen. The difficult question is whether the appellants entered into a binding agreement the effect of which was to alter the rights of the parties so that Kost Sereda became entitled to receive as his own the whole of the royalties so long as he lived. If such an agreement were in fact entered into between Kost Sereda, Andrew Sereda and the three appellants, the Courts would, in my opinion, give effect to it as a family arrangement, the agreement by each of the remaindermen to give up his or her share of the royalties being a sufficient consideration for the similar agreement made by the others. For this reason, I do not think that if the making of such an agreement was proved the argument that the appellant Annie Hayduk received no consideration would avail.\nHowever, on a consideration of the evidence and of the reasons of the learned trial judge, I have reached the conclusion that it was not proved that any such agreement was made. It seems to me that the evidence establishes only that, after the discovery of oil, the parties were in doubt as to what were the true rights of Kost Sereda in respect of the royalties, that he took the view that he was entitled to receive them as his own and that the three appellants acquiesced in this primarily because they \u201cdid not wish to disturb or upset their father\u201d.\nThe Court of Appeal disposed of the matter at the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellants without calling on counsel for the respondents, as follows:\nThe learned trial judge found as a fact that there was an agreement among the members of the family that the proceeds from the lease should belong to the father for his lifetime.\nWe all agree that the learned trial judge was justified on the evidence in coming to the conclusion which he did. We have come to the same conclusion and concur in his reasons.\nIt is therefore necessary to examine the findings of fact in this regard made by the learned trial judge. These are contained in the passage in his reasons quoted by my brother Martland and which, as a matter of convenience, I shall repeat:\nNow, I think one must now bear in mind a situation that existed in fact. At the time this happened it is clear, I think, that the parties who in 1943 when this family arrangement was arrived at and who were not thinking of oil and gas rights, now in 1947 know that such rights do exist and that they are valuable, and it was wondered just what would be done about it, the family, I am sure, feeling that father was entitled to the natural income from the land, and which was all they had been thinking about to start with, reached the conclusion that during his lifetime he would be equally entitled to the proceeds of the royalty to deal with as he saw fit during his lifetime in the same fashion as he would deal with and was entitled to deal with the normal farm income that had been thought of in the original instance. This I think happened.\nand in the following passage:\nIn this case it is obvious that Kost and Andrew certainly, that is the trustee and the donor under the original trust, treated the royalty as if it fell within the conception of income, and therefore available to Kost during his lifetime. The documentation they entered into makes that clear. It seems to me clear too from the documentation that the plaintiffs Mary Waterton and Katherine Flechuk entered into bear this same concept out. The plaintiff Annie Hayduk has not signed documentation to this effect. Her evidence, however, is before us from discoveries that were read and from them it appears abundantly clear that she was aware from the outset or virtually so that her father was dealing with the royalty as something in which he himself had a life interest, and she explains not having taken exception by saying that she did not want to disturb or upset her father. From the evidence of the other daughters that was put in this same idea is conveyed in addition to the documents they signed that \u201cWell, we are not going to disturb father\u201d. Now, to me this conveys what I think to be and find to be the fact, that this whole family had agreed to the proposition, and the reason why Mrs. Hayduk would not want to kick up a row and not hurt father is that, having agreed to a proposition as a family deal, it would certainly hurt father to find that members of the family were now trying to break it down. I am, therefore, of the conclusion that though an explanation is now given, that it was only because \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to hurt father\u201d, that no action was taken contrary to his, was because in fact the family were in agreement and understood the situation to be, that Kost understood it to be such and acted upon that understanding.\nThe first of these passages does not appear to me to be a finding that the appellants agreed to give up their rights under the trust document but rather that they had concluded, mistakenly; that their father was entitled to the royalties for his own use during his lifetime.\nThe second passage goes farther than this and is, I think, a definite finding by the learned trial judge that an agreement was made.\nIt is with hesitation that I differ from a finding of fact made by the trial judge and concurred in by the Court of Appeal but the finding which he has made does not rest on the evidence of any witness who says that an agreement was reached. It is an inference which he draws from all the evidence; but that evidence does not appear to me to amount to more than this, that for several years none of the appellants objected to their father receiving the royalties as his own. This is not in my opinion sufficient to support a finding that they must have agreed that he was going to be entitled to receive the royalties for the rest of his life.\nThe only basis on which the judgment can be supported is that there was a concluded agreement in the nature of a family settlement. For such an agreement to be binding it must appear that all of the parties to the settlement are bound. In my opinion, the evidence does not warrant an inference that the appellant Annie Hayduk agreed, even if it could be said that it was sufficient to support an inference that the appellants Mary Waterton and Katherine Flechuk did agree.\nIn my view, the payments of the royalties to Kost Sereda as if he was entitled to them for his own use were breaches of trust but breaches in which each of the appellants acquiesced. The law is clear that a beneficiary who has consented to a breach of trust may retract the consent so given at any time before the consent has been acted upon. In regard to the moneys in the two funds, whatever consent had been given by the three appellants was withdrawn before it was acted upon and those moneys remain in the hands of the Trust Company.\nFor these reasons, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed and that judgment should be entered declaring that each of the, appellants is entitled to a one-quarter share in the two funds held by the Prudential Trust Company Limited except such parts thereof as represent interest on the investment of the moneys received by way of royalties.\nAs the other members of the Court do not share my view, it is not necessary for me to consider what order should be made as to costs or whether any directions for an accounting are necessary.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014These two actions, which arise out of the same facts, were tried together. The plaintiffs in both actions are appealing from judgments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which affirmed the decision at trial dismissing both actions.\nThe facts giving rise to these proceedings are as follows: Prior to, August 24, 1943, Kost Sereda, the father of the three female appellants, who are hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe appellants\u201d, was the registered owner, in fee simple, of the South-East Quarter of section 19, township 50, range 26, West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, reserving to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal. This land is hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe land\u201d.\nOn August 24, 1943, he transferred the land to his son, Andrew. Prior to that time he and his wife had farmed the land. He had previously also owned another farm, which had been transferred, some years before, to his son, John. At the time of the transfer of the land to Andrew, Kost was over 83 years of age.\nOn the same date that the land was transferred, Andrew executed an encumbrance of the land and of a lot in the townsite of Calmar. It provided as follows:\nI, Andrew H. Sereda, of the City of Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan, Fur Trader, being the owner of an estate in fee simple in the following lands and premises, namely:\n(1) The South East Quarter of Section Nineteen (19) in Township Fifty (50) Range Twenty six (26) West of the 4th Meridian in the Province of Alberta containing 160 acres more or less Reserving all coal on or under the said land to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company;\n(2) Lot Twelve (12) in Block One (1) Plan 4250 E.O. of the Townsite of Calmar registered in the Land Titles Office for the North Alberta Land Registration District;\nAnd desiring to render the said land available for the purpose of securing to and for the benefit of:\n(1) Kost Sereda of Calmar in the Province of Alberta and Eva Sereda his wife and the survivor of them of the liferent of the said lands;\n(2) The said Kost Sereda and Eva Sereda and the survivor of them such moneys in addition as they and the survivor may require to support them in comfort during the lifetime of both and the survivor;\n(3) Kate Flechuk, Mary Waterton and Annie Hayduk, the natural and lawful daughters of the said Kost and Eva Sereda equally three fourths of the said lands or their equivalent value after deduction of the moneys referred to in the next paragraph;\n(4) From the encumbrance in favour of the said daughters there shall be deducted three fourths of any moneys with interest at 6% per annum in addition to the said lands liferents the said Andrew H. Sereda may have expended or paid out to or on behalf of the said Kost Sereda and Eva Sereda, and also a further sum of Three hundred ($300.00) Dollars;\nThe said Andrew H. Sereda doth encumber the said lands with the liferent of the said Kost Sereda and Eva Sereda and the survivor; The said Andrew H. Sereda doth further encumber the said lands with such moneys as during the lifetime of the said Kost Sereda and Eva Sereda in addition to the said liferent of lands they may require to support them in comfort;\nThe said Andrew H. Sereda doth further encumber the said lands so that on the death of the said Kost and Eva Sereda the said Kate Flechuk, Mary Waterton and Annie Hayduk shall receive equally between them each a one fourth interest in the said lands as owners in fee simple, subject to a charge against the said of any moneys with interest at 6% per annum paid out by me the said Andrew H. Sereda in addition to the said liferent for the maintenance in comfort of the said Kost & Eva Sereda; and a sum of Three hundred ($300.) Dollars payable to me the said Andrew H. Sereda by the said Kate Flechuk, Mary Waterton and Annie Hayduk out of the interest in the said land now encumbered in their favour.\nAnd subject as aforesaid the said Incumbrancees shall be entitled to all the powers and remedies given to an Encumbrancee.\nKost and his wife filed a caveat, giving notice of their interest under the encumbrance.\nIt would appear that Kost, feeling that he could not, at his age, continue to farm the land, disposed of it in favour of his son, Andrew, and of his three daughters, at the same time making provision for the support of his wife and himself, while they lived.\nKost\u2019s wife, Eva, died in 1945.\nAt the time the transfer and the encumbrance were made, it seems clear that no one then contemplated the possible value of the minerals underlying the land. Oil production in the Leduc area, where the land is situate, did not occur until 1947.\nIn that year, on February 8, Andrew entered into a petroleum and natural gas lease with The California Standard Company (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCalifornia Standard\u201d), and on February 11 Kost executed a consent to the lease. The term of this lease was for ten years and if, within that time, drilling operations were commenced, thereafter until all the petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons, other than coal, or any of them, had been fully recovered. A \u201croyalty and rental\u201d of 12\u00bd per cent of gross production of petroleum and natural gas, or its market value equivalent, was provided to be paid to the lessor.\nOn April 16, 1947, Andrew reconveyed the surface of the land to his father. No consent to the lease had been obtained by Andrew from his three sisters, the appellants. On October 23, 1947, they commenced an action contesting the validity of the lease.\nOn November 7, 1947, the appellants entered into an agreement with George Cloakey, under which they received from him the sum of $5,000. He was granted an option to acquire a lease of the appellants\u2019 interest in the petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons, other than coal,. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cpetroleum substances\u201d). It was also agreed that, if he could make a settlement with California Standard, the appellants would affirm the existing lease to that company in consideration of their receiving $75,000 in cash, and a further $75,000 out of production from the land.\nThis agreement stipulated that\nneither the consent, approval, ratification or affirmation of the said Standard Lease nor anything done or received by the Optionors under the provisions of this Agreement shall operate in any way to hinder, defeat, delay or prejudice the rights, remedies and powers of the Optionors against the said ANDREW H. SEREDA to claim, take or receive a share or interest in the royalty to be payable to the said ANDREW H. SEREDA under the said Standard Lease or any other lease affecting the optioned area under and by virtue of the encumbrance annexed as Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto.\nA settlement was effected on September 22, 1948, by an agreement made by the California Standard Company, the appellants, and three other oil companies, which companies acquired one-half of the lessee\u2019s interest in the California Standard lease. The appellants ratified that lease. They agreed to the obtaining of a consent judgment in the proceedings which concerned the validity of that lease, declaring the lease to be valid \u201cand to be a first charge upon all the interest of the said Andrew H. Sereda, the said Kost Sereda and the Claimants (the appellants) in the petroleum and natural gas underlying the said lands\u201d.\nThis agreement also contained a saving clause, much less broad in its terms than the one quoted above from the Cloakey agreement, and containing no reference to any interest in royalty under the California Standard lease. It read:\nNothing herein contained shall operate in any way to hinder, delay, defeat or prejudice any rights the Claimants may have against the said Andrew H. Sereda with respect to the lands, the subject of this Agreement, or the petroleum and natural gas underlying the same.\nThe appellants duly received from the three oil companies the two sums of $75,000 provided for in their agreement with George Cloakey.\nThe following month, Kost Sereda, on October 30, executed four documents, each called an \u201cAssignment of Life Interest in Oil Royalty\u201d, which granted to each of the four assignees a portion of the royalty payable under the. California Standard lease. Reference was made in the recitals to the encumbrance, dated August 24, 1943, and to the lease.\nEach assignment also recited that:\nAND WHEREAS it was further provided in the said Incumbrance that on the death of the Assignor and his said wife, Kate Flechuk, Mary Waterton and Annie Hayduk, natural and lawful daughters of the Assignor, shall receive equally between them each a one-fourth (1\/4th). interest in the said lands as owners in fee simple, subject to certain cash payments therein set forth, the remaining one-fourth (1\/4th) interest to be held by the said Andrew H. Sereda.\n. . .\nAND WHEREAS the Assignor is by virtue of the provisions of the said Incumbrance entitled to all income which may be derived from the said lands during the remaining years of his life and therefore is entitled to all of the said royalty payable under the said Indenture of Lease and is accordingly possessed of and the owner of the gross royalty of twelve and a half percent (12\u00bd%), of the total production from any well or wells that may be drilled upon the said lands or any part thereof for life,\nBy these assignments Kost Sereda assigned, out of the 12\u00bd per cent royalty, to his son, John, 3 per cent; to John, in trust for John\u2019s son, Toby, 1\u00bd per cent; to John\u2019s wife, Anna, 2 per cent; and to his son, Andrew, 3 per cent, making a total, in all, of 9\u00bd per cent.\nOn November 23, Kost Sereda entered into a royalty trust agreement with the Prudential Trust Company, Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Trust Company\u201d), under the terms of which the Trust Company assumed the obligation of receiving payment of the royalties paid pursuant to the lease, and of disbursing the same to the parties interested. This agreement was afterwards ratified by the assignees under the four assignments above-mentioned. On September 22, 1956, Anna Sereda assigned \u00bd of 1 per cent royalty to her daughter, Isabelle L. McClain, and on the same date Toby Sereda assigned \u00bc of 1 per cent royalty to the same assignee.\nIn 1952, Kost Sereda made an undated assignment of 1 per cent to his daughter, the appellant Mrs. Waterton, and on July 28 of that year also made a like assignment in favour of his daughter, the appellant Mrs. Flichuk.\nMrs. Waterton, on September 8, 1952, directed that half of her share be paid to her son, James Waterton.\nEach of the assignments to Mrs. Waterton and to Mrs. Flichuk was signed by the assignee as well as by Kost Sereda, and each provided that:\nI the Transferee hereby agree to accept the said Royalty subject to the terms, conditions and provisions set forth in the Trust Agreement under which the same is issued.\nDrilling on the land was successful and oil and gas came into production. The royalties were paid to the Trust Company and were disbursed by it to Kost Sereda and to his various assignees, according to their interests, until June 14, 1957, when Kost Sereda purported to revoke the assignments which he had made in favour of John Sereda, John\u2019s wife, Anna, and son, Toby. Thereafter, no payments were made to them or to persons claiming through them. The moneys were accumulated, until April 20, 1959, in a fund known as Fund 1.\nThe Trust Company obtained an interpleader order on March 13, 1958, respecting the moneys affected by the purported revocation. Pleadings were filed, but the action has not been determined.\nThe other moneys received by the Trust Company, not affected by the revocation, were paid out until April 20, 1959. At that time the Trust Company was advised of a dispute as to Kost Sereda\u2019s right to receive or dispose of the royalties. An interpleader order was obtained on June 9, 1960, which is the basis of the present proceedings. Since April 20, 1959, the Trust Company ceased all payments, and the entire royalty payments received by it have all been accumulated in a second fund, known as Fund 2.\nAndrew Sereda died on September 4, 1959. His wife, Elizabeth, is the executrix of his estate. Kost Sereda died on September 28, 1961, at the age of 101. The appellants, Mrs. Waterton and Mrs. Flichuk, are the executrices of his estate.\nThe learned trial judge made the following findings of fact, which are fully supported by the evidence:\nIn this case it is obvious that Kost and Andrew certainly, that is the trustee and the donor under the original trust, treated the royalty as if it fell within the conception of income, and therefore available to Kost during his lifetime. The documentation they entered into makes that clear. It seems to me clear too from the documentation that the plaintiffs Mary Waterton and Katherine Flechuk entered into bear this same concept out. The plaintiff Annie Hayduk has not signed documentation to this effect. Her evidence, however, is before us from discoveries that were read and from them it appears abundantly clear that she was aware from the outset or virtually so that her father was dealing with the royalty as something in which he himself had a life interest, and she explains not having taken exception by saying that she did not want to disturb or upset her father. From the evidence of the other daughters that was put in this same idea is conveyed in addition to the documents they signed that \u201cWell, we are not going to disturb father.\u201d\nThe submission of the appellants is that Kost Sereda never, at any time, had the right to receive or dispose of the 12\u00bd per cent royalty payable under the California Standard lease. It is contended that, under the provisions of the encumbrance, he had only a \u201cliferent\u201d, thereby being in the position of a tenant for life. As such, he was not entitled to the proceeds, received by way of royalty, from the lease of the petroleum substances, because such receipts were capital and not income, and, therefore, rightly belonged to the remaindermen.\nThe learned trial judge, while acknowledging that the term \u201cliferent\u201d conveys the conception of a life tenancy and that normally the proceeds of a royalty would not be included, found as a fact that the Sereda family had agreed that Kost Sereda should be entitled to receive the royalties paid pursuant to the lease as his own income during his lifetime. Accordingly, he dismissed both actions.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that he was justified in making this finding and agreed with his reasons.\nOn the appeal before this Court, the position taken by the appellant Mrs. Hayduk differed from that taken by the appellants Mrs. Waterton and Mrs. Flichuk. On behalf of the former, it was contended that she was entitled to recover from the respondents 25 per cent of all the royalties realized from the lands. Counsel for the latter two appellants conceded that, while there had been acquiescence by the beneficiaries, properly entitled, in the payments of royalty disbursed by the Trust Company, any consent to the alleged breach of trust had been retracted. Therefore, he said that these appellants were entitled, together, to one-half of the moneys held by the Trust Company in Funds 1 and 2, after allowance of whatever sums should have been paid out as income, and one-half of the income thereon since the death of Kost Sereda.\nIn my opinion there is no doubt, on the evidence, that there was acquiescence by all the appellants in the disbursement of royalties by the Trust Company to Kost Sereda and to those persons holding assignments from him, and, accordingly, they are not entitled to recover from the Trust Company, or from anyone else, the amounts of the moneys so disbursed. The serious issue in this appeal is as to the argument raised by the appellants Mrs. Waterton and Mrs. Flichuk respecting the disbursement by the Trust Company of Funds 1 and 2.\nThe position of Kost Sereda under the terms of the encumbrance was that he, along with his wife, had a \u201cliferent\u201d. In addition, they were entitled to be provided, by the appellants and Andrew Sereda, with such moneys, in addition to the liferent, as they required to support them in comfort.\nThe use of the word \u201cliferent\u201d in. this document was unusual. It is a term used in the law of Scotland. It is defined in Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary, 3rd ed., as follows:\n\u201cLiferent\u201d is used in Scotland to denote an estate or beneficial interest for life in moveables as well as realty; a liferenter, at least of realty is, as nearly as may be, the same as a tenant for life.\nWhat was its meaning, as used in a somewhat roughly drawn encumbrance, drafted in Leduc, Alberta, in 1943? Did it necessarily have the same meaning as it would receive if used in a family settlement in Scotland drawn by a Scottish solicitor?\nThe position of the appellants is that the word \u201cliferent\u201d, as used in this document, must be given the meaning ascribed to it by Scots law, and that the liferenter is not entitled to destroy any part of the substance of the land. The appellants rely upon the judgment of the House of Lords in Campbell v. Wardlaw[1]. In that case, a testator had directed his trustees to pay to his wife \u201cthe whole annual produce and rents of the residue and remainder of my means and estate, heritable and moveable, during all the days and years of her life\u201d. Before his death, coal and iron mines had been leased by the testator. After his death, the trustees leased others. The issue was as to the widow\u2019s right to receive the rents from these latter leases, there being no question as to her right to receive the rents from the leases made prior to the testator\u2019s death. It was held that she was not entitled to the rents from the later leases.\nThe words used in the will were considered to be equivalent to the gift of an interest as a liferentrix. The widow\u2019s rights in respect of mines opened before her husband\u2019s death are based upon a presumed intention that the person with the limited interest would be at liberty to work the opened mines. (Per Lord Blackburn, at p. 646.)\nAt p. 655, Lord FitzGerald says:\nI think that the laws of both countries are in this respect substantially the same; that is to say a tenant for life in England, and a liferenter, as he is called in Scotland, namely, the person to benefit under the trust deed, stand in the same position; each is entitled to the whole produce and profits derivable from that life estate whatever they are; but in both countries equally he is subject to this limitation, that in England, he must not destroy the corpus of the estate, or, as it is more correctly expressed in Scotland, the substance of the estate is to be preserved and not destroyed; and in both countries it is subject to this also, that the settlor may in either case expressly indicate a contrary intention\u2014he might have said in this case that his widow should, if she had the rents derivable from opened mines, equally have the rents derivable from mines which were unopened.\nAt p. 650, Lord Watson makes this statement, which is, I think, of some significance:\nHad this deed contained an express or implied provision by the late Sir George Campbell that these minerals should be or might be worked by the trustees in the course of their administration, I should have been prepared to hold that it was his intention that when they were so worked his widow was to enjoy the rents or lordships arising from their working, as part of her usufructuary right.\nIn the present case, which does not involve a will, the settlor and all beneficiaries lived for some years after the encumbrance was made. In essence what occurred was the creation of a trust by Kost Sereda, with Andrew as trus- tee, of which the beneficiaries were Kost and his wife, Andrew and the three appellants. Kost, the settlor, reserved to himself a \u201cliferent\u201d and some additional benefits.\nThe encumbrance did not give to the trustee any specific power to work minerals underlying the land, or to grant leases in respect of the same. He did, however, acquire that power by the consent of all the beneficiaries. Andrew, the trustee, executed the lease to California Standard on February 8, 1947. On February 11, 1947, Kost approved the lease in writing. The three appellants contested the validity of such lease, but later, for a substantial consideration, involving the payment to the appellants by three oil companies of $150,000 and the transfer to those companies by the lessee, California Standard, of half of its lessee\u2019s interest under the lease, recognized the validity of the lease. Therefore, after the execution of the settlement agreement of September 22, 1948, the position was that the trustee, Andrew, by consent of all beneficiaries, had validly leased the petroleum substances under the land. This situation was, therefore, comparable to that mentioned by Lord Watson in the passage above quoted.\nIt is also significant, as the learned trial judge points out, that a little more than two months after the lease was granted to California Standard by Andrew, the land was transferred back to Kost, by transfer dated April 14, 1947, and registered on April 16, but reserving to Andrew all mines and minerals, other than coal. Kost, therefore, became owner of the surface of the land and Andrew owned the petroleum substances. However, the encumbrance continued, and it was now an encumbrance providing for a liferent to Kost in respect of the petroleum substances underlying the land.\nThere is no evidence to show that in making this transfer Andrew was acting on his own. The transfer was drawn by the same solicitor who drafted the encumbrance and the fact of this transfer being made was specifically recited in the agreement which the appellants made with George Cloakey.\nWhen the settlement agreement was made the appellants convenanted to join with California Standard in ob- taining a consent judgment that the lease to that company by Andrew was \u201cto be a first charge upon all the interest of the said Andrew H. Sereda, the said Kost Sereda and the Claimants in the petroleum and natural gas underlying the said lands\u201d. (The italicizing is my own.)\nIt is, I think, at this point of time that we must consider what the interested parties to the settlement must be taken to have meant by \u201cliferent\u201d, in relation to the question of whether or not it was intended to include receipts obtained by way of royalty from the leasing of petroleum and natural gas. The trust property now consisted of the petroleum substances in respect of which a lease had been granted authorizing their production by a lessee in consideration of payment by the lessee of a share of production.\nPrior to and at the time of the execution of the settlement agreement, the rights of the appellants as remaindermen in respect of the land were obviously a matter of their serious consideration. After obtaining legal advice, they had challenged Andrew\u2019s right to make the lease, which was virtually certain to continue after Kost\u2019s death. They had recognized the validity of that lease, which called for royalty payments to be made to Andrew.\nUnfortunately, we do not have the benefit of Andrew\u2019s evidence, he having died in 1959. We do, however, know that no demand was made upon him by any of the appellants for payment to her of any part of the royalties. We also know that it was only a little over a month after the appellants executed the settlement agreement that Kost effected assignments of royalty to members of the John Sereda family and to Andrew. Clearly Kost and Andrew were under the impression, following the execution of the settlement agreement, that Kost was entitled, during his lifetime, to receive the royalties.\nAll of the appellants became aware of these assignments soon after they were made. None of them challenged Kost\u2019s right to receive the royalties until the year 1959. In fact, two of them, Mrs. Waterton and Mrs. Flichuk, were themselves recipients of a share of the royalty from Kost.\nAs I see it, the situation is, therefore, that in 1943, when the encumbrance was executed, we have a document which defines an interest by using a word from a system of law other than that which applies in Alberta. The view of the interested parties as to what they meant to accomplish is probably summarized in an answer of Mrs. Hayduk, on discovery. Asked whether the term \u201cliferent\u201d was discussed, she said:\nWe said that everything must go to the parents during their lifetime and if that wasn\u2019t sufficient then the brother (Andrew) was to add what was necessary and then all of us would then settle it between us.\nClearly no one was giving specific consideration to oil royalties at that time, but the evidence which I have summarized, as to what occurred subsequently, in my view, does establish a common understanding among the parties that \u201cliferent\u201d should include a right to royalties during Kost\u2019s life, and an agreement that this should be so.\nI think it is proper in the present case to consider that evidence in determining what the parties meant by the word \u201cliferent\u201d. It has already been pointed out that it is not a term of English common law, which is in force in Alberta. In the case of Campbell v. Wardlaw, previously mentioned, where the words of the will were considered to give the widow the equivalent of a liferent, reference was made, in the judgment of Lord Watson, at p. 649, to a statement of Earl Cairns, in Gowan v. Christie[2], in respect of mineral leases:\nThere is no fruit; that is to say, there is no increase, there is no sowing or reaping in the ordinary sense of the term; and there are no periodical harvests. What we call a mineral lease is really, when properly considered, a sale out-and-out of a portion of land. It is liberty given to a particular individual for a specific length of time, to go into and under the land, and to get certain things there if he can find them, and take them away just as if he had bought so much of the soil.\nThe judgment of Earl Cairns was mentioned in the case of McColl Frontenac Oil Company Limited v. Hamilton[3], (an Alberta case), but it was found unnecessary in that case to decide whether the oil lease there in question constituted a grant of the minerals. In Berkheiser v. Berkheiser and Glaister[4], (a Saskatchewan case), the oil lease under consideration was held by three members of the Court to be a grant of a profit \u00e0 prendre for an uncertain term. The other two members of the Court said it created either a profit \u00e0 prendre or an irrevocable licence to search for and win the named substances. In 1956, in Alberta, The Land Titles Act Clarification Act, 1956 (Alta.), c. 26, declared, retroactively, that the term \u201clease\u201d, as used in The Land Titles Act, includes an agreement of the kind made between Andrew Sereda and California Standard. In view of this, it is not possible to assume that the use of the word \u201cliferent\u201d necessarily debarred the liferenter from a right to receive the \u201crent and royalty\u201d covenanted to be paid by California Standard. The meaning of the word in the encumbrance is ambiguous.\nIn Watcham v. Attorney-General of The East Africa Protectorate[5], a decision of the Privy Council, Lord Atkinson said, at p. 538:\nThe principle of the above-mentioned decisions, so far as it is based on the probability of a change during the lapse of time in the meaning of the language used in an ancient document, cannot of course have any application to the construction of modern instruments, but even in these cases extrinsic evidence may be given to identify the subject-matter to which they refer, and where their language is ambiguous the circumstances surrounding their execution may be similarly proved to show the sense in which the parties used the language they have employed, and what was their intention as revealed by their language used in that sense.\nThe question, however, remains whether in such instruments as these proof of user, or what the parties to them did under them and in pursuance of them, can be used for the like purpose. In Wadley v. Bayliss, (1814) 5 Taunt. 752, it was decided that the user of a road described in an ambiguous way in an award made under an Enclosure Act by the owner of a holding by the award allotted to him, might be proved in evidence in order to ascertain the meaning of those who worded the award. In Doe v. Ries, (1832) 8 Bing. 178, 181, Tindal C.J., in delivering judgment, the document to be construed being modern, said: \u201cWe are to look to the words of the instrument and to the acts of the parties to ascertain what their intention was: if the words of the instrument be ambiguous, we may call in aid the acts done under it as a clue to the intention of the parties.\u201d The fact mainly relied upon in that case to show that the document to be construed was a legal demise, and not a mere agreement for a lease, was this: that the person who claimed to be the tenant or lessee had been put into possession and remained there. In Chapman v. Bluck, (1838) 4 Bing. N.C. 187, 193, was practically to the same effect. Tindal C.J., in giving judgment, said: \u201cLooking only at the two first letters between the parties, on which the tenancy depends, I think this falls within the class of cases in which it has been held that an instrument may operate as a demise, notwithstanding a stipulation for the future execution of a lease. But we may look at the acts of the parties also; for there is no better way of seeing what they intended than seeing what they did, under the instrument in dispute.\u201d Park J. said: \u201cThe intention of the parties must be collected from the language of the instrument and may be elucidated by the conduct they have pursued.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge has found, as a fact, the existence of an agreement among the parties as to Kost\u2019s right to the royalties. He says:\nNow, I think one must now bear in mind a situation that existed in fact. At the time this happened it is clear, I think, that the parties who in, 1943 when this family arrangement was arrived at and who were not thinking of oil and gas rights, now in 1947 know that such rights do exist and that they are valuable, and it was wondered just what would be done about it, the family, I am sure, feeling that father was entitled to the natural income from the land, and which was all they had been thinking about to start with, reached the conclusion that during his lifetime he would be equally entitled to the proceeds of the royalty to deal with as he saw fit during his lifetime in the same fashion as he would deal with and was entitled to deal with the normal farm income that had been thought of in the original instance. This I think happened.\nHis conclusion has been adopted by the judgment of the Appellate Division, with which I agree.\nThis is not, therefore, a matter of acquiescence by a beneficiary in a breach of trust by a trustee. It is a matter of agreement by all parties as to the intention of a settlement agreement which provided for their interests in the land.\nI would dismiss the appeals in both actions, with costs.\nAppeals allowed with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant, Annie Hayduk: Cavanagh, Henning, Buchanan, Kerr & Witten, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants, Katherine Flechuk et al.: Silverman, Wright & Stubbs, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the, defendant, respondent, Elizabeth Sereda: Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Kane, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents, John Sereda et al.: Hansen, Joyce, Ross & Hustwick, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Prudential Trust Co.

The magistrate found that the accused had entered unlawfully and without lawful excuse and had not given an explanation of his presence, that is, a reasonable or logical explanation. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question of law as to whether the magistrate had erred in failing to determine whether the intent to commit an indictable offence had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\nHeld (Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nPer Martland J.: The offence defined in s. 293 of the Code contains two elements: an entry without lawful excuse and an accompanying intent, which must exist at the time of entry, to commit an indictable offence in the dwelling house. Under subs. (2) of s. 293, the Crown could establish a case against the accused upon proof of entry without lawful excuse and in the absence of other evidence. Where, however, other evidence is given relating to the circumstances the Court must be satisfied, upon the whole of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entry was made accompanied by the requisite intent. The trial judge appears to have overlooked that the explanation given by the accused, while not establishing a lawful excuse for his presence in the premises, might well have created a reasonable doubt as to his intent to commit an indictable offence therein.\nPer Hall and Spence JJ.: Proof of the intent to commit an indictable offence, which intent must exist at the time of entry, is a necessary ingredient for a conviction and all that subs. (2) does is to provide prima facie evidence, not disturbing the principle of law that on the whole evidence the Crown must prove each essential element including, in this charge, the intent beyond reasonable doubt. There was no evidence upon which the magistrate could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had entered the premises with intent to commit an indictable offence.\nPer Judson and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: When the magistrate stated that the appellant had not given the Court an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable or logical explanation, he was stating his conclusion that in his opinion the accused\u2019s explanation was no explanation at all. The magistrate\u2019s mode of expression meant that he rejected the explanation as one that might reasonably be true and convicted on the operation of s. 293(2). He was not required to find that the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt entry with intent to commit an indictable offence quite apart from the operation of the presumption. He correctly applied the presumption. On the facts of this case, the appellant\u2019s entry was without lawful excuse.\nDroit criminel\u2014Entr\u00e9e dans une maison d\u2019habitation avec l\u2019intention d\u2019y commettre un acte criminel\u2014\u00c9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction\u2014Preuve de l\u2019intention\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 293.\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable par un magistrat de s\u2019\u00eatre introduit ill\u00e9galement dans une maison d\u2019habitation avec l\u2019intention d\u2019y commettre un acte criminel, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 293 du Code criminel.

En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (2) de l\u2019art. 293, la Couronne peut prouver l\u2019accusation sur preuve d\u2019une entr\u00e9e sans excuse l\u00e9gitime et en l\u2019absence de toute autre preuve. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019une autre preuve relativement aux circonstances est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, la Cour doit \u00eatre satisfaite hors d\u2019un doute raisonnable, en se basant sur la preuve enti\u00e8re, que l\u2019entr\u00e9e \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e de l\u2019intention requise.

Il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve sur laquelle le magistrat pouvait statuer hors d\u2019un doute raisonnable que l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait introduit dans les lieux avec l\u2019intention de commettre un acte criminel.\nLes Juges Judson et Pigeon, dissidents: Lorsque le magistrat a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour une explication de sa pr\u00e9sence, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une explication raisonnable ou logique, il \u00e9non\u00e7ait ses conclusions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que dans son opinion l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une explication.

Appel accueilli, les Juges Judson et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal allowed, Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nJ. Harper Prowse, for the appellant.\nBrian A. Crane, for the respondent.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I am in agreement with my brother Spence and merely wish to add the following comments:\nThe charge against the appellant was that he did unlawfully enter a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, contrary to s. 293 of the Criminal Code.\nSection 293 provides as follows:\n293. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offense therein is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.\n(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused, without lawful excuse, entered or was in a dwelling house is prima facie evidence that he entered or was in the dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.\nThere are two elements in the offence charged as defined in s. 293(1):\n1. Entry without lawful excuse.\n2. An accompanying intent to commit an indictable offence therein. Under subs. (2) it is provided that entry without lawful excuse is prima facie evidence of entry with intent to commit an indictable offence therein. In other words, in the absence of other evidence the Crown can establish a case against the accused upon that evidence.\nWhere, however, other evidence is given relating to the circumstances the Court must be satisfied, upon the whole of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entry was made accompanied by the requisite intent.\nIn finding the appellant guilty, the Court said this:\nI find as a fact that the accused entered the premises of 505 Kennedy-Towers unlawfully and without lawful excuse and he has not given this Courtroom an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable nor a logical explanation.\nJeffrey Bain Austin I find you guilty of being in these premises contrary to Section 293 of the Criminal Code.\n(The underlining is mine.)\nThe Court appears to have been of the view that if a prima facie case, under subs. (2), was made, thereafter the onus was on the appellant which had to be met by providing a reasonable and logical explanation for his presence in the premises. This overlooks the fact that the evidence, while not establishing a lawful excuse for the presence of the accused in the premises, might well create a reasonable doubt as to his intent to commit an indictable offence therein. This is a vital element in the commission of this offence, and it appears to have been overlooked in this case.\nFor this reason I think this appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nThe judgment of Judson and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, in affirming this conviction by the magistrate, delivered the following unanimous reasons:\nAssuming that rule in the Ungaro case is applicable, it is clear that the learned Magistrate considered whether the explanation of the Appellant\u2019s presence in the apartment was one which might reasonably be true. He found that under all the circumstances disclosed the explanation was not one which might reasonably be true. We have examined those circumstances and we agree with his conclusion. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed. To me it is clear that the magistrate disbelieved the appellant and, in particular, held that his evidence was untruthful when he stated that Mrs. Hickling had intended him to look in and keep an eye on the children. Although the appellant stated that he knew the girl and that she was in the apartment baby-sitting and that his only purpose was to \u201cSee if she was O.K.\u201d, the girl\u2019s evidence, which was accepted by the Magistrate, was that the appellant opened the door, said \u201cHi\u201d to her and went directly into the boy\u2019s room and that she was too frightened to ask him to leave.\nThe following are the reasons in full of the magistrate:\nFirstly, with respect to the evidence of the adults, Mr. and Mrs. Hunt, I find that their evidence is very clear. As a matter of fact, I marvel at the restraint exercised by Mr. Hunt in the manner in which he gave his testimony. The testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Hunt and of the Constable, Constable Benson, make it quite clear that the accused was adamant at the time that Mrs. Hickling had asked him to look in upon her children while she was absent from the city. I accept the denial of Mrs. Hickling that she made such a request or that such a request would be even thought necessary because she had left her children in charge of a capable sitter. The evidence of the young girl Margaret or Peggy, as she was probably called, Hickling, who was babysitting the young Hunt boy at the time on this occasion, was quite clear after she got over her first fright at being in this Courtroom. The evidence of that young lady and the evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Hunt clearly indicate also at the time the Hunts returned that Austin, the accused, was sitting on the bed and not at the doorway as he himself said in his own testimony. In other words, on both of those occasions I find that his evidence is untruthful and I accept the evidence to the contrary by the other persons.\nI find as a fact that the accused entered the premises of 505 Kennedy Towers unlawfully and without lawful excuse and he has not given this Courtroom an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable nor a logical explanation.\nIn my opinion, when the magistrate stated that the appellant had not given the court an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable or logical explanation, he was stating his conclusion that in his opinion the accused\u2019s explanation was no explanation at all. When an explanation is tendered as one that might reasonably be true, it cannot be mere fancy but must have relation to the evidence. The magistrate\u2019s mode of expression does not mean that he failed properly to apply s. 293(2) of the Criminal Code. It means that he rejected the explanation as one that might reasonably be true and convicted on the operation of s. 293(2). He was not required to find that the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt entry with intent to commit an indictable offence quite apart from the operation of the presumption. He correctly applied the presumption and in so doing his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division.\nSection 293 reads:\n293. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offense therein is guilty of an indictable offense and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.\n(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused, without lawful excuse, entered or was in a dwelling house is prima facie evidence that he entered or was in the dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.\nThe appellant\u2019s entry into the apartment was without lawful excuse. He went directly to the boy\u2019s room where he sat on the bed and on at least one occasion, laid his hands on the boy. When the boy pulled away from the appellant and tried to get out of bed, the appellant still stayed with him.\nThe magistrate properly convicted the appellant of an offence against s. 231(1) of the Criminal Code on the same evidence.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta pronounced on November 8, 1967, whereby that Court dismissed an appeal from the conviction by the magistrate made on May 1, 1967, of the accused upon the charge that he did:\non or about the 3rd day of April, A.D. 1967 at the City of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, did without lawful excuse enter a dwelling house situated at Suite # 505, Kennedy Towers, with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, contrary to Section 293 of the Criminal Code,\nThis Court granted leave to appeal upon the following question of law:\nDid the learned Magistrate err in failing to determine whether the intent to commit an indictable offence, which is an essential element in the offence defined by section 293(1) of the Criminal Code, had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt? A rather detailed statement of the relevant facts is necessary. The appellant was living separated from his wife and family in Apartment 1104 in the Kennedy Towers Apartment House in the City of Edmonton. A Mrs. Lucy Hickling with her son David and her daughter Peggy, twelve years of age, lived in Suite # 708 in the same apartment house. A Mr. and Mrs. James Hunt and their son David, seven years of age, lived in Suite 505 again in the same apartment house.\nThe appellant knew Mrs. Hickling and her children and had spent part of the evening prior to April 3, 1967, in the company of Mrs. Hickling. He also knew that Mrs. Hickling was leaving for Calgary to spend the weekend. On April 3, 1967, about 5:00 p.m., when the appellant returned from his work, he met in the elevator of the apartment house Peggy Hickling. The appellant left his brief case in his own apartment and then went to the Hickling apartment, picked up Peggy Hickling there, and another young boy from another apartment, and took the two children with him when he went shopping. He returned a very short time later and left the children at their respective apartments. He then returned to his own apartment, and to use his own words, \u201cI had something to eat. I had nothing to do so I decided to go down and see how David and Peggy Lou were making out\u201d. The appellant arrived at the Hickling apartment, # 708, to find that David was there alone. He spent a short time with David and then learning that Peggy Hickling was in apartment 505, the Hunt apartment, he went to that apartment, knocked on the door, and went in. Peggy Hickling had been engaged by Mrs. Hunt to act as a baby sitter for her young child David. She had gone to the apartment after she and the appellant had parted a little earlier in the evening and her brother David Hickling had later attended that apartment to give her a sandwich. It would appear that when he left the apartment, David Hickling had not pressed the lock on the door so that when the appellant knocked on the door and opened it it was unlocked permitting his easy entry. The hour was about 9:30 in the evening; David Hunt had retired to his bed but was not asleep. The door to David Hunt\u2019s room was almost opposite the entrance door to the apartment and it stood open. The appellant walked into David Hunt\u2019s bedroom and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nThe appellant, in his evidence, gave as his reason for entering the boy David Hunt\u2019s bedroom that he was not asleep and that the appellant throught he might be able to get the boy to sleep. The appellant swore that in an attempt to persuade the boy to sleep he promised him a ride in his, the appelant\u2019s motor boat, if the boy would sleep. David Hunt, who gave unsworn evidence, corroborated this statement adding, \u201cI said we could buy our own boat\u201d. Although David Hunt said that the appellant laid against him and his feet were then partially on the floor, Peggy Hickling who had stood in the doorway of the room and observed all that occurred, testified that when the boy David Hunt attempted to roll off the bed the appellant merely put his hand on the boy to hold him in the bed and that at that time the appellant was sitting on the edge of the bed with his feet on the floor. At this juncture, Mr. and Mrs. Hunt returned. What could only be described as a fracas occurred, the police were called and the appellant was taken into custody. Constable Benson of the Edmonton Police Force, who had attended at the apartment upon being summoned, gave evidence that he questioned the appellant as to the reason he had been in the apartment and that the appellant told him that he, the appellant, had been asked by Mrs. Hickling to look in on her children while she was away in Calgary. The constable testified that because of that answer they had not held the appellant in custody that night, but after a further investigation they did place the appellant under arrest and proceeded with the charge. It would appear that that subsequent investigation included questioning Mrs. Hickling, Peggy Hickling\u2019s mother, as she gave evidence at the trial that she had not requested the appellant to look after her daughter since she had already arranged for a responsible person as baby sitter for her children.\nIn his evidence, the appellant testified that his purpose in going down to the Hickling apartment was that he knew Mrs. Hickling was out of town and he thought that she might appreciate him \u201clooking in on the kids to see how they were doing and to be sure they were o.k.\u201d. He acknowledged that he did not recall Mrs. Hickling asking him directly to do so but said that they had had considerable conversation and \u201cI think I may have mentioned that I would check on the kids when she was out of town\u201d.\nIt should be added that both the appellant and James Hunt admitted that they had drunk what they both described as a rather small quantity of alcohol during the course of the evening. Upon all that evidence, the magistrate convicted the accused of a breach of s. 293 of the Criminal Code. That section provides:\n293. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.\n(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused, without lawful excuse, entered or was in a dwelling house is prima facie evidence that he entered or was in the dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.\nIn view of the wording of the question of law propounded by this Court in its order granting leave to appeal, the appellant chose to argue that even upon the basis that the accused had not proved the lawful excuse, the burden of proof which lies upon him under the provisions of s. 293 (1), the Crown had failed to prove that there was any intent to commit an indictable offence. By subs. (2) of s. 293, evidence that the accused without lawful excuse entered the dwelling house is prima facie evidence that he intended to commit an indictable offence therein. Proof of the intent, of course, is a necessary ingredient for a conviction and all that subs. (2) does is to provide prima facie evidence not disturbing the principle of law that on the whole evidence the Crown must prove each essential element including, in this charge, the intent beyond reasonable doubt: Regina v. Wendel[1]. It was also pointed out in the judgment of Tysoe J.A. in that case that the intent must exist at the time of the entry. Tremeear, in the 6th edition, at p. 476, however, in the notes to the section, expresses the view that so long as the intent and the being in the premises are in concurrence then a conviction may be adjudged. The learned author of Tremeear bases his opinion on The King v. Higgins[2], a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. In The King v. Higgins, the charge was \u201cfor being unlawfully in a dwelling house by night with intent to assault\u201d, while in the Wendel case and the present case the charge is \u201centering a dwelling house with intent\u201d. I am, therefore, of the opinion that here the judgment in the Wendel case outlines the applicable law and in order to support a conviction it must be found that the accused had entered the apartment with intent to commit an indictable offence.\nWhen one turns to consider whether there was any evidence upon which the magistrate could find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had entered the apartment with intent to commit an indictable offence, one asks oneself what indictable offence is it alleged the accused intended to commit. The form of charge, unlike those used on the great majority of occasions, does not specify the intended indictable offence and merely describes it in the words of the section, as \u201can indictable offence\u201d. I have read the complete evidence at trial, and such references to argument as are contained in the appeal case and I have read the respondent\u2019s factum, and I do not find therein any clear statement of the offence which it was alleged the accused intended to commit. It is true that the accused was charged at the same time with common assault upon David Hunt and, pleading not guilty thereto, by consent the evidence adduced in reference to the charge presently under appeal was applied to the assault charge. The accused was convicted and was fined $100. Counsel for the Crown in his argument before us would seem to rely upon that conviction as showing the indictable offence which it was alleged the accused intended to commit when he entered the apartment.\nIt is significant that the conviction for assault was one for common assault. The learned magistrate said in discussion with counsel for the accused:\nIn this particular case, I find that the intent on his own evidence was to pull him back into bed, that was sufficient attempt to create an assault here by touching that boy.\nCounsel for the accused: With no hostile intent.\nThe learned magistrate: The attempt was to restrain him, which is sufficient. I don\u2019t accept your argument that it has to be hostile in the sense that you are suggesting not with the new Criminal Code as we have it as of 1955. I cannot understand how upon the whole record there can be any evidence that when the accused entered the apartment he had any intent to commit an assault on the boy, David Hunt. There is no evidence that he knew the age of the boy or even that he had known the boy at all. There is no evidence that he knew the boy would be in bed or would be up and around. There is a perfectly reasonable explanation given by the accused, and in no way contradicted, that his whole intent, which was first arrived at after he entered the apartment, was to persuade the boy to go to sleep, as a boy of that age should have been asleep at that hour. The grasping of the boy by the arm or his shoulder to prevent the boy from leaving his bed was only part of the carrying out of the purpose, not any evidence of an intent to commit an indictable offence.\nThe learned magistrate was much concerned with what he termed \u201cnasty, sexual overtones\u201d but such concern which moved him to request a pre-sentence report and which he even mentioned in his report to the Appellate Division has no support whatsoever from the evidence. I have no hesitation in saying there was no evidence of intent to commit an indictable offence against the boy David Hunt at any time let alone at the time the accused entered the apartment.\nWas there any evidence of intent to commit an indictable offence as to the girl Peggy Hickling? The accused had the girl in his car earlier and had shown no such intent on that occasion. The accused was a good friend of the girl\u2019s mother. When the accused entered the apartment, on his explanation to merely check on the girl\u2019s welfare, he merely greeted her and she greeted him as he walked past her into the boy\u2019s room. The accused never moved near her or touched her. She made no protest at his entry. Although in examination in chief the girl testified in reply to clearly leading questions by the Crown that she was frightened to ask the accused to leave, on cross-examination, she agreed that such fear was really at the possible displeasure of the Hunts should they return, as they did, and discover the accused in the apartment. Again, on all of the evidence, there is simply no evidence of intent to commit any indictable offence against the girl Peggy Hickling either at the time of the accused entering into the apartment or thereafter. For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.\nAppeal allowed and conviction quashed, JUDSON and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Prowse, Dzenick, Grossman & Mousseau, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Alberta.\n[1] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 684, 50 C.R. 37, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 23.\n[2] (1905), 10 C.C.C. 456.\n"

He was then cautioned and made an inculpatory statement which he signed. During the voir dire as to the admissibility of that statement, the trial judge, sitting without a jury, asked the accused, while he was giving evidence, whether the statement was true. The trial judge had stated at the outset of the inquiry that he did not propose to look at it. An objection to the question was overruled, and the accused replied that the statement was substantially correct. The trial judge admitted the statement. The appellant was convicted and his conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. He appealed to this Court, where the issue was as to whether the trial judge erred in law when he asked the accused whether the statement was true.\nHeld (Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J.: The trial judge did not err in law in putting the question which he did. It was not possible to say that, as a matter of law, the question was not permissible, although it was permissible only on the ground that it might assist the trial judge in determining the credibility of the evidence which the accused was giving on the voir dire. However, this was eminently a case in which the trial judge should, in the exercise of his discretion, have refrained from putting the question.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The question was admissible: R. v. Hammond, [1941] 3 All E.R. 318. While the inquiry on a voir dire is directed to finding whether a statement is voluntary, it does not follow that the truth or falsity of the statement must be irrelevant to such an inquiry. There had been no attempt by the trial judge to use the voir dire as a means of determining the guilt of the appellant. The inquiry as to the truth of the statement was related solely to the weight to be given to the evidence on the issue as to whether or not it was voluntary.\nPer Hall J., dissenting: It is true that the accused cannot be compelled by the Crown to testify on the voir dire and does so only of his own will. However, the very purpose of holding a separate inquiry into the admissibility of a confession is that this issue may be dealt with only on evidence relevant thereto. It is an essential feature of this system that the accused is thereby permitted to testify on that issue without prejudice to his right not to testify on the main issue. If an accused cannot testify on the voir dire without being liable to be asked questions bearing directly on his guilt or innocence, he is put in a situation where he cannot do so without in effect being deprived from the benefit of the rule against compulsory self incrimination. At least this is so when the trial is by a judge alone. The question as to whether it was proper for the trial judge to do what he did is a pure question of law.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The question should be ruled to be inadmissible. Under the particular circumstances of the voir dire, the answer of the accused to the question as to whether the statement was true is not relevant, has no probative value in determining the voluntary or involuntary character of the statement, and deprives the accused from the benefit of the rule against self incrimination. It was not possible to say that the putting of the question by the trial judge did not cause a miscarriage of justice.\nPer Pigeon J., dissenting: Questions to an accused concerning the truth of a statement allegedly made by him cannot be permitted as having a bearing on his credibility. These questions really go to the main issue of guilt. They cannot be helpful in reaching a decision on the only issue on the voir dire: the admissibility of the statement. The result of permitting, on a voir dire, questions pertaining to the truth or falsity of the statement must inevitably be to weaken the rule against the admission of involuntary statements and thus to undermine a very necessary safeguard against improper treatment of suspects.\nDroit criminel\u2014\u00abVoir dire\u00bb\u2014Confession\u2014Proc\u00e8s par un juge seul\u2014Le juge demande \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 si sa d\u00e9claration incriminante est v\u00e9ridique\u2014Est-il permis de poser une telle question\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 592(1)(b)(iii).\nAu cours d\u2019une investigation polici\u00e8re, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 au poste de police o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment accus\u00e9 d\u2019avoir commis un attentat \u00e0 la pudeur. Il a fait et sign\u00e9 une d\u00e9claration incriminante apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en garde. Lors du \u00abvoir dire\u00bb pour d\u00e9cider de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9claration, le juge au proc\u00e8s, si\u00e9geant sans jury, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 au cours de son t\u00e9moignage si la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait v\u00e9ridique. Le juge avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de regarder la d\u00e9claration. Une objection \u00e0 cette question ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, l\u2019accus\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu que la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait substantiellement exacte. Le juge a admis la d\u00e9claration. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel. L\u2019accus\u00e9 en appela \u00e0 cette Cour, o\u00f9 le d\u00e9bat s\u2019est engag\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si le juge avait err\u00e9 en droit lorsqu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 si la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait v\u00e9ridique.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, les Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright: Le juge n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en droit en posant la question. Il n\u2019est pas possible de dire qu\u2019en droit, la question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible, bien qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait que pour aider le juge \u00e0 en venir \u00e0 une conclusion sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 sur le \u00abvoir dire\u00bb. Cependant, il s\u2019agit du cas par excellence o\u00f9 le juge aurait d\u00fb, dans l\u2019exercice de sa discr\u00e9tion, s\u2019abstenir de poser la question.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: La question \u00e9tait admissible: R. v. Hammond, [1941] 3 All E.R. 313. Bien que l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur le \u00abvoir dire\u00bb porte sur la question de savoir si une d\u00e9claration est volontaire, il ne s\u2019ensuit pas que la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 ou la fausset\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration n\u2019a aucun rapport avec l\u2019objet d\u2019une telle enqu\u00eate. Le juge n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de se servir du \u00abvoir dire\u00bb pour d\u00e9terminer la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant. L\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 avait rapport seulement \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage sur la question de savoir si la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait volontaire.\nLe Juge Hall, dissident: Il est vrai que l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre contraint par la Couronne de t\u00e9moigner sur le \u00abvoir dire\u00bb et qu\u2019il le fait seulement de sa propre volont\u00e9. Cependant, le but v\u00e9ritable d\u2019une enqu\u00eate distincte sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une confession est de faire en sorte que cette question ne soit trait\u00e9e que sur la preuve qui lui est pertinente. Permettre ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de t\u00e9moigner sur ce point sans pr\u00e9judice de son droit de ne pas t\u00e9moigner sur la question principale de culpabilit\u00e9 est une caract\u00e9ristique essentielle de ce syst\u00e8me. Si un accus\u00e9 ne peut pas t\u00e9moigner sur le \u00abvoir dire\u00bb sans s\u2019exposer \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on lui pose des questions portant directement sur sa culpabilit\u00e9 ou son innocence, il est plac\u00e9 dans une situation telle qu\u2019il ne peut le faire sans \u00eatre effectivement priv\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la r\u00e8gle que personne n\u2019est tenu de s\u2019incriminer. Tel est le cas du moins lorsque le juge si\u00e8ge sans jury. La question de savoir si ce que le juge a fait \u00e9tait permis est une pure question de droit.\nLe Juge Spence, dissident: La question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible. Selon les circonstances particuli\u00e8res du \u00abvoir dire\u00bb, la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 la question portant sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration n\u2019est pas pertinente, n\u2019a pas de valeur probante pour d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re volontaire ou involontaire de la d\u00e9claration et prive l\u2019accus\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la r\u00e8gle que personne n\u2019est tenu de s\u2019incriminer. Il n\u2019est pas possible de dire que le fait d\u2019avoir pos\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une erreur judiciaire grave.\nLe Juge Pigeon, dissident: Des questions \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration cens\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par lui ne peuvent pas \u00eatre admises comme ayant rapport \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sur le \u00abvoir dire\u00bb. Ces questions portent en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sur la question principale: sa culpabilit\u00e9. Elles ne peuvent pas \u00eatre utiles pour en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion sur le seul point qui se soul\u00e8ve lors d\u2019un \u00abvoir dire\u00bb: l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration. Permettre, alors des questions sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 ou la fausset\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9claration ne peut avoir d\u2019autre r\u00e9sultat que d\u2019affaiblir la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019admission d\u2019une d\u00e9claration involontaire et ainsi d\u00e9truire une protection indispensable contre le mauvais traitement des pr\u00e9venus.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario[1], confirmant une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour attentat \u00e0 la pudeur. Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction for indecent assault. Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nJoseph A. Mahon, Q.C., for the appellant.\nR.G. Thomas, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall and I will endeavour to avoid repetition.\nThe only question not disposed of at the hearing of the appeal is whether the learned trial Judge erred in law when he asked the appellant, who was giving evidence on the voir dire, whether the inculpatory statement, dated August 6, 1964, signed by the appellant, which the Crown was seeking to introduce in evidence, was true and insisted on an answer to the question in spite of the objection of counsel.\nThe rule that when the Crown seeks to introduce in evidence an inculpatory statement said to have been made by the accused the onus lies upon the Crown to show that the statement was voluntary is firmly established. It is stated in the following words in Ibrahim v. R.[2]:\nIt has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.\nIt has frequently been applied in this Court.\nWhile the reason for the rule is said to be the danger that a confession, the making of which has been induced by threats or promises made by a person in authority, may well be untrue, it must now, I think, be regarded as settled that when an inquiry is held during the course of a trial as to the admissibility of an inculpatory statement sought to be introduced by the Crown, the question to be determined is whether or not the statement was voluntary and not whether or not it is true. On the other hand, an assertion by the accused that the statement is untrue may logically have a bearing in determining whether or not it was voluntary.\nIn R. v. Mazerall[3], Robertson C.J.O., giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at page 787:\nIt would be a strange application of a rule designed to exclude confessions the truth of which is doubtful, to use it to exclude statements that the accused, giving evidence upon this trial, has sworn to be true.\nI incline to the view that this observation was obiter. The statements the admissibility of which was in question in that case had been made by Mazerall under oath before a Royal Commission under the compulsion of a statute. The basis of the judgment was that such evidence could be used against him unless he had objected to answer and thereby become entitled to the protection afforded by s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nThe question to be determined by the Judge on the voir dire being whether or not the statement was voluntary in the sense mentioned above, I think it clear that the Crown could not lead evidence on that inquiry, the sole object of which was to show that the statement given was true. Such evidence should be excluded on the ground that it was irrelevant. In Hollington v. F. Hewthron & Co.[4], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, drew a distinction between the \u201cmodern law\u201d of evidence and the law before the passing of the statutes which removed the incompetency of witnesses and parties and their spouses on the ground of interest, and, having done so, said at page 594:\nThe law being what it was before these statutes were passed, it is not surprising to find Sir FitzJames Stephen saying, in his Digest of the Law of Evidence, 12th ed., p. 217, Note XVIII, that the law of competency \u201cwas formerly the most, or nearly the most important and extensive branch of the law of evidence,\u201d and that rules of incompetency are \u201cnearly the only rules of evidence treated of in the older authorities.\u201d But, nowadays, it is relevance and not competency that is the main consideration, and, generally speaking, all evidence that is relevant to an issue is admissible, while all that is irrelevant is excluded.\nI agree with his concluding statement that the general rule is that all evidence that is relevant to an issue is admissible while all that is irrelevant is excluded.\nI do not understand that counsel for the respondent seeks to justify the putting of the question as to the truth of the statement on the ground that it was relevant; his argument is that it was a question properly put on cross-examination as bearing upon the credibility of the accused.\nIt is not possible to say that at the stage when the question was put the credibility of the accused was not in issue; he had deposed that one of the officers had said to him \u201cit would be better for me if I did make a statement and co-operated in this respect\u201d; the two officers who were present at the time at which the accused said that this had been said to him had both been examined as witnesses; one had said that he had no recollection of such a statement being made and the other had in effect denied the making of any such statement.\nWhile he did not refer to them by name, it would seem that when the learned trial Judge said he was satisfied by the authorities that the question which he put to the accused was proper, he had in mind the cases of R. v. Hammond[5] and LaPlante v. The Queen[6]. Neither of these cases suggests that the question put to the accused as to the truth of his statement was permissible on any ground other than its bearing on the question of his credibility.\nIn the Hammond case, supra, Cassels J., who was the trial Judge, made it clear that he did not decide on the admissibility of the confession as the result of the admission of the appellant that it was a true confession. He admitted it because he was satisfied on all the evidence that it was a voluntary statement and this is stressed in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.\nIn the LaPlante case, supra, the second ground of appeal was \u201cthat answers made by the accused to questions put by counsel for the Crown showing that the contents of the statement made by him were true were not admissible in evidence on the voir dire held to decide whether those statements should be admitted as voluntary\u201d. Laidlaw J.A., who gave the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, dealt with this ground in the following paragraph, at page 81:\nIn respect of the second ground, we can add nothing to the reasons given by Mr. Justice Humphreys in R. v. Hammond (1941), 28 Cr. App. R. 84. The evidence given by the accused in cross-examination on the voir dire that the statements made by him were true, touches the issue of credibility. Likewise, the admission by him that he killed Edwin Jones touches the matter of his credibility, and his answers in respect of both matters to the questions put by counsel for the Crown were relevant to the issue as to whether or not the statements made by him were voluntary.\nIt should be noted that an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the LaPlante case was made to this Court. It was heard on December 16, 1957, and judgment was reserved. Judgment was given on December 19, 1957, dismissing the application. As is usual in such cases, written reasons for dismissing the application were not given. The case being a capital one, five Judges sat to hear the application. The Court consisted of Kerwin C.J., Rand, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.\nWhile it may be that much of what was said in the judgment in R. v. Hammond, supra, was obiter, the paragraph quoted above from the judgment in LaPlante v. The Queen, supra, formed the ratio of that decision.\nIn the case at bar the decision of the learned trial Judge at the conclusion of the voir dire was as follows:\nThe court has to determine whether the statement is a free and voluntary statement, and I am satisfied on the evidence that it is. Accordingly, it will be admitted.\nI do not find it possible to say that, as a matter of law, the question put in the case at bar was not permissible although I think it clear that it was permissible only on the ground that it might assist the trial Judge in determining the credibility of the evidence which the accused was giving on the voir dire.\nHowever, while it cannot be said that the question was legally inadmissible, in my respectful opinion, this was eminently a case in which the trial Judge should, in the exercise of his discretion, have refrained from putting the question on the ground discussed in Noor Mohamed v. The King[7]:\nIt is right to add, however, that in all such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.\nThis passage has frequently been referred to with approval; an instance is the unanimous judgment of this Court in Lizotte v. The King[8].\nWhile, in my opinion, the learned trial Judge ought not to have put the question and ought not to have required an answer after the objection of counsel, I find myself unable to say that the course he followed constituted an error in law. It was, in my view, with the greatest respect, a mistaken exercise of his discretion but, as has so often been held, in an appeal to this Court in a criminal case, our jurisdiction, differing sharply from that of the Court of Appeal, is limited to dealing with questions of law in the strict sense.\nFor these reasons, I have reached the conclusion that it cannot be said that the learned trial Judge erred in law in putting the question which he did. The ground on which I am of opinion that he ought not to have put it raises no question of law in the strict sense and it follows that in my opinion the appeal must be dismissed. The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The facts which give rise to this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall. The sole issue before this Court is as to whether the learned trial judge erred in law when he asked the appellant whether the statement which he had signed was true.\nThis is exactly the same issue which had to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Hammond[9]. In that case, as in this, a question had been put to the accused on the voir dire as to whether a statement which he had made was true. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Humphreys J., who said, at p. 321:\nThis appeal is brought on the sole ground that the question which was put by counsel for the prosecution in cross-examination of the accused was inadmissible. In our view, it clearly was not inadmissible. It was a perfectly natural question to put to a person, and was relevant to the issue of whether the story which he was then telling of being attacked and ill-used by the police was true or false. It may be put as it was put by Viscount Caldecote, L.C.J., in the early part of the argument of counsel for the appellant, that it surely must be admissible, and in our view is admissible, because it went to the credit of the person who was giving evidence. If a man says, \u201cI was forced to tell the story. I was made to say this, that and the other,\u201d it must be relevant to know whether he was made to tell the truth, or whether he was made to say a number of things which were untrue. In other words, in our view, the contents of the statement which he admittedly made and signed were relevant to the question of how he came to make and sign that statement, and, therefore, the questions which were put were properly put. They were admissible, and they could not, therefore, have wrongly affected the mind of the judge.\nIt was after stating this conclusion as to the admissibility of the question that he went on to point out that the trial judge had not reached his conclusion as to the admissibility of the statement as the result of the admission as to its truth.\nAs the Chief Justice has pointed out in his reasons, the Hammond case was followed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in LaPlante v. The Queen[10], a capital case, and an application for leave to appeal, which could only have been granted on a question of law, was refused by this Court. The notice of motion for leave to appeal to this Court, in that case, relied only upon two grounds. The first was that there had been non-direction amounting to mis-direction in the charge to the jury in respect of serious inconsistencies in the evidence. The second was stated as follows:\nWere the questions put to the appellant during the course of cross-examination on the voir dire by counsel for the Crown as to the truth or falsity of Exhibits 26 and 27 inadmissible, irrelevant and prejudicial?\nThe exhibits mentioned were statements made by the appellant.\nThe written submission to the Court said, in respect of this question:\nIt is submitted that the sole function of the Voir Dire is to determine whether or not the Statement or Statements are voluntary. It is submitted that on the Voir Dire the truth or falsity of the Statement is irrelevant and any question directed to the issue of truth or falsity is irrelevant, inadmissible and prejudicial.\nReference was made to the Hammond case as well as to R. v. Weighill[11] and R. v. Mandzuk[12].\nI am in agreement with the conclusions stated in the Hammond case. While it is settled law that an inculpatory statement by an accused is not admissible against him unless it is voluntary, and while the inquiry on a voir dire is directed to that issue, and not to the truth of the statement, it does not follow that the truth or falsity of the statement must be irrelevant to such an inquiry. An accused person, who alleged that he had been forced to admit responsibility for a crime committed by another, could properly testify that the statement obtained from him was false. Similarly, where the judge conducting the voir dire was in some doubt on the evidence as to whether the accused had willingly made a statement, or whether, as he contended, he had done so because of pressure exerted by a person in authority, the admitted truth or the alleged falsity of the statement could be a relevant factor in deciding whether or not he would accept the evidence of the accused regarding such pressure.\nThere was no attempt by the learned trial judge in the present case to use the voir dire as a means of determining the guilt of the appellant. He stated at the outset of the inquiry that he had not seen the statement and that he did not propose to look at it. When it was produced it was handed to the witness for identification and he was questioned concerning it. Had he been satisfied that the statement was not voluntary, the trial judge would not have become aware of its contents. The inquiry as to its truth was related solely to the weight to be given to the evidence on the issue as to whether or not it was voluntary.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant was convicted by His Honour Judge Waisberg, sitting without a jury in the County Judges\u2019 Criminal Court for the County of York on May 5, 1965:\nTHAT he did on or about the 4th day of August in the year 1964 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, indecently assault one Patricia D\u2019Amata, a female person, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nHe was sentenced on May 14, 1965, to six months definite and two years less one day indefinite.\nThe charge arose out of a complaint by an 11-year old child, Patricia D\u2019Amata, that, in the absence of her parents from the house in which the appellant was a lodger, he had indecently assaulted her by having carried her to his room and placed her on his bed and while on the bed had touched her on the thigh above the knee. She objected and was released. The complaint continued that the appellant grabbed a younger sister, placed her on the bed and touched her in the same manner, but on being threatened by the older girl with a broom he released the younger girl and both girls went to their own room. The complainant\u2019s parents were employed away from the home and when they came home in the evening the complainant told her father what had happened. He phoned the police who came to the D\u2019Amata home about 8:00 o\u2019clock that evening, August 4, 1965.\nAt approximately 2:00 a.m., August 6, 1965, Detectives Gossen and Pringle of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department went to the appellant\u2019s room and requested him to accompany them to the police station. They told him they were conducting an investigation but the matter would not be discussed until they arrived at the police station. The appellant got dressed and agreed to go along with the officers. At the police station the appellant was told by the officers that they were investigating an alleged indecent assault with respect to the daughters of his landlord. The appellant was not cautioned and had not been placed under arrest. After some conversation with the appellant, the officers charged him with indecent assault. He was cautioned and a statement taken which was reduced to writing and signed by him.\nA voir dire was held as to the admissibility of that statement. The two detectives testified that no advantage had been held out to the appellant nor were any threats made. They said the appellant was nervous, embarrassed and co-operative. The learned trial judge said when the statement was being tendered as an exhibit on the voir dire that he did not propose to look at it. The record as to this is as follows:\nQ. I am showing you a statement which I ask to be entered as Exhibit One.\nMR. MAHON: It shouldn\u2019t be entered as an exhibit yet.\nMR. HANS: This would be merely, Your Honour, for identification, his signature and Detective Pringle\u2019s signature, and the fact that this was read out loud and corrected, not as far as content...\nTHE COURT: I haven\u2019t seen the statement yet. I don\u2019t propose to look at it.\nMR. HANS: This is on the voir dire.\nThe appellant gave evidence on the voir dire as follows:\nDIRECT-EXAMINATION ON THE VOIR DIRE BY MR. MAHON:\nQ. Gerard, the officers say that they came to your room at 2:00 A.M. on the 6th day of August 1964, is that correct?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And that you were asleep in your room and that they woke you up, is that correct?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. I see; did they say anything to you in the room as to the nature of the charge against you?\nA. No, they didn\u2019t.\nQ. I see. And then you put your clothes on, did you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Why did you do that?\nA. They asked me to.\nQ. Did they ask you to do anything else?\nA. To come along with them to the station.\nQ. Did you ask them the nature of the charge?\nA. Yes, I did. Q. Did they tell you?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. So you went and got into the car and went with the officers, is that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. There were two officers, and the two officers who testified, was it these two?\nA. Yes.\nQ. On the way down to the station, was there any conversation about the charge, or the nature of the charge?\nA. I was trying to find out what it was all about. I was sort of puzzled.\nQ. Did they tell you?\nA. No.\nQ. Did they tell you the nature of the charge?\nA. I asked whether it was a serious charge?\nQ. What did they say?\nA. One of the officers agreed to it?\nQ. Pardon?\nA. One of the officers said it was serious.\nQ. He said it was a serious charge, I see. Now, after you got down to the station, what happened?\nA. Well, they began to interrogate me.\nQ. They began to question you?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. There were just the two officers there, Gossen and Pringle, and what happened?.\nA. The officers\u2014its such a long time ago, its very hard to remember exactly what happened.\nQ. The exact wording?\nA. Yes; they did explain that the indecent assault had happened in the house at 54 Beatrice Street.\nQ. I see.\nA. And they asked me would I be so kind\u2026\nQ. Speak up, I can\u2019t hear.\nA... as to make a statement, which I did.\nQ. And did they say anything else before you made the statement?\nA. Well, I asked them what I should do; did I have to. They said, well, it would be better for me if I did make a statement and cooperated in this respect.\nQ. And was it subsequent to that you told them\u2014you made a statement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Then later, was there a caution given to you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. I see. And was what you told them before caution in the statement itself?\nA. More or less, it was all along the same lines, yes.\nQ. The officer said you were nervous and agitated, would you agree with that?\nA. Yes, I may have been. Q. And did they tell you you were entitled to counsel?\nA. No, sir.\nMR. MAHON: That will be all.\nCROSS-EXAMINATION ON THE VOIR DIRE BY MR. HANS:\nQ. Mr. DeClercq, at this time were you feeling ashamed? Were you feeling ashamed of yourself?.\nA. Yes, I think any person with police officers...\nQ. Was your conscience bothering you?\nMR. MAHON: No. Objection; the only matter that is material here\u2014This is not cross\u2011examination in general. It is an examination purely on the question of the voluntariness of the statement.\nTHE COURT: Where is the statement? Have you it there?\u2014Court receives document.\nBY THE COURT:\nQ. Give the witness the exhibit. Is that the statement you signed?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Is it true?\nMR. MAHON: Now, in addition to that, the question of whether the statement is true or is not is not material here.\nTHE COURT: I think it is.\nMR. MAHON: It is purely whether the statement is voluntary or not.\nTHE COURT: Eventually the proper statement was put to the witness. I think it is very important whether it is true or not. I note your objection and I think it is a proper question taken at this time.\nMR. MAHON: There are all sorts of cases.\nTHE COURT: Yes, I have read them all. I am quite familiar with them and I am satisfied with my ruling.\nWITNESS: Yes, Your Honour.\nTHE COURT: All right.\nWITNESS:...except for a few details, I would say the statement is correct.\nTHE COURT: All right. Have you any further questions?\nMR. HANS: No further questions, Your Honour.\nIt is obvious that the first part of the last answer was not recorded and it is to be noted that the appellant was not asked as to the details in which the statement was not correct. After hearing argument, the learned trial judge admitted the statement. It could not be successfully argued that the statement should not have been admitted because the evidence on the voir dire was quite conclusive that it was in fact a voluntary statement apart altogether from the question as to its truth put by the judge.\nAccordingly, the issue in this appeal is not whether the statement was properly admitted but whether the learned trial judge was in error in taking over the cross-examination of the appellant, and having directed that the \u2018confession\u2019 be put in the appellant\u2019s hands, put to him the question \u201cIs it true?\u201d Defence counsel objected that the question was not proper. The learned judge ruled that his question was proper and required the appellant to answer which he did.\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal[13] on a number of grounds, but the only one we are now concerned with is no. 5 as follows:\n5. That I gave evidence on the voir dire; that when objection was made by my Counsel to my being cross-examined on the contents of the statement, the Judge himself, over the objection of my Counsel questioned me as to the truth or otherwise of the statement; that I replied that the statement was true in part; that the learned trial Judge erred in questioning me on the statement otherwise than on the ground as to whether or not the statement was a voluntary statement.\nThe appeal was heard by MacKay, McLennan and Laskin JJ.A. MacKay and McLennan JJ.A. dealt with this ground of appeal as follows:\nAs to the appellant being asked on the voir dire if his statement given to the police was true, we are bound by the decision of this court in Regina v. LaPlante (1958) OWN 80 in which it was held that such a question is permissible.\nLaskin J.A. dissented, saying:\nThe accused was charged with an offence of a sexual nature, and the rule of caution against convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant is applicable. If the accused\u2019s statement was properly receivable, it would provide ample corroboration of competent evidence against the accused. Objection was taken at the trial to its admissibility, and the trial Judge, who was sitting alone, proceeded to a voir dire. The accused gave evidence on the trial within a trial, and in the course of his testimony the presiding Judge asked him if the statement was true. The reply given after objection was that it was substantially true.\nIn my opinion, this question was improperly asked on the voir dire. I do not find fault with the trial Judge because he was following the judgment of this Court in Regina v. LaPlante, (1958) O.W.N. 80, which in turn rested on the judgment of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Hammond, (1941) 3 All E.R. 318, 28 Cr. App. R. 84. To say, as was said in the Hammond case that the question is relevant to credibility is too simple an analysis of the issues raised by the question. I prefer the contrary approach of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Regina v. Hnedish (1958) 26 W.W.R. 685, 29 C.R. 347. I note also that Rex v. Hammond was questioned by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Rex v. Weighill, (1945) 2 D.L.R. 471, 83 C.C.C. 387, and it is criticized in Cross on Evidence (2nd ed. 1963) p. 55. I do not regard this Court as being prevented by any principle of stare decisis from reconsidering its previous decisions. If distinctions must be made, I would readily agree that to allow a trial Judge sitting alone (or Crown Counsel in such a case) to ask the incriminating question is more prejudicial than to permit it to be put on a voir dire in the course of a trial by jury. I do not, however, find it seemly to rest my difference with the LaPlante case on this distinction alone.\nA number of vital principles of criminal law administration are brought under scrutiny in respect of the matter at hand. It is, of course, clear that the prevailing rule in Canada that permits illegally obtained evidence to be adduced at a trial if relevant to the issues does not apply to what I may call involuntary admissions of guilt made to persons in authority. The reason for this has to do with the values that we believe are worth protecting beyond the mere desirability of whether the holding of a trial within a trial is designed to control improper inducements or threats or other misbehaviour by the police in any efforts they may make to secure an incriminating statement from an accused or whether the voir dire is merely intended to assure the presiding Judge that the statement is reliable. I realize that I am drawing a line that may be very thin, since reliability or trustworthiness is closely related to the conduct of the interrogating police officers. Authorities can be cited to show that both the considerations mentioned lie back of holding of a trial within a trial for a preliminary consideration of admissibility. Although the basis of the exclusion of confessions improperly extracted from an accused has not hitherto been regarded, at least in our cases, as based on the privilege against self\u2011crimination, there is the respected opinion of Dixon J. as he then was, of the High Court of Australia in McDermott v. The King (1948) 76 C.L.R. 501, at p. 513 that the rules respecting confessions and the privilege against self-crimination are related.\nIf an accused must expose himself on a voir dire to an incriminating inquiry when he finds it necessary to give evidence to resist the reception of an inculpatory statement, the relation with the privilege against self-crimination is more pronounced and the privilege is prejudiced, especially on a trial by a Judge alone. Indeed, on such a trial, the distinction between a voir dire and the trial proper becomes blurred if the accused, who is not then testifying in defence, may be compelled on the voir dire to answer an incriminating question. However, there is prejudice to the principle that an accused is not a compellable witness. Strictly speaking, the Hammond case does not preclude a trial Judge from excluding a confession as involuntary even where the accused has admitted its truth. But this possibility seems to me to be weak protection against what I consider substantial unfairness. I gave fleeting consideration to possible resort to section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1952, c. 307 in connection with the voir dire but I do not see how it can be said that the voir dire and the trial on the merits are separate proceedings. Apart from this, I would not think that an accused\u2019s admission on the voir dire that his statement was true could be put before the jury even if the statement itself was admitted. Even if he gives evidence before the Jury, the trial Judge ought not to allow cross-examination on his admission on the voir dire nor should he permit that admission to be adduced through a Crown witness. This is predicated on the correctness of the Hammond case so far as it goes. I doubt that even it can be carried so far as to support the right of a Crown witness to give evidence that the accused admitted the truth of his inculpatory statement on the voir dire. Apart from the foregoing, the law of evidence has developed policies of exclusion based on confusion of issues and undue prejudice. The first is more appropriately referable, on the matter under discussion, to trial by Judge alone, but the second has a general application for present purposes. The trial within a trial has a limited object\u2014to enable the trial Judge to decide whether an inculpatory statement made to persons in authority is admissible by examining the circumstances surrounding its making. To use such an occasion to obtain verification from the accused of the truth of his statement is to depart from the purpose for which the voir dire is held, and is to prejudice the accused unfairly on the very question of admissibility. Putting the matter another way, the question whether a confession is true, even if relevant to the issue of its voluntariness (and, hence, admissibility), involves resort to a line of inquiry that goes to much beyond the issue for which it is invoked at to make it improper either to initiate it or pursue it.\nSince Rex v. Hammond[14] is the starting point for all subsequent discussion on the point, it is desirable to see what was really dealt with in Hammond. The facts as stated in the report at pp. 84-5 are as follows:\nIn opening the case counsel for the prosecution stated that the appellant had made a statement amounting to a confession of the crime to the police and that he proposed to relate the circumstances in which the statement had been made. Defending counsel said that he intended to object to the admissibility of the statement, and the Judge then heard evidence as to its admissibility in the absence of the jury. After the evidence of the police the appellant went into the witness-box and said that the confession had been extorted from him by violence and ill-treatment on the part of the police. Counsel for the Crown then cross-examined the appellant as follows: \u201cQ.\u2014Your case is that this statement was not made voluntarily? A.\u2014Yes. Q.\u2014Is it true? A.\u2014Yes.\u201d Counsel put further questions in order to ensure that the appellant understood what he was saying. After hearing all the evidence on the preliminary issue, Cassels, J., ruled that the statement was voluntary and admissible, and it was subsequently put in evidence at the trial before the jury. The statement described in great detail how the appellant had committed the crime and included a number of matters which were proved to be unknown to the police.\nIt is of great importance to note that Hammond\u2019s confession was not received in evidence by the trial judge, Cassels J., as a result of Hammond\u2019s admission that it was a true confession but the confession was admitted by Cassels J. as a voluntary one apart altogether from Hammond\u2019s admission that what it contained was true. This is made very clear by Humphreys J. in the appeal judgment at p. 88 where he said:\nThe facts of this case go even further, for it is clear from the statement made by Cassels, J., the presiding Judge, that he did not decide on the admissibility of this confession as the result of the admission of the appellant that it was a true confession. He himself had some doubt whether or not the question as to its truth was a desirable question to put, and he said: \u201cI had almost said that it was unnecessary to put the statement in detail. I have listened to everything the prisoner had to say in his evidence-in-chief. I hold that this statement is a voluntary statement, and admissible in evidence.\u201d\nWe cannot entertain the smallest doubt that the appellant was rightly convicted upon evidence which was properly before the jury. Further, we are satisfied that the evidence of his confession of the crime was rightly admitted by the Judge, who was in no way misled by anything which took place. The appeal is dismissed.\nThe ratio decidendi is clearly in those last two paragraphs. They show that what was said as to the question respecting the truth of the confession being relevant to credibility on the voir dire is an obiter dictum which deserves respect but nothing more.\nConcerning the refusal in this Court of leave to appeal from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the LaPlante case, no reasons were given and, therefore, nothing shows that this was not done on the view that, it being a jury trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred because, apart from the question respecting the truth of the confession, there was sufficient evidence to justify the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that it was voluntary.\nThe question \u2018was the learned trial judge right or wrong in putting the question which he did to the appellant and in requiring him to answer?\u2019 now comes to this Court for the first time. A discussion of the nature of the voir dire in respect of alleged confessions is, therefore, indicated.\nThe most quoted and generally recognized authoritative statement relating to the admissibility of confessions by an accused is that of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[15], where at pp. 609-10, he said:\nIt has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale. The burden of proof in the matter has been decided by high authority in recent times in Reg. v. Thompson ((1893) 2 Q.B. 12)... This statement was accepted and applied by this Court in Boudreau v. The King[16]. Kerwin J. (as he then was) said at p. 267:\nAgain with great respect, I think it advisable that it should now be stated clearly what this Court considers the law to be. My view is that it has not been changed from that set out in Ibrahim v. Rex (1914) A.C. 599 and Rex v. Prosko 63 S.C.R. 226.\nand Rand J. at pp. 269-70 said:\nThe case of Ibrahim v. Rex (1914) A.C. 599, Rex v. Voisin (1918) 1 K.B. 531 and Rex v. Prosko 63 S.C.R. 226 lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the case. The underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily made?\n(Emphasis added)\nIn The Queen v. Fitton[17], Rand J. referred to Boudreau and said at p. 962:\nThe rule on the admission of confessions, which, following the English authorities, was restated in Boudreau v. The King (1949) S.C.R. 262, 94 C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R. 427, (1949) 3 D.L.R. 81, at times presents difficulty of application because its terms tend to conceal underlying considerations material to a determination. The bases of torture, actual or threatened, or of unabashed promises are clear; perplexity arises when much more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of mind and will of the accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of questions or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part they have played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether what was said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the influence of hope or fear aroused by them.\nIt will be seen that in none of these statements is the question of the actual truth of the alleged confession put as one of the factors to be considered. Rand J. stated the proposition in language that permits of no doubt when he said: \u201cThe underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily made?\u201d There are numerous decisions to the effect that a confession, even if the truth, will not be admitted if it was obtained by threats or promises or by duress of any kind. See Regina v. McLean and McKinley[18]; R. v. Sim[19]; Regina v. Starr[20] and art. 833 on pp. 267\u201168 in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed.\nAnother rule of universal acceptance is that the admissibility of the statement or confession is a question for the judge alone who must decide after a voir dire whether or not it is admissible. Once admitted, the statement goes to the jury who alone may decide whether the statement was in fact made, whether it was true and who may give it such weight as they think fit. The circumstances of the taking of the statement must be given in evidence again before the jury even though fully gone into on the voir dire. One of the most apt statements of the law in this regard is that of O\u2019Halloran J.A. in Rex v. Mandzuk[21], where he said:\nOnce these distinctive functions of the Judge and jury (which apply equally in principle where as in this case the Judge sits alone and thereby assumes the additional function of the jury) are appreciated, it becomes apparent that, in determining the admissibility of a statement which may be a confession, it is not the function of the Judge to consider its likely effect upon the minds of the jury. He is confined to determining whether the statement in itself is a confession in whole or in part and if so whether it is voluntary. He is not concerned with its truth or its untruth as such or the good or bad effect it may ultimately have upon the minds of the jury. He is of course concerned with the truth of testimony as to whether the statement was or was not made and as to what statement was made. But once the confession is admitted in evidence, then it is to be weighed and judged in the same way as any other testimony which may affect the minds of the jury advantageously or adversely to the accused.\n(Emphasis added)\nThis being the law, it is elementary that the function of the judge on a voir dire is to determine:\n(1) Whether the evidence establishes that the statement being tendered was in fact made by the accused. If he is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to this, he must not admit the statement;\n(2) Whether the statement was voluntary within the rule in Ibrahim v. The King and Boudreau v. The King.\nThe problem is whether the truth of the statement is relevant to this inquiry. It is obvious that it is not directly relevant because fundamentally it is relevant only to the main issue, namely the guilt or innocence of the accused. However, it is contended that it is indirectly relevant as bearing on the credibility of the accused testifying on the voir dire. But is it not rather a petitio principii, trying to find out from the accused whether he is guilty in order to decide whether to admit his confession as evidence of his guilt?\nWhenever the statement or confession amounts to an admission by the accused that he has committed the offence of which he is charged, the truth of the incriminating statement is but theoretically distinguishable from his guilt. If the statement is totally incriminating, asking the accused testifying on the voir dire: \u201cIs the statement true?\u201d is tantamount to asking him: \u201cAre you guilty of the offence?\u201d But that is precisely what an accused may not be asked unless he chooses to testify at the trial. In Batary v. Attorney-General for Saskatchewan[22], Cartwright J. (as he then was) said, speaking for the majority of the Court:\nIt would be a strange inconsistency if the law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary inquiry should permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the prosecution be permitted to take the accused before a coroner and submit him against his will to examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt. In the absence of clear words in an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority I am unable to agree that that is the state of the law.\nWould it not be a stranger inconsistency if the law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to testify at his trial should permit that, if an incriminating statement has been improperly obtained from him, he would not be permitted to give evidence of such impropriety without being submitted against his will to cross-examination as to his guilt.\nIt is true that an accused cannot be compelled by the Crown to testify on the voir dire and does so only of his own will. However, the very purpose of holding a separate inquiry into the admissibility of a confession is that this issue may be dealt with only on evidence relevant thereto. It is an essential feature of this system that the accused is thereby permitted to testify on that issue without prejudice to his right not to testify on the main issue. As Cartwright J. said in the Batary case (at p. 478):\nthe maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare...has been described (by Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott, 1856, Dears & B. 47 at 61, 169 E.R. 909) as \u201ca maxim of our law as settled, as important and as wise as almost any other in it\u201d.\nIf an accused cannot testify on the voir dire without being liable to be asked questions bearing directly on his guilt or innocence, he is put in a situation where he cannot do so without in effect being deprived from the benefit of the rule against compulsory self-incrimination. At least this is so when the trial is by a judge alone. Before a jury, the problem is not so serious. Those who have to pass upon the guilt or innocence of the accused are to remain in complete ignorance of the evidence on the voir dire. But when the accused is tried by a judge alone once this judge has acquired knowledge of the guilt of the accused by a question that he has himself put to him, how can he properly weigh the evidence and give the benefit of the doubt if need be? When the question is being put on the voir dire, it cannot be presumed that the confession will be found to have been voluntarily made. The inquiry into the truthfulness then being made as bearing on credibility, it is uncertain whether the confession will be admitted, even if truthful. If it is rejected, how can the accused not be seriously prejudiced by an admission of guilt obtained from him while testifying?\nIt must also be considered that if it is held to be permissible to question an accused testifying on the voir dire as to the truthfulness of the statement of confession sought to be introduced in evidence, even when the accused is tried by a judge alone, an essential safeguard against improper pressure by police authorities is being seriously compromised. If the confession was not voluntarily made, the accused will know that he cannot go into the witness box to disprove the evidence brought against him on that issue without, in fact, renouncing the right to refrain from testifying on the main issue and thus prevent the Court from questioning him on his guilt or innocence. Under our law this right is so sacred that any comment by the prosecutor or the judge on the failure to testify is strictly prohibited. In the Supreme Court of Ontario by Rule 317 of the Rules of Practice it is provided that:\n...no statement of the fact that money has been paid into court under the preceding rules shall be inserted in the pleadings, and no communication of that fact shall at the trial of any action be made to the judge or jury until all questions of liability and amount of debt or damages have been decided\u2026\nIs it not much more serious for a judge trying a criminal case to acquire knowledge of the guilt of the accused otherwise than through evidence properly admitted at the trial? It goes without saying that evidence on the voir dire is not evidence at the trial.\nThis Court having jurisdiction in such cases only on questions of law in the strict sense, a last point remains to be considered, namely whether questioning the accused as was done is an error in law. In Demenoff v. The Queen[23], the question before this Court was the admissibility, as a voluntary statement, of the confession of guilt made by the appellant. It was held that the issue being the inferences to be drawn from the evidence relevant to the voluntariness of the confession, the question was not one of law in the strict sense. Reference was made to The Queen v. Fitton, supra, where this principle had been admitted but it had been held that the rejection or admissibility of the statement did raise a question of law. Here the question raised is whether it was proper for the trial judge to question the accused respecting the truthfulness of the statement that was sought to be introduced in evidence. This does not depend on any question of fact like the voluntariness or otherwise of the statement. It is a pure question of law.\nReference has been made to the following passages of the judgment of Lord Du Parcq in Noor Mohamed v. The King[24]:\nIt is right to add, however, that in all such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.\nIt must be pointed out that in that case the Privy Council was considering the propriety of allowing in a murder case evidence of another murder. This had been permitted by the trial judge as evidence of a \u201csimilar pattern\u201d. The Privy Council quashed the conviction. Immediately after the passage quoted above, which is clearly obiter, Lord Du Parcq went on to say:\nTheir Lordships have considered with care the question whether the evidence now in question can be said to be relevant to any issue in the case.\nHe finally concluded by saying (at p. 193):\nAfter fully considering all the facts which, if accepted, it revealed, their Lordships are not satisfied that its admission can be justified on any of the grounds which have been suggested or on any other ground.\nWhen that decision was considered by this Court in Lizotte v. The King[25], the following passages were quoted in addition to the passage first above referred to, namely at p. 190:\nIn Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales (1894, A.C. 57, 65), Lord Herschell L.C., delivering the judgment of the Board, laid down two principles which must be observed in a case of this character. Of these the first was that \u201cit is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried\u201d. In 1934 this principle was said by Lord Sankey L.C., with the concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords who sat with him, to be \u201cone of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our criminal law\u201d and to be \u201cfundamental in the law of evidence as conceived in this country\u201d. (Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, 1935, A.C. 309, 317, 320).\nAnd at pp. 195-196:\nTheir Lordships think that a passage from the judgment of Kennedy J. in the well-known case of Rex v. Bond (1906, 2 K.B. 389, 398) may well be quoted in this connexion:\n\u201cIf, as is plain, we have to recognize the existence of certain circumstances in which justice cannot be attained at the trial without a disclosure of prior offences, the utmost vigilance at least should be maintained in restricting the number of such cases, and in seeing that the general rule of the criminal law of England, which (to the credit, in my opinion, of English justice) excludes evidence of prior offences, is not broken or frittered away by the creation of novel and anomalous exceptions.\u201d\nTheir Lordships respectfully approve this statement, which seems to them to be completely in accord with the later statement of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell\u2019s case (1935, A.C. 309, 320), when he said \u201cIt is of the utmost importance for a fair trial that the evidence should be prima facie limited to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment and that any departure from these matters should be strictly confined.\u201d They would regret the adoption of any doctrine which made the general rule subordinate to its exceptions.\nOn the basis of those principles this Court held in the Lizotte case that evidence disclosing the commission of another murder had been improperly admitted in the course of the cross\u2011examination of a witness and the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered.\nI would quash the conviction here and order a new trial.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014Upon this appeal, I agree with my brother Hall. Despite reference in various cases to the possible impropriety of the exclusion of statements of the accused which are true, it has most certainly been settled by the decisions both in this Court and in England that the task of the trial judge in considering the admissibility of a statement made by the accused to a person in authority is to determine not whether that statement is true but whether it is voluntary. I need not cite authorities for that proposition, the Chief Justice has already done so in his reasons.\nThe only justification, in my opinion, for either counsel for the Crown or the trial judge questioning the accused when giving evidence on the voir dire as to truth or falsity of his statement, which it is sought to introduce, is the relevance of his answer as to the truth of the statement upon the question of his credibility. Careful consideration of the matter convinces me that under the particular circumstances of the voir dire the answer of the accused to that question is not relevant and has no probative value in determining the voluntary or involuntary character of the statement. It must be remembered that the statement of the accused to a person in authority is introduced during the evidence advanced by the prosecution and very often quite early in the course of the trial. At that time, of course, no evidence has been given as to guilt or innocence by the accused or anyone on his behalf, and indeed in the usual course the only evidence given up to that time is evidence by such witnesses as the complainant and police officers. If the accused were to answer the question when put by either Crown counsel or the trial judge in the negative, then there would be no basis upon which the trial judge could come to the conclusion that his answer was false and that therefore his credibility in his testimony to the effect that the statement was not voluntary might be untrue until the trial had been completed. That conclusion could be made only on the basis of the whole evidence. Therefore, I cannot see how a negative answer by the accused to the question as to the truth of the statement would in any way damage his credibility and assist the trial judge in coming to the conclusion as to whether the accused\u2019s evidence denying the voluntary nature of the statement was false.\nIf, on the other hand, the accused answered the question as to the truth of the statement in the affirmative, it would not in any way damage or cast doubt on his other evidence that the statement was not voluntary. It might well be part of the accused\u2019s case that despite the fact that he did commit the offence with which he has been charged he cannot be convicted thereof as the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and surely it is plain that the Crown cannot proceed to do so by the production of a statement made to a person in authority which was not voluntary.\nUnder the circumstances, the affirmative answer in this situation makes the prejudice two\u2011fold; firstly, as I have said, it is not relevant to the issue of whether the statement was voluntary or not voluntary and, secondly, and particularly when, as in the present case, the trial was by judge alone without a jury, the accused suffers all the disabilities pointed out by my brother Hall in his reasons. I am, therefore, of the opinion that despite the decision in Rex v. Hammond[26] and in Regina v. LaPlante[27], the question should be ruled to be inadmissible whether put by Crown counsel or even in the careful fashion put by the learned trial judge in the present case.\nIt would appear from the wording of the learned trial judge\u2019s ruling as cited by the Chief Justice in his reasons that the learned trial judge realized his task and determined that the statement was a voluntary one. I am, however, of the opinion that that ruling is not sufficient justification for this Court to act under the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, It would be speculation for this Court to say that despite the question put by the learned trial judge to the accused, which I am of the opinion for the above reasons was improper, and the accused\u2019s answer thereto, the learned trial judge would have ruled the statement voluntary. The accused\u2019s answer to that question may well have been the telling factor in causing the learned trial judge to determine that the statement was a voluntary one. Moreover, had the statement been excluded then counsel for the accused might well have proceeded in a very different fashion in his defence, and might well have chosen not to call the accused in defence.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that this Court cannot say that the putting of the question by the learned trial judge to the accused upon the voir dire caused no substantive miscarriage of justice. I, therefore, agree with my brother Hall that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.\nPIGEON J. (dissenting):\u2014In this appeal I agree with what my brothers Hall and Spence have said and wish to add the following observations.\nI cannot hold that questions to an accused concerning the truth of a statement allegedly made by him, although irrelevant to the inquiry on the voir dire, may be permitted as having a bearing on his credibility. These questions really go to the main issue: the guilt or innocence. On the voir dire, the answers to such questions cannot be tested against full evidence, and they cannot be of any real help in reaching a decision on the only issue: the admissibility of the statement.\nIn my view, the result of permitting on a voir dire questions pertaining to the truth or falsity of the statement must inevitably be to weaken the rule against the admission of involuntary statements and, in fact, to admit in evidence statements which otherwise would have to be rejected as not voluntarily made. This would be unfortunate because it would tend to undermine a very necessary safeguard against improper treatment of suspects.\nThere is no reason for the judge sitting on a voir dire to put or permit any question respecting the truth of the statement unless he is in some doubt as to whether it was voluntarily made or not. Seeing that he must at that time take the answer of the accused as given, the consequence of such a question must be that any doubt concerning the voluntary character of the statement is resolved in favour of the prosecution if the accused says it is a true statement. The end result of such a course of action is to admit in evidence, because the accused says it is true, an incriminating statement that would otherwise probably be rejected.\nWhere this can lead is strikingly illustrated by what occurred in the Australian case of Reg v. Monks as related in the Australian Law Journal (1960, vol. 34, p. 111). The accused testifying on the voir dire said that a confession had been extorted from him by brutal treatment on the part of the police. This confession was the only evidence of any consequence against him. When cross-examined he admitted that it was true in fact and also that he had committed all the offences with which he was charged. Thereupon the trial judge, the Chief Justice himself, ruled the confession admissible, saying that it would be a \u201cpublic scandal\u201d if, after a full confession upon oath in open court, the accused should thereafter be acquitted. Who will say that this man should properly have been disbelieved when saying that the confession had been extorted because he ought to be believed when confessing his crimes? Yet this is what must be the reasoning on the issue of credibility if one is going to contend that the principle of not allowing involuntary confessions in evidence remains unimpaired.\nIn the present case, much is made of the fact that the trial judge did not look at the statement before he asked the accused whether it was true. It is said that this shows that the accused would not have been prejudiced if the judge had decided to reject the statement. In my view, the fallacy of this reasoning is that under those circumstances the statement was inevitably going to be received in evidence if the accused admitted it to be true. Although the contents had not been disclosed to the judge, it was obvious from what had been said that the statement was inculpatory. When, in order to resolve his doubt concerning its voluntary character, the judge asked the accused whether it was true, the admission obtained by this questioning necessarily resulted in the statement being admitted. To say that the statement was admitted because the trial judge came to the conclusion that it had been voluntarily made is not strictly accurate in the circumstances of this case. In fact, the judge came to this conclusion partly because the accused admitted that it was true.\nBecause the rule against compulsory self-incrimination is the root of the objection, I cannot agree that this is a matter of judicial discretion respecting the extent of cross-examination on credibility. In considering the cogency of the reasoning in the Hammond case we should bear in mind that, in the United Kingdom, judges are allowed to comment on the omission of the accused to testify. In this perspective it is much less obnoxious to permit incriminating questions on the voir dire, than under a system where such comments are strictly prohibited. One only has to read the Bigaouette case[28] to appreciate the importance of this difference in the applicable legal principles.\nAppeal dismissed, HALL, SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.A.

Dias, [1968] S.C.R. 931\nDate: 1968-06-26\nRoger Adams and The Corporation of the Township of Toronto (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nManuel Dias (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1968: June 13, 26.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Driver entering divided highway from side road\u2014Stalling while crossing westbound lanes\u2014Turning east into eastbound lane after second stall at middle of intersection\u2014Westbound car crossing median strip and crashing head-on into plaintiff\u2019s car\u2014Whether contributory negligence on part of plaintiff\u2014Damages.\nThe motor vehicle accident out of which the present action arose occurred at about 11 o\u2019clock on a rainy night at the intersection of a divided four-lane highway running east and west and a side road running north and south. The plaintiff was travelling south on the side road and after having brought his vehicle to a full stop at the intersection, he made a considerable entry into the intersection at a time when it was free of traffic. However, his engine stalled and his car was temporarily stationary while straddling the two westbound lanes of the highway. The plaintiff restarted the car but it stalled again when it had reached about the middle or centre of the intersection. The plaintiff again restarted his vehicle and was turning it in a south-easterly direction into the southern section of the highway when he was struck head-on by a police car which was being operated by the defendant. This car had been proceeding westerly on the highway, at a rate well in excess of the 50 m.p.h. speed limit, and had veered over from its own right-hand side of the highway, across the median strip so as to be travelling in a south-westerly direction on its wrong side of the road. The plaintiff sustained permanent and crippling injuries as a result of the collision.\nThe trial judge allocated the fault for the accident 60 per cent to the defendant driver and 40 per cent to the plaintiff driver and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s general damages at $85,000. The Court of Appeal affirmed the apportionment of liability but increased the assessment of general damages to $150,000. The defendant and his employer, the defendant municipality, then appealed to this Court and the plaintiff cross-appealed.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The plaintiff was not guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident. While a driver is in no way relieved from the liability which flows from a failure to take reasonable care simply because another user of the highway is driving in such a fashion as to violate the law, no motorist is required to anticipate, and therefore keep on the look-out for, such an unusual and unexpected violation as was manifested by the defendant\u2019s course of conduct in the present case. As to the amount of damages, the Court of Appeal did not err in principle in awarding the amount which it did and as that amount did not appear to be inordinately high having regard to the injuries sustained, there was no reason for interfering with the increased award.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The concurrent findings by the Courts below on liability should be affirmed. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct was a contributing factor to the accident. Until almost the moment of impact the plaintiff never saw the police car and the only reason for the stalling was improper operation.\n[London Passenger Transport Board v. Upson, [1949] A.C. 155, referred to.]\nAPPEAL by defendants and CROSS-APPEAL by plaintiff from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the division of fault but increasing the assessment of damages made at trial in an action for damages for personal injuries. Appeal dismissed and cross\u2011appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting in part.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and H.A. Willis, for the defendants, appellants.\nR.E. Holland, Q.C., B.B. Shapiro, Q.C., and G.C. Elgie, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of a head-on collision which occurred in the Township of Toronto at about 11 o\u2019clock on a rainy night in April 1964, at the intersection of highway No. 5 and a side road called Mavis Road. The respondent, operating his own motor vehicle had entered the intersection and having crossed the northern section of the highway had just completed a left-hand turn into the southern half thereof, when a police car owned by the appellant municipal corporation and operated by the defendant Adams in the course of his employment as a police officer, crossed from its own proper side of the highway directly into the respondent\u2019s path. The respondent sustained permanent and crippling injuries as a result of this collision.\nThe learned trial judge allocated the fault for this accident 60 per cent to the appellant and 40 per cent to the respondent and assessed the respondent\u2019s general damages at $85,000, but the Court of Appeal for Ontario, while affirming the division of fault made at the trial, allowed the respondent\u2019s cross-appeal as to damages and thereby increased the award from $85,000 to $150,000. The appellants now appeal to this Court alleging that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in holding that there was any negligence on the part of the appellant Adams which contributed to the accident and from the Court of Appeal\u2019s assessment of the general damages while the respondent cross appeals alleging that there was no real evidence upon which a Court could find that he was negligent.\nHighway No. 5 is a \u201cthrough highway\u201d within the meaning of The Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, s. 1(26), and it runs east and west having two eastbound and two westbound lanes, the most northerly of which is 11 feet 6 inches in width, the other three being 12 feet wide. The two sets of lanes are separated by a median or ripple strip some 4 feet in width which has a maximum height of some 3 inches above the surrounding pavement and tapering to 1\/4 inch at its outer edges. Mavis Road which is a paved side road 21 feet 1 inch in width, runs north and south and there is a stop sign situate on the west side of the road about 55 feet north of the north edge of the most northerly lane of No. 5 highway.\nAt the time and place in question, the respondent was travelling south on Mavis Road and having stopped at the stop sign, made a substantial entry into the intersection at a time when it was free of traffic, and when the trial judge has found that there was no traffic within such a distance as to constitute an immediate hazard, at this point his engine stalled and his car was temporarily stationary while straddling the two west bound lanes of highway No. 5, the respondent restarted the car but it stalled again when it had reached a point which the learned trial judge describes as \u201cabout the middle or the center of the intersection straddling what would have been the ripple strip if it had been in the spot where the vehicle came to rest at that time; a little more of the vehicle itself south of the center line than to the north\u201d. Dias again restarted his vehicle and was turning it in a south-easterly direction into the southern section of highway No. 5 when he was struck head-on by the police car which had been proceeding westerly on highway No. 5 and had veered over from its own right-hand side of the highway, across the ripple strip so as to be travelling in a south-westerly direction on its wrong side of the road. The above account of the movements of the respondent\u2019s vehicle is a paraphrase of the finding of the learned trial judge, but in considering the findings concerning the appellant\u2019s activities, I think it desirable to quote verbatim from the findings at trial. Having found that \u201cthe police car was some very considerable distance east of the intersection when the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle entered it\u201d he went on to say:\nThere was no traffic in the intersection, of course, when the plaintiff driver entered the intersection with his vehicle. And again I repeat there was no traffic within such a distance or proceeding under such circumstances existing as to constitute an immediate hazard to the plaintiff in the operation of his car, or such as to constitute the plaintiff a hazard to approaching traffic. Although the driver of the police car says he approached the intersection at a speed of some 50 miles an hour, and that he reached a certain point where he applied his brakes, I find he is undoubtedly mistaken in that. The evidence that I accept leads me to believe he was travelling at a speed much in excess of that. I think that is apparent not only from the physical damage to the vehicles and the position of the vehicles as ascertained when they came to rest after the collision but, also, from the evidence of a witness who states that at the crest or about the crest of the hill this vehicle passed him at a speed of some 70 to 75 miles an hour. This was a 50\u2011mile speed zone at the area in question.\nThe trial judge\u2019s account of the part played by the appellant\u2019s vehicle in the actual collision itself is phrased in the following language:\nThe collision occurred in the south-east quadrant of the intersection. The defendant driver had crossed the ripple strip and was proceeding in a south-westerly direction at the time that he collided or his vehicle collided with the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. The collision was almost head-on. The photographic evidence indicates substantially where the first impact was upon the vehicles. They were some distance apart when they came to rest. Strange to say, the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was some distance to the west of the point of impact. Again, it will be remembered that it was travelling easterly or substantially easterly at the time the impact occurred. Again, this leads me to the conclusion that the other vehicle was travelling at a high rate of speed. The plaintiff was not travelling fast; he was travelling slowly. He has said himself below ten miles an hour. I am inclined to look with some skepticism upon his relation of the events that occurred, by reason of the fact he did suffer some post-traumatic amnesia. However, he is substantially corroborated in the details of the accident which he gives by his passenger Korth.\nThere is no question whatever in my mind that the defendant driver is negligent, or was negligent, and that his negligence contributed to or was a substantial cause of this accident in question and the resulting damage. I find that he was negligent in that he failed to keep a proper look-out; that he failed to yield to the plaintiff the right of way to which he was entitled under s. 64 of The Highway Traffic Act, after having made prior entry into the intersection; and that he failed to keep his vehicle under such control as would have enabled him to avoid an accident or collision when it was reasonably possible for him so to avoid it. Had he been alert and watching what was occurring ahead of him, and had he been travelling at such a speed that he was able to react properly and adequately to the situation, I think he could have brought and should have brought his vehicle to a stop before he even entered the intersection. While it is true, I think, that the movement of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle within the intersection caused some confusion, particularly on the night in question in the light of the inclement weather, the defendant driver was familiar with this intersection, he could see it if he had been keeping a proper look-out, the movements of the vehicle, and he could have slowed down. He said he did slow down by applying his brakes at a certain time\u2014in one instance he says ten car lengths from the other vehicle, and at another point five or six car lengths from the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. He estimates a car length to be 20 feet. At that time he was headed on a south-westerly course. Just where he veered from his normal lane of traffic, in which he had been proceeding prior to reaching the intersection, or prior to the time when he was close to the intersection, it is difficult to say, but he did veer to the left or to his left, to the south-west and across the median or ripple strip. And I have no hesitation in finding he is right when he says he applied his brakes, although there was no indication upon the pavement that he had done so that was visible or apparent following the accident.\nIt is thus clearly established from the facts as found by the learned trial judge that the appellant\u2019s vehicle was being driven at a rate well in excess of the 50 m.p.h. speed limit directly across the median strip between the two double lanes of highway No. 5 onto a portion of the highway where he had no right to be and that he there ran head-on into the defendant\u2019s vehicle.\nIn dividing the fault so as to find the respondent 40 per cent to blame for the accident, the learned trial judge found the respondent to be negligent in the operation of his vehicle in the following manner:\nWhen it stalled the second time, and before he proceeded forward, I think that he should have been sufficiently alert to have been aware of the presence of and the course of the other vehicle upon the highway. His evidence is that at no time did he see the other vehicle approaching until it was at a point a very short distance from him, and just before or at the time that he started forward after he had stalled the second time. In other words, according to his version, only one half to one second in time before the collision occurred. It is quite apparent to me that at that point of time the other vehicle was on its south-westerly course. Undoubtedly, the driver had taken some steps to avoid the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle as best he could under the circumstances, but I think much too late. Had the plaintiff been keeping a proper look-out, I think that there is a good probability that he could have avoided this collision, at least rendered it much less severe. And I think it was quite imprudent, and would have been quite imprudent of him to have proceeded forward after this second stalling with the oncoming vehicle in the position in which it was proceeding at the time that he stalled the second time. I find that he was negligent in that he failed to keep a proper look-out, and that he proceeded in the face of danger without insuring that he could safely proceed further on his way. Such negligence, again, I find was a contributing cause to the accident in question and the resulting damage.\nWith the greatest respect for the learned trial judge, I am of opinion that this latter finding of negligence placed a much higher duty of care on the respondent than that which is required of a reasonably prudent motorist.\nIt is true that a driver is in no way relieved from the liability which flows from a failure to take reasonable care simply because another user of the highway is driving in such a fashion as to violate the law, but in my opinion, no motorist is required to anticipate, and therefore keep on the look-out for, such an unusual and unexpected violation as was manifested by the appellant\u2019s course of conduct in the present case.\nIt is to be noted that the negligence found against the respondent by the learned trial judge consisted of failure to keep a proper look-out when he proceeded forward after the second time he had stalled. At this time more than half of his vehicle was to the south of the centre line of the highway thus leaving the two northerly lanes, which together measured 23\u00bd feet, almost completely free for the appellant. As Dias moved from the position of his second stall wholly into the southern half of the intersection, it was his duty to look ahead and to the west to determine whether any other vehicles were approaching from these directions at such a distance as to constitute a hazard, but he was in my view under no duty to keep a look-out for cars travelling west on the other side of the ripple strip which divided the highway.\nThe learned trial judge found that the respondent should have been sufficiently alert to detect the fact that the appellant\u2019s car was on a south-westerly course at the time when he was moving away from his second stall, but I do not think that even if he had observed the police car\u2019s lights veering towards the south, he could have been expected to foresee that it would continue on this course so as to cross the ripple strip and invade the area which was reserved for eastbound traffic. Upon seeing the lights of the approaching vehicle turning towards the south, the normal reaction of a reasonable motorist would, I think, have been to conclude that it was moving further over into the southerly lane of the northern section of the highway rather than that it was bent upon crossing the centre line so as to travel entirely onto its wrong side of the road. The fatal error on Constable Adams\u2019 part was not that he adopted a south\u2011westerly course, but that he continued on that course across the ripple strip and taking into consideration the speed at which he was travelling, the elapsed time from the moment when his front wheels encountered the ripple strip until the collision occurred cannot have been much more than one second.\nIn my view the respondent\u2019s actions after the appellant had crossed the ripple strip were conditioned by the imminent danger in which he was placed through the appellant\u2019s negligence, and with all respect to the learned trial judge, I do not think that he had any opportunity to take avoiding action after the appellant had started to cross the ripple strip. As I have indicated, even if the respondent\u2019s vehicle had remained where it was after the second stall, there would have been ample room for Adams to pass it on his own side of the highway and it seems to me that the most probable explanation of the accident is that he became confused, misjudged the position of the respondent\u2019s car and thought it necessary to move over to the wrong side of the road. Like all such decisions made by drivers travelling at a high rate of speed, it must have been made in a matter of seconds and the result proved that it was clearly wrong.\nThis case in my opinion is to be viewed in light of the well-known observation made by Lord Uthwatt in London Passenger Transport Board v. Upson[1], at p. 173 where he said:\nA driver is not, of course, bound to anticipate folly in all its forms, but he is not, in my opinion, entitled to put out of consideration the teachings of experience as to the form those follies commonly take.\nThe actions of Adams in my view constituted the type of folly which a driver is not bound to anticipate and no amount of experience on the highway would lead the reasonably careful motorist to consider it in any way likely that a police car with its red light flashing which appeared to be approaching the centre line of the highway, was going to continue on its way across the ripple strip directly into his path. I am fully conscious of the fact that the findings of fact of the learned trial judge have been affirmed by the Court of Appeal and I in no way dissent from those findings, but it has often been said that when it comes to deciding the proper inferences to be drawn from accepted facts, the Courts below are in no better position to decide the issue than the judges of an appellate Court and I am of the opinion that the facts found by both the Courts below do not support the conclusion that the respondent was guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to this accident. I would accordingly allow the cross\u2011appeal.\nThe respondent suffered a severe closed head injury with damage to the brain stem area which has resulted in permanent and crippling disability and the evidence indicates that he will require constant and continual nursing care and service and medical supervision for the rest of his life, so that there can be no question about his right to recover substantial damages. In awarding the respondent $150,000 general damages, the Court of Appeal treated the $85,000 award made by the learned trial judge as being a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage and as I cannot find that the Court of Appeal erred in principle in awarding the amount which it did and as that amount does not appear to me to be inordinately high having regard to the injuries sustained, I can find no reason for interfering with the increased award. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nThe statement of claim was amended at the trial so as to include a claim for \u201cgeneral damages in the amount of $250,000 on behalf of the Ontario Hospital Services Commission for future hospitalization\u201d. (The italicizing is my own.)\nThe Ontario Hospital Services Commission is not a party to these proceedings but it is assumed that the claim was included pursuant to s. 52(2) of the Regulations [O. Reg. 1\/67] passed pursuant to The Hospital Services Commission Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 176, which read as follows:\n52(2) The Commission is subrogated to any right of an insured person to recover all or part of the cost of insured services from any other person, including future insured services, and the Commission may bring action in the name of the insured person to enforce such rights.\nWhen this claim was drawn to the attention of the learned trial judge he said:\nIf it were indicated to me that this man were required to remain in a hospital over which the Ontario Hospital Services Commission had juris- diction, then I think I would be inclined to ensure there was some definite sum allocated for that purpose, but I am not at all sure, in the light of the evidence, whether that is going to be so.\nThis matter was raised before us, but there is, in my opinion, no evidence upon which this Court would be justified in making any estimate of the future hospitalization, if any, which will be undergone by the respondent in an institution approved by the Commission, and I therefore do not think that we are in a position to deal with this claim.\nThe respondent will have the costs of the appeal in this Court and his costs of the cross\u2011appeal both here and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting in part):\u2014I would not interfere with the trial judge\u2019s apportionment of 40 per cent of the responsibility for this accident to the plaintiff. This apportionment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and in my opinion there was ample evidence for the common conclusion of both Courts on this point.\nThe plaintiff entered this intersection from a stop street to the north and stalled in this position when Adams in the westbound police car had to make a decision to avoid him by veering either to the north shoulder or the eastbound lanes to the south. Adams chose to veer to the south. The plaintiff stalled his car again in the median strip and then began to make a left turn into the eastbound lanes. The cars collided in the south-east quadrant. Until almost the moment of impact the plaintiff never saw the police car. According to the plaintiff\u2019s own witness, who was a motor mechanic and who had examined the car immediately before its recent purchase by the plaintiff, the only reason for the stalling was improper operation.\nI would affirm the concurrent findings on liability and accept the increase in the damages awarded in the Court of Appeal. Consequently, I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal, both with costs.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Willis, Clarke, Dingwall & Newell, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Elgie & Philp, Toronto.\n[1] [1949] A.C. 155.\n"

Their operations were affected by certain general orders of the Air Transport Board, purporting to regulate commercial air traffic. On January 17, 1968, the Air Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission ordered by General Order 1968-A-5 that these orders of the Air Transport Board be made orders of the Air Transport Committee. The appellants were granted leave, under s. 53 of the Railway Act, to appeal to this Court where two questions were in issue: whether the Air Transport Board had power to make the orders in question and whether, if the Board had no such power, the general order enacted by the Air Transport Committee was effective to make these orders valid.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the orders in question declared invalid.\nThe general orders of the Air Transport Board, made, as they were, without the approval of the Governor in Council, were invalid. R. v. North Coast Air Services Ltd. (1968), 65 D.L.R. (2d) 334, applied.\nThe wording of s. 5 of the National Transportation Act, 1966-67 (Can.), c. 69, was not broad enough to grant to the Canadian Transport Commission power to regulate in matters under the Aeronautics Act, which were not given to it by that Act, or to exercise regulatory powers given to it in that Act without the approval of the Governor in Council which was still specifically required by the Act.\nOrdonnances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales\u2014A\u00e9ronautique\u2014Pouvoir de la Commission des transports a\u00e9riens d\u2019\u00e9tablir des ordonnances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales\u2014Pouvoir du comit\u00e9 des transports a\u00e9riens de rendre valide les ordonnances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de la Commission des transports a\u00e9riens qui autrement seraient invalides\u2014Loi sur l\u2019a\u00e9ronautique, S.R.C. 1952, c. 2, art. 8, 13, 15\u2014Loi nationale sur les transports, 1966-67 (Can.), c. 69, art. 5\u2014Loi sur les chemins de fer, S.R.C. 1952, c. 234.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from general orders of the Air Transport Board. Appeal allowed.\nA.A.W. MacDonell and B.A. Crane, for the appellants.\nA.M. Garneau, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal, with leave, pursuant to s. 53 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, from General Orders No. 5\/51, 7\/52, 21\/58, 46\/67 and 49\/67, all of which were orders of the Air Transport Board. In brief, these orders dealt with three subject-matters:\n1. (a) prohibiting a commercial air carrier from carrying traffic between points named on the same licence of any Class 1 or Class 8 scheduled commercial air carriers or between points named on the same licence of any Class 2 or Class 9-2 non-scheduled commercial air carriers.\n(b) Prohibiting carriers in Group A from carrying traffic out of the base of another Group A carrier, prohibiting carriers in Group B from carrying traffic out of the base of another Group B or Group C carrier, and prohibiting carriers in Group C from carrying traffic out of the base of another Group C or Group B carrier.\n2. Prohibiting Class 4 charter air carriers from chartering aircraft to persons who obtain payment for the transportation of traffic at a toll per unit.\n3. Prohibiting the acquisition or the announcement of an intention to acquire by a Canadian air carrier licensed to operate Class 1, 2, 4, 8, 9-2 or 9-4 commercial air services of aircraft having two or more engines with a maximum take-off weight on wheels in excess of 18,000 pounds without first obtaining written approval from the Board.\nThe appellants are licensed commercial air carriers for non-scheduled flights, whose operations were affected by these orders.\nSubsequent to the making of these orders, the National Transportation Act, 1966-67 (Can.), c. 69, came into effect. Thereafter, on January 17, 1968, the Air Transport Committee enacted General Order No. 1968-A-5, which provided as follows:\nWHEREAS the power of the former Air Transport Board to issue orders of general application has been questioned;\nAND WHEREAS under the provisions of section 5 of the National Transportation Act certain provisions of the Railway Act including section 34 thereof are made to apply mutatis mutandis to the Canadian Transport Commission;\nAND WHEREAS section 34 of the Railway Act authorizes the making of orders or regulations which may be made to apply to all cases or to any particular case or class of cases;\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:\nTHAT under the authority of the Aeronautics Act, section 5 of the National Transportation Act and section 34 of the Railway Act:\n(1) the General Orders of the Air Transport Board referred to in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto are made orders of the Air Transport Committee; and (2) unless otherwise specifically provided compliance with the provisions of the said orders where applicable is hereby made a condition of every licence to operate commercial air services.\nIncluded in the orders listed in Schedule A were the orders to which I have previously referred.\nTwo questions arise on this appeal. The first is as to whether the Air Transport Board had power to make the orders in question in this appeal. The second, which only arises if the Board is held not to have had such powers, is whether the General Order of the Air Transport Committee was effective to make the orders valid.\nThe first question involves a consideration of the power of the Air Transport Board to make general orders under the provisions of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 2. Under that Act, certain powers were conferred upon the Minister of Transport, others upon the Board.\nThus, under s. 3(f) it was the duty of the Minister to prescribe aerial routes. Under s. 4, the Minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, was empowered to make regulations, including, under para, (h) of subs. (1), regulations with respect to aerial routes, their use and control.\nThe powers of the Board were, defined in Part II of the Act. Section 8, in subss. (1) and (2), provided as follows:\n8. (1) The Board has full jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine any matter\n(a) where it appears to the Board that any person has failed to do any act, matter or thing required to be done by this Act or by any regulation, licence, permit, order or direction made thereunder by the Board, or that any person has done or is doing any act, matter or thing contrary to or in violation of this Part, or any such regulation, licence, permit, order or direction, or\n(b) where it appears to the Board that the circumstances may require the Board, in the public interest, to make any order or give any direction, leave, sanction or approval that by law it is authorized to make or give, or with respect to any matter, act, or thing that by this Part or any such regulation, licence, permit, order or direction is prohibited, sanctioned or required to be done.\n(2) The Board may order and require any person to do, forthwith, or within or at any specified time and in any manner prescribed by the Board so far as it is not inconsistent with this Act, any act, matter or thing that such person is or may be required to do under this Part, or any regulation, licence, permit, order or direction made thereunder by the Board and may forbid the doing or continuing of any act, matter or thing that is contrary to this Part or any such regulation, licence, permit, order or direction and, for the purposes of this section, has full jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters, whether of law or fact.\nAs to subs. (1), I agree with the views expressed by Tysoe J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, in R. v. North Coast Air Services Ltd.[1]. The Court was dealing with an appeal by the present appellant from a conviction for disobeying an order of the Air Transport Board (No. 5\/51). At p. 338 he said:\nI am unable to accede to this argument. In my view, s-s. (1) of s. 8 does not empower the Board to make an \u201corder\u201d but merely to \u201cinquire into, hear and determine any matter\u201d where it appears to the Board that any of the circumstances set out in para. (a) or (b) of the subsection have arisen. Subsection (1)(b), on which counsel particularly relied, does no more than authorize an inquiry into and a hearing and determination of any matter in cases where a question has arisen whether the Board should, in the public interest, make any order or give any direction, leave, sanction or approval that by law it is authorized to make or give, etc.\nSubsection (2) deals only with the making of mandatory orders to compel the enforcement of duties or obligations imposed upon a person by Part II of the Act, or under any regulation, licence, permit, order or direction made by the Board under Part II.\nSection 13 deals with the power of the Board to make regulations, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council. The only portions of this section which might be relevant are paras. (i) and (o), which define the subject-matter of regulations as follows:\n(i) respecting traffic, tolls and tariffs, and providing for the disallowance or suspension of any tariff or toll by the Board, the substitution of a tariff or toll satisfactory to the Board or the prescription by the Board of other tariffs or tolls in lieu of the tariffs or tolls so disallowed;\n(o) providing for the effective carrying out of the provisions of this Part.\nIt is doubtful whether the Board\u2019s orders in issue fell within either of these paragraphs, but, in any event, the approval of the Governor General was not obtained in respect of any of these orders.\nSection 15 of the Act deals with the issuance of licences, and subs. (6) of that section provides:\n(6) In issuing any licence, the Board may prescribe the routes that may be followed or the areas to be served and may attach to the licence such conditions as the Board may consider necessary or desirable in the public interest, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may impose conditions respecting schedules, places of call, carriage of passengers and freight, insurance, and, subject to the Post Office Act, the carriage of mail.\nWith respect to this provision I agree with what was said by Tysoe J.A., in the North Coast Air Services Ltd. case, at p. 337:\nSection 15 appears to me to have no relation to licensees as a group or class but to individual applicants for licences and licences issued to specific individuals. The General Order cannot be supported under that section.\nI am in agreement with the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal in that case regarding the power of the Board to enact the order which was in question, and the reasoning, in my opinion, applies equally to the other orders involved in this appeal.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the general orders in question, made, as they were, without the approval of the Governor in Council, were invalid.\nIs the situation altered by General Order 1968-A-5 of the Air Transport Committee?\nThe submission of the respondent is that s. 5 of the National Transportation Act, which made certain provisions of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, applicable to the newly created Canadian Transport Commission, has the effect, by reason of the operation of s. 34 of the Railway Act, of authorizing the Air Transport Committee (created by s. 17 of the National Transportation Act) to make regulations or orders generally for carrying the Aeronautics Act into effect, without the sanction of the Governor in Council.\nSection 5 of the National Transportation Act provides as follows:\n5. (1) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Act, the provisions of the Railway Act relating to sittings of the Commission and the disposal of business, witnesses and evidence, practice and procedure, orders and decisions of the Commission and review thereof and appeals therefrom apply in the case of every inquiry, complaint, application or other proceeding under this Act, the Aeronautics Act or the Transport Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or function on the Commission; and the Commission shall exercise and enjoys the same jurisdiction and authority in matters under any such Acts as are vested in the Commission under the Railway Act. (2) For greater certainty and the avoidance of doubt, but without limiting the generality of subsection (1), it is declared that the following provisions of the Railway Act, namely sections 12, 13, 18 to 21, 30, 32 to 41 and 43 to 72 apply mutatis mutandis in respect of any proceedings before the Commission pursuant to this Act, the Aeronautics Act or the Transport Act, and in the event of any conflict between those provisions of the Railway Act and the provisions of the Aeronautics Act or the Transport Act those provisions of the Railway Act prevail.\nSection 34 of the Railway Act is as follows:\n34. (1) The Board may make orders or regulations\n(a) with respect to any matter, act or thing that by this or the Special Act is sanctioned, required to be done, or prohibited;\n(b) generally for carrying this Act into effect; and\n(c) for exercising any jurisdiction conferred on the Board by any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n(2) Any such orders or regulations may be made to apply to all cases or to any particular case or class of cases, or to any particular district, or to any railway or other work, or section or portion thereof; and the Board may exempt any railway or other work, or section or portion thereof, from the operation of any such order or regulation for such time or during such period as the Board deems expedient; and such orders or regulations may be for such time as the Board deems fit, and may be rescinded, amended, changed, altered or varied as the Board thinks proper.\n(3) The Board may by regulation or order provide penalties, when not already provided in this Act, to which every company or person who offends against any regulation or order made by the Board shall be liable.\n(4) The imposition of any such penalty does not lessen or affect any other liability that any company or person may have incurred.\nI do not construe these provisions as having this broad effect. The National Transportation Act, while it repealed certain portions of the Aeronautics Act, left most of it intact. The power to make regulations, conferred by s. 13 upon the Air Transport Board (and now upon the Canadian Transport Commission), remains the same, and can be exercised only subject to the approval of the Governor in Council. It is difficult to see what purpose is served by retaining that section if, as the respondent contends, the Commission has a general power to regulate without such approval.\nIn my opinion s. 5 of the National Transportation Act does not have the effect which is claimed. Subsection (1) makes applicable those sections of the Railway Act relating to sittings of the Commission, disposal of business, witnesses and evidence, practice and procedure, orders and decisions of the Commission and review and appeals therefrom \u201cin the case of every inquiry, complaint, application or other proceeding\u201d. It is in this context that the subsection then goes on to say that the Commission shall exercise and enjoy the same jurisdiction and authority in matters under any such Acts as are vested in the Commission under the Railway Act.\nSubsection (2) makes reference to specific sections of the Railway Act which are to apply, mutatis mutandis, in respect of proceedings before the Commission.\nSection 5 is therefore concerned with proceedings before the Commission under the National Transportation Act, the Aeronautics Act, the Transport Act and other statutes governing its duties and function. It is with respect to proceedings of the Board and matters coming before it that it is given the same jurisdiction and authority as the Board of Transport Commissioners enjoyed under the Railway Act.\nMy view as to the meaning of s. 5 is strengthened by the wording of the French text. In the English text, in subs. (1) the word \u201cprocedure\u201d is used in one place, and the word \u201cproceeding\u201d in another, both words occurring in the same sentence, but in the French text the word \u201cprocedure\u201d is used in both places. In subs. (2) where the English text refers to \u201cproceedings\u201d, the word \u201cproc\u00e9dures\u201d is used in the French text. This emphasizes the fact that s. 5 is concerned with procedural matters.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the wording of the section is not broad enough to grant to the Commission power to regulate, in matters under the Aeronautics Act, which are not given to it by that Act, or to exercise regulatory powers given to it in that Act without the approval of the Governor in Council which is still specifically required by the Act.\nIn my opinion, therefore, this appeal should be allowed, and the respective orders of the Air Transport Board, 5\/51, 7\/52, 21\/58, 46\/67 and 49\/67, declared invalid.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacDonell, Shaw, Graham & Errico, Prince Rupert.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n[1] (1968), 65 D.L.R. (2d) 334, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 214.\n"

The claim in question is for processes which, among others, include several particular chemical reactions, anyone of which might be a step in a process for the synthesis of a substance which has become known by the generic name tripelennamine. That substance is one of a group of drugs which have been found to be useful in blocking the effects of histamines in the body and which have become known as anti-histamines. The Exchequer Court held that claim 18 was invalid and dismissed the action for infringement. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. It was conceded that claim 18 covers some substances which have no therapeutic value. It was also conceded that if claim 18 was valid the defendants had infringed.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nClaim 18 was invalid. It was too broad in its terms in respect of utility. The claim was also bad for want of subject-matter since the claim covered substances which were not useful.

Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une revendication de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qui, entre autres, comportent plusieurs r\u00e9actions chimiques sp\u00e9cifiques, dont l\u2019une quelconque peut \u00eatre un \u00e9chelon dans le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour obtenir la synth\u00e8se d\u2019une substance connue sous le nom g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de tripelennamine.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an action for infringement. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and R.S. Smart, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nI. Goldsmith, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an action for alleged infringement by the respondents of claim 18 of Canadian Patent no. 474637 granted to the appellant Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Usines Chimiques Rhone\u2011Poulenc on June 19, 1951, for an invention entitled \u201cSubstituted Diamines\u201d. Claim 18 is, in substance, for processes which, among others, include several particular chemical reactions, any one of which might be a step in a process for the synthesis of a substance which has become known by the generic name tripelennamine.\nThe first named appellant sues as owner of the patent and the appellant Ciba as exclusive licensee under it. Their claim is that claim 18 of the patent has been infringed by the respondent, Gilbert Surgical Supply Co. Ltd. and by the other respondents. It is conceded that if claim 18 of the patent is valid the respondents have infringed.\nThe issues were narrowed in the Exchequer Court1 by an agreement as to facts providing that for the purposes of the action the parties agreed:\n1. That the process claimed in claim 18 of Canadian patent No. 474,637 consists in the application of methods which were known on June 22, 1943, to substances which were also known on the said date, though the said methods had never at the said date been applied to the said substances except by the inventor named in the said patent.\n2. That the substance referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the re-amended Statement of Defence was not manufactured in Canada and was imported from outside Canada.\n3. That none of the defendants has any knowledge as to the process by which the said substance was prepared or produced.\nTripelennamine is one of a group of drugs which have been found to be useful in blocking the effects of histamine in the body and which have become known as anti-histamines.\nThe specification in Canadian Patent No. 474637 is, in part, as follows:\nTO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\nBE IT KNOWN THAT I, RAYMOND JACQUES HORCLOIS, of 31 Rue du Chalet, Malakoff (Seine), France, a citizen of France, having made an invention entitled: \u201cIMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO SUBSTITUTED DIAMINES\u201d, the following is a full, clear and exact disclosure of the nature of the same invention and of the best mode of realizing the advantages thereof:\u2014\nThe present invention relates to new chemical compounds and to processes of producing the same. More particularly, this invention is concerned with new substituted diamines.\nIt is the main object of the present invention to provide new tertiary diamines having exceptionally powerful anti-histaminic action. It is a further object of this invention to provide processes for the production of these new diamines.\nThe new therapeutically active ditertiary diamines of the present invention conform to the general formula:\u2014\nwhere \u201cHet\u201d represents a monocyclic, heterocyclic nucleus, for example, pyridine, piperidine, furane, tetrahydrofurane, thiazole and pyrimidine, R represents a radical selected from the class consisting of aralkyl, aryl and monocyclic heterocyclic groups and aryl substituted in the nucleus by a member of the class consisting of alkyl and alkoxy groups, and R1 is a lower alkylene group having at least two carbon atoms. Substances in this class possess an exceptionally powerful antihistaminic action.\nand includes details set out in the reasons of Thurlow J. not necessary to repeat here. Thirteen examples are given in the specification but only those numbered I, IX and XIII represent separate methods of preparing tripelennamine, example XIII being the method involved in claim 18. The disclosure portion of the specification concludes:\nIt will be understood that, without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the claims, various modifications may be made in the specific expedients described. The latter are illustrative only and not offered in a restricting sense, it being desired that only such limitations shall be placed thereon as may be required by the state of the prior art.\nClaim 18, the claim in question in this action, reads:\n18. A process as defined in claim 8 in which R is phenyl.\nReference to claim 8 brings in successive references to claim 7 and claim 3 the result of which, on the references being incorporated, is that claim 18 reads:\nA process for the preparation of new therapeutically valuable tertiary diamines being compounds of the general formula\nwhere Het is pyridine, R is phenyl and R1 is\u2014CH2CH2\u2014and their salts, by reacting a secondary tertiary diamine of the formula\nwith a compound of the formula\npyridine-X\nwhere X is a halogen atom.\nThe validity of claim 18 was challenged on a number of grounds, all of which were dealt with by Thurlow J. in his comprehensive reasons now under review. In my view only one of these grounds needs to be considered. If this ground is valid, as I think it is, that concludes the matter adversely to the appellants. This ground has two aspects which are interrelated, the first aspect being that claim 18 is too broad in its terms in respect of utility and for the reasons given in Hoechst Pharmaceuticals of Canada Limited and Farbwerke Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft Vormals Meister Lucius & Bruning v. Gilbert & Company, Gilbert Surgical Supply Co. Limited, Jules R. Gilbert Limited[2] is invalid. In Hoechst Thurlow J. is quoted with approval at p. 193 as follows:\nAs a matter of interpretation however it is in my opinion clear that the claim refers to every mathematically conceivable sulphonyl urea of the class for I can see no basis upon which anyone who might contrive to make a substance of the class, however inconceivable the preparation of such a substance may have been at the time of the drafting of the claim, could successfully maintain that his substance was not within the class. But even if the claim were read as referring only to those members of the class which as a matter of chemistry or even of commercial manufacture could conceivably be made, I see no reason to doubt that it would refer to a class many thousands strong.\nIt is obvious and conceded by appellant that claim 18 of the patent in suit covers at least twelve different substances, namely the alpha, beta and gamma isomers and their four hydrohalide salts. On the other hand, it is equally clear that the beta and gamma isomers are not shown to be therapeutically valuable anti-histamines, the effective antihisme, tripelennamine, being the alpha isomer. It is also established that at least one of the hydrohalide salts cannot be safely used as oral medication, namely the hydrofluoride. This is sufficient to bring the case within the principle of the decision Re May & Baker Ltd. v. Boots Pure Drugs Co. Ltd.[3], which is referred to by Thurlow J. and was applied by this Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba[4]. This principle is stated as follows in that case by Martland J. at p. 381:\nAlthough the two named thiazoles were of considerable therapeutic value, there was no evidence that this was true of any other derivatives covered by the claims, and accordingly the patent was bad for want of subject-matter, since the claims covered substances which were not useful.\nAs this is sufficient to dispose of the case, I prefer to express no opinion as to the consequence of having claimed, in addition to the substances obtained by the process described in claim 18, the salts of those substances. Similarly, I prefer to express no opinion as to whether the rare radioactive halogen element atastatine is to be considered as included in claim 18 in addition to the four usual halogens. I also prefer to express no opinion as to whether the claim should be read as implying that the alpha isomer may be prepared by the process described otherwise than by using alpha material in the reaction. The appeal should, accordingly, be dismissed with costs. The request of the respondents that their costs should include the costs of preparing and printing the appeal case for appeal No. 10393 between these same parties is refused.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Duncan, Goldsmith & Caswell, Toronto.\n[1] (1967), 35 Fox Pat.

The Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court upheld the assessment, but the two tribunals did not agree as to the basis on which the $700 should be considered as income. The applicant filed an appeal to this Court although the amount in controversy, the tax on $700, was less than $500. The Minister did not object. Subsequently, the applicant gave notice than an application for leave to appeal would be made when the appeal came on for hearing. The application for leave was argued in Chambers before the hearing of the appeal and was opposed by the Minister.\nHeld: Leave to appeal should be granted.\nIn view of the importance of the question of law involved, it was desirable that it should be reviewed by this Court.\nAlthough this Court sometimes under special circumstances gives leave to appeal at the time an appeal is heard, it is very inconvenient and highly undesirable that applications for leave should be made at such a late date. Also, when a case is inscribed without jurisdiction, it is the duty of the respondent to move to quash if the appellant does not move for special leave.

Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe following judgment was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The appellant is a solicitor who, over a period of years, acquired some 13 mortgages, usually at a substantial discount. He was assessed for income tax in 1962 on $700 being the amount of a discount on one of these mortgages that he collected at maturity in that year.\nBefore the Tax Appeal Board, the assessment was upheld on the finding, not that it was profit from a \u201cbusiness\u201d, but that \u201cit was a quasi-bonus\u201d and therefore \u201cinterest per se\u201d In the Exchequer Court, Gibson J. did not wish to pass on the soundness of that conclusion and did not choose (those are his words) to make a finding that this was profit from a \u201cbusiness\u201d. He expressly founded his decision in favour of the Minister on the basis that this \u201cwas income from a source within the meaning of the opening words of section 3 of the Income Tax Act\u201d, adding:\nas far as I know, there is no decision of this Court or of the Supreme Court of Canada in which a question of this kind has been resolved by deciding that such a discount was income from a \u201csource\u201d within the meaning of the opining words of s. 3 of the Act, without deciding whether it was income from any of the particular sources detailed in s. 3 or elsewhere in the Act.\nFrom this judgment, appellant filed an inscription in appeal to this Court as of right without apparently realizing that, due to the rate of tax applicable, the actual amount in controversy was less than $500. Respondent also appears to have overlooked the point and did not move to quash but, on the contrary, signed an agreement as to contents of case and did not object to the appeal being inscribed for hearing at the last term. Being No. 17 on the Ontario list, the case was not called before the vacation. In June, however, appellant became aware of the doubtful jurisdiction and, on June 13, gave to respondent a notice of motion supported by affidavit which was filed the following day. This notice was \u201cthat an application will be made to this Honourable Court or to a Judge of this Honourable Court on the day when this appeal comes on for hearing for leave to appeal to this Honourable Court, if such leave should be necessary,\u2026\u201d\nThe parties have now appeared before me and argued the application before the case will be called. Counsel for the respondent agrees that the amount in controversy is under $500 and is a \u201csum of money payable to Her Majesty\u201d within the meaning of para. (b) of s. 83 of the Exchequer Cour Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, but otherwise he opposes the application.\nIn view of the importance of the question of law involved in the decision sought to be appealed from, I consider it desirable that it should be reviewed by this Court and accordingly grant leave to appeal.\nIn doing so, I must point out that, although this Court sometimes under special circumstances gives leave to appeal at the time an appeal is heard, it is very inconvenient and highly undesirable that applications for leave should be made at such a late date. Especially is this so when, as in this case, the jurisdiction for granting leave is conferred not on the Court but on a judge. The orderly disposition of the business of the Court requires that applications for leave be brought promptly. Also, when a case is inscribed without jurisdiction, it is respondent\u2019s duty to move to quash if applicant does not move for special leave.\nUnder the circumstances, there will be no costs of the application to either party.\nApplication granted.\nSolicitors for the petitioner: MacKenzie, Wood & Goodchild, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n[1] [1967] 1 Ex. C.R. 199, [1967] C.T.C. 66, 67 D.T.C. 5045.\n"

The unanimous decision of this Court in Durocher v.

The grievance went through the procedure in the collective agreement then in force and on September 30, 1966, the company replied to the third stage of the grievance. On October 18, 1966, the company received notice from the union of its desire to arbitrate the grievance. The company objected that the notice was too late. This objection was submitted to the arbitration board. The decision of the board was that the union had failed to deliver its notice respecting arbitration within the specified ten-day period as required by the collective agreement, and that the company had not waived the failure to notify in time and had preserved its right to object to arbitration.\nThe majority of the arbitrators then purported to relieve against the default and held that they had power to proceed to hear the merits. An application by the company to quash the majority decision was dismissed and, on appeal, the decision of the judge of first instance was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. With leave, the company then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe majority decision was erroneous for the following reasons: (a) The grievance was not timely and the board of arbitration had no power to extend the time. (b) The board of arbitration had no power to go beyond the question submitted in the parties\u2019 joint statement. (c) The board of arbitration was in breach of an article of the collective agreement in extending the time and so modifying the terms of the agreement.\nJudicial review of this decision was not precluded by s. 34(1) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, nor did s. 86, the purpose of which is to require the Courts on motions by way of certiorari or otherwise when they are considering proceedings under the Act not to quash such proceedings because of defect of form or technical irregularity, afford any foundation for the decision of the board.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Jessup J. Appeal allowed.\nGeorge D. Finlayson, Q.C., and D.F.O. Hersey, for the appellant.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., Martin L. Levinson and J. Sack, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is whether a board of arbitration had power under a particular collective agreement to deal with a grievance notwithstanding the admitted fact that it was late in time.\nOn August 22, 1966, an employee of Union Carbide Canada Limited filed a grievance through his union representative. The grievance went through the procedure in the collective agreement then in force and on September 30, 1966, the company replied to the third stage of the grievance. On October 18, 1966, the company received notice from the union of its desire to arbitrate the grievance. The company objected that the notice was too late. This objection was submitted to the arbitration board. The decision of the board was that the union had failed to deliver its notice respecting arbitration within the specified ten-day period as required by the collective agreement, and that the company had not waived the failure to notify in time and had preserved its right to object to arbitration.\nThe majority of the arbitrators then purported to relieve against the default and held that they had power to proceed to hear the merits.\nThe company then applied to a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario to quash the majority decision. This order was refused. The decision of the judge of first instance was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nThe parties prepared a joint statement, the final paragraph of which sets out the question for determination by the board. This question was:\nIs the grievance timely? and\nShould the Board decide in the affirmative then to determine if Article 9, Section 2-4, of the Collective Agreement was violated as alleged by the Grievor?\nThe grievance procedure that we are concerned with in this appeal is set out in the following sections from the collective agreement:\n(a) Article X, Grievance Procedure, Section 6:\nGrievances shall be presented for adjustment in accordance with the following procedure:\n...\nStep 4. If the grievance is not settled by the foregoing steps, it may be submitted to arbitration, provided the Company is notified in writing not more than ten (10) days from the date of the Company\u2019s third step reply. Such written notification shall contain the name of the Union\u2019s Arbitrator and the Company shall name its arbitrator within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notification. The matter shall then be processed to Arbitration as outlined in Section 2 of Article XI.\n(b) Article XI, Arbitration, Section 4:\nA joint statement, or separate statements, by the Company and the Union covering the grievance or dispute and outlining the matter to be settled by the Arbitration Board shall be submitted to all members of the Board within three (3) days after their appointment.\n(c) In arriving at a decision, the Arbitration Board shall be limited to the consideration of the dispute or question outlined in this statement, or statements, referred to in Section 3 and shall not in any way amend, modify or change any of the provisions of this Agreement, or change any decision of the Management unless the Board finds that the Company has violated the express terms of this Agreement.\nMy opinion is that the majority decision was erroneous for the following reasons:\n(a) The grievance was not timely and the board of arbitration had no power to extend the time.\n(b) The board of arbitration had no power to go beyond the question submitted in the joint statement.\n(c) The board of arbitration was in breach of Article XI, s. 4, above quoted, in extending the time and so modifying the terms of the collective agreement.\nThe joint statement makes it clear that the decision on the merits is only to be made if there is a preliminary finding that the grievance was timely. Once the board found that the grievance was out of time, this should have been the end of the matter. By assuming to relieve against the time limit and imposing a penalty as a condition for the exercise of this power, the board amended, modified or changed the provisions of the collective agrement in spite of the express provision contained in Article XI, s. 4.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] held that the appeal failed on the following ground:\nThis Court is of the opinion that the appeal fails on the following ground which can be put shortly. It is apparent from the two questions submitted to arbitration that the arbitration board was called upon under the first of those questions to determine whether the substantive issue raised by the grievance was arbitrable. This was a matter which, having regard to section 34(1) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, the board was entitled to decide. The submission to the the board was wholly in this respect on a question of law and the board\u2019s decision thereon is not reviewable.\nSection 34(1) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, reads:\n34(1) Every collective agreement shall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration, without stoppage of work, of all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable. I cannot accept the opinion of the Court of Appeal that s. 34(1) of The Labour Relations Act precludes judicial review of this decision. There was no problem here relating to the \u201cinterpretation, application, administration, or alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable\u201d. The plain fact, so found by the board, was that the union is out of time with stage 4 of its grievance procedure. The subject-matter of the grievance (seniority rights of a particular employee) was plainly arbitrable. We come back to the only issue, namely, whether the board had power to extend the time.\nNor do I think that s. 86 of The Labour Relations Act affords any foundation for the decision of the board. Section 86 reads:\n86. No proceedings under this Act are invalid by reason of any defect of form or any technical irregularity and no such proceedings shall be quashed or set aside if no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.\nSection 86 is directed solely to the Courts. The whole purpose of the section is to require the Courts on motions by way of certiorari or otherwise when they are considering proceedings under the Act, for example, hearings before and decisions of the Labour Relations Board, not to quash such proceedings because of defect of form or technical irregularity. Section 86 does not enable a board of arbitration, as the majority thought in this case, to ignore the plain and emphatic language of the written contract. Galloway Lumber Co. Ltd. v. Labour Relations Board of British Columbia et al.[3] does not decide to the contrary. That case affirmed a board\u2019s action because there was evidence before the board that the grievance procedure had been complied with. In this case there is the only possible finding of the board that the union had not complied with the grievance procedure.\nI would allow the appeal and quash the decision of the board of arbitration. The order for costs in this Court will be in accordance with the condition of the order granting leave that Union Carbide pay the costs of the respondents Paul C. Weiler, Robert Nicol and Lester L. Porter in this Court. The company is entitled to the costs of the motion before Jessup J. and the appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario against the United Steelworkers of America.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Martin L.

Colonial Coach Lines Limited, [1969] S.C.R. 106\nDate: 1968-10-01\nIda Ruch and William Ruch (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nColonial Coach Lines Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1968: May 29, 30; 1968: October 1.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Standard of care\u2014Passenger reclining on rear seat of bus\u2014Injuries sustained when bus passed over bump\u2014Whether carrier negligent in failing to warn of danger in using rear seat in reclining position.\nThe female plaintiff suffered injuries while she was a passenger on an overnight trip in a bus owned by the defendant company. The plaintiff stated that at the time she was injured she was \u201creclining\u201d with her back propped against the side of the bus and her legs stretched out across the three rear seats when the vehicle went over a bump and she was bounced around, causing her to hit her hip and back on the window ledge. The jury found no negligence on the part of the driver, but found that the defendant was negligent in failing to warn the plaintiff of the hazard inherent in using the back seats of the bus in a reclining position. No such negligence had been pleaded but after the verdict the trial judge permitted an amendment to the statement of claim whereby such negligence was alleged. The judgment rendered at trial was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeal. An appeal from the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: In the circumstances of this case no duty lay upon the carrier to warn its passengers not to recline on the back seat of its bus. Nor was it in any other way in breach of its undertaking to take all due care of its passengers and to carry them safely as far as reasonable care and forethought could attain that end.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The amendment to the statement of claim was proper and the plaintiffs were entitled to recover on the basis of negligence found by the jury. The company\u2019s driver and its depot employees, realizing that passengers almost inevitably would doze or sleep as the bus proceeded during the night, should have warned the passengers that they might recline safely in the seats on either side of the aisle but that it was most dangerous to lie along the unprotected rear seat. Failure to do so was failure to meet the standard of care set by this Court in Day v. Toronto Transportation Commission, [1940] S.C.R. 433.\n[Kauffman v. Toronto Transit Commission, [1960] S.C.R. 251, applied; De Courcey v. London Street Railway, [1932] O.R. 226, distinguished.] APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from, and setting aside, a judgment of Costello Co.Ct.J. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nEdward J. Houston, Q.C., and Gordon P. Killeen, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nE. Peter Newcombe, Q.C., and John I. Tavel, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal from, and setting aside, the judgment rendered at trial by Costello Co.Ct.J., pursuant to the verdict of a jury whereby the female appellant was awarded $15,000 and the male appellant $6,093.85 in respect of damage suffered by Mrs. Ruch when she was a passenger in a bus owned by the respondent Colonial Coach Lines Limited.\nAt the time when she was injured, Mrs. Ruch has stated that she was \u201creclining\u201d with her back propped against the side of the bus and her legs stretched out across the three rear seats when the bus went over a bump and she was bounced around, causing her to hit her hip and back on the window ledge. By its verdict the jury found that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not caused by any negligence on the part of the bus driver, but gave the following particulars of the negligence which they found against the appellant:\nThe defendant Colonial Coach Limited was negligent in not warning Ida Ruch of the danger inherent in using the back seats of the bus in a reclining position. This warning could have been given by a suitable sign posted over the seats or by other means.\nNo such negligence had been pleaded by the appellants but after the verdict they were given leave to amend the statement of claim by adding para 5(a) in the following terms:\nIn the further alternative the plaintiffs say that the defendant Colonial Coach Limited was negligent in not warning its passengers of the danger inherent in using the back seats of the bus when in a reclining position. I am in complete agreement with the reasons for judgment rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal by Mr. Justice MacGillivray and I have very little to add to those reasons.\nIt does, however, seem to me to be desirable to adopt the clear statement regarding the duty of carriers to their passengers which is to be found in the reasons for judgment rendered by Kerwin C.J., on behalf of himself and Mr. Justice Judson in this Court in Kauffman v. Toronto Transit Commission[2], where he said:\nWhile the obligation upon carriers of persons is to use all due, proper and reasonable care and the care required is of a very high degree, Readhead v. Midland Railway Co. (1869), L.R. 4 Q.B. 379, such carriers are not insurers of the safety of the persons whom they carry. The law is correctly set forth in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 4, p. 174, para. 445, that they do not warrant the soundness or sufficiency of their vehicles, but their undertaking is to take all due care and to carry safely as far as reasonable care and forethought can attain that end.\nLike Mr. Justice MacGillivray, I do not feel that in the circumstances of this case any duty lay upon the carrier to warn its passengers not to recline on the back seat of its bus, or that it was in any other way in breach of its undertaking to take all due care of its passengers and to carry them safely as far as reasonable care and forethought could attain that end, but the appellant\u2019s counsel has laid great stress on one passage in the reasons for judgment of Fisher J.A. in De Courcey v. London Street Railway[3], where it was held that the carrier was liable to a passenger who fell forward from the front seat of a bus when it came to a sudden stop and it was found that there was a lack of care and foresight on the part of the carrier in not having a rail or guard in front of the unprotected front seat. The passage from Mr. Justice Fisher\u2019s decision upon which the appellant relies reads as follows:\nThe fact that the passenger was thrown from the seat on which she was invited to sit without negligence on her part is proof that the seat was not safe, and under the cases the onus was on the company to show it could not have been made safer than it in fact was.\nThis appears to me to be tantamount to saying that whenever a passenger is thrown from one of the seats of a public vehicle without negligence on his part, the rule embodied in the maxim res ipsa loquitur applies so as to place upon the carrier the burden of proving that the seat could not have been made safer than it in fact was, and if the learned judge intended to give expression to any such general proposition, then with all respect I feel it desirable that such a proposition should be rejected. It was proved through the respondent\u2019s general manager that the bus seats in the present case were up to date and of a type in general use in the industry and I do not think that the mere fact of a passenger being thrown from such a seat through collision or sudden stop necessarily affords proof that the seat itself was unsafe.\nThe facts of the De Courcey case were, in my opinion, clearly distinguishable from those with which we are here concerned because the unguarded front seat in the London Street Railway bus did obviously present a hazard to a passenger occupying it when the bus came to a sudden halt, but it should also be remembered that in the De Courcey case there was a finding that the driver was negligent whereas in the present case the jury has absolved the driver from any negligence whatever.\nAs I have indicated, I adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice MacGillivray in the Court of Appeal and would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4] pronounced on October 20, 1965, whereby that Court allowed the appeal of the defendants from the judgment of the County Court of the County of Carleton delivered on November 23, 1964, after a trial in that Court with a jury. By such judgment of the County Court, the plaintiff William Ruch recovered from the defendant the sum of $6,093.85 and the plaintiff Ida Ruch recovered from the defendant the sum of $15,000.\nThe plaintiff Ida Ruch had purchased from Allan\u2019s Travel Service in Ottawa a ticket for a return trip from Ottawa to New York City by bus and for a two-day stop over in the latter city. The plaintiff testified that she was assigned a seat in the bus, when it was departing from Ottawa for New York City, by an office employee of Allan\u2019s Travel Service. That seat was the one which was situated across the rear end of the bus and was capable of bearing three passengers. The seat was a straight seat with no arm rests and it ran from the one side wall of the bus to the wall of the powder room in the other corner of the bus. A small aisle which the plaintiff said was about two feet in width ran across the front of that seat and then the main aisle of the bus ran forward to the front with seats on each side of it, in rows, for two persons each. Those seats running up the bus had arm rests on the outside, that is, close to the wall of the bus, and also on the side next to the aisle, but no arm rests between the two passengers occupying the seats.\nThe bus left Ottawa at about 8:00 p.m. on Friday and, driving all night, arrived at New York City early the next morning. At the end of the holiday weekend on October 11, 1960, at about 8:00 p.m., the bus left the New York terminal for its return overnight trip to Ottawa. The plaintiff Ida Ruch, although she sat in another seat in the bus for the first half-hour or so after leaving New York, returned to her original seat at the back of the bus and sat in that seat until about 2:00 a.m. when, according to the evidence of the driver one Lewis Shane, the bus developed a defective tire and the driver was forced to make a stop of about one hour while the tire was changed. The bus then proceeded on its way. This occurred near Booneville in the State of New York.\nThe plaintiff, when she retired to the rear seat of the bus, stretched out along the length of the seat. It being for the accommodating of three persons was too short to permit her to lie at full length on the seat so she occupied a semi-reclining position with her back against the opposite wall of the bus and her legs and feet along the seat her feet being toward the powder room. According to her evidence at trial, she was dozing but more awake than asleep when the bus struck either some obstruction in the road or some pothole, and she was thrown in the air coming down with her back and side against the side wall of the bus, and thereby sustaining the injury which was the basis of her action.\nThe bus driver, giving evidence at trial in November 1964, had no memory whatsoever of the bus having struck any such object.\nIt was the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that no one and particularly not the driver Shane had given her any instructions or advice or suggestion as to how she should occupy the seat in the bus. Of course, this bus and for that matter no other bus had any seat belts and there was no protection whatsoever to prevent the passengers on the rear seat of the bus falling forward or in any other direction. The passengers who sat in the seats at either side of the main aisle, of course, were sitting only a very short distance behind the seat of the row in front and if tossed forward or upward by the motion of the bus had means of steadying themselves by grasping the upholstered seat in front of them or by grasping the arm rests, one being available to each such passenger. Neither of these protections was available to any passenger occupying this rear seat. In addition, of course, the rear seat being at the end of the bus body any motion of the bus upward due to unevenness of the road would have its maximum effect there. The seats on either side of the aisle were so arranged that the occupant of each seat could place the back of the seat in a sloping position and then the passenger occupying such seat would recline in an angle which was said to be even as much as 45 degrees, and yet be sitting in the seat facing forward, so that a tossing motion would leave such passenger able to protect himself in any of the fashions which I have outlined. The passenger stretched along the rear seat, that is, lying at right angles to the line of travel of the bus, with no protection by way of arm rests or the back of the seat in front of him, would be in the very hazardous position of having no opportunity to protect himself if the bus made a sudden stop or if the rear of the bus were tossed in the air as it went over any kind of a bump in the road. In travel on a highway, the necessity of making a rapid decrease in the speed of the vehicle may occur on many occasions. No highway is so perfect that there may not occur occasions when the vehicle receives a heavy bump when passing over the road such as will inevitably cause passengers to be tossed around. In either of those cases, the passengers in the seats to each side of the aisle have a considerable measure of protection available to them. The passenger stretched out on the rear seat, as was the plaintiff, has none.\nThis bus had been travelling all night from Ottawa to New York City and was returning to Ottawa from New York City by night. Such a course was not unusual. The driver, Lewis Shane, swore that he had taken the trip about ten times a year and that about half of those trips had been night trips. A fellow passenger, Mrs. Warren, giving evidence for the plaintiff swore that she had taken seven such previous trips to New York and that they were usually at night. One occupant after another of the bus gave evidence that the lights were dimmed and that nearly everyone in the bus appeared to be asleep. In short, it was the regular course of the defendant Colonial Coach Ltd. to encourage occupants of the bus during this all night trip to recline and to sleep. The seats along the aisle were designed to permit such reclining. The lights in the bus were dimmed for this reason and it was the usual thing for the passengers to board and then sleep or doze as the bus drove through the night between the two cities.\nThe learned trial judge submitted to the jury the following questions:\n1. Were the injuries to the Plaintiff caused by any negligence on the part of the Defendant Colonial Coach Lines Limited. Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.\nANSWER: Yes.\n2. If your answer to question one is \u201cyes\u201d, state fully in what such negligence consisted.\nANSWER: The Defendant, Colonial Coach Limited was negligent in not warning Ida Ruch of the hazard inherent in using the back seats of the bus in a reclining position. This warning could have been given by a suitable sign posted near the seats or by other means. 3. Were the injuries to the Plaintiff caused by any negligence on the part of the Defendant\u2019s driver, Lewis Shane? Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.\nANSWER: NO.\n4. If your answer to question three is \u201cyes\u201d state fully in what such negligence consists.\nANSWER:\nTherefore, the jury\u2019s answers were that there was negligence on the part of the defendant Colonial Coach Limited and the jury outlined that negligence in their answer to question 2 in the fashion I have set out. The jury, however, negatived any negligence on the part of the driver. The allegations of the plaintiff that the driver drove negligently and caused the vehicle to bump over some obstruction or pothole in the road having thus been negatived by the jury need not be further considered, and the sole question this Court has to determine is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover upon the jury\u2019s answers to questions 1 and 2 on its finding against the defendant Colonial Coach Limited.\nIn the Court of Appeal, McGillivray J.A., giving the reasons for judgment of the Court, accepted the grounds for appeal cited by the appellant as follows:\n4. The finding of negligence was not a proper one.\n5. The finding of negligence made was not supported by the evidence.\nAlthough McGillivray J.A. cited many English authorities, I think it may be said that he relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Kauffman v. Toronto Transit Commission[5], as later affirmed in this Court in [1960] S.C.R. 251. Although, of course, general principles as enunciated in the reasons for judgment in that case are applicable, the case must be understood as being one upon the facts there in issue. Those facts were very different from those which are present in this appeal. In the Kauffman case, the plaintiff had been a passenger on an escalator in one of the local subway stations in Toronto and immediately ahead of her was a man preceded by two boisterous youths. The latter engaged in some juvenile horseplay with the result that they fell against the man riding up the escalator behind them and then all three tumbled against the plaintiff with the result that the four fell to the bottom of the escalator. The issues considered in all Courts in the Kauffman case were the sufficiency of the handrail on the side of the escalator and the necessity or non\u2011necessity of having a guard posted at each escalator. I do not regard the circumstances in that case as having the slightest resemblance to those in the present appeal, and I am of the opinion that the question the Court must determine here is as to whether there should be liability upon the carrier if that carrier provides equipment for overnight travel, encourages sleeping and reclining during that overnight travel, and then fails to warn passengers of the danger of taking any such extremely hazardous position in the vehicle as was occupied by the plaintiff in the present case.\nI am of the opinion that the liability of the carrier is supported by some of the authorities to which McGillivray J.A. referred in his reasons. McGillivray J.A. quoted and adopted Morden J.A.\u2019s judgment in the Kauffman case, and that learned justice in turn relied on the words of Lord Dunedin in Morton v. Dixon[6], at p. 809, as follows:\nWhere the negligence of the employer consists of what I may call a fault of omission, I think it is absolutely necessary that the proof of the fault of omission should be one of two kinds, either\u2014to shew that the thing which he did not do was a thing which was commonly done by other persons in like circumstances, or\u2014to shew that it was a thing which was so obviously wanted that it would be folly in anyone to neglect to provide it.\nAnd then Morden J.A. continued at p. 203:\nAfter quoting these words, Lord Normand said in Paris v. Stepney, [1951] A.C. 367 at p. 382:\u2014\nThe rule is stated with all the Lord President\u2019s trenchant lucidity. It contains an emphatic warning against a facile finding that a precaution is necessary when there is no proof that it is one taken by other persons in like circumstances. But it does not detract from the test of the conduct and judgment of the reasonable and prudent man. If there is proof that a precaution is usually observed by other persons, a reasonable and prudent man will follow the usual practice in the like circumstances. Failing such proof the test is whether the precaution is one which the reasonable and prudent man would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it.\nIt is true that in the present case there was no proof that a precaution such as warning signs or some other means was used customarily in other examples of bus travel, but even in the absence of any such evidence surely the second test, as put by Lord Normand in Paris v. Stepney, quoted above, is whether the precaution is one which the reasonable and prudent man would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it as applicable. Surely the driver of this bus, and surely the employees in the bus depot in Ottawa before the first overnight trip had commenced, realizing that passengers almost inevitably would doze or sleep as the bus proceeded during the night, should have warned the passengers that they might recline safely in the seats on either side of the aisle but that it was most dangerous to lie along the unprotected rear seat. In my view, failure to do so was failure to meet the standard of care set by this Court in Day v. Toronto Transportation Commission[7], in the words of Hudson J. at p. 441:\nAlthough the carrier of passengers is not an insurer, yet if an accident occurs and the passenger is injured, there is a heavy burden on the defendant carrier to establish that he had used all due, proper and reasonable care and skill to avoid or prevent injury to the passenger.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nThat statement was adopted by this Court in Harris v. Toronto Transportation Commission[8], per Ritchie J. at p. 464.\nI am further of the opinion that the respondent Colonial Coach and its driver Shane could not rely on any employee of Allan\u2019s Travel Service to discharge the respondent\u2019s duty to warn its passengers of such a hazard.\nTherefore, subject to what I shall say herein as to the form of the pleadings, it would seem to me that the finding of negligence as against the defendant Colonial Coach Lim- ited is the proper finding of negligence, that is, a finding of a breach of its duty toward its passenger the plaintiff Ida Ruch and that is fully supported by the evidence.\nThe endorsement of the writ of summons issued by the plaintiff reads as follows:\nThe plaintiffs claim from the Defendant damages representing personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, Ida Ruch, and out-of-pocket expenses sustained by the Plaintiff, William Ruch. The Plaintiffs say that the said damages were the result of the failure of the Defendant to carry the Plaintiff, Ida Ruch, safely in one of its motor vehicles on a voyage between the City of New York, in the State of New York and the City of Ottawa, in the Province of Ontario. In the alternative, the Plaintiffs claim is for negligence on the part of the operator of the said motor bus, in the manner in which the said motor bus was being operated.\nThe plaintiffs in their statement of claim in paragraphs 4 and 5 said:\n4. The female Plaintiff says, as the fact is, that the injuries which she sustained which are more particularly hereinafter set forth, were caused by the negligence of the operator of the bus acting within the scope of his employment and whose negligence the Defendant is responsible in law in that:\n(a) He was operating the said bus at a high and improper rate of speed;\n(b) He was not keeping a proper lookout;\n(c) He failed to apply his brakes in a timely and proper manner or at all.\n5. In the alternative, the Plaintiffs say that the Defendant was guilty of a breach of its contract with the female Plaintiff for the safe carriage of her in the said bus.\nCounsel for the plaintiffs in his opening remarks to the jury said:\nWe expect to prove to your satisfaction that these injuries were sustained on this bus and arose from the negligence of the Defendant carrier and through the breach of this contract for safe carriage of Ida Ruch. We will lead evidence of fellow passengers on the Colonial Coach Lines bus to establish how that accident happened of which she sustained her injuries and we have to show by a balance of probabilities, or a preponderance of evidence, which His Honour will explain to you as a matter of law, we have to show to you that the Defendant company is fully responsible for those injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, Ida Ruch, and we hope to show you by way of the evidence of the female Plaintiff and her husband and some of the other witnesses I have indicated, she has suffered substantial damages and we will ask you to award substantial damages to her on the basis of the evidence led in this case.\nUpon the jury returning the verdict which I have outlined above, counsel for the plaintiffs moved for leave to amend the statement of claim by the addition of paragraph 5(a). After some considerable argument, that motion was allowed and the said para. 5(a) was added, reading as follows:\n5(a) In the further alternative, the Plaintiffs say that the Defendant Colonial Coach Lines Ltd. was negligent in not warning its passengers of the hazards inherent in using the back seats of its bus in a reclining position.\nThat amendment was the subject of serious objection in the Court of Appeal and again in this Court, and it was said that the plaintiffs by such amendment were in effect introducing a new cause of action and that such new cause of action was in fact introduced after the limitation period provided by the Ontario Highway Traffic Act had elapsed.\nI am of the opinion that in view of the terms of the endorsement on the writ of summons which I have quoted above, the plaintiffs were not introducing any new cause of action but were simply outlining a new particular of negligence. The plaintiffs could not rely on para. 5 of the statement of claim as originally delivered as that paragraph alleges a contract of carriage between the plaintiffs and the defendant and the contract was made between the plaintiffs and Allan\u2019s Travel Service, which latter entity was not a party to the action. I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs, therefore, require the allegation in the amendment to the statement of claim wrought by para. 5(a) of the statement of claim in order to be permitted to recover against the defendant. It is true that that allegation was only added after the verdict but it is difficult to see how the defendant was in any way prejudiced. If the proof of the allegation had depended on the production of evidence of what was customarily done by way of warning then I am ready to agree that it has not been clearly demonstrated that the defendant had notice and opportunity to produce such evidence. The fact was noted by McGillivray J.A. in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In my view, however, the defendant\u2019s liability is established not on the basis of what was customary in other cases but on the basis of what was lacking was a precaution which a reasonable and prudent man would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it. Such a finding needed no demonstration by evidence and was in fact made by the jury simply acting as persons of ordinary common sense.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the amendment as did the learned trial judge.\nIt is true that in this Court, counsel for the appellants sought to put the appellants\u2019 case on the basis of the maxim res ipsa loquitur pointing out in the words of Hudson J. in Day v. Toronto Transportation Commission, supra, what was a heavy burden on the defendant carrier to establish the use of the necessary skill and care and that the defendant had failed to discharge such a burden. I am, however, of the opinion that counsel for the respondent supplied an adequate answer to that submission when he pointed to the opening to the jury made by counsel for the plaintiffs where the counsel did not purport to rely in any way on the maxim and on the other hand assumed the burden of proof. In Spencer v. Field,[9] Davis J. said at p. 42:\nIt is unnecessary for us in this case to consider whether or not that doctrine has any application to this case. It is sufficient in our view to observe that the case for the respondents was formulated in the pleadings and developed at the trial as an action of negligence against the appellant without any reference to the rule of res ipsa loquitur. And the case went to the jury, without any objection, on the basis of an action for negligence in which the burden lay upon the respondents. That being so, the respondents are not entitled upon an appeal to recast their case and put it upon a basis which had not been suggested at the trial.\nHowever, having come to the conclusion that the amendment to the statement of claim was proper, I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover on the basis of the negligence found by the jury and I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the County court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Soloway, Wright, Houston, Galligan & McKimm, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1966] 1 O.R. 621, 54 D.L.R.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1967: October 19, 20, 23, 24; 1968: October 1.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nShipping\u2014Contract for carriage of goods\u2014Obligations of carrier and shipper\u2014Seaworthiness\u2014Loading instructions\u2014Capsize of barge during loading\u2014Expert advice subsequent to accident\u2014Responsibility for loss.\nUnder a contract entered into by the plaintiff and the defendant, the latter undertook to provide tugs and scows for transporting pulp chips from the plaintiff\u2019s plant to their destination. The agreement provided, inter alia, that: \u201c(a) Tugs and scows shall be approved by a representative of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada or other competent surveyor; (b) Carrier shall in all cases exercise due diligence to make and keep all vessels used seaworthy; (c) Shipper shall be responsible for all scows from the time they are made fast to moorings until carrier has placed a line aboard with intention of removing the same from the dock; (d) Scows shall be loaded and trimmed in accordance with loading instructions provided by carrier to shipper from time to time; (e) All shipments of pulp chips shall be carried subject to all the terms and conditions of carrier\u2019s bill of lading.\u201d The first condition on the reverse side of the form of bill of lading annexed to the contract was that \u201cit shall have effect subject to the Water Carriage of Goods Act\u201d.\nIn the performance of this contract the defendant at first used barges of approximately 700 units carrying capacity, but the intention was that it would later use much larger barges. Due to their greater width, the plaintiff\u2019s loading equipment did not project far enough to make it possible to centre the load within the box of the larger barges, as could be done with the smaller ones. It was agreed between the parties that the necessary alterations would not be made until some experience had been gained in the loading of the big barges. In the meantime, the load was to be put on eccentrically, the barge being turned around by a tug from time to time as the loading progressed. One of the defendant\u2019s scows capsized while it was moored to the plaintiff\u2019s dock and in the last stages of being loaded with chips through the plaintiff\u2019s equipment. Loading instructions with respect to permissible list had been given verbally by the defendant\u2019s superintendent to the plaintiff\u2019s mill foreman, who was also superintending the loading of the barges.\nJudgment at trial was given in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal, the Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action and allowed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nPer Martland and Pigeon JJ.: It was clear that the provision for responsibility for the scows during loading could not have the effect of suppressing during that period the obligation of the carrier to use due diligence to make the ship seaworthy and, accordingly, it was unnecessary to decide whether the Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 291, applied. Seaworthiness requires more than structural soundness; it also requires proper instructions. Even if this was not a legal requirement, the contract between the parties would make it such under (d) above.\nAs to whether the defendant did in fact provide proper loading instructions or at least used due diligence to that end, it was obvious that it did not use due diligence. The defendant had failed to obtain the advice of a naval architect or of a person of equivalent qualifications, in respect of a vessel, a substantial part of which had not been designed by such a person. The loading instructions verbally given by the defendant\u2019s superintendent to the plaintiff\u2019s foreman prior to the accident were not proper and adequate. There was no reason to believe that if competent expert advice had been sought, as it should have been before the barges were put in service, such advice would have been any different from that which was subsequently given as suitable under the conditions of eccentric loading in which the defendant had acquiesced.\nOn the question of whether the capsize was in fact due to the insufficient and defective loading instructions or to the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s foreman, the conclusion was reached, following an examination of the evidence, that the Court of Appeal was wrong in finding that the capsize was due to the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. On the contrary, the accident was due to the insufficient and imprudent loading instructions given by the defendant\u2019s representatives.\nPer Spence J.: The obligations of the plaintiff and the defendant were fixed by the terms of the contract entered into by the parties and under the circumstances the bill of lading was merely a receipt. Under the contract the defendant had not merely a right but a duty to issue proper instructions as to loading and it was the breach of that duty which created the occasion for the capsize of the scow. Per Abbott and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: It was the agreement and not the Water Carriage of Goods Act which controlled the relationship between the parties. Under the agreement the responsibility for the scow while moored at the plaintiff\u2019s dock during loading rested with the plaintiff subject to the fact that it was required to comply with any instructions provided by the carrier as to loading and trimming. The carrier had the right but not the duty to give such instructions subject to the fact that any instructions which it did give must be such as to not endanger the safety of the scow or cargo, and even if the agreement be construed as imposing a duty upon the carrier to give loading instructions, there was no breach of such a duty in the present case.\nUnder all the circumstances of the case, before the defendant could be fixed with the responsibility for the loss it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show not only that the instructions given by the defendant\u2019s superintendent were wrong, but that this error was the cause of the mishap. The evidence indicated that there was nothing wrong with the instructions given as to permissible list.\nThe underlying causes of the collapse of the vessel were that the plaintiff company was employing loading equipment which was not thoroughly adapted to the loading of these large scows and that its superintendent was not exercising the care required to supervise the undertaking. The immediate cause of the capsizing was the negligence of the foreman who was responsible for the loading of this particular scow.\n[Standard Oil Co. of New York v.

Ltd., [1907] A.C. 272, considered.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Collins J. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nW.J. Wallace, Q.C., and D.B. Smith, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. McK. Brown, and B. Trevino, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Pigeon in which he has made an extensive analysis of a great deal of the evidence, but as I take a somewhat different approach to the problem involved and as I place a different interpretation on some of the facts, it is perhaps as well for me to state independently the issues as I see them. I will endeavour to refrain from repetition in so far as is consistent with making my opinion clear.\nThis appeal arises out of the capsizing of one of the respondent\u2019s scows while it was moored to the dock at the appellant\u2019s plant and in the last stages of being loaded with wood chips through the appellant\u2019s equipment.\nIn my view the respective obligations of the appellant and the respondent concerning the supplying of scows and the loading thereof with pulp chips at the appellant\u2019s plant, are fixed by the terms of the contract (hereinafter referred to as the agreement) entered into between the parties on April 26, 1962, wherein it is recited that the carrier, i.e., Vancouver Tug Boat Company Limited, has agreed with the shipper, i.e., Tahsis Company Limited, to supply suitable tugs and scows to transport pulp chips from the shipper\u2019s plant to their destination. This is a contract to carry the appellant\u2019s goods in the respondent\u2019s scows between the Tahsis Company\u2019s plant and the St. Regis Paper Mill and in my view it has the character of a charter party covering a succession of voyages by these scows from the point of loading to the destination specified.\nBy clause 10 of the charter agreement it is provided that all shipments\n\u2026shall be carried subject to all the terms and conditions of Carrier\u2019s Bill of Lading\u2026 which together with the provisions of this contract shall constitute the terms and conditions under which the said pulp chips are carried. In the event of any conflict between the said Bill of Lading and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.\nCarrier shall supply Shipper with Bill of Lading forms which shall be completed by Shipper and signed by each party hereto prior to the sailing of each scow\u2026\nI mention this clause because the learned trial judge took the view that the provisions of the \u201cRules Relating to Bills of Lading\u201d which are a schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 291, governed the loading and carriage of the chips shipped under the agreement and as I disagree with this conclusion and consider the matter may be of some importance in determining the rights of the parties, it appears to me to be desirable to state at the outset the reasons for my disagreement. In this regard it is to be observed that the rules in question, with the exception of art. 6, only apply to \u201ccontracts of carriage\u201d as defined in art. 1(b) of the schedule, and are therefore limited to:\n\u2026contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title in so far as such document relates to the carriage of goods by sea, including any bill of lading or any similar document as aforesaid issued under or pursuant to a charterparty from the moment at which such bill of lading or similar document of title regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder of the same.\nIn the present case it was the shipper, i.e., Tahsis, who chartered the vessel directly from the owner as opposed to the common situation in which an owner has chartered his vessel and the charterer in turn contracts with the shipper. There is a long line of cases to the effect that where, as here, the shipper has chartered the vessel directly from the owner, the bill of lading in so far as it may differ from the terms of the charterparty, is to be treated as a mere receipt for the goods.\nThe effect of these cases is well summarized in the reasons for judgment of Lord Halsbury in Kruger & Co. Ltd. v. Moel Tryvan Ship Co. Ltd.[2] where he said:\nThe bill of lading cannot control what has been agreed upon before between the shipowner and the merchant and what has been expressed in a written instrument which is the final and concluded agreement between the parties. It is in truth a bill of lading; it is somewhat inaccurately described as a contract in the Bills of Lading Act, but Bramwell L.J. said in Wagstaff v. Anderson, (1880), 5 C.P.D. 171, 177, that \u201cto say it is a contract superseding, adding to or varying the former contract under the charterparty is a proposition of law to which I never can consent.\u201d\nIn Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading, 17th ed. at p. 397, the matter is dealt with in relation to the language used in the schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act. The learned author there says:\nFor as between the charterer and the shipowner the operative document is the charterparty, the bill of lading being generally a mere receipt\u2026 and there is between them no \u201ccontract of carriage\u201d within the meaning of Article 1(b) and, therefore, the shipowner is not within the meaning of Article 1(a) a \u201ccarrier\u201d (i.e., a person who \u201centers into a contract of carriage\u201d)\u2026\nI am accordingly of the opinion that it is the agreement and not the Water Carriage of Goods Act which controls the relationship between the parties. I have dealt with this matter at such length because counsel for the appellant invited us to adopt the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the respondent had failed to exercise due diligence \u201cbefore and at the beginning of the voyage to make the ship seaworthy\u201d as is required by art. 3(1) of the schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act. The word \u201cseaworthy\u201d is not defined in that Act or in the schedule thereto and it has been variously interpreted by the Courts having regard to the facts of the various cases before them, but the meaning of the word \u201cseaworthy\u201d as used in the agreement is fixed by the provisions of clause 1(b) thereof and the combined effect of that clause and clause 3(c) makes it clear that the obligation of Vancouver Tug in this regard was limited to exercising due diligence to make and keep the scow \u201cin a normal condition, safe to tow in the trade for which\u201d it was \u201cbeing used and that the amount of water contained within the hull\u201d did not \u201cexceed the equivalent of 4 inches depth over the entire bottom of any single main compartment of\u201d the scow.\nThe agreement itself describes in some detail the carrier\u2019s obligation to supply scows and to arrange towing operations so as to provide efficient transportation and the shipper\u2019s obligation to load the chips on the scows. The following provisions appear to me to be most relevant to the present inquiry:\nClause 3(a)\nCarrier shall provide sufficient tugs and scows all of which shall be approved by a representative of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada, or other competent surveyor, for the purposes of transporting not less than 60,000 units, nor more than 80,000 units, of pulp chips per annum. Scows provided hereunder shall have a minimum aggregate carrying capacity of 3,000 units and a maximum aggregate carrying capacity of 4,500 units and shall be properly boxed and fitted for the transportation.\nClause 3(c)\nCarrier shall in all cases exercise due diligence to make and keep all vessels used hereunder in good order and condition and in all respects seaworthy.\nClause 5(b)\nCarriers shall deliver the scows to Shipper at loading places in good order and condition and in all respects ready to load.\nClause 5(e)\nShipper shall be responsible for all such scows from the time they are made fast to moorings as directed by Shipper until Carrier has placed a line aboard such scows with the intention of removing the same from the plant, whether loaded or empty. 7. Loading.\n(a) All pulp chips shall be loaded and trimmed by Shipper solely at the expense of Shipper, PROVIDED ALWAYS that Carrier shall bear any costs occasioned as a result of faulty equipment supplied by Carrier.\n(b) Scows shall be loaded and trimmed in accordance with loading instructions provided by Carrier to Shipper from time to time.\n(c) Loading shall be deemed to be completed when any loaded scow has been examined and accepted by the master of the tug.\n(d) Shipper shall load each scow to capacity with all reasonable despatch.\n11. Risk and Liability.\n(a) Shipper shall be liable for and shall pay for all damage caused to vessels provided by Carrier hereunder which shall be caused by the negligence of Shipper, its servants or agents, and shall indemnify and save Carrier harmless from all loss and damage whatsoever caused by the negligence of St. Regis Paper Company, its servants or agents.\n(b) Shipper shall procure and maintain at its expense, insurance on all pulp chips carried hereunder to the full insurable value thereof against all sea, fire and marine risks which may arise during the loading, transportation and discharge thereof.\nIt appears to me that the division of responsibility between the parties under this agreement was that the shipper would be responsible for the scows from the time they were made fast to the moorings at its dock until the tug master put a line aboard to tow them away, while the carrier undertook to provide scows approved by a representative of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada and accepted the responsibility for safe carriage of the cargo to the specified destination. In so doing, the carrier reserved the right to have the scows loaded and trimmed in accordance with its instructions from time to time. Loading was \u201cdeemed to be completed when any loaded scow\u201d had \u201cbeen examined and accepted by the master of the tug\u201d.\nIn my opinion, by virtue of the provisions of clause 7(d) the shipper accepted the responsibility of loading \u201ceach scow to capacity with all reasonable despatch\u201d and further agreed under clause 7(a) to load and trim all pulp chips solely at its expense. As the carrier was responsible for the scow and its cargo during the voyage, it appears to me to be only reasonable that the agreement should contain a provision that the scows would be loaded and trimmed in accordance with such instructions as the carrier might, from time to time, provide and that the loading would not be deemed to be completed until the tug master had examined and accepted the loaded scow. Clause 7(b) undoubt- edly placed the shipper under the obligation to load and trim in accordance with any instructions provided by the carrier, but I do not read it as creating any concomitant obligation on the carrier to provide such instructions. The loading was left to the shipper but the carriage at sea was left to the carrier. As will hereafter appear, instructions were in fact given by the carrier to the shipper as to the maximum permissible list to be allowed in loading the type of scow with which we are here concerned, and whether these instructions were wrong, and whether or not they were carried out by the shipper, are two of the questions involved in this appeal.\nDuring the early months of the life of the agreement, the respondent was supplying barges of its 100 series with a carrying capacity of approximately 700 units which could be readily loaded with chips from the then existing chip conveyor and chip delivery spout at the appellant\u2019s plant, but it decided to acquire a much larger type of barge which was later known as its 150 series and which had a capacity of 1,680 units of chips. This decision was conveyed to the appellant with a view to determining what effect the change would have on the method of loading with its existing loading facilities.\nThe discussions between the parties at this stage of the proceedings are well described in the evidence of Mr. W.G. Beale, who was the superintendent and former manager of planning and engineering for the Tahsis company, and who said:\nWe had previously received drawings of the proposed barges, the V.T. 150 and 151 in order to determine whether it was\u2014whether these barges would present any difficulty in so far as loading with our facilities was concerned. As a result of having received these and made a preliminary investigation, we had determined that it was quite possible and practical to load these barges and this was discussed at this meeting. I conveyed to Mr. Plester and to Mr. Lindsay that we would load the barges with the present facilities in the initial stages, but that once we had seen physically what the barges looked like, what the problems were, we would then extend the conveyor then we could load the barges more economically.\nQ. What do you mean by more economically?\nA. I explained to Mr. Plester that we proposed to turn the barges during the process of loading. This was a fairly\u2014this was something which we had done\u2014that I had done during my stay in B.C. Forest Products in Victoria, and it was a fairly common type of procedure. He was later again asked:\nQ. Now, you mentioned that\u2014I think I asked this question about\u2014you mentioned something about being economical, that you would make changes to make it economical. What did you mean by that?\nA. Oh, we proposed to accept the cost during the initial stages of turning the barges during the loading, and this of course, was a direct cost. We proposed to use the local tug owned by Texada Towing at their going rates to turn the scow.\nIt is, I think, fair to conclude from this evidence that the problem in loading the V.T. 150 and 151 scows as opposed to the 100 series was created because Tahsis had not got the proper facilities for loading such large scows directly, that this problem was discussed before the scows were ever constructed, that it was the Tahsis managing engineer who suggested loading by turning the barges so as to cover first one side and then the other with chips, and that he had, on behalf of Tahsis, made a preliminary investigation as a result of which he determined that it was practical to so load the scows. Mr. Beale had had experience in loading in this fashion and it is clear that the whole operation was to be conducted independently of Vancouver Tug by the use of the \u201clocal tug\u201d for turning. This procedure appears to have been adopted on a temporary basis until Tahsis had found out \u201cwhat the problems were\u201d after which it was contemplated that the conveyor would be extended.\nIt was not until October 13 that the first of the new barges arrived at the Tahsis plant. Captain Plester, who was port superintendent for the tug company had intended to be present during most of the loading but unfortunately his arrival was delayed until October 17 after the loading was practically completed and the scows had been turned end for end five times in order to assist in the distribution of the load.\nIt was at this time that Captain Plester had a conversation with Mr. Kovlaske, who was in charge of loading the 150 series scows for Tahsis under the direction of Mr. Beale, which he describes as follows:\n\u2026I asked Mr. Kovlaske when he expected to turn the barge again as he had informed me that he would be turning her once more before completion, and he then asked me, and while he was asking me he was looking at the width of the barge, and he said, now he said, \u201cHow much list should I put on this barge before I turn her as this is an unfamiliar piece of equipment to me?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, Al, two to three feet. You can go two to three feet to be quite safe, but you should not exceed three feet in any case.\u201d\nIt is with respect to this evidence that the learned trial judge made the following comment:\nHowever, he did not tell Kovlaske that in the final stages of loading the effect on stability by the placement of the latter part of the cargo could be controlled by watching to keep the list within the limit of three feet, nor how tricky this could become in the final stages of loading. I particularly find that although Captain Plester advised him not to allow a list to exceed three feet he did not advise him of any plan or sequence of placement of cargo which would enable Kovlaske to keep the list under three feet. In my view it is meagre advice to advise one to keep the list not more than three feet and to fail to explain how this can be done.\nIn quoting the evidence of the conversation between Plester and Kovlaske, the learned trial judge omitted to refer to what followed after Kovlaske had been told that he should not exceed three feet in any case. Mr. Plester\u2019s evidence, which is uncontradicted, continues:\nQ. Alright, and what did he say in response to that?\nA. And he said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and I said, now, I said, \u201cDue to the size the barges you should take measurements from time to time or have your loader take measurements to establish the list.\u201d I said, \u201cThese can be very confusing due to the size of the barge. You can get more than that if you don\u2019t watch.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll watch that pretty carefully.\u201d\nAs I have indicated, the loading procedure adopted by Tahsis was on a temporary basis and to some extent was a question of trial and error to find out what the problems were, but whatever the exact instructions may have been which were given to Kovlaske by Captain Plester, it is clear that having received these instructions Kovlaske had successfully superintended the loading of six such scows eccentrically between October 15 and December 30 and that on December 27 when the V.T. 151 was delivered by Vancouver Tug, he was the only person who had had any actual experience in superintending the loading of these scows with the equipment available and he was in a better position than anyone else to know what was a safe load.\nIt is in my view highly significant and clearly indicative of the responsibility accepted by Tahsis for loading that after observing the first two loads, the superintendent and managing engineer of Tahsis decided to change the loading arrangements at the plant. As to this he gave the following evidence:\nQ. Well, now, as a result of this loading and your experience what plans were made with respect to the conveyor?\nA. After we had observed a couple of loadings of V.T. 150 we were still somewhat undecided as to exactly what action we should take. We then laid out again in great detail the barge at all water levels and all load conditions.\nQ. What do you mean you laid it out?\nA. We drew a sketch to scale showing the conveyor, the dock face, the water at high tide, the barge at full load and empty, to examine completely the relationship of the barge to the conveyor and to the spout. Having done this, we decided that we should then lengthen the conveyor and re-hang the spout and lengthen the spout.\nIt is to be remembered that Mr. Beale was a qualified engineer with years of experience in the loading of scows and his next answer deals with details of re-hanging the conveyor. He then says:\nWe then would add one section to the conveyor spout so that the chips could be directed further away from the dock, further in all directions. This course of action was decided upon. It was uncertain at this point how much inconvenience we would run into in loading the scows this way. We determined for certain that we could load them, and I think below 5 or 6 foot tide we could load a scow in any condition. We would have to plan our loading so that the top load was built at tides so that the corners of the top loads would have to be built at tides below 5 or 6 feet, something in that order.\nIf this proved to be inconvenient, which we did not anticipate, then it would be no more costly to raise the conveyor after these changes were made than to raise the conveyor before the changes were made, so we decided we would do it in 2 steps, we would make the 3 changes to the conveyor, and observe what happened for a period of time, and if we found it was inconvenient or costly, then we would raise the conveyor, and as a second step\u2014Now, having decided this we then went ahead with it.\nQ. What relative dates are involved there, Mr. Beale?\nA. Well, in the middle of October we loaded the first scow. Some time in November we made these decisions after several sketches and some fairly detailed layouts. As to the exact timing, I am not sure, but between that time, between the middle of November and the end of December, we fabricated and installed a new support mechanism for the conveyor, in order to support the additional lengths, and this had been installed when the conveyor was knocked down by the barge.\nI have quoted at considerable length from the evidence of Mr. Beale because he was the general superintendent of the Tahsis company and because it was he who suggested the method of loading the scows \u201cto a list\u201d which was undoubtedly a factor contributing materially to the capsizing of the V.T. 151 at the dock side on December 31. It is to be noted that when he was called out to view the scow shortly before its collapse, his reaction was \u201cthat it may have been loaded very poorly.\u201d\nAs I have indicated, I take the view that the responsibility for the V.T. 151 while moored at the appellant\u2019s dock during loading rested with the appellant (see clause 5(e)) subject to the fact that it was required (under clause 7 (b)) to comply with any instructions provided by the carrier as to loading and trimming.\nIn the course of investigating the cause of the accident, both parties took the opinions of experts in naval architecture and I think it is fair to say that the effect of their evidence is that the scow was \u201ctender\u201d and the loading had to be closely watched even before the list reached the three feet specified by Captain Plester, although none of these experts was prepared to say that the scow would have capsized as the result of loading alone if Captain Plester\u2019s instructions had been followed and the list not allowed to exceed three feet.\nBased on the very exhaustive analysis made by its experts after the event, it is now contended on behalf of the appellant that the scow was unseaworthy in that the loading instructions given by Plester to Kovlaske on October 17 were insufficient. It is to be remembered that under the provisions of clause 1(b) and 3(c) of the agreement, pursuant to which the loading was being conducted, the carrier\u2019s agreement was to exercise due diligence to keep the scow in all respects in \u201cnormal condition, safe to tow in the trade for which\u201d it was \u201cbeing used\u201d and that the water contained in any main compartment of the bottom of any scow did not exceed four inches.\nThere is no suggestion that the scow was not in normal condition, or that it was unsafe to tow in the trade or that there was any water contained within the hull. The scow was in this sense seaworthy within the meaning of the agreement, but it is contended on behalf of the appellant that a ship which is structurally sound may nevertheless be unseaworthy if those who charter it are not instructed in the proper method of using it. The contention is based on the case of Standard Oil Co. of New York v. Clan Line Steamers Ltd.[3], (hereinafter called \u201cClan Line\u201d) and it is in my opinion important that this case should be analysed so as to determine whether it affords authority for the proposition that a structurally sound ship chartered by an owner for loading by a shipper is not seaworthy unless it is accompanied by detailed loading instructions embodying the conclusions of a marine architect based on stability data compiled by him concerning the ship. In The \u201cHildina\u201d[4], Lord Merriman, who was then President of the Admiralty Division, had occasion to make the following explanatory comment on the Clan Line case. He said, at p. 258:\nThis was the case, to put it quite shortly, of the turret ship which turned turtle and it is a little important, in comparing so far as possible one set of circumstances with another, to know that an earlier turret ship of the same construction had turned turtle. The whole point was this, that in a ship of that description it proved on subsequent investigation after the loss of the first ship that unless there was water ballast in two of the holds up to a certain measure the ship was unseaworthy. If she was properly ballasted she was perfectly seaworthy, and, as the result of the first loss, the builders had circularized elaborate instructions to those in whose possession their ships were, about the absolute necessity of keeping the water ballast intact. In the case of the second ship, some nine years later than the original casualty, it was proved that those instructions had not been passed on to her master, who had deliberately, but in absolute ignorance of the necessity for keeping these holds full of water ballast, pumped the ballast out\u2026\nIt was under these circumstances that the House of Lords held \u201cthat the ship was inherently unseaworthy under certain not improbable conditions unless special precautions were taken which it was the duty of the owners to enjoin as being required by the structure of their ship and that the owners were therefore liable for the loss of their cargo\u201d.\nWhen he came to consider the Clan Line case in relation to the facts of The \u201cHildina\u201d, Lord Merriman observed, at p. 260:\n\u2026I do not think there is anything in the circumstances of this case which remotely resembles the outstanding fact in the Clan Line case that nine years before the casualty in question another ship had turned turtle for lack of the very precaution with which the owners had in the case in question failed to acquaint the master of the ship involved in the second casualty. There is nothing comparable to that at all in this case. With the greatest respect for those who may hold a different view, I think that this language of Lord Merriman is applicable to the present case, and I do not think that the Clan Line case affords authority for the proposition that when a shipowner delivers a structurally seaworthy scow into the hands of a shipper for loading and that shipper is experienced in the loading of the cargo to be carried, that the scow can be said to be unseaworthy because its owners have not retained naval architects to devise a detailed loading plan and conveyed detailed loading instructions to the shipper as to the point beyond which it becomes dangerous to overload the scow on one side. In the present case there had been no similar collapse of such a scow at its moorings while loading, the plant superintendent at Tahsis was a man of long experience in loading scows and only a very short time before the accident his company had prepared a scale sketch of the barge and loading facilities and had \u201claid out again in great detail the barge at all water levels and all load conditions\u201d.\nIn the case of the Clan Line the owners knew that the vessel was only seaworthy so long as the detailed instructions furnished by the builders were complied with, but they failed to convey these instructions to the master of the ship. The real question in that case was whether the owners had proved \u201cthat the loss occurred without their actual fault and privity\u201d within the meaning of s. 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and it was held that the failure to give the instructions to the master brought the fault home to the owners.\nIt is, however, also contended that the provisions of clause 7(b) of the agreement placed upon the respondent the burden of providing the shipper with the kind of detailed instructions which were worked out by the marine architects after the event and in this regard it is to be observed that the right to control the manner in which a ship is to be loaded rests primarily with the shipowner as it has to protect its ship from being made unseaworthy, but that the obligation to discharge the function of loading may be shifted to the shipper by the terms of the contract of carriage. As I have indicated, I read the provisions of clause 7(b) as giving expression to the carrier\u2019s right to dictate loading instructions and I think that the shipper is required to comply with such instructions, but I do not think that the carrier is placed under any obligation to give them although if it does so, its instructions must be such as not to endanger the safety of the scow or cargo.\nIn my view there is a strong analogy between the circumstances of the present case and those which were considered in Canadian Transport Co. Ltd. v. Court Line Ltd.[5] In the present case clauses 7(b) and (c) of the agreement, when read together, provide that the cargo (i.e. pulp chips) \u201cshall be loaded and trimmed solely at the expense of the Shipper\u2014in accordance with loading instructions provided by the Carrier\u2014from time to time\u201d whereas in the Court Line case clause 8 of the charterparty provided in part that \u201ccharterers are to load, stow and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain\u2026\u201d. In that case the captain stood in the place of the shipowners who brought the action against the charterers for damage due to improper stowage of cargo. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Lord Atkin said, at p. 937:\nThe shipowners claimed to recover this sum which had been paid to the bill of lading holders from the charterers on the ground that they were liable to the owners for improper stowage under clause 8. The first answer which the charterers made was that there was no such liability because the duty of the charterers was expressed to be to stow, etc., \u201cunder the supervision of the captain\u201d. This, it was said, threw the actual responsibility for stowage on the captain; or at any rate threw upon the owners the onus of showing that the damage was not due to an omission by the master to exercise due supervision. This, we were told, was the point of commercial importance upon which the opinion of this House was desired. My Lords, it appears to me plain that there is no foundation at all for this defence; and on this point all the judges so far have agreed. The supervision of the stowage by the captain is in any case a matter of course; he has in any event to protect his ship from being made unseaworthy; and in other respects no doubt he has the right to interfere if he considers that the proposed stowage is likely to impose a liability upon the owners. If it could be proved by the charterers that the bad stowage was caused only by the captain\u2019s orders, and that their own proposed stowage would have caused no damage no doubt that might enable them to escape liability. But the reservation of the right of the captain to supervise, a right which in my opinion would have existed even if not expressly reserved, has no effect whatever in relieving the charterers of their primary duty to stow safely\u2026\nIn that case the charterparty was in \u201ctime-charter\u201d form but it was in fact a charter for a single voyage from Rotterdam to the Northern Pacific and return to the United Kingdom or the Continent. In my opinion the position of the charterers was analagous to that of the shippers in the present case and as I have said, the captain stood in the place of the owners. I therefore think the decision of the House of Lords, when applied to the interpretation of clause 7 of the agreement in the present case can be construed as meaning that the reservation of the right of the owner to give loading instructions from time to time and to require that the loaded scow be examined by its master (clauses 7(b) and (c)) has no effect whatever in relieving the shippers of their primary duty under clauses 5(e) and 7(a) to stow safely, and I think also that in order to succeed in the present action the shippers would have to prove that the bad stowage resulting in the collapse of the scow was caused only by the loading instructions given by the carrier and that their own proposed stowage would have caused no damage at all.\nAs I have indicated, I am of opinion that the shipper was required to comply with any instructions which were given to it by the carrier and that the carrier had the right but not the duty to give such instructions subject to the fact that any instructions which it did give must be such as to not endanger the safety of the scow or cargo. I am, however, in any event of opinion that even if clause 7(b) be construed as imposing a duty upon the carrier to give loading instructions, there was no breach of such a duty in the present case because, as will hereafter appear, I do not think that the instructions not to exceed a three-foot list \u201cin any case\u201d, which were given by Captain Plester, can be said to have endangered the safety of the scow or that they were in any way inadequate having regard to the fact that they were being furnished to a company, the superintendent of which, who was in overall charge of the loading, had had previous experience in the eccentric loading of pulp chips and who regarded it as \u201ca fairly common type of procedure\u201d.\nIt is true that in the present case if the loading instructions, prepared by marine architects after the accident, had been available and had been followed on December 31, they would have provided a greater margin of safety during loading operations, but the extent of the obligation undertaken by the carrier under clause 3(a) of the agreement was to provide scows \u201capproved by a representative of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada or other competent surveyor\u201d and there can be no doubt that the V.T. 151 had been so approved by Captain Brown, the principal surveyor for the Marine Surveyors of Western Canada, who had held that position for seventeen years and that it was according to the advice furnished by this expert that Captain Plester made his recommendation to Kovlaske with respect to the list not being allowed to \u201cexceed three feet in any case\u201d. It may be that Captain Brown was not as skilled in the exact scientific preparation of stability data as the marine architects who examined the situation after the event, but I do not think it can be said that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence to make and keep the scow in a normal condition and safe to tow in the trade for which it was being used when it is considered that it was structurally seaworthy and that the respondent had obtained the opinion and approval of a marine surveyor as it was required to do in accordance with clause 3(a) of the agreement. There was no other obligation on the carrier to have the scows surveyed before delivery and I do not think that the decision in the Clan Line case or any other case which I have been able to find required it as a matter of law to consult marine architects before putting the scows in service.\nThe fact that amended loading instructions were given by the respondent after the accident in conformity with the advice which it received from the experts, cannot of itself be treated as any evidence of the inadequacy of the instructions given by Captain Plester. (See Hart v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[6]) It is appreciated, however, that the main argument in support of the appellant\u2019s position does not depend in any way upon the fact that amended instructions were given after the event, but is on the other hand founded on the contention that under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the respondent could and should have consulted marine architects with a view to a more accurate determination of the stability factors in the scows before they were put in service and that its failure to do so resulted in insufficient loading instructions being supplied by Captain Plester. I find myself unable to accept this view of the matter. As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the Tahsis people accepted full responsibility for loading these scows and at the time when the accident occurred they were in the course of experimenting in order to achieve the best result. In my view, it was the superintent at Tahsis and the man who had been in charge of loading the last six scows of the 150 series who were best able to judge as to the effect of the permeability of chips to rain and as to the effect of wind and weather on the operation which they were conducting.\nUnder all the circumstances of this case, I am of opinion that before the respondent can be fixed with the responsibility for the loss it is incumbent on the appellant to show, not only that the instructions given by Captain Plester were wrong, but that this error was the cause of the mishap. It is not enough in my view to prove that the loading operation could have been conducted with greater safety if the instructions had been more elaborate, the question as I see it is whether the instructions were wrong in the sense that if they were followed the scow would be likely to capsize.\nAs I have indicated, I do not find in any of the evidence of the marine architects a statement that the loading to a 3-foot list would of itself cause the scow to capsize; whereas there is on the other hand evidence that six of these scows had been safely loaded in this fashion by Kovlaske without capsizing and that the very scow in question had been moored at the appellant\u2019s dock with a 3-foot list from 2 a.m. on December 29 to 7.30 a.m. on December 31, the day of its loss.\nWithout going into any further detail, I am prepared to agree with Mr. Justice MacLean when he says in the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia:\nI can find no evidence to indicate that danger is involved in loading this barge to a three foot list.\nI am accordingly of opinion that there was nothing wrong with the instructions as to permissible list given to Kovlaske by Captain Plester.\nThe evidence as to the cause of the mishap is contradictory because Kovlaske testified the scow was only listing 2 feet 2 inches at 12 noon and 2 feet 4 inches at about 12:15, shortly before it capsized and this would indicate that he had followed the respondent\u2019s instructions; whereas the loading experts were of opinion, after considering all the circumstances, that this estimate must have been wrong and that the scow by 12:15 was at a substantially greater list in excess of three feet and that it had become \u201chung up\u201d on the dock or that the normal progression of the list had been interfered with in some other way so as to make it appear less than it actually was.\nIn my view the underlying causes of the collapse of the V.T. 151 on December 31 were that the Tahsis company was employing loading equipment which was not thoroughly adapted to the loading of these large scows and that its superintendent, Mr. Beale was not exercising the care required to supervise the undertaking. The immediate cause of the capsizing was, in my opinion, the negligence of Kovlaske who was responsible for the loading of this particular scow and whose actions at the critical times on the morning of December 31 are accurately described in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice MacLean where he says:\nAt 11:30 A.M. he must have known that a critical stage in the loading was approaching, he left his post, did not reappear till 12:05 when he made a \u201cvisual\u201d measurement for calculating list\u2014left again to reappear at 12:15 p.m. at which time the barge was doomed. In the meantime an underling had been left in charge of the whole loading operation at the critical stage of loading.\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Martland and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The essential facts of this case are as follows:\nOn April 26, 1962, the parties entered into a contract whereby the respondent undertook to provide tugs and scows for transporting pulp chips from appellant\u2019s dock at Tahsis inlet, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, to the St. Regis paper mill in Tacoma, State of Washington. This agreement provided among other conditions that:\n(a) Tugs and scows shall be approved by a representative of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada or other competent surveyor;\n(b) Carrier shall in all cases exercise due diligence to make and keep all vessels used seaworthy; (c) Shipper shall be responsible for all scows from the time they are made fast to moorings until carrier has placed a line aboard with the intention of removing the same from the dock;\n(d) Scows shall be loaded and trimmed in accordance with loading instructions provided by carrier to shipper from time to time;\n(e) All shipments of pulp chips shall be carried subject to all the terms and conditions of carrier\u2019s bill of lading.\nThe first condition on the reverse side of the form of bill of lading annexed to the contract was that \u201cit shall have effect subject to the Water Carriage of Goods Act\u201d.\nIn the performance of this contract, respondent at first used mostly barges designated as the V.T. 100 series, carrying each approximately 700 units of chips (a unit is 200 cubic feet). However, they intended to use much larger barges known as the V.T. 150 and V.T. 151 which had been ordered built for this purpose. These were much larger barges intended to carry as much as 1,680 units.\nThe barges were loaded by means of an overhead conveyor at the end of which a movable spout directed the chips inside the box in which they were carried above the deck of the barge. Due to the greater width of the larger barges, the conveyor did not project far enough to make it possible to centre the load within the box of the larger barges, as could be done with the smaller ones. It was agreed between the parties that the necessary alterations would not be made until some experience had been gained in the loading of the big barges. In the meantime, the load was to be put on eccentrically, the barge being turned around by a tug from time to time as the loading progressed.\nOn the first voyage to Tacoma, the barge known as V.T. 151 suffered damage; one side of the box gave way and part of the cargo was lost. Subsequent examination established that the stanchions holding the planks forming the sides of the box were not strong enough, part of the flange of the steel beams making those stanchions having been cut away where they went through the steel deck. The barge was repaired and the defect corrected by strengthening the stanchions. The barge, however, was not returned to service as soon as expected, with the result that the appellant was without a barge for a few days before Christmas 1962. As a consequence, the production during those days went to the open air stock pile, and when the barge became available great effort was made to complete the loading in the three working days between Christmas and New Year; that is on Thursday and Friday, December 27 and 28, and Monday, December 31.\nOn this last day, the barge was first turned early in the morning having then a three-foot list to port. This degree of list was the maximum beyond which it was not safe to go according to instructions verbally given by Captain Plester, respondent\u2019s superintendent, to Kovlaske, appellants chip mill foreman, who was also superintending the loading of the barges. During the morning, the list gradually changed to starboard; chips being loaded both from production and stock pile. At 11:30, the chip mill stopped for the lunch hour but loading was continued from stock pile. Sometime after noon, around 12:15, Kovlaske had the loading stopped and heard what he described as a creaking noise. He then saw that the cap of the box of the scow was touching a temporary scaffolding put up on the face of the conveyor tower in preparation for the contemplated extension. An effort was made to hold the barge by tightening the spring lines but the list kept on increasing until the cap of the box came to rest on what was called the \u201cbull rail\u201d on the front of the dock. The barge held this position for some little time but finally something gave way and the barge capsized, bringing down a part of the conveyor and of the dock.\nThe trial judge held that under the circumstances the Water Carriage of Goods Act applied and imposed upon Vancouver Tug the duty to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy and that this required that the ship be accompanied by adequate loading instructions. He also held that the same obligation was imposed by the provision of the contract to which reference has already been made.\nThe respondent contended that the Water Carriage of Goods Act did not apply, and that the provision in the agreement that Tahsis would be responsible for the vessel from the time it became fast to moorings overrode during that time, the obligation to use due diligence to make the ship seaworthy.\nIn my opinion, it is not necessary to decide whether the Water Carriage of Goods Act applies because I find it clear that the provision for responsibility for the scows during loading, cannot have the effect of suppressing during that period the obligation of the carrier to use due diligence to make the ship seaworthy. It is well established that seaworthiness requires more than structural soundness; it also requires proper instructions: Standard Oil Co. of New York v. Clan Line Steamers Ltd.[7] Even if this was not a legal requirement, the contract between the parties would make it such because it provides for \u201cloading and trimming\u201d in accordance with loading instructions provided by carrier to shipper from time to time. The provision for responsibility of the shipper during loading certainly cannot have been intended to displace the obligation to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy by issuing proper and adequate loading instructions without which the ship would not be seaworthy during loading. Respondent\u2019s contention would result in putting on appellant\u2019s shoulders the burden of issuing to the loaders of the barge the instructions for loading that it was its legal and contractual duty to provide.\nHaving come to this conclusion, it is now necessary to consider whether respondent did in fact provide proper loading instructions or at least used due diligence to that end.\nThat it did not use due diligence is, I think, obvious. No naval architect was consulted to determine what those instructions should be. It must be noted in this connection that while the design for the barge itself had been prepared by a naval architect, this design involved not a chip box but an enclosed space for carrying newsprint. The design of the chip box was prepared by the builders without consultation with a naval architect. As we have seen, this resulted in such a poor design that on its first loaded trip the V.T. 151 lost a complete side of the box. Although the structural defect had been repaired prior to the accident, the owners had not been provided with the data respecting stability that a naval architect would normally have provided.\nThe record shows that the loading instructions verbally given by Capt. Plester, respondent\u2019s superintendent, to Kovlaske, appellant\u2019s chip mill foreman, were the result of a discussion between Capt. Plester and Capt. Brown, principal surveyor of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada. Captain Brown, as he said himself, had practical experience only and did not possess the technical knowledge of a naval architect. His advice to Capt. Plester was not based on precise stability data pertaining to the new barges; it was in the nature of an educated guess based on practical experience. I, therefore, conclude that respondent has not used due diligence to provide proper loading instructions, having failed to obtain the advice of a naval architect or of a person of equivalent qualifications, in respect of a vessel, a substantial part of which had not been designed by such a person.\nIn considering whether the loading instructions given were adequate and proper, it is convenient to examine first the instructions that were issued after the accident.\nCapt. Brown reacted as might be expected from a man relying essentially on practical experience. In his letter of January 24, 1963, he suggested: \u201cthat cargo box height be reduced by not less than 5 feet\u201d. The height of the box being 25 feet, this involved a reduction of 20 per cent in the volume of chips that might be carried.\nInstead of acting on this haphazard advice, respondent on February 5, 1963, retained the services of a naval architect, J.G. German. In essence, his recommendations dated February 26, 1963, were that:\n\u201c(a) The height of bin, and consequently of load, be reduced by 2 feet.\n(b) The maximum load permissible should be reduced to correspond to a loaded draft of 11\u2019\u20140\u201d in salt water. This allows additional margin for such possibilities as moisture accumulation in the bin.\n(c) When loading, the heeling angle should never be such as to permit entry of the underside of the fender in the water.\u201d These recommendations were acted upon and instructions issued in writing accordingly on February 28, 1963. It is important to note how far these instructions differed from those that had been given verbally prior to the accident:\nFirstly, the height of the box and of the load was reduced by 2 feet, that is 8 per cent.\nSecondly, the free-board was increased from 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet, this being the free\u2011board closely corresponding to a draft of 11 feet, as appears from the table annexed to the instructions dated April 9, 1964.\nThirdly, the maximum list at the critical stage was specified not as a difference of 3 feet between the freeboard on one side and the free-board on the other, but by the requirement that the underside of the fender should not be in the water. This underside being 12 inches below the barge\u2019s deck, this last requirement preserved a margin of one foot between the moment eccentric loading should be stopped and the point where the stability of the barge would be endangered, namely deck edge immersion.\nIt should be observed that this margin of safety at the critical time was thus made approximately double that which existed under Capt. Plester\u2019s verbal instructions. These were to load with one foot trim aft, two feet six inches free-board, maximum heel during loading, three feet. With the trim specified, the mean free-board aft became 2 feet because a 3-foot list makes a difference of one foot 6 inches each side of the mean and, therefore, puts the aft end of the fender 6 inches in the water.\nGerman was heard as expert witness for the respondent at the trial. He did not say that his above-mentioned recommendations had been unduly conservative or excessively cautious. What he said was that he did not then know that appellant\u2019s installation had been altered to prevent eccentric loading and that under conditions of off-centre loading he felt that his recommendations were necessary for a proper margin of stability. We, therefore, have it in the record that, on the basis of respondent\u2019s own expert\u2019s opinion, instructions to ensure a proper margin of stability during off-centre loading should have involved a reduction of 2 feet in the height of the box and, consequently, in the height of the load, an increase in the mean free-board to 3 feet instead of 2 feet 6 inches and a maximum list during loading defined by a prohibition against putting the underside of the fender below water level Undoubtedly, such instructions would have made for greater stability and provided a much greater margin of safety during loading operations as German himself admitted.\nAs it was, the margin of safety under the new instructions was even greater because appellant\u2019s installation had, in fact, been altered so as to eliminate off-centre loading. In the latter part of March 1963, the appellant had the chip box restored to its original height. Revised loading instructions stipulated an average free-board of 3 feet and of an inch in the winter, 2 feet 6 3\/4 inches, in the summer, with load lines 6 inches wide serving to indicate both limits. The prohibition against listing a barge so that the lower edge of the fender is immersed was retained, and it was added that the list should not exceed 30 inches.\nIn 1964, after \u201ca thorough study of all trips made by the barges\u201d since the last loading instructions, new instructions were issued by letter of April 9. These instructions did not embody any change in the box height nor in the maximum list allowable. However, the height of the top load was to vary according to the free-board by reference to two charts: one to be used in the summer, the other in the winter. These instructions being objected to as impracticable were replaced by another set specifying mean top load height and maximum top load height for five freeboard heights only, instead of the close to forty different heights listed in the tables accompanying the previous instructions. The restrictions respecting allowable list were unchanged.\nThus, it will be seen that after more than a year of experience and elimination of off-centre loading, appellant still did not consider it prudent to list any barge during loading as much as Capt. Plester had told Kovlaske that it could safely be listed under conditions of off-centre loading which admittedly required a greater margin of stability.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the loading instructions verbally given by Capt. Plester to Kovlaske prior to the accident were not proper and adequate. There is no reason to believe that if competent expert advice had been sought, as it should have been before the barges were put in service, such advice would have been any different from that which was subsequently given as suitable under the conditions of eccentric loading in which respondent had acquiesced. If anything, the presumption would rather be that these initial instructions having to be issued in the absence of any experience in the use of those barges, restrictions designed to ensure the stability at dock side during loading would have been even more rigorous than those recommended by German in February 1963.\nIt remains now to be considered whether the capsize is in fact due to the insufficient and defective loading instructions supplied by Capt. Plester or to the negligence of Kovlaske.\nAt the hearing in this Court, the imputation of negligence was essentially predicated on the assertion that, irrespective of any other considerations, it is a fact that if the barge had not heeled to such an extent that the deck went under the water, it would never have capsized. All the experts who were heard have agreed that the barge\u2019s maximum righting moment was reached at deck edge immersion; beyond this point, the righting moment decreased; in so far as the heeling moment represented by the load could not be removed, capsize then became inevitable unless the barge could be restrained by mooring lines or other temporary supports. In fact, this is what was attempted but without success.\nBefore jumping to the conclusion that, under those conditions, the fact of the capsize is conclusive evidence of negligence on the part of the loader, one must consider that a barge, like all mechanical devices, must be operated with an adequate margin of security. Proper operation of all human-made implements requires some margin for safety. It is never safe to operate too close to the breaking point. While the breaking point is an ultimate datum determined with a degree of scientific accuracy, the safe working load is a matter of judgment resting, on the one hand, on a consideration of the ultimate theoretical load determined by scientific considerations, and on the other hand, on the experience of the proportion between the ultimate load and the working load that has been shown to be reasonably satisfactory as striking a proper balance between the economic advantage of maximum loading and the safety of an adequate margin. Of course, the width of this margin depends, in part, on the degree of accuracy to which the ultimate load is known and also on the degree of accuracy to which it is possible to work in practice, taking account of the human element and of unpredictables such as weather conditions.\nThree naval architects were heard as expert witnesses at the trial. Professor Baier and Gordon Snyder, for the appellant, and John G. German, for the defendant. Baier and German both submitted elaborate reports based on slightly different estimates of the various factors involved and, naturally, came to different conclusions on many points, specially on the degree of instability of the barge at the time the loading was stopped. This is not surprising seeing that, as German put it in his first report, his letter of March 8, 1963: \u201cVery slight variations to these basic assumptions can alter the critical angle by several degrees.\u201d When it is considered that the basic assumptions include such unascertainable factors as the permeability of chips to rain, it becomes obvious that the figures submitted by both experts can be considered as scientifically accurate only on the assumption that the data on which they are predicated also are accurate. It is abundantly clear that such is not the case, most data are only estimates made to an unstated degree of inaccuracy. For one thing, permeability to rain could not even be said to have been estimated, it was assumed; for another thing, the actual volume and disposition of the load could only be said to have been estimated to a fair degree of accuracy. When the evidence shows that the results of careful measurements of the volume of chip loads by the shipper and by the consignee were sometimes found to differ by as much as 2 per cent, some idea can be obtained of the possible margin of error when no measurements were taken and a highly irregularly shaped load was merely estimated.\nIt is obvious from what both experts have said that the margin of error in their computations was quite substantial. Their respective conclusions cannot be said to represent anything better than that which each of them judged to be most probable in the light of his knowledge of the facts, his estimate of various quantities and his assumptions of unknown or largely unknown facts. Near the end of his cross-examination, the following question was put to Snyder:\nThen you would agree that, no matter how far off-centre a steadily increasing load may be applied, causing the vessel to increasingly heel over, if loading were stopped when the vessel reached a three-foot heel she would still have a positive righting moment for the remainder of heel angle up to the point of deck edge immersion?\nHis answer was:\nThis is theoretically true. But we are dealing with margins here that are so small that you really can\u2019t count on what would happen.\nThen this witness was made to agree that making no other assumptions than a mean draft of 11 feet 6 inches, a trim of not more than 1 foot, a list of not more than 3 feet and floating freely in the water, one would have to go on adding load off-centre to cause the barge to heel further than 3 feet. However, it should be noted that weather conditions are carefully excluded from the above assumptions, as was pointed out when the last question was put to the witness.\nConcerning weather conditions, evidence was given by only one witness, Professor Baier. From his examination of one of the photographs taken by the witness Thompson while the barge was listing at an excessive angle before capsize, he estimated by the manner in which a flag was shown flowing, that there was a wind blowing across the barge towards the dock at force four, that is 20 m.p.h., and from this he deduced a resulting moment of 21 foot-tons. This evidence was not contradicted but, strangely enough, little attention seems to have been paid to it although Baier had explained that, with the void on the port side of the load, the wind pressure was sufficient to capsize the barge without the loading being carried beyond a 3-foot list.\nThe trial judge said that \u201cThe strong capsizing moment was created by the weight of that part of the load which was off-centre and high up on the starboard side coupled with the existence of a void aft on the port side.\u201d In other words \u201cthe load was built lopsided on the starboard side to such a degree that it tipped the barge over,\u2026\u201d. But he said:\nIn contrast to calculated and carefully planned loading instructions of such kind the only loading advice Tahsis received allowed Kovlaske to proceed with a haphazard system of fill it up, leaving voids, putting a large amount of the heaviest units on top and off centre due partly to inadequate loading facilities, and due largely to his landsman\u2019s ignorance of the inherent danger of doing so. It is true that he was advised by Captain Plester during the loading of barge \u201cVT 150\u201d not to allow the list on the barge to exceed three feet, but he was not advised or instructed of the danger of so doing or that a critical stage of loading might be reached when the inherent stability of the barge could be overcome in about eleven minutes. It is clear to me that such a critical stage of loading would never have been reached if adequate loading instructions had been given.\nOn that basis the trial judge held that the responsibility for the capsize was to be ascribed solely to the omission of adequate loading instructions. He paid scant attention to respondent\u2019s contention that the barge had become \u201chung up\u201d during loading. He merely said that there was \u201ca possibility\u201d that the winch lines \u201cmay have to some degree retarded the development of the list to starboard\u201d.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Davey J.A. was of opinion that:\nthere was an insufficient reserve of stability to permit the barges to be safely loaded eccentrically to a three-foot list. They were not fit to meet the perils of being loaded in that way, and so were not seaworthy, and I think there was a lack of due diligence on the part of the appellant to make them seaworthy, if its duty was not absolute.\nHowever, he said that this was not a cause of the casualty and that the capsize was due to lack of care by Kovlaske:\nEither Kovlaske was quite wrong in his estimate of the list, or the barge was hung up. If he had been watching her list during loading he would have known she was hung up because of lack of normal progression in the list, and done something about it.\nWhen this proposition is analysed, it becomes apparent in the first place that there is another possibility which is suggested by the evidence and completely overlooked by Davey J.A., namely that the wind started blowing towards the barge and, in its condition of very limited stability, increased the list by the few inches necessary to go beyond the point where it would be doomed to capsize, namely deck edge immersion.\nIn the second place, the result of this so-called dilemma is to have the appellant instead of the respondent bear the responsibility for appellant\u2019s failure to give instructions which would have ensured an adequate margin of stability during loading. In fact, the result is to say to appellant: \u201cIrrespective of the insufficiency of the margin of stability which respondent\u2019s instructions provide, you are under obligation to make up for such insufficiency by a high enough degree of care.\u201d In my opinion, this is contrary to the fundamental basis on which negligence is to be defined. It is not a failure to act in such a way as to prevent damage from occurring. It is a failure to act with reasonable care. What is reasonable care is to be determined not according to what will prevent the damage but according to what may properly be expected under the circumstances.\nRespondent\u2019s representatives knew that Kovlaske was the chip mill foreman; therefore, he could not be expected to supervise the loading continuously. They also knew that Kovlaske had been loading smaller barges (the V.T. 100 series) without being required to pay too much attention to the degree of list during loading. In the conditions under which these smaller barges were being loaded their margin of stability was much greater than that of the V.T. 151. It was more than adequate so that the allowable list during loading was not at all critical. Captain Plester completely misjudged the situation in this respect. He believed the V.T. 151 to have a greater instead of a much smaller margin of stability during loading.\nCounsel for the respondent sought to justify this by contending that if the V.T. 100 series had been operated with a smaller free-board than was in fact the case, their stability would have been no better than that of the V.T. 151. This reasoning is ill-founded for two reasons. Firstly, Captain Plester when he made that statement was specifically making the comparison on the basis of the same freeboard. Secondly, the only meaningful comparison was to be made under actual conditions of operation. This was the only basis of which Kovlaske could have any knowledge and it also was the only material basis as between respondent and appellant. Capt. Plester having given his instructions to Kovlaske under a complete misapprehension of the relative stability of the two series of barges, certainly did not say anything from which Kovlaske could have inferred that much greater care and closer supervision were necessary in loading the V.T. 151; the contrary is the obvious inference.\nIn his reasons for judgment Maclean J.A. says: \u201cIt is fair to assume, I think, that Captain Plester\u2019s evidence as to the instructions he gave to Kovlaske was accepted by the learned trial judge for\u2026 he said:\u201d Then follows a long quotation in which the trial judge appears at first to make a finding concerning the instructions given by Captain Plester to Kovlaske as related by Plester in chief at the trial:\nYou can go two to three feet to be quite safe, but you should not exceed three feet in any case.\nIn the end, however, the trial judge underlines what Captain Plester had stated in his examination on discovery:\nTry to keep the list during loading within two or three feet, not to go beyond three feet\u2026 that would be a little too severe when turning.\nOn the contrary, Maclean J.A. takes Plester\u2019s instructions as related at the trial and then stresses and underlines the words: \u201cin any case\u201d, instead of \u201cthat would be a little too severe when turning\u201d. With respect, I consider this as an error. The trial judge having heard Captain Plester in chief and in his cross-examination with respect to his version of his instructions given in his examination on discovery clearly adopted this latter version as correct. His finding certainly did not justify relying on the other version which was very different in its implications respecting a crucial point in this case, namely the degree of care to be taken in loading and the danger involved in exceeding the permissible list.\nIn his reasons for judgment, Maclean J.A. further says:\nNo doubt if Kovlaske himself had been present he would have noticed that although chips were pouring from the loading spout the list of the barge was not changing, which would have indicated that the barge was \u201chung up\u201d, that is, not floating free, and consequently that the freeboard measurements gave a false impression of the list of the barge.\nThere is absolutely no evidence that for any length of time during the loading the list of the barge was not changing. What was said by German was that the list was changing less than what he calculated should have been normal. This is quite a different thing. On what basis should a man like Kovlaske be expected to have knowledge of the normal rate of change of list of a barge when this involves such complex calculations as those made by Baier and German, which were beyond the competence of Capt. Plester and Capt. Brown?\nOn the basis of their stability calculations, both Baier and German expressed the opinion that the barge had become hung up, that is restrained from listing as far as it would have gone under the load if floating freely. No means of support other than the lines holding the barge to the dock are suggested in the evidence. It is clearly established that the lines known as the \u201cspring lines\u201d were slack. This is not surprising seeing that it appears that from 9:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. the water level rose due to the tide from 6 feet above low water level to 8 feet 6 inches. However, it is also established that the winch lines were taut.\nIt is very hard to see how the winch lines could have substantially restrained the list of the barge unless it was practically in unstable equilibrium as Snyder said it was. The fact is that the winch lines ran longitudinally along the dock to bollards near each end of the barge. These winch lines were used to move the barge along the dock and this obviously required that they run as nearly parallel to the dock as possible. In that condition, those steel cables could restrain the downward movement only to the extent of a fraction of their breaking strength of 23 tons. The evidence shows that the winch gave way when the barge capsized. One cable remained attached to the barge and had to be cut to permit the capsized barge to be towed away in order to clear the dock. With a single exception, all the men who were at work on or around the barge were heard as witnesses and none of them having said anything that might suggest such an occurrence, I consider it most unlikely that the winch lines or their supports suddenly gave way before the capsize. Baier put it in this way:\n\u2026you can\u2019t calculate the effect of the lines which are still holding and if they get held forever the boat will still be sitting there. If the lines let go, which again was an outside force, as was the wind an outside force\u2014there were three outside forces, your lordship, imposed on that ship which make any calculation a matter of simply assuming that free of those lines under the condition I assumed, she would still have a righting moment. Well, she didn\u2019t, which, agrees with the fact that she held up there a little bit until, as I remember Kovlaske\u2019s about 12:15 he came back and the after deck edge was under water and it makes no difference; she would have started capsizing earlier and she would ultimately have gone unless those lines could continuously hold her up. That is\u2014regardless of any assumptions necessary the facts to me indicate that she could not have been stable unless those lines were holding her up.\nAccording to Baier, the barge lost its positive stability even before the deck edge went under. His opinion that to a certain extent which he considered undefinable the barge was restrained by the winch lines, affords no basis for a finding of negligence against Kovlaske.\nIn final analysis, this finding in the Court below rests solely on the evidence of German on which Maclean J.A. mainly relied. It might be sufficient to say that when expert opinion is conflicting and there is no clear error on one side, a fact is not to be considered established by such opinion. However, in this case, there is a fact which in my view discredits German\u2019s opinion on this point. This is the drawing which German prepared in an attempt to show that when Kovlaske heard \u201ccreaking noises\u201d as he was stopping the loading, the barge had already listed a great deal more than the 3 feet which he estimated by visual inspection. On this drawing filed as Ex. 133, German shows the barge as separated from the dock by the floating fender logs, these logs being represented as floating between the fender of the barge and the fender piles of the dock. On that basis, German\u2019s drawing purports to show that the opposite side of the barge would have to be approximately 11 feet above the water for the cap of the chip box to touch the temporary support under the conveyor.\nThis was disproved by Beale who pointed out that because earlier in the day the barge had been listing the other way, the fender logs had then been under the barge\u2019s fender floating between the hull of the barge and the fender piles. Accordingly, on the plan which he made he assumed that the fender logs had remained in that position when the barge\u2019s fender reached water level. It is erroneous to assume, as German did, that the floating fender logs pushed the barge away from the dock 10 inches. To make this possible, the lines would have had to be slack. If, as German contends, the barge was hung up by the lines, then on account of the vertical angle between the bollards on the barge and the front of the dock, the barge must have been pressed very tightly against the dock. This shows that German\u2019s assumptions underlying Ex. 133 and his testimony respecting the list required for the cap of the chip box to touch the temporary supports under the conveyor, are irreconcilable with his theory that the barge was hung up by the winch lines. The correct position of the barge is clearly that shown by Beale\u2019s plan ex. 161. There the list at deck edge immersion is shown as 4 feet with the fender logs between the hull and the fender piles under the barge\u2019s fender and the cap of the chip box is just touching the temporary supports.\nOn the whole, I come to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal was wrong in finding that the capsize of the barge was due to appelant\u2019s negligence. On the contrary, I am of opinion that the unfortunate accident is due to the insufficient and imprudent loading instructions given by respondent\u2019s representatives.\nCaptain Plester admitted that when he instructed Beale and Kovlaske on the loading of the V.T. 150 and V.T. 151 he did not have all the information he needed for formulating written instructions to control the loading procedure. He explained:\nAfter all what we were trying to establish was the characteristics of the barge, both when loading and at sea, and you cannot go and issue a bunch of instructions until you are sure of what you are saying.\nBeing thus ignorant of the characteristics of the barge and, as we have seen, under a complete misapprehension of its relative stability, he nevertheless insisted on having full loads when the prudent thing to do would have been to load no higher than two feet less.\nIn my view, what is clearly established is that respondent took the risk of putting the barge in service without ascertaining its stability characteristics. Haphazard instructions were then verbally given and full loads required when appellant would rather not have loaded so heavily. This did not leave an adequate margin of safety and the result of so trying to establish the characteristics of the barge when loading was that it capsized. It is true that there was some minimal margin of safety and that theoretically the mishap might have been avoided, but this is not evidence of negligence because one cannot expect from the others more than reasonable care, not such extreme care as might avert the consequences of one\u2019s own negligence or lack of due diligence.\nI, therefore, conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia should be reversed and the judgment of the trial judge re-established with costs throughout against the respondent. SPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brothers Ritchie and Pigeon and I find it desirable to express some of my own views on this very complicated litigation. It will be unnecessary, however, for me to refer extensively to the evidence as both of my brethren have referred to or recited the portions thereof which are relevant to my consideration.\nWith respect, I adopt the view of Ritchie J. that the obligations of the appellant and respondent are fixed by the terms of the contract between the parties dated April 26, 1962, and that under the circumstances the bill of lading is merely a receipt. The particular terms of the said contract as to loading are as follows:\n7. Loading\n(a) All pulp chips shall be loaded and trimmed by Shipper solely at the expense of the Shipper, PROVIDED ALWAYS that Carrier shall bear any costs occasioned as a result of faulty equipment supplied by Carrier.\n(b) Scows shall be loaded and trimmed in accordance with loading instructions provided by Carrier to Shipper from time to time.\n(c) Loading shall be deemed to be completed when any loaded scow has been examined and accepted by the master of the tug.\n(d) Shipper shall load each scow to capacity with all reasonable despatch.\nIt is the view of my brother Ritchie that under the said clause 7 the respondent had a right to give instructions as to the loading of the scow but the respondent was under no duty to do so. Ritchie J. quotes Canadian Transport Co. Ltd. v. Court Line Ltd.[8] citing Lord Atkin at p. 937. The charterparty which governed the rights and liabilities of the shipper and owner in that case by clause 8 provided that \u201cthe charterers are to load, stow and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain\u2026\u201d. With respect, I am of the opinion that a decision under the circumstances in that case as to the proper meaning of those words is not applicable to the situation in the present case. It would appear to me that the words of clause 7(b) of the agreement in this case \u201cscows shall be loaded and trimmed in accordance with loading instructions provided by carrier to shipper from time to time\u201d imply a duty on the carrier to give such instructions to the shipper and not a mere right to give such instructions. It must be remembered that the V.T. 150 series of barges had never been used to load chips prior to the present contract and that no matter what experience in loading other vessels the superintendent of the appellant company had it was necessary in order for the shipper, the appellant, to carry out its contract to have proper loading instructions from the carrier, the respondent, applicable to the particular and unique type of vessel to be used in carrying out this particular contract. Even on Ritchie J.\u2019s view that clause 7 of the agreement between the parties gave the respondent a right to issue instructions as to loading but did not create a duty to do so, it must be noted that the respondent did issue instructions as to loading. As Ritchie J. states in his reasons, if the carrier does so, its instructions must be such as not to endanger the safety of the scow or cargo. I am of the opinion that even with this limited view of the respondent\u2019s responsibility it must be found to have been in breach of such responsibility. The present case does exhibit some of the exceptional features which were present in Standard Oil Co. of New York v. Clan Line Steamers Ltd.[9] and which are not present in the ordinary case of a vessel with well-established potential for receiving loads and carrying them being loaded by a shipper. In the Clan Line case, as Lord Merriman said in The \u201cHildina\u201d[10], at p. 258, this was a \u201cturret ship\u201d so that the water ballast had to be retained at all costs under all conditions, and the failure of the owner to pass on to the master such instructions permitted the master in the perfectly normal course of his duties to pump out that ballast so that the ship rolled over. In the present case, the design of the barges to take a load of and to carry such a large quantity of chips resulted in the scow being very \u201ctender\u201d during loading, and if the list reached three feet then very quickly the list would go beyond three feet, the heeling momentum would overcome the stabilizing momentum and the scow would capsize. It is true that the characteristic could only have been discovered by the careful measurement and calculation carried out by marine architects, which was done after the event which, in my view, should have been done before the event.\nAs Pigeon J. points out, the failure to carry out that careful investigation by marine architects in order to arrive at exact loading instructions caused the respondent to rely on advice given by Captain Brown, the principal surveyor for the Marine Surveyors of Western Canada, whose advice given to Captain Plester, the officer of the respondent, was passed on by him to the superintendent for the appellant and to the actual foreman in charge of the loading, Kovlaske. Captain Brown, no matter what his practical qualifications were, was certainly not a marine architect and was quite incapable of carrying out the complicated engineering calculations made prior to the trial, but of course after the disaster, by Mr. German and Professor Baier. His advice as to loading, which in short was not to permit a list of more than three feet, did allow loading up to the exact point where disaster would occur if the list went even a little bit beyond the three-foot limit. In other words, as Pigeon J. points out, there was no margin for safety whatsoever, and there being no margin for safety the instructions were not proper in that they were not practical. There must always be a margin for safety in any operation entailing the acts of human beings or subject to being affected by outside causes.\nIt is true that on the five previous occasions this scow or its fellow had been loaded with no more than a three-foot list and disaster had not occurred. It is also true that for five hours on the previous weekend this barge had stood with a three-foot list and had not capsized; but on none of those occasions had the list exceeded three feet and on none of those occasions had such extraneous forces as wind appeared to upset the hazardous balance of the scow. In my view, those circumstances simply show that the loadings were lucky on the previous occasions and the luck ran out on the occasion when the capsizing occurred. It is Pigeon J.\u2019s opinion that the springing up of a wind of considerable force may well have contributed to the disaster but my brother does not find it necessary to so find nor do I do so. The loading instructions were not practical because they permitted listing up to the very maximum and, therefore, subjected the safety of the scow and its cargo to any extraneous danger.\nRitchie J. points out that the scows were approved by a representative of Marine Surveyors of Western Canada in accordance with the provisions of clause 3(a). With respect, in my view, that is not relevant to the problem concerned with the discharge of what I have found to be the respondent\u2019s duty to issue proper instructions under clause 7(b). I am in accord with the view of Pigeon J. that it was the breach of that duty which created the occasion for the capsize of the scow and that, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs and trial judgment restored, ABBOTT and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bull, Houser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Russell & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1967), 60 W.W.R. 65, 62 D.L.R.

Respondent.\n1968: February 19, 20; 1968: October 1.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nLabour relations\u2014Certification of appellant union as bargaining agent\u2014Error of law by Board of Industrial Relations on face of record\u2014Application by way of certiorari to quash certificate\u2014The Alberta Labour Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 167.\nAn application was made to the Alberta Board of Industrial Relations to secure certification of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association, Local 414, as bargaining agent for a unit of employees of the respondent company. After a hearing before the Board it certified, not the applicant, but the appellant union, as bargaining agent for the unit in question. Objection was taken by the respondent before the Board to certification because, inter alia, none of the employees in the proposed unit was properly eligible for membership in the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association in view of the definition of the trade jurisdiction of that union, contained in its constitution. An application, by way of certiorari, to quash the certificate issued by the Board was refused by the trial Judge. The respondent\u2019s appeal from the trial Judge\u2019s decision was allowed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The Board and the appellant union then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was no privative section in The Alberta Labour Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 167, giving to the Board exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions of fact and law and prohibiting removal of proceedings into any Court by certiorari. A review of the proceedings of an administrative Board by way of certiorari could be made, not only, on a question of jurisdiction, but also in respect of an error of law on the face of the record, even though the error did not go to jurisdiction.\nIn the instant case there had been an error of law. The Act contemplated that a trade union, to be a proper bargaining agent, must be one whose objects and membership requirements are in harmony with the interests of the employees in the proposed unit and which permit them to become members of it. Where the Board erred was in construing the constitution of the applicant union as permitting its general president to authorize the international organizer to organize a local union, i.e., the appellant union, to take in classes of workers not included in the general classification defined in the constitution of the applicant union.\nAccordingly, there having been an error of law by the Board, which error appeared on the face of the record, the certification order could be quashed.\n[R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, Ex p. Shaw, [1951] 1 K.B. 711, affirmed [1952] 1 K.B. 338, applied; Baldwin & Francis Ltd. v. Patents Appeal Tribunal, [1959] A.C. 663; R. v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd., [1922] 2 A.C. 128, referred to.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Dechene J., dismissing an application by way of certiorari to quash a certificate of the Alberta Board of Industrial Relations. Appeal dismissed.\nW.S. Ross, Q.C., and D.A. Stewart, for the appellants.\nJohn C. Prowse and William A. Wiese, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1 which allowed the respondent\u2019s appeal from the decision of the learned trial judge, who had refused the respondent\u2019s application, by way of certiorari, to quash a certificate of the Alberta Board of Industrial Relations issued on August 10, 1965. The certificate certified the appellant, Sheet Metal Auto Body, Motor Mechanics, and Allied Production Workers, Local No. 414, Edmonton, Alberta (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe appellant union\u201d), as bargaining agent for a unit of employees of the respondent comprising \u201cAll employees of the Company with the exception of office workers, salesmen and supervisory personnel.\u201d The judgment of the Appellate Division quashed this certification.\nThe facts are not in dispute. An application was made in June, 1965, to the Board of Industrial Relations (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Board\u201d) to secure certification of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association, Local 414, as bargaining agent for the employees of the respond- ent in the unit above described. After a hearing before the Board it certified, not the applicant, but the appellant union, as bargaining agent for that unit. Objection, was taken by the respondent before the Board to certification because, inter alia, none of the employees in the proposed unit was properly eligible for membership in the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association, in view of the definition of the trade jurisdiction of that union, contained in its constitution.\nSection 105 of The Alberta Labour Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 167, requires each trade union and each branch or local of a trade union to file with the Minister of Industries and Labour a duly certified copy of its constitution, rules and by-laws.\nSection 55(1)(b) defines a \u201cbargaining agent\u201d as a trade union that acts on behalf of employees in collective bargaining, or as a party to a collective agreement with their employer.\nSection 55(1)(j) defines a trade union as meaning\nan organization of employees formed for the purpose of regulating relations between employers and employees which has a written constitution, rules or by-laws setting forth its objects and purposes and defining the conditions under which persons may be admitted as members thereof and continue in such membership.\nSection 61 requires the Board, upon receipt of an application for certification of a bargaining agent, to inquire into whether the trade union that claims to have been selected by a majority of the employees in a unit is a proper bargaining agent.\nSection 63 of the Act provides as follows:\n63. If the Board is satisfied\n(a) that the applicant for certification as a bargaining agent is a proper bargaining agent,\n(b) that the unit of employees is an appropriate unit for collective bargaining, and\n(c) that a majority of the employees in the unit have selected the applicant to be a bargaining agent on behalf of the employees of the unit\n(i) by membership in good standing according to the constitution and by-laws of the applicant or by having applied for membership and by having paid the initiation fee required by the constitution and by-laws of the applicant on or not longer than three months before the date of the application for certification was made, or (ii) by the result of a vote conducted or supervised by the Board, of those who were employees in the unit on the date the application was made or such other date as may be fixed by the Board,\nthe Board shall certify the applicant to be a bargaining agent on behalf of the employees in the unit, but if the Board is not satisfied in respect of any of the matters set out in clauses (a) to (c) the Board shall refuse to certify the applicant.\nThe return filed by the Board to the certiorari proceedings, in compliance with Rule 865 of the Alberta Rules of Court, which requires the return to include all papers or documents touching the matter, included the minutes of its own meetings, the Constitution and Ritual of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association and Affiliated Local Unions, its certificate certifying the appellant union as bargaining agent and its reasons for decision in the case of the appellant and Turnbull Motors Ltd., which dealt with the same issue as had been raised in the present proceedings and which, in substance, represented the reasons for its decision in the present case.\nDealing with the issue raised by the respondent that the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association, the union which was the applicant for certification before the Board, had no jurisdiction to accept the employees in the unit as members, because they were all mechanics and not body repair men, the learned trial judge said this:\nIn dealing with the question raised in the first ground of objection the return to the certiorari proceedings contains the reasons for decisions delivered by the Board in a previous application by the same Union in which it dealt with the employees of Turnbull Motors Limited, Edmonton, Alberta, and which contained the following paragraphs:\n\u201cDealing with the question of jurisdiction, counsel for the respondent stated that in so far as he had been able to ascertain, the only reference to automobiles in the trade jurisdiction appeared in Article 1, Section 5(s) as follows:\n\u201cAny and all types of sheet metal work and coppersmith work in connection with or incidental to the manufacture, fabrication, assembling, maintenance and repair of automobiles, airplanes, pontoons, dirigibles, blimps and other types of air craft and equipment, and all types of aircraft hangars.\u201d\nThe representatives of the applicant referred the Board to Article 3, Section 1, which reads in part as follows:\n\u201cThe General President shall preside at all meetings and Conventions of this Association and at meetings of the General Executive Council. He shall preserve order and in all cases where the vote is equally divided in a Convention or meeting of the General Executive Council he shall cast the deciding vote. He shall enforce all laws of the Association, decide all questions of order and usage, interpret and decide all points of law and controversies and decide all constitutional questions.\u201d\nHe also referred to Article 3, Section 2(g) which reads in part as follows:\n\u201cThe General President shall have full authority to specify, designate or change the specific territory and classes of work over which each local union or district council shall exercise jurisdiction, to organize and charter additional local unions or district councils in accordance with this Constitution and to determine the specific territory and classes of work over which newly chartered locals or district councils shall have jurisdiction \u2026\u201d\nHe submitted that in view of the authority granted the General President that officer had the discretion to allocate jurisdiction to a local union covering the classifications of work falling within the jurisdiction of the applicant. The representatives also advised the Board that at the 1962 International Convention, representations were made to the Constitution Law Committee to include in Article 1, Section 5(s) of the constitution mechanics and it was the decision of that committee, upheld on the convention floor, that it was not necessary to amend that portion because it was provided for in the general part of the constitution. He also submitted that since 1956 locals of the applicant have been organizing on a production basis, industrial basis and on the basis of plant maintenance.\u201d\nThat decision refers to a letter from the General President of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association to Mr. Raymond A. Gall, International Organizer at Edmonton, dated 29 January, 1965, which is stated to be applicable to the present case, and which reads as follows:\n\u201cPlease be advised that you have my permission under Article 10, Section 2(e) of the International Association\u2019s Constitution to organize Auto Body Workers, Motor Mechanics and other Allied Production Workers in the Province of Alberta, and that all such persons are eligible for membership upon application and the payment of the initiation fee which, pursuant to the said section, is hereby set at $1.00.\u201d\nI am of the opinion, with respect, that the Board\u2019s decision is wrong. The General President\u2019s authority to \u201cInterpret and decide all points of law and controversies and decide all constitutional questions\u201d (see Article 3, Section 1 of the Union\u2019s Constitution above cited), cannot reasonably be wide enough to include an altogether different class of workers than that which is originally covered by the Constitution. There can often be difficult questions arising from the interpretation of a Constitution such as this and it is probably wise that an officer be given the right to decide. But to allow that officer to extend the classes of employees, renders the Constitution itself useless. It removes all meaning from the provisions of Section 55(1)(j) of The Alberta Labour Act, which defines a \u201ctrade union\u201d as an organization having a written constitution and from Section 105 of the Act which requires the constitution to be filed with the Minister of Labour.\nThe applicant\u2019s affidavit shows that it does not have a single employee who could be classified within the terms of the Union\u2019s written constitution. The authority given to the General President by Article 3, Section 2(g) supra, \u201cto specify, designate or change the specific territory and classes of work over which each local union or district council shall exercise jurisdiction\u201d, must, I believe be subject to the ejusdem generis rule. He may designate and alter territorial jurisdiction, and vary the classes of workers which local unions may include in their organization, but, in the view I take, he cannot extend the classes of workers to some who are not included in the general classifications listed in Article 1, Section 5(s) of the Constitution which is cited above in full.\nIf, therefore, this were an appeal and I was to substitute my judgment for that of the Board, I would find in favour of the applicant.\nReference should also be made to the following paragraph in the Board\u2019s reasons:\nIt was the opinion of the Board that in view of the authority vested in the General President under Article 3, Section 2(g) that officer did not exceed his powers in issuing the charter to the applicant and allocating the jurisdiction as set out in his letter of January 29, 1965, quoted above.\nThe learned trial judge went on to say that as this was an application by way of certiorari it must rest on lack of jurisdiction, breach of natural justice or an error on the face of the record. In concluding that certiorari would not lie he took the view that if the Board had erred it was in respect of a finding of fact, apparently as to the question of whether a majority of the employees in the unit had selected the appellant union as the bargaining agent, and he appears to have decided that the application for membership in the appellant union by a majority of the employees was sufficient for the purposes of s. 63(c)(i) whether or not they could obtain membership in the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association under the provisions of its constitution. He does not refer to the requirement of s. 63(a) as to the Board being satisfied that the applicant for certification is a proper bargaining agent.\nThe Appellate Division agreed with the view expressed by the learned trial judge that the Board\u2019s decision as to the interpretation of the union\u2019s constitution was wrong and also held that, on the record, the Board had erred in law in giving to the word \u201cproper\u201d, in s. 63(a), a meaning which it would not bear, and the Board order was, accordingly, quashed.\nThe appellants, before this Court, did not seriously dispute the conclusion of law reached by both the Courts below in respect of the interpretation of the union\u2019s constitution. Their position was that the error in law by the Board would not warrant the quashing of its order because it did not relate to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. In the present case, it was said, the Board\u2019s decision was in respect of a matter specifically referred to it by the statute and it could not be disturbed because, in reaching it, there had been an error of law.\nI am not in agreement with this submission. The Alberta Labour Act does not contain a privative section, such as that contained in the British Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C., c. 370, s. 76(1), referred to in the judgment of this Court in Farrell v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board[2], giving to the Board exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions of fact and law and prohibiting removal of proceedings into any Court by certiorari. The question, in this case, is as to the extent to which the proceedings of an administrative Board may be reviewed by way of certiorari.\nIn my opinion, such a review can be made, not only on a question of jurisdiction, but in respect of an error of law on the face of the record. That certiorari would issue to quash the decision of a statutory administrative tribunal for an error of law on the face of the record, although the error did not go to jurisdiction, was clearly stated in R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, Ex p. Shaw[3]. That case was referred to by Kerwin J. (as he then was) in Toronto Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Company[4].\nIn Baldwin & Francis Ltd. v. Patents Appeal Tribunal[5], Lord Reid said, at p. 683:\nProcedure by way of certiorari is available both where there has been \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d (which is not a very adequate description) and where error of law appears on the face of the record.\nIn the Northumberland case the Court applied, in respect of a decision of an administrative tribunal, what had been stated in the Privy Council by Lord Sumner in R. v. Nat Bell Liquors, Limited[6].\nAt p. 154, Lord Sumner said:\nThere is no reason to suppose that, if there were any difference in the rules as to the examination of the evidence below on certiorari before a superior Court, it would be a difference in favour of examining it in criminal matters, when it would not be examined in civil matters, but, truly speaking, the whole theory of certiorari shows that no such difference exists. The object is to examine the proceedings in the inferior Court to see whether its order has been made within its jurisdiction. If that is the whole object, there can be no difference for this purpose between civil orders and criminal convictions, except in so far as differences in the form of the record of the inferior Court\u2019s determination or in the statute law relating to the matter may give an opportunity for detecting error on the record in one case, which in another would not have been apparent to the superior Court, and therefore would not have been available as a reason for quashing the proceedings. In this connection, reliance was placed on a passage in the opinion of Lord Cairns in Walsall Overseers v. London and North Western Ry. Co. (1878) 4 App. Cas. 30, 39. The question for decision there was simply whether or not the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from an order of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, discharging a rule nisi for a certiorari to quash an order of Quarter Sessions in a rating matter. Lord Cairns, speaking of certiorari generally, said: \u201cIf there was upon the face of the order of the Court of Quarter Sessions anything which showed that that order was erroneous, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench might be asked to have the order brought into it, and to look at the order, and view it upon the face of it, and if the Court found error upon the face of it, to put an end to its existence by quashing it.\u201d He then turned to the kind of order under discussion, and after stating how much in that matter, both of fact and of law, the Sessions were bound to set out on the face of their order, he proceeded to point out that the statement of what had led to the decision of the Court made the order \u201cnot an unspeaking or unintelligible order,\u201d but a speaking one, and an order which on certiorari could be criticised as one which told its own story, and which for error could accordingly be quashed.\nAt p. 156, dealing with the jurisdiction of the superior Court to review the decision of an inferior Court, he said:\nThat supervision goes to two points: one is the area of the inferior jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course of its exercise.\nI agree with the Court below in holding that there was, in this case, an error of law. A trade union, which seeks to be certified as a bargaining agent, must have a written constitution, rules or by-laws which, in addition to setting forth its objects, defines the conditions under which persons may be admitted and continue as members (s. 55(1)(j)). In my opinion, when that provision is read along with ss. 61(a) and 63, the Act contemplates that a trade union, to be a proper bargaining agent, must be one whose objects and membership requirements are in harmony with the interests of the employees in the proposed unit and which permit them to become members of it.\nI do not accept the submission of the appellants that, when s. 63(c) (i) was amended, in 1964, to speak of \u201cmem- bership in good standing according to the constitution and by-laws of the applicant or by having applied for membership \u2026\u201d, this contemplated that an application for membership in a union whose constitution prevented membership being granted would be a sufficient compliance with that paragraph.\nThe Board was quite properly concerned, in this case, with the matter of the employees\u2019 right to membership in the union which had applied for certification. Where it erred was in construing the constitution of the applicant union as permitting its General President to authorize the international organizer to organize a local union, i.e., the appellant union, to take in classes of workers not included in the general classification defined in the constitution of the applicant union. In the result, it certified as a bargaining agent, not the union which had applied, but a local union which purported to have been created by the international organizer of the applicant union by authorization of its General President.\nThere having been an error of law by the Board, was it on the face of the record? The return, in compliance with the Rules of Court, included the reasons of the Board in the case of Turnbull Motors Ltd., which had raised the same issue as in the present case. This was properly filed by the Board, and thereby it stated the reasons which had led it to grant a certificate in the present case. In my opinion, this made the Board\u2019s certificate, to quote Lord Sumner again, \u201c\u2018not an unspeaking or unintelligible order,\u2019 but a speaking one and an order which on certiorari could be criticised as one which told its own story, and which for error could accordingly be quashed\u201d.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Ross, McLennan & Ross, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Prowse & Wiese, Edmonton.\n[1] (1967), 59 W.W.R. 269, 61 D.L.R.

Action was initially commenced by the respondent against the other three parties to the agreement for a declaration as to the proper interpretation of the clauses in question, but a settlement was effected by the respondent with the other two parties, before trial.\nThe parties other than the respondent agreed to deliver acid gas to the respondent\u2019s plant, retaining for themselves the other products of the gas which they produced. The respondent agreed to pay the other parties, for the acid gas which they delivered to it, a price to be determined by multiplying the number of long tons of sulphur produced by the respondent from such acid gas by a price, per long ton of sulphur, established in the manner provided in the agreement. It was the interpretation of an amended sub-clause of the payment clause of the agreement which was in dispute, and the question in issue was as to the meaning in its context, of the word \u201cinterest\u201d. The meaning of that word was in dispute in respect of the application of the clause to certain factual situations.\nAn appeal, by leave of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, pursuant to s. 39 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, was brought from the judgment of the trial judge to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe word \u201cinterest\u201d, as used in the amended clause of the agreement, was not limited in its meaning to a proprietary interest, but included a pecuniary interest. Where sales of sulphur were made by a company with which both the appellant and the respondent (and others) had entered into gas sales contracts, and where part of the money received by each owner contracting with the company was paid on the basis of the sulphur derived from its gas, all sales made by that company would properly be included in making the required price computation.\nIn the case of a plant in which one or more of the parties were joint owners with others, and therefore had an interest in the plant and a right to receive sulphur therefrom out of the common inventory, all sales from that plant should be considered in applying the price computation provisions of the agreement. APPEAL from a judgment of Milvain J., now C.J.T.D., Supreme Court of Alberta, interpreting the language of a contract for the sale of natural gas. Appeal dismissed.\nW.A. McGillivray, Q.C., and E.D.D. Tavender, for the appellant.\nD.P. McLaws, Q.C., and R.S. Dinkel, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This appeal, by leave of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, pursuant to s. 39 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, is brought from the judgment of the learned trial judge in these proceedings. Such an appeal lies only in respect of a question of law. The legal issue involved in this case is as to the proper interpretation of the provisions contained in an agreement dated January 1, 1962, and amended on January 1, 1965, to which the appellant and the respondent were parties, governing the method of determination of the price to be paid by the respondent to the appellant and two other companies for acid gas delivered by them to the respondent at the \u201cWest Whitecourt plant\u201d near Whitecourt, Alberta. The two other parties to the agreement were Pan American Petroleum Limited and Hudson\u2019s Bay Oil and Gas Company Limited.\nThe action was initially commenced by the respondent against the other three parties to the agreement for a declaration as to the proper interpretation of the clauses in question, but a settlement was effected by the respondent with the other two parties, before trial.\nThe three parties to the agreement, other than the respondent, who are referred to in the agreement as \u201cWest Whitecourt Owners\u201d, built the West Whitecourt plant to treat acid gas which they were producing. Among the products of the plant is sulphur. Under the agreement the West Whitecourt Owners conveyed to the respondent, for a stated consideration, that part of the plant which produced sulphur.\nThe West Whitecourt Owners agreed to deliver acid gas to the respondent\u2019s plant, retaining for themselves the other products of the gas which they produced. The respondent agreed to pay the West Whitecourt Owners, for the acid gas which they delivered to it, a price to be determined by multiplying the number of long tons of sulphur produced by the respondent from such acid gas by a price, per long ton of sulphur, established in the manner provided in the agreement, which was as follows:\n9. PAYMENT\nSubject to the provisions of Clause 10 hereof, Texas Gulf shall make payment to Pan American on behalf of the West Whitecourt Owners for all acid gas delivered hereunder, the amount of such payment to be determined by multiplying the number of Long Tons of sulphur produced at the Sulphur Plant from the said acid gas by the prices per Long Ton for such sulphur established in accordance with the following terms and provisions:\n(1) At the beginning of each calendar year Texas Gulf shall estimate a reasonable F.O.B. Price which may be expected for sulphur sold from plants in the Province of Alberta during such calendar year, having regard for the F.O.B. Price at which sulphur was sold from plants in the Province of Alberta during the preceding calendar year.\n(2) On the basis of the aforesaid estimated F.O.B. Price, Texas Gulf shall, within twenty (20) days following the end of each calendar month, make payment for acid gas delivered during such calendar month, in Canadian currency, in accordance with the following scale:\nWhen the estimated F.O.B. Price is within the range of:\nAmount payable for acid gas expressed as a price per Long Ton for sulphur produced therefrom shall be:\n$ 0 to $ 5.00......................................................\n$1.00\n$ 5.01 to $ 8.00................................................\n$1.00 plus 100% of the amount by which F.O.B. Price exceeds $5.00.\n$ 8.01 to $ 9.00................................................\n$4.00 plus 50% of the amount by which F.O.B. Price exceeds $8.00.\n$ 9.01 to $13.50...............................................\n$4.50\n$13.51 or more.................................................\n$4.50 plus 50% of the amount by which F.O.B. Price exceeds $13.50.\n(3) At the end of each calendar year Texas Gulf shall determine the actual F.O.B. Price for the preceding calendar year which shall be the greater of:\n(a) the weighted average F.O.B. Price at the Sulphur Plant received by Texas Gulf for sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant during such calendar year, or\n(b) the weighted average F.O.B. Price received for all sulphur sold from plants in the Province of Alberta during such calendar year, exclusive of sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant, in which sulphur the parties hereto, or any of them, have an interest and which price can be verified from actual statements from the sellers of such sulphur. It is agreed, however, that for the purpose of determining the weighted average sales price pursuant to this Clause 9(3) (b) the quantity of sulphur sold by Texas Gulf from plants in the Province of Alberta in which sulphur Texas Gulf has an interest, exclusive of the Sulphur Plant, shall be a maximum of Fifty (50%) percent of the total sulphur sales under consideration or Fifty Thousand (50,000) Long Tons, whichever is the greater,\nand immediately following such determination shall calculate the difference, if any, in the payments which would have been made to Pan American on behalf of the West Whitecourt Owners for acid gas delivered during such preceding calendar year if this actual F.O.B. Price had been substituted for the estimated F.O.B. Price in the schedule set forth in Clause 9(2) hereof, and the parties hereto shall make settlement for any such difference within thirty (30) days of the determination thereof.\n(4) Texas Gulf shall, if requested so to do by the West Whitecourt Owners, verify the price received by Texas Gulf for sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant by Statutory Declarations made by virtue of The Canada Evidence Act.\nUnder the original agreement, the West Whitecourt Owners had an option to purchase 50 per cent of the sulphur produced at the West Whitecourt plant at the price set out in cl. 9(3) (a).\nThe agreement was amended by the agreement of January 1, 1965. The option to purchase, just mentioned, was eliminated, and cl. 9(3) was amended, so as to read as follows:\n(3) At the end of each calendar year Texas Gulf shall determine the actual F.O.B. Price for the preceding calendar year which shall be the greatest of:\n(a) the weighted average F.O.B. Price at the Sulphur Plant received by Texas Gulf for sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant during such calendar year, or\n(b) the weighted average F.O.B. Price received for sulphur sold from plants in the Province of Alberta during such calendar year, exclusive of sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant, in which sulphur the parties hereto, or any of them, have an interest and which price can be verified from actual statements from the sellers of such sulphur. It is agreed, however, that for the purpose of determining the weighted average sales price pursuant to this Article 9(3) (b) the quantity of sulphur sold by Texas Gulf from plants in the Province of Alberta in which sulphur Texas Gulf has an interest, exclusive of the Sulphur Plant, shall be a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the total sulphur sales under consideration or fifty thousand (50,000) Long Tons, whichever is the greater, or\n(c) the weighted average F.O.B. Price received for sulphur sold during such calendar year from EXISTING PLANTS in the Province of Alberta, exclusive of sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant, in which sulphur the West Whitecourt Owners, or any of them, have an interest and which price can be verified from actual statements from the sellers of such sulphur. It is agreed that the term \u201cEXISTING PLANTS\u201d, as used in this Article 9(3) (c), hereof, shall be limited to include only plants in the Province of Alberta in existence on the 1st day of January, 1965 which have actually produced sulphur prior to that date,\nand immediately following such determination Texas Gulf shall calculate the difference, if any, in the payments which would have been made to Pan American on behalf of the West Whitecourt Owners for acid gas delivered during such preceding calendar year if this actual F.O.B. Price had been substituted for the estimated F.O.B. Price in the schedule set forth in Article 9(2) hereof, and the parties hereto shall make settlement for any such difference within thirty (30) days of the determination thereof.\nIt is the interpretation of the amended cl. 9(3) which is in dispute in these proceedings, and the question in issue is as to the meaning, in its context, of the word \u201cinterest\u201d. The meaning of that word is in dispute in respect of the application of the clause to three factual situations.\nThe first of these relates to sulphur produced and sold by Petrogas Processing Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cPetrogas\u201d). This company was incorporated to construct and operate a gas processing plant, located near Calgary. It entered into contracts, identical in form, with most of the owners of natural gas in what is known as the East Calgary Field. Under the terms of the contract, the owner agreed to sell gas to Petrogas, which agreed to pay for it from the proceeds which it received from the sale of the plant products, one of which is sulphur. Each owner receives his proportion of the total sale proceeds, as computed under the terms of the agreement, less applicable processing charges, in the determination of which Petrogas is entitled to show only a nominal profit.\nEach owner of gas contracting for its sale to Petrogas is entitled to become a shareholder of Petrogas, the size of the share holding being determined on a proportionate basis. In essence, Petrogas provided a convenient vehicle for the disposition of their natural gas by owners in the East Calgary Field. Both the appellant and the respondent had entered into sales contracts with Petrogas and owned shares in it. The sales agreement provided, with respect to sulphur, that:\nThe value of elemental sulphur shall be the average sales price per long ton actually received in cash in each month by Buyer (Petrogas) F.O.B. the Plant.\nThe value of the sulphur ascribed to each owner and sold by Petrogas is an element in determining the price for gas to be paid to such owner.\nIt is the contention of the respondent that, in applying the formula provided in paras. (b) and (c) of the amended cl. 9(3), the price received for all sulphur sold by Petrogas in any calendar year is to be taken into account in determining the weighted average F.O.B. price. The appellant contends that the price received by Petrogas from sulphur sold by it cannot be taken into account because neither the appellant nor the respondent has any \u201cinterest\u201d in such sulphur. It takes the position that \u201cinterest\u201d means a proprietary interest. The respondent submits that the word, as used in this agreement, was intended to have a broad application and would include, not only a proprietary, but also a pecuniary interest.\nThe appellant has cited a number of authorities, which deal with the meaning of the term, but none of these is a precedent. Rather they are illustrations of the application of the word in various factual circumstances.\nReliance is placed on Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co. Ltd.[1] This case is authority for the proposition that neither a shareholder nor a creditor of a company has an insurable interest in any of its assets. It holds that no shareholder has any property right in any item of property owned by the company. This, of course, merely reaffirms the fact that the company is a legal entity, separate and apart from its shareholders.\nOn the other hand, in City of London Electric Lighting Co. Ltd. v. Mayor, &c., of London[2], the House of Lords had to consider the application of a statutory provision which prohibited a commissioner or a member of the Court of Aldermen or of the Common Council of the City from being directly or indirectly interested in any contract made by the Commissioners of Sewers. It was held that a contract with a company, in which any of the commissioners, members of the Court of Aldermen or of the Common Council were shareholders, would be within this provision and would be null and void.\nThe appellant cited Smith v. Hancock[3], which held, on the facts of that case, that the defendant was not interested in a business operated by his wife and nephew so as to be in breach of a covenant in an agreement made by the defendant with the plaintiff, that the defendant, within a specified area, would not carry on or be in anywise interested in any similar business to that described in the agreement, which the defendant had sold to the plaintiff. What the defendant had done was to introduce his wife to his bankers, assist her in obtaining a lease of a shop in her name, introduced the nephew to wholesale suppliers who had supplied the old business and to write, for his wife, who was prevented by a physical infirmity from writing, a circular inviting \u201cold friends\u201d to come to the shop. The defendant put no money into the business and took no share in its profits.\nAt p. 386, Lindley L.J. says this:\nWhen a person sells a business and agrees not to carry on, or be in any way interested in, any similar business, the word \u201cinterested\u201d is used to prevent him, not only from carrying it on, but also from having any proprietary or pecuniary interest in it.\nSimilarly, in Gophir Diamond Co. v. Wood[4], it was held that a covenant not to become directly or indirectly interested in a similar business did not prevent the defendant from becoming an employee in such a business at a fixed salary. It was, however, stated that if the defendant\u2019s remuneration had in any way depended on the profits or gross returns of the business he would have been interested in it.\nIn my opinion, an interest may, in certain circumstances, consist of a pecuniary interest as distinct from a proprietary interest. The meaning of the word, in any specific agreement, must be ascertained in the context in which it appears. In considering this issue, it is desirable to refer to the whole of cl. 9 of the agreement, and not only to the portion of it which was amended by the second agreement. Under this clause, the respondent agrees to pay the West Whitecourt Owners, not for sulphur, but for \u201call acid gas delivered hereunder\u201d. The respondent is obligated to pay for such gas whether or not the sulphur produced from it by the respondent is sold or not. The provisions of the clause dealing with the price of sulphur relate only to the method for determination of the price to be paid for acid gas. Such price is determined by multiplying the number of long tons of sulphur produced by the respondent by a price per ton determined under the clause.\nThe initial payments to the West Whitecourt Owners are determined on the basis of an estimate by the respondent, at the beginning of the calendar year, of a reasonable F.O.B. price to be expected for sulphur sold from plants in the Province of Alberta having regard to the F.O.B. price for which sulphur was sold from plants in that province during the previous year (cl. 9(1)).\nThe final price is to be ascertained at the end of the year, as the highest of three prices as determined by three methods of computation. The first, described in para. (a) of cl. 9(3), is the actual selling price of sulphur produced at the West Whitecourt plant.\nThe second, described in para. (b), is based on the sale price of all sulphur sold from plants in Alberta, exclusive of the West Whitecourt plant, and is thus somewhat similar to the provisions of cl. 9(1), but it contains the restriction which limits \u201call sulphur sold from plants in the Province of Alberta\u201d by the words \u201cin which sulphur the parties hereto or any of them have an interest\u201d.\nThe third, described in para. (c), is essentially the same as para. (b), but the restrictive words refer to sulphur in which the West Whitecourt Owners, or any of them (and not the respondent) have an interest, and it is limited to \u201cexisting plants\u201d, as defined.\nIf the provisions of para. (b) had been intended to be limited to sales from plants in Alberta, exclusive of the Whitecourt plant, of sulphur actually owned by any of the parties, the wording used appears to be unnecessarily cumbersome. The paragraph, to achieve that object, could have read:\nThe weighted average F.O.B. price received for all sulphur sold by any of the parties hereto from plants in the Province of Alberta, exclusive of sulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant.\nBut the paragraph does not say this. Its terms are broader in their scope. It is significant that it contains the provision which reads: \u201cwhich price can be verified from actual statements from the sellers of such sulphur\u201d. (The italicizing is my own.) This obviously indicates that the paragraph is applicable to sales of sulphur made by parties other than the parties to the agreement. The parties to the agreement are described, in the very same sentence, as \u201cthe parties hereto\u201d, and, quite clearly, verification of their sales prices could be required as a term of the agreement. But verification of the sale price of sulphur sold by a third party would depend on his willingness to provide a statement.\nFurthermore, when we come to para. (c), which refers to sulphur in which \u201cthe West Whitecourt Owners or any of them have an interest\u201d, there is the specific exclusion therefrom of \u201csulphur sold from the Sulphur Plant\u201d. Clearly the West Whitecourt Owners have no proprietary interest in sulphur produced from that plant and, therefore, if the word \u201cinterest\u201d, in para. (c), meant a proprietary interest, no such exclusion would be necessary. That sulphur is produced by the respondent from the acid gas sold and delivered to it by the West Whitecourt Owners and is the property solely of the respondent. But the West Whitecourt Owners do have a pecuniary interest in that sulphur in that its sale, by the respondent, may determine, under para. (a), the price which they receive for their acid gas.\nIn my opinion, the word \u201cinterest\u201d, as used in paras. (b) and (c), is not limited in its meaning to a proprietary interest, but includes a pecuniary interest.\nMy understanding of the meaning of para. (b) is that, in making the computation contemplated by it, one is to take into account, in each calendar year, the prices received on all sales of sulphur from those sulphur plants in Alberta from which sulphur, in which any party to the agreement has some proprietary or pecuniary interest, has been sold. The paragraph does not stipulate that such interest must exist at the time a particular sale is actually effected. All that is required is that the plant in question be one from which sales are made of sulphur in which the party to the agreement has an interest.\nI should add that the words \u201cand which price can be verified from actual statements from the sellers of such sulphur\u201d restrict the computation made under para. (b) to prices received from sales made by sellers who are prepared to give actual statements so as to verify the prices obtained.\nTurning now to the sales of sulphur made by Petrogas, it is my view that all the sales made by that company would properly be included in making the computation required under para. (b). It is true that such sales were of sulphur owned by Petrogas and not by the appellant or the respondent, and that what was sold by them to Petrogas was gas. However, Petrogas is essentially an instrument for the processing and sale of the gas and its derivatives of those companies with whom it contracts. The sulphur extracted from the gas delivered by the appellant and by the respondent was a part of the total volume of sulphur to be marketed by Petrogas. Part of the money received by each owner contracting with Petrogas was paid on the basis of the sulphur derived from its gas. Both of the parties had a pecuniary interest in the sulphur sold from that plant.\nWhat I have said above in relation to para. (b) applies equally to the computation to be made under para. (c), since the appellant, one of the West Whitecourt Owners, had the required interest under that paragraph.\nThe next factual situation is in connection with sales of sulphur from plants in which one or more of the West Whitecourt Owners are joint owners with others. In such a case, the appellant, for example, would sell acid gas to the plant and receive, in kind, its share of the products, proportionate to the volumes of gas which it delivered to the plant. One of the products would be sulphur. The gas received at the plant from the various suppliers would be intermingled. The sulphur produced from it would be placed in a common stock pile from which each would be entitled to withdraw its proportionate share. In substance, the appellant\u2019s contention is that it is only sales of sulphur from the stock pile made by the appellant itself, or in which it has itself participated along with others, which can be taken into account in making the computations required under paras. (b) and (c).\nI do not agree with this submission. The sulphur produced in plants of the kind under consideration, in a common inventory, is sulphur in which the appellant or other West Whitecourt Owner has joint ownership, which clearly constitutes an interest. In my opinion, any sale from the joint stock pile is a sale of sulphur in. which a West Whitecourt Owner has an interest, within the meaning of paras. (b) and (c), and the fact that, for purposes of delivery, the sulphur sold must be removed from the stock pile, does not prevent the application of those paragraphs. Their application extends to all sales from a plant of any sulphur in which the appellant or other West Whitecourt Owner has an interest and the \u201cinterest\u201d is not to be determined solely at the time of segregation and delivery to the buyer. What these paragraphs contemplate is a broad base for the ascertainment of price not limited only to those sales effected by the West Whitecourt Owners themselves.\nThe third factual situation is in respect of sales of sulphur sold from the Okotoks plant. This is a plant in which the respondent has an interest. It supplies gas to this plant and is entitled to sulphur produced therefrom in proportion to the gas which it supplies. This situation is the same as the one just considered, save only that in this case it is the respondent, and not a West Whitecourt Owner, which has an interest in the plant, and a right to receive sulphur therefrom out of the common inventory. For the same reasons as those already given, it is my view that all sales from that plant should be considered in applying para. (b).\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLaws & Company, Calgary.\n[1] [1925] A.C. 619.\n[2] [1903] A.C. 434.\n[3] [1894] 2 Ch. 377.\n[4] [1902] 1 Ch. 950.\n"

Under the agreement the city was required to carry out certain undertakings involving the demolition of buildings, the construction of a new roadway and the installation of a sewer and watermain, all of which were to be completed by a given date. An application by the defendant\u2019s immediate predecessor in title for a building permit to erect a two-storey rather than a seven-storey building and a similar application made by the defendant, after he had acquired the property, were refused. Subsequently, an action founded on the above agreement was brought by the city to recover from the defendant the land in question on payment of the required sum. The city\u2019s claim having been upheld by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, the defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the defence that the agreement offended the rule against perpetuities, this was not a case where a contingent interest in property might arise outside the perpetuity period. If it was to arise at all, it had to be on the date stated or within a reasonable time thereafter.\nThe second defence, i.e. that the city had lost its rights by reason of failure to complete the installation of the stipulated municipal services within the specified time, was also without merit, as any default in that regard was directly attributable to the failure of the defendant and his predecessors in title to comply with the terms of the agreement respecting the erection of a building.\nThe third defence, i.e. that the covenant in a reconveyance was a personal contract between the original parties and cannot be enforced against the subsequent purchaser because it does not fall within that class of negative covenants which run with the land and bind subsequent purchases with the burden, did not arise on the facts of this case. The defendant took with full notice of the city\u2019s future interest in the property.\n[City of Halifax v. Vaughan Construction Co. Ltd., [1961] S.C.R. 715, applied.] APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Moorhouse J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.J. Carthy, for the defendant, appellant.\nD.K. Laidlaw, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an action by the Corporation of the City of Kitchener against Abraham Weinblatt to recover from him a certain parcel of land in the city on payment of the sum of $33,000. The action was founded on an agreement made between the city and Weinblatt\u2019s predecessor in title which provided for such a reconveyance in certain events. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal1 have upheld the city\u2019s claim. Weinblatt appeals to this Court for a reversal of these judgments and a dismissal of the action. In my opinion, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe city assembled a parcel of land in its centre at a cost of $130,000 for the purpose of redevelopment. It sold part of this land, which had a value of approximately $75,000, to one Robert E. Hart for the sum of $33,000. Hart was acting as nominee for Noy Construction Limited. The city\u2019s deed to Hart was registered on November 17, 1960, and on the same date Hart conveyed to Noy Construction Ltd. Noy Construction Ltd. conveyed to Abraham Weinblatt on August 3, 1961, nearly eight months later. The deed was registered the same day. Both Noy Construction Ltd. and Weinblatt took with full notice of the agreement made between the city and Hart when the property was conveyed to Hart in November of 1960. This agreement is dated October 25, 1960, between the city, as vendor, and Hart as purchaser. The following are its terms:\n1. The Vendor (City) shall demolish to ground level all buildings presently situate on the premises and remove all demolished materials from the said premises.\n2. The Vendor (City) further covenants and agrees to construct a new roadway and sidewalk on the Vendor\u2019s (City\u2019s) property adjacent to and fronting on the premises, between Queen Street and Benton Street, and to install Sewer and Watermain and arrange for all other necessary public services along the same, all to be completed by October 1st, 1961.\n3. The Purchaser (Hart) or his assigns covenants and agrees to sign all petitions that may be necessary to permit such, adjacent roadway to be constructed and such services to be installed and further covenants and agrees to pay all taxes that may be levied against the said Purchaser (Hart) or his assigns pursuant to the provisions of The Local Improvement Act.\n4. The Purchaser (Hart) and\/or his assigns covenants and agrees to commence the erection upon the aforesaid premises of a building substantially in compliance with the Plan of George A. Robb, Architect, dated August, 1960, under Job No. 6012, attached as Schedule \u201cB\u201d to the aforementioned Offer and forming part of this Agreement, within twelve months from the date of completion of this transaction, namely, October 31st, 1960; failing commencement of construction pursuant to this covenant by the Purchaser (Hart) or his assigns within the time limit specified herein, the Vendor (City) may repurchase the land for the sum of THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($33,000.00) provided the Vendor (City) has fulfilled all covenants made by it herein.\n5. The Vendor (City) may extend the time for performance by the Purchaser (Hart) of any of the matters hereinbefore described and agreed to be performed by the said Purchaser (Hart).\n6. The Vendor (City) shall be entitled to reserve the necessary land required for the proposed widening of Queen Street, South.\nThis agreement was registered on June 28, 1961.\nNoy Construction applied for a building permit on November 23, 1960. The preliminary plans submitted were not in conformity with those of the architect mentioned in para. 4 of the agreement. They proposed the construction of a two-storey building instead of a seven-storey building and they were not sufficiently detailed to enable the city even to consider the issue of any building permit. There were subsequent discussions between Noy Construction Ltd. and the city but these ended in February 1961. Following this no further attempts were made by Noy Construction Ltd. to procure a permit for the building contemplated in para. 4 of the agreement. On April 12, 1961, Noy Construction Ltd. entered into an agreement to sell the property to Abraham Weinblatt for $37,000. They gave him a deed on August 3, 1961, and it was registered the same date.\nWeinblatt applied for a building permit in the month of July 1961 and had certain discussions with officials of the city in the month of August 1961. He too was proposing to erect a building which was not in conformity with the agreement between the city and Hart. He was told that his plans were not acceptable. In the month of October he had further discussions with the city. He was asking to be relieved of the obligation to build in accordance with the agreement. The city rejected his suggestions.\nBy the end of 1962 the city had completed all the requirements under the agreement as to demolition, construction of new roadway and the installation of the sewer and watermain. The city demanded a reconveyance. The writ was issued on October 15, 1962. The statement of claim was delivered on January 11, 1963. The judgment of Moorhouse J. directing the reconveyance is dated March 3, 1964.\nThe defence of the action is threefold. First, it was said that the agreement offended the rule against perpetuities; second, that the city had not performed its part of the agreement in time; and third, that Weinblatt was not bound by Hart\u2019s covenants in the agreement.\nAll three defences are without merit. The defence based upon infringement of the rule against perpetuities was rejected by the judgment of this Court in City of Halifax v. Vaughan Construction Co. Ltd.[2] The two cases are indistinguishable both on fact and law. As in the Vaughan case, this is not a case where a contingent interest in property may arise outside the perpetuity period. If it is to arise at all, it must be on the date stated or within a reasonable time thereafter.\nThe second defence is that the city has lost its rights by reason of its failure to perform the matters referred to in para. 2 of the agreement by the stated date, October 1, 1961. I have set out in detail what was done by Hart, Noy Construction and Weinblatt in an attempt to persuade the city to change the requirements of para. 4 of the agreement. It is apparent that there was no effort on the part of these people, nor was there any intention on their part, to comply with para. 4. The Court of Appeal has dealt with this point in the following paragraph, and, in my opinion, correctly:\nThe evidence clearly supports the inference that the defendant and his predecessors in title did not intend to construct a seven-storey building as agreed. They sought permission to amend the agreement to a two-storey building and were refused. Any default by the Plaintiff in failing to complete the installation of the stipulated municipal services within the time specified is directly attributable to the action or rather lack of action on the part of the defendant. To permit the defendant to take advantage of a default which is clearly the result of the expressed intention of the defendant or his predecessors in title would be unjust and cannot be allowed.\nThe third defence was that the covenant in a reconveyance was a personal contract between the original parties and cannot be enforced against the subsequent purchaser because it does not fall within that class of negative covenants which run with the land and bind subsequent purchases with the burden. This defence does not arise on the facts of this case.\nWhat the city had by virtue of this contract was an interest in the property to arise at a future date. Weinblatt took with full notice of this future interest. There is here no question of purchase for value without notice. Weinblatt, if he does not perform under the agreement\u2014and he had no intention of performing\u2014must reconvey on the terms of the agreement.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Allan C. Wilson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Bray, Schofield, Mackay & Kelly, Kitchener.\n[1] [1966] 2 O.R. 740, 58 D.L.R. (2d) 332.\n[2] [1961] S.C.R. 715, 30 D.L.R. (2d) 234.\n"

(Defendant).\n1968: February 12, 13, 14, 15; 1968: October 1.\nPresent: Abbott, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCorporations\u2014Representative action brought by minority shareholders\u2014Internal affairs of company complained of\u2014Issues between company and promoters-Cause of action, if any, properly belonging to company and not to shareholders.\nAppeal\u2014Appellant complying with part of judgment under which benefits accrued to him\u2014Whether precluded from appealing other part.\nThe plaintiffs were minority tenant-shareholders in a company which owned and operated a large \u201cself-owned apartment block\u201d. Before possession of the building was transferred to the company, the building was managed by the company\u2019s promoters and during this period the loss arising from the parking spaces was charged against the company. Similarly, the rent of the suite allotted to the caretaker was also charged against the company.\nIn a dispute which arose between the plaintiffs and the promoters and the directors, the substantial issues related to (i) the portion of the mortgage which was to be paid off by revenue from the garage and (ii) the caretaker\u2019s suite. Having first expressed their dissatisfaction at an annual meeting, the plaintiffs brought a representative action and were afforded substantial relief at trial. An appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal and the action was dismissed on the ground that the action was precluded by the rule in Foss v. Harbottle (1843), 2 Hare 461, 67 E.R. 189. The plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe issues relating to the caretaker\u2019s suite and to the portion of the mortgage attributable to the garage were the only issues involving money between the company and the promoters. They were questions of accounting which depended on the company\u2019s recognition of its obligations, if any, with respect to these matters. Such a cause of action properly belonged to the company and not to the shareholders. The question of the application of the funds of the company was within the powers of the company. A group of shareholders could not complain of acts which were valid if done by the majority of the shareholders or were capable of being confirmed by the majority.\nIt was necessary, therefore, that the company be the plaintiff in any action to redress this wrong, if it existed, and the Court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the internal management when the company was acting within its powers. If a majority of the shares were controlled by those against whom relief was sought, the complaining shareholders might sue in their own names but in that case they had to show that the acts complained of were either fraudulent or ultra vires. The Court below had made a clear finding that it had not been shown in this case that the majority of the shares were controlled by the promoters.\nIn dismissing the preliminary objection whereby the plaintiffs argued that the defendants having complied with the trial judgment as to the issue to them of a new allotment of shares in place of an issue held to be illegal and void, they had taken and enjoyed the benefits to them under this portion of the judgment and were, therefore, precluded from appealing, the Court agreed with the Court below that: (a) the actions of the defendant promoters did not bring them within the principles of estoppel enunciated in Lissenden v. C.A.V. Bosch Ltd., [1940] A.C. 412, and (b) the defendant promoters had done no more than comply with the judgment which they were bound to do.\nOn a further subsidiary issue, the Court also agreed with the Court below that in the particular circumstances no unauthorized reduction in capital or trafficking in shares was involved in a proposal that the company should purchase the caretaker\u2019s suite. The shares appurtenant to that suite had already been beneficially owned and held for the company but by an irregular allotment, and the intention was merely to extinguish them.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Munroe J. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.\nC.C.I. Merritt, Q.C. for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJohn L. Farris, Q.C. and Ronald C. Bray, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nJUDSON J.:\u2014In 1956 a group of real estate promoters formed three private holding companies, namely, B & W Apartments Ltd., owned by the defendants Becker and Walsh, W & E Apartments Ltd., owned by the defendants Walsh and Enders, and F & N Apartments Ltd., owned originally by Forst and Nemetz but subsequently acquired by the defendants F.A. Lockwood and W.W. Lockwood (hereafter called the \u201cVendor Companies\u201d) for the purpose of financing and building a large \u201cself-owned apartment block\u201d. The promoters entered into a construction contract with Becker Construction Co. Ltd., a company wholly-owned by the defendant Becker, and on November 25, 1957, incorporated Ocean Towers Ltd., as a private company authorized to issue 2,020 shares without nominal or par value. Ocean Towers was to be the owner of the apartment building. Its articles of association provided that no corporation except a trust company could be a shareholder and that all shares should be allotted, and could only be transferred, in units of 26 and 32 shares respectively and in one unit of 50 shares. Each unit represented an apartment suite and each purchaser was to get a 50-year renewable lease. On the same day the vendor companies made an agreement to sell the apartment building to Ocean Towers. The building was to have 18 floors with a total of 69 suites, including a penthouse, and 108 covered automobile parking spaces.\nThe construction contract provided for a price to include the cost of construction plus a fee of $100,000. A mortgage for $900,000 was arranged with an insurance company. The promoters intended that the mortgage, both as to principal and interest, was to be paid off in this way:\n(a) As to $738,000 by monies provided from the sale of blocks of shares representing suites;\n(b) As to $162,000 by the revenue from the parking spaces.\nAgreements were made to sell some suites at a price based upon the estimated cost of the building. As the building progressed, it became apparent that the estimated cost would be exceeded. Those who had agreed to buy suites based upon the original estimated cost were given the option to cancel their purchases. Only one person took advantage of this offer. The prices of the suites were increased to take care of the increased costs. Nothing turns on this rearrangement and the rearrangement itself requires statement only in outline. The number of shares was increased to 2,421. The 26-share suites became 31-share suites; the 32 became 38; the penthouse suite rose from 50 to 75. The price of each share remained at $1,000. The mortgage arrangements remained the same. An amending agreement was made between the three vendor companies and Ocean Towers to give effect to these changes and the memorandum and articles of association of Ocean Towers were also amended. Some adjustments were made for the small number of tenant-shareholders who had agreed to purchase their suites under the old agreement. However, most of the tenant-shareholders, including the plaintiffs, purchased their suites under the new agreement. It is clear that nearly all, if not all, the tenant-shareholders signed an acknowledgment that they had received, read and approved the amended \u201cparticulars of the transaction\u201d as well as the revised memorandum and articles of association.\nIn the absence of what is now known as condominium legislation, these financial arrangements exposed the purchasers of suites to real hazards. Their security of tenure depended upon everything going according to plan. If suites were unsold, someone had to assume responsibility for the payments attributable to these suites. In this case the vendor companies assumed the responsibility. When the amending agreement was made in January 1957, they took up 776 shares. These shares were issued to Canada Trust Company in trust for the vendor companies who now held a total of 828 shares. These shares were paid for by a cash payment of $278,400, which was credited to the purchase price of the building, and promissory notes totalling $417,600 dated to coincide with the commencement of mortgage payments on April 1, 1960. These shareholdings were reduced from time to time by the sale of suites and at the time when this action was commenced in November 1964, the vendor companies still held 543 shares.\nIt had been expected that the building would be completed and possession and management transferred to Ocean Towers by November 1, 1959. This transfer was not made until January 1, 1964, and until this date the promoters managed the building. Until the first annual meeting of the company on January 31, 1961, the board of directors were appointees of the promoters but on this date the board was increased from three to seven and a new board was elected consisting of two promoters and five tenant-shareholders. The trial judge found that this was an independent board and it is apparent from the evidence that it was an able and conscientious board. The three plaintiffs, who are the appellants in this Court, are shareholders in Ocean Towers. They own 62 shares. They claim to have the support of 22 tenant-shareholders who own 759 shares. Their combined holdings are, therefore, 821 shares out of a total of 2,421.\nThe action is brought against two main groups of defendants. The first group were those who were promoters and the three companies that they formed for this purpose. At the date of the writ, the promoters had a total of 688 shares. There were four individual defendants who were not promoters. They held a total of 181 shares. No appeal has been taken against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the claim against these defendants. The two other directors who were sued were W.W. Lockwood and John Leslie Bartram. Lockwood was a promoter and Bartram represents the estate of Frank Wallace Walsh, who was a promoter. Again, the Court of Appeal dismissed the action against these two and no appeal has been taken from this dismissal.\nThe judgment at trial afforded substantial relief to the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the action on the ground that the action was precluded by the rule in Foss v. Harbottle[2]. I think it better to begin with to state what the substantial issues were. The first of these was the liability of Ocean Towers to take care of that part of the mortgage which was attributable to the parking spaces. This amounted to $162,000. The expectation was that revenues from the parking spaces would be sufficient to repay this sum over a certain period. This expectation was not realized because for a time there were many empty suites. Subsequently, after possession of the building was turned over to Ocean Towers on January 1, 1964, there were rearrangements made in the parking spaces and two increases made in the rentals. These increases and rearrangements were sufficient from then on to take care of this portion of the mortgage.\nBut, in the meantime, while the promoters were managing the apartment until January 1, 1964, the loss arising from the garage was charged to operating expenses and against Ocean Towers. When the property was turned over on January 1, 1964, it was apparent from the statement of adjustments, and the directors had known this for at least three years, that the retirement of the $162,000 portion of the mortgage was being looked after in this way. They also knew that there was a deficit and that the deficit had been charged as operating expenses. There can, in my opinion, be no doubt about this and the directors do not suggest otherwise. The statement of adjustments had been prepared by an independent firm of auditors who had been appointed to examine the accounts of the promoters. This was not the firm of auditors that had represented previously both the company and the promoters. The accounts were prepared and submitted on the basis that the $162,000 portion of the mortgage was the responsibility of the company and that this had been so from the beginning. These accounts were accepted by the directors. They had been aware from the time of their election that this was the way the garage was being financed and there was no question in their minds of the propriety of this. The suggestion of impropriety seems to have arisen for discussion at the annual meeting of shareholders held on March 19, 1964, and adjourned to April 2, 1964. At this time the dissident group raised the question.\nTo summarize, the judgment of the learned trial judge found that the promoters were liable for the $162,000 portion of the mortgage attributable to the garage. He reopened the accounts which had been finally approved by the directors on February 13, 1964, for the purpose of reversing the charges already made up to the date of the take-over of the building and for the subsequent period from January 1, 1964, up to the date of judgment, May 1, 1966. He awarded the sum of $23,231.68 by way of indemnity. In other words, under this judgment the promoters and not the company are responsible for the payment of this portion of the mortgage.\nOn this issue the trial judge found that there had been a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the promoters in that they had failed to disclose to the applicants for shares in Ocean Towers that the responsibility for the payment of the $162,000 portion of the mortgage would be on Ocean Towers out of garage revenues and that any deficiency would have to be made good by the company. The Court of Appeal did not make any finding on this branch of the case as it was not necessary for their decision because they founded their judgment on the application of the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and their conclusion that the plaintiffs had not brought this within the exceptions to that rule enunciated in Burland v. Earle[3]. Mr. Justice Norris indicated that in his view there had been breaches of fiduciary duty. Mr. Justice Bull indicated that he would not have found any breach of fiduciary duty. Mr. Justice Tysoe declined to express an opinion on this issue on the ground that it might be an embarrassment if there were future litigation in a properly constituted action. However, his analysis for the financial set-up is the same as my own, and to me, it is clear that this $162,000 that I have been dealing with was not the obligation of the promoters and if it were necessary for me to express an opinion, I would not agree with the trial judge. The documentary evidence makes it plain that free parking was not to be provided and was not included in the price of the suites. The course of dealing is strong affirmation of the impossibility of any misunderstanding on this point. An independent and experienced board of directors never had any doubt.\nIn my opinion, the financial set-up was accurately stated in the particulars which were given to each shareholder. Briefly, the price of the building was the amount received from the sale of the treasury shares plus the sum of $162,000 \u201crepresenting the cost of the covered parking spaces\u201d. The particulars also went on to say that \u201cthe covered parking spaces have been valued at $162,000 and as no provision has been made for the allocation of stock with respect to same, the purchase price of said parking spaces shall be paid from the proceeds of the mortgage aforesaid. The company will on request allot parking spaces to shareholders at a monthly rental to be determined.\u201d In other words, Ocean Towers was mortgaged for $900,000, and $162,000 from this mortgage was used to pay the sum of $162,000, which was part of the purchase price in addition to the amount received from the sale of treasury shares. I have examined the record for the purpose of discovering what tenant-shareholders signed certificates which stated that they had read certain documents which really-composed the \u201cprospectus\u201d of the company. Munroe J. had this to say on the matter:\nA reading of the memorandum and articles of association of Ocean and of the forms of lease, when read in conjunction with the said agreement, together with a statement of \u201cparticulars\u201d prepared by the solicitor of Ocean\u2014all of which documents each applicant for shares certified that he (or she) had read\u2014and which certificate is, I hold, binding upon them\u2026\nTysoe J.A. agreed:\nIn view of the above changes, a new form of memorandum for use in the sale of suites was prepared consisting of \u201cparticulars\u201d of the transaction accompanied by copies of the memorandum and articles of association (as amended) of the company, a conformed copy of the executed new agreement, ex. 12, and a copy of the draft 50-year lease to be signed by a tenant-shareholder. These were delivered to prospective purchasers of suites and most, if not all, applicants were required to and did sign thereon an acknowledgment that same had been received, read, and approved. The learned trial judge found, correctly in my opinion, that those who signed such acknowledgments were bound thereby, notwithstanding evidence given by some that they did not receive and\/or read the documents.\nTaking as a starting point the list of shareholders dated December 31, 1963, there is evidence that all the original shareholders except three signed certificates stating that they had read the documents. There is no evidence that R.G. Buchanan or Tucker signed a certificate. Neither was called to give evidence. Mrs. Burrows bought by way of sublease and assignment from Becker and she gave evidence that she never saw any documents until March 1964.\nThere are cases where an original tenant-shareholder assigned his lease and shares to a third party. There is no evidence that any of the assignees signed a certificate. Mrs. Burrows appears to be in this position.\nThe other ground of complaint on the part of the plaintiff-shareholders related to the caretaking services. There could be no doubt on the material before the Court and before all the shareholders that maintenance costs were for the company and its shareholders and not for the promoters. The form of lease provided for a monthly payment for these costs of $69 for inside suites and $86 for outside suites. What has been referred to as a prospectus stated that there would be a 24-hour caretaking service. The original intention was to employ three shifts of caretakers. This was found to be more expensive than having a man and his wife live on the premises in one of the suites. This arrangement began in May of 1960 and suite 202 was allotted to the caretaker and his wife. It was shown by the evidence that this arrangement was cheaper than the 24-hour service originally contemplated. The shares representing suite 202 were in the hands of the promoters along with the other shares that they had taken up to keep the building going.\nThe learned trial judge found misrepresentation on the part of the promoters with reference to this suite and he reopened the accounts for the purpose of reversing the charges made for it to operating expenses. In my opinion, in so doing he was plainly in error. There was nothing in the material before the shareholders and before the Court to justify any conclusion that the promoters were to provide a caretaker\u2019s suite in perpetuity at their own expense. Once the board of directors had decided to do the care-taking in this way instead of by non-residential employees, the rent of the caretaker\u2019s suite was a proper charge to operating expenses.\nThe learned trial judge concluded that equity required of the promoters frank disclosure to each applicant for shares that Ocean would have to purchase from the promoters the suite now occupied by the caretaker if it desired to have him continue in residence. He further found that a failure to make such disclosure amounted to a misrepresentation of a material fact if, as the promoters said, it was not within their contemplation that suite #202 should be made available without cost to Ocean as a place of residence for the caretaker. He did not refer to the uncontradicted evidence that the cost of providing the suite, together with the caretaker\u2019s remuneration, was less than the $600 per month originally estimated to be included in the maintenance to cover the cost of a 24-hour caretaker service. He also held that the proposal that Ocean should purchase this suite would be ultra vires, it being contrary to the principle of Trevor v. Whitworth[4]. On this point the Court of Appeal held that in the particular circumstances no unauthorized reduction in capital or trafficking in shares was involved in the proposal that Ocean Towers should purchase the caretaker\u2019s suite.\nThe issues relating to the $162,000 portion of the mortgage and the caretaker\u2019s suite are the only issues involving money between the company and the promoters. All others were of a subsidiary nature. I have dealt with the two money issues in detail because the Court of Appeal founded its judgment on the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and not on the merits of the case, but the facts of this case show that the rule is a salutary rule and not one of mere technicality. Here was a group of shareholders which wanted the company to litigate these two issues. Their dissatisfaction was first expressed at the annual meeting held on March 19, 1964, and adjourned to April 2, 1964. They made their own nominations for the board of directors but failed to secure their election. Instead, the meeting elected five tenant\u2011shareholders and two representatives of the promoter group. There were three resignations of directors on April 28, 1964. Replacements were made, one of whom was a member of the plaintiff\u2019s group. At no time was there any requisition for a special general meeting to instruct the directors to bring this action. It is, I think, clear from the evidence that the directors had little confidence in the outcome of a company action. They were taking legal advice when the writ of summons was issued on November 30, 1964.\nIt is true that the plaintiffs as shareholders and tenants along with all the others were interested in these two issues. But they were not seeking to assert personal claims as shareholders against the promoters such as damages for fraud or rescission of their contracts to purchase shares. They were insisting that the company, as plaintiff, should litigate these issues and that if the company failed to do so, they had the right to bring the action. These money issues were between the company and the promoters. They were questions of accounting which depended upon the company\u2019s recognition of its obligations, if any, with respect to the $162,000 portion of the mortgage and the caretaker\u2019s suite. Such a cause of action properly belongs to the company and not to the shareholders. The question of the application of the funds of the company was within the powers of the company. A group of shareholders cannot complain of acts which are valid if done by the majority of the shareholders or are capable of being confirmed by the majority.\nThe company, therefore, must be the plaintiff in any action to redress this wrong, if it exists, and the Court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the internal management when the company is acting within its powers. If a majority of the shares are controlled by those against whom relief is sought, the complaining shareholders may sue in their own names but in that case they must show that the acts complained of are either fraudulent or ultra vires. The Court of Appeal in the reasons of Tysoe J.A. made a clear finding that it had not been shown in this case that the majority of the shares were controlled by the promoters. The independence of the board of directors after January 31, 1961, is beyond question.\nTysoe J.A. summarized the facts relating to control in the following passage:\nWhen all is said and done I remain faced with the following stark facts. At the relevant time the promoters did not possess a majority of the shares of the company and even if their shares are added to those of the directors and four former directors the total does not represent a majority. There were an unidentified number of shareholders who had not declared themselves\u2014an uncommitted group holding over 20 per cent of the issued share capital of the company. No one of this group was a witness at the trial. The Court was not directed to any evidence indicating how any of the members of this floating group of uncommitted shareholders would or might have voted on the crucial question of whether the company should bring action against the promoters, with or without sufficient information to enable them to form an intelligent judgment. Nor is there evidence from which the Court might infer, rather than speculate, that some members of the floating group would have given proxies to others to vote their shares either for or against the bringing of an action against the promoters. In this situation it is much easier to hazard a guess than to speak with any certainty.\nI agree with his conclusions and they fully support his judgment in declining to interfere with the internal affairs of this company and his finding that the \u201cplaintiffs have not shown that any attempt to have the company bring this action in its own name would have been futile\u201d. I accept his analysis of the facts of this case and their relevancy in connection with the rule in Foss v. Harbottle. They are set out in his reasons for judgment contained in (1967), 63 D.L.R. (2d) 100, and I refrain from repeating them. This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal on these two points.\nThe next issue in this appeal relates to a block of 543 shares which at the time of the institution of the action were in the hands of the promoters. I have mentioned these shares earlier in the reasons. They were the rest of the block of 776 shares issued pursuant to a resolution of January 29, 1959, to Canada Trust Company in trust for the three vendor companies. These shares were issued in breach of arts. 3 and 4 of the articles of association and the issue was, therefore, illegal and void. The trial judge rectified this illegality by directing the cancellation of these 543 shares and the issue of the same number in units of 31 and 38 shares to the defendant promoters personally and the delivery of their joint and several promissory notes to secure the unpaid balance of the purchase price. The reason for this was that the promoters, if they bought shares pending their further sale to tenant-shareholders, were to adhere to the form of agreement which the tenant-shareholders who did not pay for their shares in full were to sign.\nI do not think that this issue requires further discussion. Tysoe J.A. said:\nThe effect of this judgment is simply to correct the irregularities resulting from the breaches of arts. 3 and 4 of the articles of association of the company and to produce such a result that \u201cthe original resolution of January 29, 1959 will be adhered to as nearly as possible\u201d. With respect, it appears to me that this was a sensible way of dealing with this matter and I am unable to see any error in what was done. In my opinion this claim must fail.\nAccording to Tysoe J.A., the defendants were bound to comply with the provisions of this part of the judgment and they did so. In the Court of Appeal the plaintiffs argued that by complying with the judgment, the defendants had taken and enjoyed the benefits accruing to them under this portion of the judgment and were, therefore, precluded from appealing. The same point was argued in this Court by way of preliminary objection and I would dismiss this preliminary objection for the same reasons that were given in the majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Tysoe and Mr. Justice Bull dismissed the motion on two grounds:\n(a) that the actions of the defendant promoters did not bring them within the principles of estoppel enunciated in Lissenden v. C.A.V. Bosch Ltd.[5];\n(b) that the defendant promoters had done no more than comply with the judgment which they were bound to do.\nMr. Justice Norris dismissed the motion on the first ground. Again, I have nothing to add to the reasons for judgment of Tysoe J.A. on this point.\nOn the question of the ultra vires issue of these shares, I do, however, wish to state that in my opinion this was an action that any shareholder could bring and that the rule in Foss v. Harbottle has no application.\nThere is one further subsidiary issue to be dealt with, namely, the 31 shares appurtenant to suite 202, the caretaker\u2019s suite. When Ocean Towers was converted into a public company, 455 shares were allotted to Canada Trust Company in trust for Ocean Towers. All of these shares except the 31 shares appurtenant to suite 202 were sold to tenant-shareholders but the 31 shares were still outstanding in the name of Canada Trust Company in trust for Ocean Towers when the action was instituted. The trial judge ordered the cancellation of these shares on the ground that they had been illegally issued. The Court of Appeal stated that the cancellation raised no problems and that it was not attacked and must therefore stand.\nThere was, however, an agreement made on December 31, 1963, between the vendor companies and Ocean Towers under which Ocean Towers was to keep possession of suite 202 subject to payment of a purchase price of $28,000. The agreement was conditional upon its approval by a resolution of shareholders and this has never been done. The agreement was declared to be illegal and void by the trial judge. The declaration of illegality was set aside by the Court of Appeal and, in my opinion, correctly.\nThe Court of Appeal pointed out that the agreement was not a purchase of these 31 shares from the vendor companies. The vendor companies had never taken them nor showed them in their accounts as being owned. The shares had always been beneficially owned by and held for the company but by an irregular allotment. They had never been issued. The gist of the judgment of the Court of Appeal on this point is contained in the following passage:\nIn effect, the agreement constituted a purchase of a leasehold interest, or leasehold entitlement, vested in the Vendor Companies by their obligation under ex. 12 to take over all unsold suites in part payment on the purchase price of the building. The $28,000 took the place of and recompensed the Vendor Companies for the loss of the purchase price of the suite and the shares appurtenant to it which would have been added to the purchase price of the building had the suite with its shares been taken over by the Vendor Companies. Neither the form nor the intention thereof was to purchase shares. Only the company had any interest in the shares, and the intention was merely to extinguish them. In my view, under the peculiar circumstances of this matter, no unauthorized reduction in capital or trafficking in shares was involved, and the learned trial Judge\u2019s finding that ex. 37 was ultra vires, illegal and void, and that it be cancelled, cannot stand.\nAgain, I agree in full.\nThere was a cross-appeal by the promoters in which it was argued that the rule in Foss v. Harbottle applied to every cause of action asserted in this litigation and that the Court of Appeal should have simply ordered a dismissal of the action. The attack was directed against the order of the trial judge, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, relating to the 543 shares. I have already stated my opinion that the rule in Foss v. Harbottle has nothing to do with this cause of action. The cross-appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nI would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal both with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Clark, Wilson, White, Clark & Maguire, Vancouver.\n[1] (1967), 63 D.L.R.

By an agreement in writing between it and the Crown, made pursuant to s. 18(1)(g) of the Exchequer Court Act, that Court was asked to determine the following question: \u201cSubject to section 32(2) of the Combines Investigation Act is a person who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with another person to prevent, or lessen, unduly competition in the storage or transportation of household goods, guilty of an offence under section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act?\u201d The Exchequer Court answered the question in the affirmative, and the association was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThis Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. As a direct result of the judgment of the Exchequer Court, it is no longer open to the appellant to contend in other judicial proceedings that the storage or transportation of household goods does not come within the purview of s. 32(2) of the Act. Such a result binds substantial \u201crights in future\u201d of the appellant within the meaning of s. 83(b) of the Exchequer Court Act which enacts that an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court lies when the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding relates \u201cto any matter or thing where rights in future might be bound\u201d.\nAs to the merits, household goods are \u201carticles\u201d within the definition of that word in s. 2(a) of the Combines Investigation Act, as being commodities \u201cthat may be the subject of trade or commerce\u201d. The word \u201carticle\u201d does not apply only to commodities in the stream of commerce. If Parliament had intended that commodities that are actually in the stream of commerce only would be articles within the meaning of the definition, the word \u201cis\u201d would be expected to be found instead of \u201cmay be\u201d.\nCoalition\u2014Transport et entreposage de meubles de maison\u2014Sont-ils vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00abarticle\u00bb dans la loi\u2014Loi relative aux enqu\u00eates sur les coalitions, S.R.C. 1952, c. 314, art. 2(a), 32(1)(c), 32(2), amend\u00e9e par 1960 (Can.), c. 45, art. 1, 13\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98, art. 18(1)(g).\nJuridiction\u2014Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Question de droit d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier par une entente entre les parties\u2014La r\u00e9ponse se rattache-t-elle \u00e0 des \u00abdroits futurs\u00bb\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98, art. 83.\nL\u2019association appelante repr\u00e9sente quelque 300 soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales dont l\u2019entreprise consiste \u00e0 faire le transport et l\u2019entreposage de meubles de maison.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in answer to a question of law as to the application of the Combines Investigation Act. Appeal dismissed. Keith E. Eaton and Brian A. Crane, for the appellant.\nC.R.O. Munro, Q.C., and S.M. Leikin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014By agreement in writing made as contemplated in sub-para. (g) of s. 18 (1) of the Exchequer Court Act, the parties, after stating that \u201cthe transportation and storage of goods commonly described as household goods, being goods owned by householders and used in their households, is a substantial business\u2026\u201d, have submitted to the Exchequer Court of Canada the following question:\nSubject to section 32(2) of the Combines Investigation Act is a person who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with another person to prevent, or lessen, unduly, competition in the storage or transportation of household goods, guilty of an offence under section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act?\nThe question was answered in the affirmative by Gibson J. An appeal is now brought to this Court by leave granted by Fauteux J. under s. 83 of the Exchequer Court Act as relating to a \u201cmatter or thing where rights in future might be bound\u201d.\nAt the hearing, argument was heard first on the question of jurisdiction because, as far as could be determined, this appeared to be the first case of an appeal under such circumstances.\nA declaratory judgment is undoubtedly binding on the parties as res judicata, not merely by application of the doctrine of stare decisis. As a direct result of the judgment of the Exchequer Court it is no longer open to the appellant to contend in other judicial proceedings that the storage or transportation of household goods does not come within the purview of s. 32(2) of the Combines Investigation Act. In considering whether such a result binds \u201crights in future\u201d, it must be observed that when what is presently sub-para. (b) of s. 83 of the Exchequer Court Act was first enacted (1887, 50-51 Vict., c. 16, s. 52), it read as follows:\n(b) Relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound. The words \u201csuch like\u201d explicitly required the application of the noscitur a sociis rule as they did at that time in s. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 135. However, Parliament amended in a different manner the two provisions after Taschereau J. (as he then was) had said of s. 29, in Gilbert v. Gilman[2]:\nwe are asked to read this section as if it read \u201cOr in any matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\u201d But the words the legislature has used are \u201csuch like matters,\u201d thereby qualifying them to such matters or things as are precedently mentioned.\nBy s. 8 of 54-55 Vict., c. 26, the provision in the Exchequer Court Act was made to read as it now does, Parliament adopting substantially the wording indicated as not implying a restriction, namely:\n(b) Relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands, tenements or annual rents, or to any question affecting any patent of invention, copyright, trade mark or industrial design, or to any matter or thing where rights in future might be bound.\nBut concerning the jurisdiction of this Court, the amendment made two years later (56 Vict., c. 29) consisted in substituting the words \u201cand other\u201d for the words \u201cor such like\u201d. It is the provision as thus amended that was held to require the application of the noscitur a sociis rule in O\u2019Dell v. Gregory[3], a decision which was followed in a long line of cases culminating in Greenlees v. Attorney General of Canada[4].\nIn view of the difference between the two enactments it seems clear that these decisions can have no application to the instant case. It is moreover obvious that the rights in future of the appellant that are bound by the decision appealed from are substantial. As a result of the decision it is unlawful for it to conduct its business otherwise than subject to the prohibitions enacted in the Combines Investigation Act, whereas in the absence of such a decision it would be open to it to contend that as respects the storage or transportation of household goods, it is not subject to such prohibitions. It is also apparent that in those matters it is subject to the exercise of the powers of investigation contemplated in that Act without any possibility of contending that these matters are not within its proper scope.\nOn the merits, the argument submitted by appellant is essentially that household goods are not \u201carticles\u201d within the definition of that word in para. (a) of s. 2 of the Combines Investigation Act:\n(a) \u201carticle\u201d means an article or commodity that may be the subject of trade or commerce.\nIt is contended that the general intention of the Act is that it shall apply only to commodities in the stream of commerce. The fatal weakness of this argument is that it really invites us to construe the definition as if it read \u201cthat is\u201d instead of \u201cthat may be\u201d. It is true that the result of the literal reading is that the definition embraces every conceivable commodity but it is no reason for departing from the clear meaning of the Act. If Parliament had intended that commodities that are actually in the stream of commerce only would be articles within the meaning of the definition, we would expect to find the word \u201cis\u201d instead of \u201cmay be\u201d. There is no basis for not presuming that the wording used was intended precisely to make it certain that commodities not actually in the stream of commerce would be covered.\nOur attention was drawn to s. 33 of the National Transportation Act (14-15-16 Eliz. II, c. 69) whereby provision is made for the filing of a tariff of tolls by an association of motor vehicle operators on their behalf subject to the authority of the Canadian Transport Commission. Nothing in that provision, which is not yet in force, lends any support to the contention that the Combines Investigation Act should be construed otherwise than as above indicated.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

The charge was subsequently reduced to non capital murder, and in the presence of his counsel, the appellant pleaded guilty thereto and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Court of Appeal dismissed his application for leave to withdraw that plea and affirmed the conviction on the charge of non capital murder. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether the trial judge erred in law in accepting the plea of guilty without making inquiry as to whether the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the effect of such plea.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: When a plea of guilty is offered and there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing, there is no doubt that the judge will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does so; and the extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge to which the accused is pleading. Failure to make due inquiry may well be a ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the matter is left in doubt. However, it cannot be said that where, as in the case at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of guilty to non capital murder, the trial judge is bound as a matter of law to interrogate the accused before accepting the plea.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: It is the duty in law of the trial tribunal to satisfy itself that the accused understands the nature of the charge and the effect of the plea before it is entitled to accept a plea of guilty. The trial judge could not, in the circumstances of this case, in exercising his discretion to accept the plea of guilty, rely only on the fact that the accused was represented by counsel. In so doing, he could not satisfy himself that the accused knew either the nature of the plea or the consequences thereof.\nDroit criminel\u2014Plaidoyer de culpabilit\u00e9\u2014Accusation de meurtre non qualifi\u00e9\u2014Accus\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat\u2014Est-ce que la Cour aurait d\u00fb questionner l\u2019accus\u00e9 avant d\u2019accepter le plaidoyer.

Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nIan H. Baker, for the appellant.\nBrian A. Crane, for the respondent. The judgment of Cartwright C.J and of Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court on October 17, 1968, from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta pronounced on September 10, 1968, dismissing, without recorded reasons, the application of the appellant for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty, granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction on a charge of non-capital murder.\nLeave was granted to appeal on the following question:\nDid the learned trial judge err in law in accepting the Appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to non\u2011capital murder without making inquiry to satisfy himself that the Appellant understood the nature of the charge and the effect of such a plea?\nIt appears that the appellant was indicted on the charge that on or about March 11, 1967, he unlawfully killed Robert George Sidener, thereby committing capital murder. The indictment is dated September 5, 1967. The appellant appeared before Primrose J. on September 5, 1967, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty and the case was remanded to October 30, 1967, for the purpose of fixing a date for trial. The appellant appeared on October 30 before Greschuk J.; he appeared on January 2, 1968, before Primrose J.; he appeared on January 15, 1968, before Manning J.; on each of these occasions the case was further remanded for the purpose of fixing a date for trial. The appellant appeared on February 26, 1968, before Greschuk J. and was remanded to March 11, 1968, for trial. On March 11, 1968, he appeared before O\u2019Byrne J. and the notation on the back of the indictment as to what occurred on that day is as follows:\nMonday March 11th, 1968\nMr. Justice M.B.

STAINTON: In this case, my Lord, might the amendment which has been proposed and which has been written into the indictment be granted so that the charge will read non-capital murder instead of capital murder?\nTHE COURT: Yes, the amendment is granted.\nMR. STAINTON: Might the accused be rearraigned, my Lord?\nTHE COURT: Yes. Mr. Clerk:\nTHE CLERK OF THE COURT: Lawrence Willard Brosseau, you stand charged that you on or about the 11th day of March, A.D. 1967, at or near Tulliby Lake in the Judicial District of Edmonton, did unlawfully kill and slay Robert George Sidener, thereby committing non-capital murder contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. How say you to this \u2018charge, do you plead guilty or not guilty?\nTHE ACCUSED: Not guilty.\nTHE CLERK OF THE COURT: Harken to your plea as the Court doth record it, Lawrence Willard Brosseau, not guilty.\nMR. MOUSSEAU: My Lord, if we may, would the Court grant a five-minute adjournment?\nTHE COURT: Yes, we will adjourn for five minutes.\nThe Court adjourned at 10.05 a.m. and reconvened at 10.20 a.m., at which time Mr. Mousseau asked the Court to stand the matter over to two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Mr. Stainton stated that he had no objection, and the trial Judge adjourned the matter accordingly. The transcript as to what occurred at 2 p.m. is as follows:\nMR. MOUSSEAU: I might at this time, my Lord, before Mr. Brosseau arrives, explain that whilst Mr. Brosseau appears to have a sufficient command of the English language, I have on prior occasions interviewed him with an interpreter, and when I spoke with Mr. Brosseau earlier this morning he did indicate to me that he preferred that the present proceedings be interpreted to him. Mr. Callihoo, who is an ex-agent of the then Department of Indian Affairs, has agreed to do so, and I would request of Your Lordship that he be sworn in order to perform his function.\nTHE COURT: Very well.\nPATRICK CALLIHOO, sworn in as English\/Cree interpreter.\nTHE COURT: It\u2019s just a matter of reading the charge again to the accused, Mr. Mousseau? MR. MOUSSEAU: It is, yes, my Lord.\nTHE CLERK: Lawrence Willard Brosseau, you stand charged that you on or about the 11th day of March, A.D. 1967, at or near Tulliby Lake, in the Judicial District of Edmonton, did unlawfully kill and slay Robert George Sidener, thereby committing non\u2011capital murder, contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. How say you to this charge, do you plead guilty or not guilty?\nTHE ACCUSED: Guilty.\nTHE CLERK: Harken to your plea as the Court doth record it, Lawrence Willard Brosseau, guilty.\nMr. Stainton then outlined the circumstances of the killing to the trial Judge at some length. The trial Judge then asked Mr. Mousseau if he wished to say anything and Mr. Mousseau addressed the Court as follows:\nMR. MOUSSEAU: Only to indicate to the Court that the accused is describable only in terms of an absolute primitive. I don\u2019t pretend to have any particular understanding of his mind or of his intent. I can point out to evidence given in the preliminary both by the wife of the deceased as well as by Mr. Wendt, that there was absolutely no antagonism or ill feeling between the accused and Mr. Sidener. I can point out also the accused\u2019s evidence to the effect that he drank what for him was a substantial amount of beer. I can point out also the fact that whilst he did give one profession or did make certain admissions to Mr. Nolin, as my friend has pointed out, he gave a totally different reason for the commission of the act when speaking to the police.\nThese factors, of course, in view of the statutory penalty, do not involve this Court presently. However, this Court, to the extent that it is a Court of law, is involved with the matter of justice generally, and whilst I am not absolutely certain as to the Court\u2019s powers with respect to cases of like nature, I would ask of the Court that it recommend that this matter be gone into by the Parole Board and that it may, upon examination, prove to be one of the special cases that the enactment setting out the Parole Board envisages. That is my submission, my Lord.\nThe transcript continues as follows:\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Mousseau.\nStand up, Mr. Brosseau. Section 206(2) of the Criminal Code provides that a person guilty of non-capital murder shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life. I have no discretion in the matter. I sentence you to imprisonment for life. At the request of Mr. Mousseau a report will be made to the Parole Board along the line suggested by him.\nMR. MOUSSEAU: Thank you, my Lord.\nTHE COURT: That\u2019s all, Mr. Stainton?\nMR. STAINTON: Yes, my Lord.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\n(Court adjourned at 3:01 p.m.) It will be observed that no inquiry was made by the learned trial Judge either of the appellant or of his counsel as to whether the appellant understood the charge and the consequences of his plea of guilty.\nOn March 18, 1968, the appellant gave a written notice of appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta stating that he wished to apply \u201cfor leave as required\u201d and to appeal his conviction and sentence on the following grounds:\n(a) I wish to appeal my conviction and sentence on the grounds that I only have a grade 2 education and my lawyer told me that if I didn\u2019t plead guilty to the charge that they would sentence me to hang. When he told me this I was scared and pleaded guilty.\nOn August 26, 1968, the appellant swore an affidavit stating that he is a Cree Indian, that he reached only grade 2 in school and left school when he was fifteen years old, that he is now twenty-two years old, that he was drunk at the time of the offence and did not know what he did, that he was drunk when he gave a statement to the police, that he understood that for capital murder he would be hanged but that non-capital murder was not so serious, that his lawyer told him in February 1968 that he might get five or seven or eight years but did not say on what charge he could get this sentence, that, in March 1968, his lawyer told him that if he was found guilty they would sentence him to be hanged, that he pleaded not guilty in Court and the case was put over till two o\u2019clock and that his lawyer told him that if he was found guilty he could be sentenced to be hanged but that if he pleaded guilty, he would get life imprisonment; that he pleaded guilty because he was scared of being hanged, that when he pleaded guilty he did not understand that the Judge had no choice but to impose a life sentence. He concluded by saying that he did not believe he had killed Robert George Sidener as he always got along well with him when he worked for him over six years and that he had no grudge against him.\nMr. Mousseau, at the specific request of counsel then acting for the appellant and with the written authorization of the appellant, made an affidavit which appears to have beep sworn on September 12, 1968. (This would seem to be in error as the judgment of the Appellate Division refers to the affidavit of Mr. Mousseau). In this affidavit, Mr. Mousseau states that he arranged the delays in the case being brought to trial in the expectation of a change in the legislation regarding capital crimes, \u201cthat the amendments made the Criminal Code, and relevant to the proceedings at bar, were not of a nature as would assist the Appellant\u201d, that subsequent to the enacting of the amendment aforesaid a tentative arrangement was entered into between counsel for the Crown and himself, as a result of which it was suggested that the charge should be reduced to non\u2011capital murder.\nThe amendments referred to were doubtless those contained in Statutes of Canada 1967-68, c. 15, and by virtue of s. 3 of that Act, as the date of the killing of Sidener was March 11, 1967, and the indictment was dated September 5, 1967, prior to the date that the amendments were brought into force, December 29, 1967, it is clear that had the appellant been convicted on the indictment for capital murder the imposition of a sentence of death would have been mandatory.\nThe affidavit continues as follows:\n6. THAT subsequent to the above, I met with my client on a number of occasions (the last of those meetings took place on either of the 9th or the 10th days of March, A.D. 1968); we together reviewed the facts of the matter; I discussed with him the nature of the charge with which he was faced, as well as the consequences attendant upon a finding of guilty thereon; I also indicated that, on the evidence, the charge might, at trial, be reduced to one of either \u2018non-capital murder\u2019 or \u2018manslaughter\u2019\u2014I explained to him the nature of these charges as well as the consequences attendant thereon; I recommended that, in my opinion, his interests would best be served by his pleading guilty to a reduced charge of \u2018non-capital murder\u2019\u2014I indicated to him that the sentence in a case of this nature was dictated by the Statute; that, notwithstanding, the Parole Regulations permitted review and release upon his having served seven years of his sentence or, in the event that special circumstances be shown to exist, at the Board\u2019s discretion\u2014I was able, in this last regard, to assure him of the co-operation and assistance of officials of the Native Friendship Centre as well as to indicate to him that I would move that the Court, in its \u2018Report\u2019, recommend review in the light of the very peculiar nature of his person and circumstances; MR. BROSSEAU indicated that he would be guided by my recommendation.\n7. On March 11th, A.D. 1968, MR. BROSSEAU appeared before O\u2019BYRNE, J., and. was re-arraigned on a charge of non-capital murder he recorded a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d; in view of the circumstances surrounding the reduction of the charge as well as of my uncertainty as to whether he was fully cognizant of that which he had done\u2014I requested adjournment of the matter to the afternoon. 8. I then called upon P. CALIHOO, an interpreter, and together with MR. CALIHOO, attended upon MR. BROSSEAU at the R.C.M. Police cells; at that time, through the intermediary of MR. CALIHOO I clearly indicated to MR. BROSSEAU that he was wholly at liberty to proceed to trial and that, should he so desire, I would request a further adjournment of the proceedings; I again reviewed the circumstances of the occurrence; explained the consequences attendant upon a finding of \u201cguilty\u201d on each of the three charges aforementioned; I reiterated my advice to the effect that his best interests would be served by his pleading \u201cguilty\u201d to the reduced charge as it presently stood; I requested that he indicate his desire and assured him that I would do as he requested; at 2:00 o\u2019clock that afternoon he again appeared before The Honourable, Mr. Justice M.B. O\u2019BYRNE, the charge was re-read to him and translated into the Cree language by MR. CALIHOO\u2014he recorded a plea of \u201cguilty\u201d thereto.\n9. THAT MR. BROSSEAU\u2019S circumstances are such that, in my opinion, notwithstanding the above, it may well be that he was throughout incapable of understanding or appreciating the nature and consequences of the plea instantly recorded; that his background is such that he cannot be regarded other than as a true \u2018primitive\u2019.\nThere was also before the Appellate Division an affidavit exhibiting a letter from an M.D., a psychiatric consultant, concluding with the sentence:\nCertainly he (the appellant) would not rate higher than a Borderline I.Q.\u2014that is, just above the Defective level.\nand a psychological report of which the last sentence reads:\nIt can be concluded that he is functioning within the borderline group.\nI have recited the evidence which was before the Appellate Division at perhaps undue length. It was within the powers of that Court, if it saw fit to do so, to make an order permitting the appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty and directing a new trial but their decision not to do so was one involving questions of fact or mixed fact and law, not a question of law in the strict sense, unless it can be said that the question on which leave to appeal to this Court was granted should be answered in the affirmative.\nThe question before us is whether the learned trial Judge erred in law in accepting the plea of guilty without making inquiry as to whether the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the effect of such plea.\nNo doubt when a plea of guilty is offered and there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing, the judge or magistrate will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does so and the extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge to which the accused is pleading. An illustration of the care exercised in a case where the accused pleaded guilty to murder at a time when the imposition of the death sentence was obligatory, is furnished by the case of Rex v. Bliss[1].\nThe extent of the duty of inquiry resting on a judge or magistrate before whom a plea of guilty is offered is discussed in R. v. Johnson and Creanza[2] and in Rex v. Hand (No. 1)[3], both decisions of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. In the second of these, Bird J.A., as he then was, speaking for the Court said at page 389:\nThis Court in two recent cases has had occasion to express the opinion that a plea of guilty ought not to be accepted unless the Judge or Magistrate is sufficiently informed in open Court of the facts upon which the accused pleads guilty, to provide assurance that the accused understands the offence to which his plea relates: Cf. R. v. Theriault (unreported) and R. v. Johnson & Creanza, (1945) 4 D.L.R. 75, 85 Can. C.C. 56. This course is more particularly essential where the offence, as here, involves a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and whipping.\nIn Rex v. Milina[4], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia consisting of Sloan C.J.B.C. and O\u2019Halloran, Robertson, Sidney Smith and Bird JJ.A. again considered the cases above referred to. Sidney Smith J.A., with whom Sloan C.J.B.C. and Robertson J.A. agreed, said at page 592, after referring to the language used in the Hand case:\nBut however that may be, it is desirable to state now quite plainly that in my opinion when an accused person pleads guilty it is not the law that the magistrate must go into the facts in order to satisfy himself that the accused is in fact guilty. If that were so there would be an end at once to any efficacy in a plea of guilty.\nWhat the quoted language does mean is that upon a plea of guilty the magistrate should satisfy himself that the accused knows exactly what he is doing when he so pleads, and knows and understands the exact nature of the offence with which he is charged. And the accused must plead guilty in \u201cplain, unambiguous and unmistakable terms\u201d (Rex v. Golatham (1915) 84 L.J.K.B. 758, 112 L.T. 1048, per Lord Reading, C.J.). The cases will be rare indeed in which a magistrate will feel himself obliged to make any special inquiry when the accused, as here, is represented by counsel. The circumstances which are contemplated by the expressions used in the above cases are those in which the accused may be a foreigner, or illiterate, or the charge is one of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave nature. Instances of these are to be found in Crankshaw\u2019s Criminal Code, 6th ed., pp. 1062-3. The practice in England is to the same effect and is thus stated in Kenny\u2019s Outlines of Criminal Law, 15th ed., at p. 558:\nIf he confesses, i.e., \u2018pleads guilty\u2019, he may be at once sentenced. But in certain cases, lest he should be confessing under some misapprehension as to the law or even as to the facts of his case, the Court often advises him to withdraw his plea of guilty, and so let the matter be fully investigated.\nThis passage, in my view, furnishes a useful guide to the practice which should be followed when a plea of guilty is offered and there is reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing. Failure to make due inquiry may well be a ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the matter is left in doubt; but in my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in the case at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of guilty to non-capital murder, the trial Judge before accepting it is bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate the accused.\nI have reached the conclusion that the question on which leave to appeal was granted should be answered in the negative.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have read the reasons of the Chief Justice as set out herein. In those reasons, the facts are set out with considerable clarity and detail and there is no need to repeat them in these reasons. With respect, I am of the opinion that it is the duty in law of the trial tribunal, whether it be magistrate or judge, to satisfy himself that the appellant understands the nature of the charge and the effect of the plea before he is entitled to accept a plea of guilty. I am in accord with the analysis made by Sidney Smith J.A. in Regina v. Milina[5], when he said, referring to the language used in Rex v. Hand (No. 1)[6]:\nWhat the quoted passage does mean is that upon a plea of guilty the magistrate should satisfy himself that the accused knows exactly what he is doing when he so pleads, and knows and understands the exact nature of the offence with which he is charged. I realize, as Avory J. said, in Vent v. The Queen[7]:\nIt is only in a case where there is some reason to doubt whether an accused person appreciates the nature of his confession or the consequences resulting from it that a jury is empanelled to try that issue.\nI also agree with Smith J.A. when he pointed out in Rex v. Milina, supra, that the cases will be rare indeed in which a magistrate will feel himself obliged to make any special inquiry when the accused, as here, is represented by counsel; but Smith J.A. pointed out that one of those cases may well be where \u201cthe accused may be a foreigner or illiterate or the charge is of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave nature\u201d. Certainly even the reduced charge of non-capital murder was a charge of an unusually grave nature. Moreover, the accused man, a Cree Indian, was certainly an illiterate, an illiterate who was described by counsel to the learned trial judge as a \u201cprimitive\u201d.\nI am of the opinion that the present case is not one in which the learned trial judge exercised his discretion. Perhaps, to put it more accurately, if it is such a case then it is one in which the learned trial judge failed to exercise his discretion in accordance with judicial principles. It would appear that the judge, in exercising the discretion to accept the plea of guilty, relied only on the fact that the accused was represented, and apparently very adequately represented, by counsel. I am of the respectful opinion that he could not, under the circumstances, so rely on counsel for in doing so he could not satisfy himself that the accused knew either the nature of the plea or the consequences thereof. Therefore, in failing to so satisfy himself, the learned trial judge was wrong in law.\nI would grant the appeal and direct a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McClung & Baker, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General of Alberta, Edmonton.\n[1] (1936), 67 C.C.C. 1, [1937] 1 D.L.R. 1.\n[2] (1945), 85 C.C.C. 56, [1945] 3 W.W.R. 201, 62 B.C.R. 199, [1945] 4 D.L.R. 75.\n[3] (1946), 85 C.C.C. 388, [1946] 1 W.W.R. 421, 1 C.R. 181, 62 B.C.R. 359, [1946] 3 D.L.R. 128.\n[4] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 584, 2 C.R. 179, 86 C.C.C. 374.\n[5] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 584, 2 C.R. 179, 86 C.C.C. 374.\n[6] (1946), 85 C.C.C. 388, [1946] 1 W.W.R. 421, 1 C.R. 181, 62 B.C.R. 359, [1946] 3 D.L.R. 128.\n[7] (1935), 25 Cr.

The opposition was on the ground that the proposed mark was confusing with the appellant\u2019s trade mark \u201cGold Band\u201d which was already registered for use in connection with the sale of cigars, cigarettes and tobaccos. The Registrar of Trade Marks rejected the opposition and granted the registration. The Exchequer Court found that the Registrar had not acted on any wrong principle or otherwise than judicially and dismissed the appeal. The Court was of the opinion that the trade marks were confusing but decided that it was precluded by the decision in Rowntree Co. Ltd. v. Paulin Chambers Co. Ltd., [1968] S.C.R. 134, from substituting its conclusion for those of the Registrar under the circumstances. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the registration refused.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ: The decision as to whether or not a trade mark is confusing within the meaning of s. 6 of the Trade Marks Act involves a judicial determination of a practical question of fact and does not involve the exercise of the Registrar\u2019s discretion. It was open to the Exchequer Court in the circumstances of this case to substitute its conclusion for that of the Registrar and it was not precluded from doing so by the decision in the Rowntree case, supra. The Exchequer Court has rightly found that the proposed trade mark was \u201cconfusing\u201d with the other.\nPer Pigeon J.: From what the Registrar has said, the appellate tribunal could not ascertain the grounds of his decision and therefore could not see whether they were well founded in law. It therefore became its duty to form its own opinion as to the proper conclusion to be reached. The Exchequer Court\u2019s finding that confusion would be likely to occur was amply supported.\nPer Cartwright C.J., dissenting: It was open to the Exchequer Court in this case to substitute its judgment for that of the Registrar and the decision in the Rowntree case, supra, did not preclude it from so doing. The question to be determined in this case involves the exercise of personal judgment. Confusion was unlikely in this case.\nMarques de commerce\u2014Enregistrement\u2014Opposition pour motif de confusion\u2014\u00abGolden Circlet\u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cigarettes\u2014\u00abGold Band\u00bb ant\u00e9rieurement enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cigares, cigarettes et tabacs\u2014La d\u00e9cision du registraire est-elle rendue dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019une discr\u00e9tion judiciaire\u2014Appel \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier de la d\u00e9cision du registraire\u2014La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier peut-elle substituer sa propre opinion \u00e0 celle du registraire\u2014Loi sur les marques de commerce, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, art. 6(2),(5), 12(1)(d), 37.\nLa compagnie appellante a produit une d\u00e9claration d\u2019opposition, en vertu de l\u2019art. 37 de la Loi sur les marques de commerce, \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement par la compagnie intim\u00e9e de la marque de commerce \u00abGolden Circlet\u00bb pour \u00eatre employ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cigarettes.

Dans les circonstances de cette cause, il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier de substituer son opinion \u00e0 celle du registraire et elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas emp\u00each\u00e9e de le faire par l\u2019arr\u00eat Rowntree, supra. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 avec raison que la marque en question cr\u00e9ait de la confusion.\nLe Juge Pigeon: Le tribunal d\u2019appel ne pouvait pas, en se basant sur ce que le registraire a dit, se rendre compte des motifs de sa d\u00e9cision et, par cons\u00e9quent constater s\u2019ils \u00e9taient bien fond\u00e9s en droit. Il lui incombait donc de former sa propre opinion sur la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il devait en arriver.

APPEL d\u2019un jugement du Pr\u00e9sident Jackett de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1] confirmant une d\u00e9cision du registraire des marques de commerce. Appel accueilli, le Juge en Chef Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks. Appeal allowed, Cartwright C.J. dissenting.\nJohn C. Osborne, Q.C., and R.M. Perry, for the appellant.\nDonald F. Sim, Q.C., and R.T. Hughes, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts and the questions raised in this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie.\nI agree with his conclusion that it was open to Jackett P. in the circumstances of this case to substitute his judgment for that of the Registrar and that he was not precluded from doing so by the decision of this Court in The Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers Co. Ltd. et al.[2]\nIt appears to me that the question whether the degree of resemblance between two trade marks in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with such trade marks are manufactured by the same person, is one involving the exercise of personal judgment in the light of all the evidence and with particular regard to the surrounding circumstances as set out in Clauses (a) to (e) of s. 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act quoted by my brother Ritchie. I have no doubt that in arriving at their conclusions in the case at bar both the learned President and the learned Registrar had all these provisions in mind.\nBearing in mind the directions of s. 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act and assuming, contrary to the fact, in favour of the appellant that it had continuously manufactured and marketed cigarettes under its trade mark \u201cGold Band\u201d, I would still be of opinion that it is unlikely in the extreme that either a retail dealer in cigarettes purchasing from a wholesaler or the average customer buying cigarettes at a tobacconist\u2019s counter would be likely to draw the inference that cigarettes contained in a package bearing the trade mark \u201cGolden Circlet\u201d were manufactured by the appellant. The question is one of a class in the determination of which judges will naturally differ, as is evidenced by the present case. With every respect for the opinion of those who entertain the contrary view, I. find myself in agreement with the conclusion of the learned Registrar which was affirmed, although unwillingly under the supposed compulsion of the Rowntree case, by the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Jackett, the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[3], dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks by which he had rejected the opposition filed by the appellant under the provisions of s. 37 of the Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49 (hereinafter called the Act) to the registration of the respondent\u2019s trade mark \u201cGOLDEN CIRCLET\u201d to be used in association with \u201ccigarettes\u201d.\nThe ground of opposition which gives rise to this appeal is the allegation that the trade mark applied for is confusing with the appellant\u2019s trade mark consisting of the words \u201cGOLD BAND\u201d which was registered for use in connection with the sale of \u201ccigars\u201d in September 1928, and with respect to the sale of \u201ccigars, cigarettes and tobaccos of every kind and description\u201d on September 12, 1958.\nUnder the provisions of s. 12(1) (d) of the Act, a trade mark is not registrable if it is \u201cconfusing with a registered trade mark\u201d and the question of whether it is confusing or not is to be determined in accordance with the standard fixed by s. 6(2) of the Act which reads as follows:\n6. (2) The use of a trade mark causes confusion with another trade mark if the use of both trade marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with such trade marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not such wares or services are of the same general class.\nI have underlined the words \u201cwould be likely to lead to the inference\u201d as it appears to me to be clear that in opposing an application for registration, the holder of a trade mark which is already registered is not required to show that the \u201cmark\u201d which is the subject of the application is the same or nearly the same as the registered mark, it being enough if it be shown that the use of this mark would be likely to lead to the inference that wares associated with it and those associated with the registered trade mark were produced by the same company.\nIn deciding whether a trade mark is \u201cconfusing\u201d within the meaning of the Act, both the Court and the Registrar are governed by the provisions of s. 6(5) which reads:\n6. (5) In determining whether trade marks or trade names are confusing the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including\n(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade marks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;\n(b) the length of time the trade marks or trade names have been in use;\n(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;\n(d) the nature of the trade; and\n(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade marks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.\nIn the present case, after reciting the grounds for the appellant\u2019s opposition, the learned Registrar concluded by saying:\nI have duly considered the evidence and the written arguments filed by both parties. Neither party requested a hearing. Having regard to the circumstances of the case on the basis of the evidence adduced, I have come to the conclusion that the grounds of opposition are not well founded. The marks are sufficiently different in appearance, in sound and in the ideas suggested by them to preclude confusion within the meaning of Section 6 of the Trade Marks Act.\nThe opposition is accordingly rejected pursuant to section 37(8) of the Trade Marks Act.\nIt was suggested in the argument before us that because the learned Registrar appeared to confine his reasons for rejecting the opposition to the ground that the requirements of s. 6(5)(e) had not been met, it should therefore be assumed that he had ignored the provisions of s. 6(5)(a) to (d) inclusive. In view of the fact that these grounds are specifically dealt with in the evidence and that the Registrar expressly says that he reached his conclusion \u201con the basis of the evidence adduced\u201d, I do not think that this contention is tenable and, like Mr. Justice Jackett, I am unable to find that the Registrar acted on any wrong principle or otherwise than judicially.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment in the Exchequer Court, the learned President, having reviewed the evidence, expressed himself as follows:\nGiving all due weight to the decision of the Registrar, who, I realize, has had infinitely more experience in this very specialized field than I have had, when I have regard to all the surrounding circumstances, including\n(a) the fact that the trade mark \u201cGOLD BAND\u201d, while it is not what is apparently referred to as a strong mark, had, before the respondent\u2019s application, become very well known in Canada, and the fact that the trade mark \u201cGOLDEN CIRCLET\u201d was not known at all,\n(b) the fact that the trade mark \u201cGOLD BAND\u201d had been used in Canada for at least six years before the application was made, and the fact that the trade mark \u201cGOLDEN CIRCLET\u201d has not been used at all\n(c) the fact that cigars and cigarettes are closely related wares,\n(d) the fact that the wares in question are ordinarily sold by the same retailer over the same counter, and\n(e) the fact that there is a very substantial resemblance between the trade mark \u201cGOLD BAND\u201d and the trade mark \u201cGOLDEN CIRCLET\u201d (when they are considered on a first impression basis and not by way of a detailed comparison) in appearance, sound and the ideas suggested by them,\nI cannot escape the conclusion that if those two trade marks were used in the same area it would be very likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with them were manufactured by the same person and thus that, by virtue of section 6(1), the one is \u2018confusing\u2019 with the other for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act.\nIf, therefore, it were my duty on this appeal to come to a conclusion as to what the Registrar should have decided, and to substitute my conclusion for his if I come to a different one, I would allow this appeal.\nMr. Justice Jackett, however, treated the decision of this Court in The Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers Co. Ltd., et al.[4] as a binding authority which precluded him from interfering with the conclusion reached by the Registrar of Trade Marks on such an application unless it could be shown that the Registrar had \u201cproceeded on some wrong principle or that he failed to exercise his discretion judicially\u201d. In the Rowntree case the application for registration of the Trade mark SMOOTHIES in respect of candy had been refused by the Registrar on the ground that it was confusing with the Rowntree Company\u2019s registered trade marks SMARTIE and SMARTIES, but in the Exchequer Court Mr. Justice Gibson reached the opposite conclusion and allowed the registration.\nOn appeal to this Court it was found that in determining the question of confusion the Registrar of Trade Marks had directed himself in accordance with the provisions of s. 6 and had therefore adopted the proper approach to the question before him, whereas the finding of Mr. Justice Gibson that there was \u201cno probability of confusion\u201d between the trade mark applied for and the registered trade marks and his further finding that the meaning of the words \u201cSmoothies\u201d and \u201cSmarties\u201d is \u201centirely dissimilar\u201d were based in large measure on the definition of these words in Webster\u2019s 3rd New International Dictionary. In this regard the Court expressed the opinion that the essential question to be determined did not necessarily involve the resemblance between the dictionary meaning of the words used in the trade mark applied for and those in the registered trade marks and concluded:\nIt is enough\u2026 if the words used in the registered and unregistered trade marks are likely to suggest the idea that the wares with which they are associated were produced or marketed by the same person. This is the approach which appears\u2026 to have been adopted by the Registrar of Trade Marks.\nThe appeal might well have been disposed of on this basis without further comment but in the course of his argument before this Court, counsel for Paulin Chambers Company Limited made the following submission:\nIn respondent\u2019s submission, the learned trial judge, who by reason of s. 55(5) of the Trade Marks Act was entitled to exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar, correctly came to the conclusion that the trade marks are not confusing.\nThis contention was made the subject of very full argument on both sides and it was accordingly dealt with in the reasons for judgment where it was said:\nIt is contended on behalf of the respondent that the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge should not be disturbed having regard to the terms of s. 55(5) of the Act which provides that \u2018on the appeal\u2026 the Court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar\u2019. I do not, however, take this as meaning that the Court is entitled to sub- stitute its view for that of the Registrar unless it can be shown that he proceeded on some wrong principle or that he failed to exercise his discretion judicially.\nIn the present case the learned President construed this paragraph as deciding that in reviewing findings of fact made by the Registrar as well as in reviewing any exercise of his discretion, the Exchequer Court could only interfere on the ground that there had been an error in principle or a failure to act judicially. It is not difficult to appreciate this misunderstanding of the passage, but it should be made plain that this Court was there concerned exclusively with the effect to be given to the words \u2018on the appeal\u2026 the Court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar\u2019 as these words occur in s. 55(5) of the Act. It is to be observed that in the paragraph directly following the passage above quoted, reference is made to the decision of Lord Evershed In the Matter of Broadhead\u2019s Application for Registration of a Trade Mark[5], in which he cited the well-known statement made by Lord Dunedin in George Banham and Company v. F. Reddaway and Company Limited[6], where he said:\nNow it is true that an appeal lies from the decision of the Registrar, but, in my opinion, unless he has gone clearly wrong, his decision ought not to be interfered with. The reason for that is that it seems to me that to settle whether a trade mark is distinct or not\u2014and that is the criterion laid down by the statute\u2014is a practical question, and a question that can only be settled by considering the whole of the circumstances of the case.\nIn my view, the decision as to whether or not a trade mark is confusing within the meaning of s. 6 of the Act involves a judicial determination of a practical question of fact and does not involve the exercise of the Registrar\u2019s discretion. The provisions of s. 49(7), (9) and (10) which are concerned with the registration of a person as a registered user of a trade mark, afford illustrations of cases in which a discretionary power is vested in the Registrar, but this is not such a case.\nI adopt what was said by Lord Dunedin in the last-quoted passage as applying to an appeal from a decision of the Canadian Registrar of Trade Marks on the question of whether or not an application for the registration of a trade mark should be refused on the ground that it is con- fusing with a registered trade mark, subject, however, to the qualification expressed by Lord Wright in In the Matter of an Application by J. & P. Coats Limited for Registration of a Trade Mark[7], where he commented on Lord Dunedin\u2019s statement, saying, at page 375:\nWith great respect to the learned Lord, the word \u2018clearly\u2019 may perhaps be regarded as tautologous. If, in the view of the Court, examining all the circumstances, the Registrar has gone wrong, then that must mean that he has gone clearly wrong. The only matter to observe is that prima facie the Registrar\u2019s decision will be regarded as correct.\nIn my view the Registrar\u2019s decision on the question of whether or not a trade mark is confusing should be given great weight and the conclusion of an official whose daily task involves the reaching of conclusions on this and kindred matters under the Act should not be set aside lightly but, as was said by Mr. Justice Thorson, then President of the Exchequer Court, in Freed and Freed Limited v. The Registrar of Trade Marks et al[8]:\n\u2026reliance on the Registrar\u2019s decision that two marks are confusingly similar must not go to the extent of relieving the judge hearing an appeal from the Registrar\u2019s decision of the responsibility of determining the issue with due regard to the circumstances of the case.\nI am accordingly of the opinion that it was open to Mr. Justice Jackett in the circumstances of this case to substitute his conclusion for that of the Registrar and I do not think that he was precluded from doing so by the decision of this Court in The Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers et al., supra.\nThe learned President has made an extensive review of the evidence and has stated in the clearest terms his reasons for finding that if the two trade marks here in issue\n\u2026were used in the same area it would be very likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with them were manufactured by the same person and thus that, by virtue of section 6(1), one is \u2018confusing\u2019 with the other for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act.\nI am in full agreement with the reasoning and conclusion of Mr. Justice Jackett in this regard and I have nothing to add to what he has said. I would accordingly allow this appeal and give effect to the opposition filed by the appellant with the result that the respondent\u2019s application for registration of the trade mark in the words \u201cGOLDEN CIRCLET\u201d is refused.\nThe appellant will have its costs of this appeal and of the appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nPIGEON J.:\u2014I agree with Ritchie J. and wish to add the following.\nAs my brother Fauteux has pointed out in Dorval v. Bouvier[9], the rule that an appellate court should not review the evidence in view of substituting its appreciation for that of the trial judge unless he is clearly wrong, is subject to the following qualification, namely, that his reasons must be explicit enough to enable the appellate tribunal to assess their legal value (\u201cencore faut-il, cependant,\u2026 que ces raisons soient en termes suffisamment explicites pour permettre \u00e0 une Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019en appr\u00e9cier la valeur au point de vue juridique\u201d).\nThis condition was fully met in the \u201cSmoothies\u201d and \u201cSmarties\u201d case[10], the Registrar having indicated as follows on what basis he found the two marks \u201cconfusing\u201d:\nThe nature of the wares and the nature of the trade in both cases is identical and the wares are distributed through the same channels of trade. Both marks are slang terms commonly used to describe a \u2018smart aleck\u2019 or a \u2018smooth operator\u2019.\nIn the instant case, however, the reasons given by him do not indicate what weight he gave to each of the factors that he considered and, especially, they do not reveal on what basis he concluded that the obvious similarities between the two marks were unlikely to lead to the inference that the wares to which they would be applied were manufactured by the same person. In effet, the Registrar did not really give explicit reasons: he summarized the case and stated his conclusion. From what he said, the appellate tribunal could not ascertain the grounds of his decision and therefore could not see whether these were well founded in law. Under those circumstances it became its duty to form its own opinion as to the proper conclusion to be reached. Having had the advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice I find myself, with the greatest respect, unable to concur in his opinion that confusion is unlikely. In my view, the situation in this case is almost identical with that which obtained in The Matter of Broadhead\u2019s Application[11]. The mark sought to be registered was \u201cAlka-vescent\u201d. The opposition came from \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d. The Court of Appeal upheld the objection although the latter trade mark was admittedly \u201cweak\u201d because \u201cAlka\u201d being descriptive could not be monopolized any more than \u201cGold\u201d can be in the circumstances of the present case. It was held that confusion was likely to arise because the idea suggested by the two marks was substantially the same, \u201cvescent\u201d being intended to suggest \u201ceffervescent\u201d and \u201cSeltzer\u201d meaning a particular kind of effervescent mineral water. Here the situation is almost exactly the same. There is no substantial difference between \u201cgold\u201d and \u201cgolden\u201d and a \u201ccirclet\u201d is a kind of \u201cband\u201d. Of course, the sound of the second word is different as in the English case, but I think this was rightly considered by the learned President as insufficient to avoid any risk of confusion when the meaning is similar.\nIt is no doubt true that if one examines both marks carefully, he will readily distinguish them. However, this is not the basis on which one should decide whether there is any likelihood of confusion.\nThe tribunal must bear in mind that the marks will not normally be seen side by side and guard against the danger that a person seeing the new mark may think that it is the same as one he has seen before, or even that it is a new or associated mark of the proprietor of the former mark. (Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 38, No. 989, p. 590).\nIn The Matter of McDowell\u2019s Application[12], Sargant L.J. said at p. 338:\nEven if the very slight distinction between \u201cNujol\u201d and \u201cNuvol\u201d were noticed, yet, having regard to the ordinary practice of large producers to register a series of similar marks to denote various grades of their produce, it seems to me highly probable that an inference of identity of origin would be drawn.\nThe practice referred to in this quotation is sanctioned by the provisions of s.15 of the Trade Marks Act respecting \u201cassociated trade marks\u201d and it should be borne in mind in considering the issue of confusion.

Under the terms of the agreement the offer to purchase was conditional upon the purchaser obtaining rezoning of the property within a stipulated period. Prior to the expiration of this period the purchaser\u2019s solicitor notified the vendors\u2019 solicitor by letter of his client\u2019s inability to obtain the rezoning and he asked for an extension of time. There were subsequent negotiations but the extension was never granted. The day following the closing date the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor purported to waive the condition as to rezoning. The vendors\u2019 solicitor, who was himself one of the vendors, denied the right of the plaintiff to waive this condition.\nAn action by the plaintiff for specific performance was dismissed by the trial judge and this dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal found that there was no extension of time and no agreement to waive the condition. The plaintiff appealed further to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe findings of fact by the Courts below against the plaintiff\u2019s submission that there was an oral agreement of waiver of the rezoning condition should not be disturbed.\nThe plaintiff could not unilaterally waive the condition, and there was no basis for an estoppel against the defendants.\nTurney et al. v.

Smith, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Judson and, subject to one reservation, with his reasons.\nI do not find it necessary to decide whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, the appellant could have invoked the maxim, quilibet potest renunciare juri pro se introducto, waived unilaterally the condition as to obtaining a rezoning of the lands agreed to be purchased and elected to pay the purchase price in full in cash instead of giving back a mortgage to secure part of that price. On the evidence and the findings of fact made in the Courts below it cannot be said that the appellant declared such waiver and election until after the date set for closing the transaction had passed.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Judson.\nThe judgment of Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an action by a purchaser of land for specific performance. The trial judge dismissed the action. His dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for reasons substantially in accordance with those given at trial. The property in question was owned by the defendants Harry M. Sherman and E. Michael Lewin, each having an undivided half interest. The other defendant, John J. Shulman, was a trustee for E. Michael Lewin. The contract was made on December 17, 1963. The property was a block of land in the Township of North York. The purchase price was $102,500, payable $2,500 as a deposit, $32,500 on closing, with a mortgage back for the balance of $67,500. The mortgage was to contain the privilege of paying part or all of the principal sum at any time without notice or bonus.\nThe agreement was subject to the following condition:\nThis offer is conditional upon the Purchaser obtaining the rezoning of the said lands on a M-5 zoning basis. Such rezoning to be obtained within 6 months from the date of the acceptance of the Offer. Provided that should the rezoning be approved by the Municipality of the Township of North York, and should it be before the Municipal Board within a six-month period, a further extension for the approval of the Municipal Board will be given for a period of 90 days, if the Municipal Board has not had an opportunity of giving its approval prior to the said extension date.\nIt is agreed that \u201cM-5\u201d is a misdescription in this condition and that it should read \u201cM-6\u201d. Nothing turns on this. It is also agreed that the closing date was June 17, 1964.\nThe purchaser submitted requisitions on title and these were answered promptly. The vendors never submitted a draft deed or a statement of adjustments. The purchaser never submitted a draft mortgage. The purchaser was trying to obtain the necessary rezoning but it became apparent that this could not be obtained before the date of closing. On June 6, 1964, the purchaser\u2019s solicitor notified the vendors\u2019 solicitor of his client\u2019s inability to obtain the rezoning and he asked for an extension of six months. The extension was never granted.\nMotek Fischtein, the secretary-treasurer of the plaintiff company, telephoned Sherman direct about June 11 and swore that he subsequently went to Sherman\u2019s office and had an interview with him. Sherman admitted the telephone call asking for an extension which was not granted and in the course of which Fischtein was advised that he, Sherman, was dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, Mr. Wilson. Sherman had no recollection of the interview in the office. The plaintiff relies on the evidence of Fischtein as to what was said in Sherman\u2019s office to establish an agreement of waiver of the rezoning condition.\nFollowing the letter of June 6, which had asked for the extension of time, there were a number of telephone conversations between Mr. Wilson, solicitor for the plaintiff, and Mr. Sherman, one the defendants who was a half-owner of the property and also solicitor for his other partner in the enterprise. Wilson was pressing for the extension and Sherman was not committing himself. He was saying that he could not get the consent of his other partner. The last of these conversations was on June 16, 1964. Sherman was still saying that he was not in a position to grant an extension of time although in fact he had been told earlier that his partner was unwilling to grant it. Wilson undoubtedly had the impression that Sherman would telephone him on the 17th for the purpose of saying whether or not the extension would be granted. There was no such call but on June 17, Sherman wrote to Wilson refusing an extension and claiming that the transaction was at an end.\nWilson received this letter on June 18, 1964, and he immediately sent a reply complaining that Sherman had promised to telephone on June 17 and had not done so. He denied Sherman\u2019s right to terminate the contract. He wished a new date to be set for closing and suggested July 3. Although he did not expressly say so in his letter, he was purporting to waive the condition as to rezoning. Sherman\u2019s reply on the following day, June 19, denied the right of the plaintiff to waive this condition.\nOn June 24, 1964, Wilson tendered an executed mortgage with interest running from June 17, 1964, and a cheque for the balance due pursuant to a statement of adjustments prepared by him and dated as of June 17, 1964, and, in the alternative, tendered a further cheque for the whole balance due under the contract including the amount to be secured by mortgage. The tender was not accepted. The following day the plaintiff issued its writ for specific performance.\nBoth the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have found that there was no extension of time and no agreement to waive the condition. The plaintiff sought to establish an oral waiver from the evidence of Fischtein, who seems to have been the controlling force in the plaintiff company. The concurrent findings of fact against this submission are clear and they do not altogether depend upon an assessment of the credibility of Fischtein and Sherman. If there had been such an agreement, there would inevitably have been some reference to this in Wilson\u2019s letters to Sherman. There is no such reference. To me, the findings of fact of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal on this point cannot be disturbed.\nThe next question is whether there was a unilateral right to waive the condition. I do not think that there was. By its express terms the offer was conditional upon the purchaser obtaining rezoning of the lands on a named zoning basis. The condition was very carefully drawn. It provided for a term of six months from the date of acceptance together with a right to an extension in a certain event. The obligations of both parties under this contract were conditional upon the happening of these events. This depended upon the will of the Township of North York. The case is squarely within the decision of this Court in Turney et al. v. Zhilka[1].\nFor the first time in this litigation it was argued before us that there was an estoppel against the defendants. It was not pleaded. There is no basis for an estoppel in this case. There is no representation or promise on which it could be founded. There was in the conversation between Wilson and Sherman on June 16, 1964, a lack of frankness on the part of Sherman. This is a charitable description of his conduct. But he did not waive the condition or extend the time or promise to do so.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Arnup, Foulds, Weir, Boeckh, Morris & Robinson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Sherman & Midanik, Toronto.\n[1] [1959] S.C.R. 578, 18 D.L.R.

These rods were made in conformity with a method of teaching arithmetic which was fully described in a book written by the plaintiff, and were referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings as \u201cworks\u201d. The plaintiff is not alleging the infringement of a copyright in any part of his book. The Exchequer Court dismissed the action and held that the rods were not a proper subject matter of copyright in this country. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe rods are not things in which copyright can be had. The originality consisted in the ideas as they were expressed in the book and the rods are merely devices which afford a practical means of employing and presenting the method. The \u201coriginal\u201d work or production, whether it be characterized as literary, artistic or scientific, was the book. In seeking to assert a copyright in the rods which are described in his book as opposed to the book itself, the plaintiff is faced with the principle that one may have a copyright in the description of an art; but, having described it, you give it to the public for their use; and there is a clear distinction between the book which describes it, and the art or mechanical device which is described.\nDroit d\u2019auteur\u2014Violation\u2014R\u00e9glettes colori\u00e9es pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019enseignement de l\u2019arithm\u00e9tique\u2014Livre d\u2019explication \u00e9crit par le demandeur\u2014R\u00e9glettes ne sont pas susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un droit d\u2019auteur\u2014Loi sur le droit d\u2019auteur, S.R.C. 1952, c. 55, art. 2, 4(1), 20(3).\nLe demandeur a poursuivi la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse pour violation d\u2019un droit d\u2019auteur qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir sur des r\u00e9glettes colori\u00e9es employ\u00e9es pour enseigner l\u2019arithm\u00e9tique dans les \u00e9coles primaires.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 in an action for infrigement of copyright. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C. for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJohn C. Osborne, Q.C. and R.M. Perry, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice No\u00ebl of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 on a \u201cspecial case\u201d directed to be tried by order of the President of that Court, in accordance with the rules thereof, for the purpose of determining certain issues which were common to four separate actions brought by the plaintiff and consolidated for the purpose of determining the issues raised by the \u201cspecial case\u201d.\nThe actions were for the infringements of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged copyright in two sets of \u201ccoloured rods of uniform square at centre cross section and of ten different lengths and colours for the teaching of the science of arithmetic in primary school grades\u201d. The issues raised by the \u201cspecial case\u201d were:\n1. Is there a copyright in the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crods\u201d which he described as \u201cworks\u201d in his various statements of claim? 2. Who is the author?\n3. Who owns the copyright?\nIt is obvious that a negative answer to the first question is sufficient to dispose of the case and Mr. Justice No\u00ebl, in a most comprehensive decision, concluded by saying that the \u201crods are not a proper subject matter of copyright in this country\u201d.\nThe rods in question were made in conformity with a system or method of teaching arithmetic which is fully described in a book written by the appellant and entitled Les Nombres en Couleurs, and, as has been indicated, they were referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings as \u201cworks\u201d. Paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim reads as follows:\nEach of the said works is an original production in the scientific domain and is one of the works referred to by the expression \u2018every literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work\u2019 in section 4(1) of the Copyright Act.\nThe relevant provisions of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55, read as follow:\n4. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist in Canada for the term hereinafter mentioned, in every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work,\u2026\nThe italics are my own.\nSection 2.(v) provides that:\n\u2018every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work\u2019 includes every original production in the literary, scientific or artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as books, pamphlets, and other writings, lectures, dramatic or dramatico-musical works, musical works or compositions with or without words, illustrations, sketches, and plastic works relative to geography, topography, architecture, or science.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn aid of the construction which appellant\u2019s counsel seeks to place upon these sections of the statute, he relies upon the presumption which he contends is created by s. 20(3) of the Act which reads:\n20. (3) In any action for infringement of copyright in any work, in which the defendant puts in issue either the existence of the copyright, or the title of the plaintiff thereto, then, in any such case,\n(a) the work shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be a work in which copyright subsists; and\n(b) the author of the work shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the owner of the copyright;\u2026 The question which lies at the threshold of this appeal is whether the rods in question are things in which copyright can be had, and if that question is answered in the negative, it does not appear to me to be necessary to comment on the close analysis to which the learned trial judge has subjected the various statutory provisions.\nThe evidence discloses, and indeed it appears to me to have been admitted, that the plaintiff is not alleging the infringement of copyright in any part of his book Les Nombres en Couleurs. I take, for example, one question and answer on cross-examination where Mr. Osborne asked:\nQ. Here is Exhibit No. 5, a book entitled \u201cLes Nombres en Couleurs\u201d. Do you claim that any defendant in Canada has copied any part of this book? A. No, I do not think so; my book, no. They are using my book to illustrate the rods that they are manufacturing.\nEven if Mr. Cuisenaire\u2019s method of teaching could be considered as an \u201coriginal production\u2026 in the\u2026 scientific domain\u201d within the meaning of s. 2(v) of the Act, the originality consisted in the ideas as they were expressed in his book and in my opinion the rods are merely devices which afford a practical means of employing the method and presenting it in graphic form to young children. The \u201coriginal\u201d work or production, whether it be characterized as literary, artistic or scientific, was the book. In seeking to assert a copyright in the \u201crods\u201d which are described in his book as opposed to the book itself, the appellant is faced with the principle stated by Davey L.J. in the case of Hollinrake v. Truswell[2], where he says:\nNo doubt one may have copyright in the description of an art; but, having described it, you give it to the public for their use; and there is a clear distinction between the book which describes it, and the art or mechanical device which is described.\nThis principle was discussed and adopted by President Thorson in the Exchequer Court of Canada in Moreau v. St. Vincent[3], where he said:\nIt is, I think, an elementary principle of copyright law that an author has no copyright in ideas but only in his expression of them. The law of copyright does not give him any monopoly in the use of the ideas with which he deals or any property in them, even if they are original. His copyright is confined to the literary work in which he has expressed them. The ideas are public property, the literary work is his own. Every one may freely adopt and use the ideas but no one may copy his literary work without his consent.\nThis principle is recognized by Dr. Fox in the 2nd edition (1967) of his work The Canadian Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs where he says, at page 45:\nNot only is it not required that there should be any originality in the idea of the work, but a novel idea as distinct from the form in which the idea is expressed is not capable of being the subject of copyright protection.\nI have considered the many Canadian cases cited by Dr. Fox, all of which appear to illustrate this principle.\nWhat is alleged in the present case is that the respondent has distributed to school trustees and others sets of rods which are substantially the same as those which the appellant claims to have made and that the respondent has thereby \u201cwithout consent of the plaintiff reproduced and authorized the reproduction of the said works or a substantial part thereof\u2026\u201d What has in fact happened is that the respondent has adopted and used the ideas contained in the appellant\u2019s literary work and I find that its actions come directly within the language employed by President Thorson in the above quoted excerpt from his reasons for judgment. The matter is graphically illustrated by the brief quotation from the reasons for judgment of Page J. in Cuisenaire v. Reed[4], cited by the learned trial judge, where the question at issue was whether the use and distribution of \u201crods\u201d made in conformity with the directions contained in the present appellant\u2019s book, constituted a breach of copyright under the Copyright Act then in force in Australia. Pape J. said, at page 735:\nWere the law otherwise, every person who carried out the instructions in the handbook in which copyright was held to subsist in Meccano Ltd. v. Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd. (1918) 18 S.R. (N.S.W.) 606, and constructed a model in accordance with those instructions, would infringe the plaintiff\u2019s literary copyright. Further, as Mr. Fullagar put it, everybody who made a rabbit pie in accordance with the recipe of Mrs. Beeton\u2019s Cookery Book would infringe the literary copyright in that book. For these reasons I do not think that the \u201crods\u201d in question are things in which copyright can be had and I would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1968] 1 Ex.

Having refused to have sexual intercourse, she was physically and sexually assaulted and then forced from the stranger\u2019s automobile. When interviewed in the hospital, she described her attacker and the automobile. Some four months later, she identified the appellant as her attacker. The appellant\u2019s car was different from the one described as the car which the attacker drove. The appellant did not testify nor was any evidence called on his behalf. The evidence of the complainant was uncorroborated. It appears from the record that the trial judge was in some doubt that he had to apply s. 134 of the Criminal Code to the question of identity as well as to the assault. The appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the question as to whether the trial judge, having regard to the terms of s. 134, misdirected himself as to the burden of proof.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ.: The trial judge had to instruct himself in accordance with s. 134 of the Code not only as to the fact of the rape but also on the matter of identity. The record discloses that either the judge concluded that corroboration was not necessary on the question of identity, or he found that he could satisfy himself beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s story (her identification of the appellant) was true from the fact that the appellant offered no explanation or contradiction. In either case, the judge was in error. The appellant\u2019s failure to deny the charge could not be corroboration under s. 134. A burden was placed on the appellant which the law says does not exist.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux and Martland JJ.: It was necessary for the trial judge, as a judge of the facts, to instruct himself in accordance with s. 134 of the Criminal Code. There is, in the judge\u2019s reasons for judgment, the implication that he was finding the appellant guilty not because he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s evidence was true, but partly because the appellant had not gone into the witness box to deny what she had said. It was not enough, in order to find guilt, to have evidence tending toward the appellant\u2019s guilt. It was necessary for the Court to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s evidence was true. There was not due compliance with the requirements of s. 134 of the Code.\nDroit criminel\u2014Viol\u2014T\u00e9moignage de la plaignante non corrobor\u00e9\u2014Identit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9venu\u2014Directives erron\u00e9es quant au fardeau de la preuve\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, art. 134.\nLa plaignante, une femme mari\u00e9e, a accept\u00e9 alors qu\u2019elle attendait un autobus, l\u2019offre faite par un \u00e9tranger de la reconduire chez elle en automobile. Ayant refus\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des rapports sexuels, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9e physiquement et sexuellement, et, apr\u00e8s coup, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e hors de l\u2019automobile de l\u2019\u00e9tranger. A l\u2019hopital, elle a d\u00e9crit son assaillant ainsi que l\u2019automobile. Quelque quatre mois plus tard, elle a identifi\u00e9 l\u2019appelant comme \u00e9tant celui qui l\u2019avait attaqu\u00e9e. L\u2019automobile de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9crite. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte en sa faveur. La preuve de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas corrobor\u00e9e. Le dossier fait voir que le juge au proc\u00e8s n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certain que l\u2019art. 134 du Code criminel s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la question d\u2019identit\u00e9 aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 celle de l\u2019assaut. La d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel. L\u2019appelant a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 cette Cour sur la question de savoir si le juge au proc\u00e8s, vu les termes de l\u2019art. 134, s\u2019\u00e9tait donn\u00e9 des directives erron\u00e9es quant au fardeau de la preuve.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et un nouveau proc\u00e8s ordonn\u00e9.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence: Les directives que le juge au proc\u00e8s devait se donner devaient \u00eatre conformes \u00e0 l\u2019art. 134 du Code non seulement sur le fait du viol mais aussi sur la question d\u2019identit\u00e9. Le dossier montre soit que le juge a conclu que la corroboration n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire sur la question d\u2019identit\u00e9, ou qu\u2019il pouvait se convaincre au del\u00e0 d\u2019un doute raisonnable que la version de la plaignante (sur l\u2019identification de l\u2019appelant) \u00e9tait v\u00e9ridique du fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a offert aucune explication ou contradiction. Dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre cas, le juge a err\u00e9. Le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelant de nier l\u2019accusation ne peut pas \u00eatre une corroboration sous l\u2019art. 134. Un fardeau que la loi dit ne pas exister a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 sur les \u00e9paules de l\u2019appelant.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Fauteux et Martland: Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que le juge au proc\u00e8s, comme juge des faits, se donne des directives conformes \u00e0 l\u2019art. 134 du Code criminel. Il est implicite dans les notes de jugement du juge qu\u2019il d\u00e9clarait l\u2019appelant coupable non pas parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait convaincu au del\u00e0 d\u2019un doute raisonnable que la preuve de la plaignante \u00e9tait v\u00e9ridique, mais en partie parce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour r\u00e9futer ce qu\u2019elle a dit. Pour conclure \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant d\u2019avoir une preuve tendant \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que la Cour soit convaincue au del\u00e0 d\u2019un doute raisonnable que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante \u00e9tait v\u00e9ridique.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction for rape. Appeal allowed.\nIan G. Scott, for the appellant.\nBrian Crane, for the respondent.\nCartwright C.J. and Spence J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The accused was charged with rape and tried by Manning J. in the Supreme Court of Alberta without a jury. He was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison. An appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was dismissed. This appeal is by leave on the following question of law:\nDid the learned trial judge, having regard to the terms of Section 134 of the Criminal Code, misdirect himself as to the burden of proof?\nOn August 22, 1966, the complainant, a married woman, Dorothy Rose Smith, spent the late evening in a beverage room in the Royal Hotel at the City of Edmonton. After leaving the hotel at approximately 11:00 p.m. and while waiting for a bus, she was offered a ride homeward by a stranger who was alone in an automobile. After some hesitation, she accepted and got in the car. They had only driven a short distance when the driver proposed intercourse which she refused. The automobile was then driven into a laneway where the complainant was physically and sexually assaulted. The assault was a vicious one, and having had intercourse the driver shoved the complainant from the automobile and abandoned her in a semi-nude and hysterical condition. The complainant ran to the nearest house and was given assistance. The police were called and the complainant taken to Misericordia Hospital. The complainant\u2019s story of the attack was wholly credible and the place where she had been attacked was identified by parts of her clothing and effects which were found there. There is no question but that a rape took place. This appeal is concerned solely with the question of the identity of the appellant as the assailant.\nAs a new trial is being ordered, I will not refer to the evidence except in general terms,\nMrs. Smith was interviewed in the hospital by Detective Waite. She described her assailant as a man with blonde, bushy hair, 5 feet 8 inches in height, 160 pounds, wearing dark pants and a white shirt, who talked with an accent, German or Hungarian. She also described the automobile as one she believed to be an older model Chrysler product, cream or off-white in colour and very dirty.\nOn December 21, 1966 four months later, Mrs. Smith purported to identify the appellant as the man who had attacked her. Prior to the lineup, she was shown an automobile which she said she identified as the one in which she had been attacked. This automobile which belonged to the appellant was a 1957 Chevrolet, blue body with white top, very dirty both inside and out.\nThe appellant did not testify nor was any evidence called on his behalf. In his summation, counsel for the appellant drew Manning J.\u2019s attention to s. 134 of the Criminal Code which reads:\n134. Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, where an accused is charged with an offence under section 136, 137, subsection (1) or (2) of section 138 or subsection (1) of section 141, the judge shall, if the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given under oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed and that evidence is not corroborated in a material particular by evidence that implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it is not safe to find the accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration, but that they are entitled to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence is true.\nEven though this was not a jury case, it is beyond question that the learned trial judge had to instruct himself in accordance with this section, not only as to the fact of the rape but also on the matter of identity: Regina v. Ethier[1]. In Regina v. McMillan[2], which was a case of an appeal from a magistrate who had convicted on a complainant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, Kirby J. quashed the conviction. The headnote in the case reads:\nIt was held that, in the absence of any words by the magistrate indicating that he had directed himself as to the danger of convicting in the absence of any corroboration of complainant\u2019s story, the appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed. Such a direction must be given, and must appear to have been given, no less in the case of a judge sitting alone, than in the case of a judge sitting with a jury, not only in cases of charges under the Criminal Code, 1953-54, ch. 51, but in all judicial inquiries involving sexual offences;\u2026\nThe same point was dealt with by the Privy Council in Chiu Nang Hong v. Public Prosecutor[3], where Lord Donovan said at p. 1285:\nTheir Lordships would add that even had this been a case where the judge had in mind the risk of convicting without corroboration, but nevertheless decided to do so because he was convinced of the truth of the complainant\u2019s evidence, nevertheless they do not think that the conviction could have been left to stand. For in such a case a judge, sitting alone, should, in their Lordship\u2019s view, make it clear that he has the risk in question in his mind, but nevertheless is convinced by the evidence, even though uncorroborated, that the case against the accused is established beyond any reasonable doubt. No particular form of words is necessary for this purpose: What is necessary is that the judge\u2019s mind upon the matter should be clearly revealed.\nIt appears from the record that Manning J. was in some doubt that he had to apply the provisions of s. 134 of the Criminal Code to the question of identity as well as to the assault. This is made manifest in the record where the following appears:\nTHE COURT: Mr. Buchanan, it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence, dangerous to convict, does this apply also to the question of corroboration, not corroboration, but as to identity?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Yes, it does My Lord, if I may refer Your Lordship to the case of\u2014\nTHE COURT: Where identity is not denied.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Each issue must be corroborated.\nTHE COURT: When the accused does not deny identity?.\nHaving heard further submissions from counsel for the appellant which concluded with, \u201chowever I do base my final argument on the question of identity sir.\u201d the learned; trial judge said: \u201cI would like to think this over until two o\u2019clock. We will adjourn until that time.\u201d\nWhen Court reconvened at 2:00 o\u2019clock, the record is as follows:\nTHE COURT: Gentlemen, it seemed to me at the conclusion of the evidence this morning and at the conclusion of the arguments that I have heard from you two that I could not come to any other conclusion than that the charge had been established, and this was after taking into consideration the provisions of Section 134. However, as you know I wanted to consider this over the noon adjournment, and having given it more careful consideration I still feel that I should not come to any other conclusion than that the charge has been established.\nI particularly refer to this statement of the law in Regina and Coffin, 1956 Supreme Court Reports at Page 228 in which Mr. Justice Kellock has referred with approval to a statement of Lord Tenterden in which Lord Tenterden said this:\n\u201cNo person is to be required to explain or contradict, until enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which the proof tends be untrue, and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human reason do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?\u201d\nAnd accordingly I find the accused guilty of the offence with which he has been charged.\nIt seems clear that when Manning J. said in the extract just quoted:\nGentlemen, it seemed to me at the conclusion of the evidence this morning and at the conclusion of the arguments that I have heard from you two that I could not come to any other conclusion than that the charge had been established, and this was after taking into consideration the provisions of Section 134.\nhe was referring to the assault aspect of the case and not to the question of identity. Were it otherwise, there was no need for him to give the matter further consideration and that becomes even clearer when he found it necessary to consider the effect of appellant\u2019s failure to deny the charge.\nI cannot but hold that in applying the statement of Lord Tenterden as he did, and concluding with \u201cAnd accordingly I find the accused guilty of the offence with which he has been charged.\u201d (Emphasis added) the learned trial judge erred in law and misdirected himself as to the bur- den of proof. It is manifest either that he concluded that corroboration was not necessary on the question of identity or, alternatively, that he found he could satisfy himself beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s story (her identification of the appellant) was true from the fact that the appellant offered no explanation or contradiction. In either case, he was in error.\nAppellant\u2019s failure to deny the charge could not be corroboration under s. 134, and in imposing an onus on the appellant to offer an explanation or contradiction he was placing a burden on him which the law says does not exist.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nCartwright C.J. and Fauteux J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The essential facts in this case have been stated in the reasons of my brother Hall. I am in agreement with him that this appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nMy reasons for reaching this conclusion are these. The offence with which the appellant was charged was under s, 136 of the Criminal Code. Section 134 of the Code provides:\n134. Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, where an accused is charged with an offence under section 136, 137, subsection (1) or (2) of section 138 or subsection (1) of section 141, the judge shall, if the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given under oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed and that evidence is not corroborated in a material particular by evidence that implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it is not safe to find the accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration, but that they are entitled to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence is true.\nAs has been pointed out by my brother Hall, although the trial in this case was by judge alone, it was necessary for the learned trial judge, as a judge of the facts, to instruct himself in accordance with this section.\nThe only evidence in this case which implicated the appellant was that of the complainant. Her evidence, in that respect, was not corroborated by any evidence which implicated the appellant. In these circumstances, while it was open to him to find the appellant guilty of the offence charged, it was only proper for him to do so if he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence was true.\nThe learned trial judge, in stating his reasons at the conclusion of the trial, had this to say:\nGentlemen, it seemed to me at the conclusion of the evidence this morning and at the conclusion of the arguments that I have heard from you two that I could not, come to any other conclusion than that the charge had been established, and this was after taking into consideration the provisions of Section 134. However, as you know I wanted to consider this over the noon adjournment, and having given it more careful consideration I still feel that. I should not come to any other conclusion than that the charge has been established.\nI particularly refer to this statement of the law in Regina and Coffin, 1956 Supreme Court Reports at Page 228 in which Mr. Justice Kellock has referred with approval to a statement of Lord Tenterden in which Lord Tenterden said this:\n\u201cNo person is to be required to explain or contradict, until enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which , the proof tends be untrue, and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human reason do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?\u201d\nAnd accordingly I find the accused guilty of the offence with which he has been charged.\nThere is, to me, in this statement, the implication that he was finding the appellant guilty not because he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s evidence was true, but partly because the appellant had not gone into the witness box to deny what she had said. The passage quoted from Lord Tenterden\u2019s judgment in R. v. Burdett[4], as applied in the circumstances of this case, meant that the learned trial judge, in a situation where the appellant had offered no explanation or contradiction, felt that he could not \u201cdo otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends\u201d (the italics are my own).\nIn my view this reasoning is not satisfactory in a case to which s. 134 applies. It was not enough, in order to find guilt, to have evidence tending toward the appellant\u2019s guilt, coupled with the absence of any denial by him, It was necessary for the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s evidence was true.\nAs I am not satisfied that there was due compliance with the requirements of s. 134, I feel the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cameron, Brewin & Scott, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Alberta.\n[1] [1959] O.R. 533 at 536, 31 C.R. 30, 124 C.C.C. 332.\n[2] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 677.\n[3] [1964] 1 W.L.R. 1279.\n[4] (1820), 4 B. & Ald. 95 at 161, 106 E.R. 873.\n"

(Can.), c. 51, s. 584(1)(a).\nThe appellant corporation, a manufacturer of electrical appliances, was indicted on four counts of attempting to induce retail dealers to resell its products at prices not less than the minimum prices specified by it, contrary to s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314. The evidence tendered consisted in large measure of documents such as letters addressed to all dealers in certain commodities, price lists distributed to dealers and interdepartmental correspondence. The appellant was convicted on two counts and an order of prohibition was granted. The trial judge acquitted on the other two counts on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of inducement. An appeal by the Crown from the acquittal was allowed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal which also varied the order of prohibition. The corporation appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part and the verdict of acquittal restored.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The finding by the trial judge that the case presented by the Crown did not establish the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not involve \u201ca question of law alone\u201d so as to entitle the Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal under the provisions of s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. Section 41(2) (c) of the Combines Investigation Act provides that documents, such as the letters in this case, which were in the possession of the accused \u201cshall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence\u201d that the accused had knowledge of the documents and their contents and that anything recorded in them as having been done, said or agreed upon by the accused or its agent, was done, said or agreed upon. The trial judge is in no way precluded by that section from considering the weight to be attached to that evidence in considering the issue of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence. Accepting the view of the Court of Appeal that the evidence here was sufficient to support a conviction, the further question of whether the guilt of the accused should be inferred from that evidence, was one of fact within the province of the judge. It is well settled that the sufficiency of evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law. However wrong the Court of Appeal or this Court may think that the trial judge was in reaching the conclusion that the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt, this error cannot be determined without passing judgment on the reasonableness of the verdict or the sufficiency of the evidence, and these are not matters over which the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under s. 584(1)(a) of the Code.\nPer Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The evidence contained in the documents produced at the trial amounted to an admission of an attempt to induce dealers to sell at not less than a specified minimum price. There was no evidence which could give rise to a reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offence so as to rebut the presumption created by s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act. Reasonable doubt must be based upon evidence adduced at the trial. There was therefore no course but to convict the accused.\nThe Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to consider the appeal from the acquittal by the trial judge. It was an error in law for the trial judge to charge himself, as it would appear that he did, that the Crown in order to support the charges had to prove an inducing by agreement, threat or promise. The Crown had only to prove the intent to induce and an overt act toward the accomplishment of that intent. These were proven on prima facie evidence which by lack of contradiction became conclusive evidence. When there is, as in the present case, a statutory presumption to be applied, once the facts necessary to give rise to it are found by the trial judge to be established beyond reasonable doubt, the question whether the inference of guilt should be made is no longer anything but a question of law alone.\nDroit criminel\u2014Appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel\u2014Question de droit seulement\u2014Prix minimum de revente sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 par fabricant\u2014Acquittement de l\u2019accusation de tentative de maintenir un prix de revente est-il susceptible d\u2019appel\u2014Pr\u00e9somptions\u2014Suffisance de la preuve est-elle une question de fait ou de droit\u2014Loi relative aux enqu\u00eates sur les coalitions, S.R.C. 1952, c. 814, art 34(2), 41(2)\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 584(1)(a).

Appeal allowed in part, Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nGeorge D. Finlayson, Q.C. and Burton Tait, for the appellant.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C. and R.B. Tuer, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] (Laskin J.A. dissenting) whereby that Court allowed an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal of the appellant on the 3rd and 4th counts of an indictment charging attempted resale price maintenance contrary to s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines Investigation Act, which reads as follows:\n34. (2) No dealer shall directly or indirectly by agreement, threat, promise or any other means whatsoever, require or induce or attempt to require or induce any other person to resell an article or commodity\n(b) at a price not less than a minimum price specified by the dealer or established by agreement. The indictment contains four counts, each specifying offences contrary to s. 34(2) (b) and the evidence tendered consisted in large measure of documents such as letters addressed to \u201call dealers\u201d in certain commodities, price lists distributed by the appellant to various dealers, and interdepartmental correspondence between some of the appellant company\u2019s salesmen and the company\u2019s head office.\nThe circumstances giving rise to these charges were that the appellant had devised and was seeking to implement a plan which it described as its \u201cminimum profitable resale price plan\u201d or \u201cM.R.P.\u201d plan. This plan purported to be conceived in conformity with the provisions of s. 34(5) of the Act which are generally accepted as having been enacted in order to enable dealers to control the practice employed by some retailers of selling a product or products at a loss in order to induce customers to patronize their sales outlet for other products. Section 34(5) reads as follows:\n(5) Where, in a prosecution under this section, it is proved that the person charged refused or counselled the refusal to sell or supply an article to any other person, no inference unfavourable to the person charged shall be drawn from such evidence if he satisfies the court that he and any one upon whose report he depended had reasonable cause to believe and did believe\n(a) that the other person was making a practice of using articles supplied by the person charged as loss-leaders, that is to say, not for the purpose of making a profit thereon but for purposes of advertising;\n(b) that the other person was making a practice of using articles supplied by the person charged not for the purpose of selling such articles at a profit but for the purpose of attracting customers to his store in the hope of selling them other articles;\n(c) that the other person was making a practice of engaging in misleading advertising in respect of articles supplied by the person charged; or\n(d) that the other person made a practice of not providing the level of servicing that purchasers of such articles might reasonably expect from such other person.\nThere was ample evidence to show that in putting its \u201cM.R.P.\u201d plan into effect, in purported compliance with this section, the appellant had in fact violated s. 34(2) (b) of the Act in the cities of Toronto and St. Catharines in the Province of Ontario in the manner alleged in the 1st and 2nd counts of the indictment upon which it was convicted, but the 3rd and 4th counts related to attempts- to induce retailers in the City of Vancouver to comply with the plan in the same fashion and, as I have indicated, the learned trial judge did not find that these charges had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe evidence has been extensively reviewed in the judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Schroeder on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal and I do not find it necessary to deal with it in any detail because I am satisfied that the point to be determined on this appeal is a very narrow one and turns on the question of whether or not the grounds of appeal alleged before the Court of Appeal involved \u201ca question of law alone\u201d so as to give that court jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 584(1) of the Criminal Code which read as follows:\n584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal\n(a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,\u2026\nIn support of the allegations of attempted inducement contained in the 3rd and 4th counts, the Crown produced correspondence between two of the Company\u2019s salesmen in Vancouver, (Schell and Thompson) and the Company\u2019s head office which described their dealings with the Army and Navy Department Store Limited and ABC Television & Appliances Limited respectively in furtherance of the Company\u2019s \u201cM.R.P.\u201d plan.\nAs to the allegation respecting the Army and Navy Department Store Limited, (count 3), the learned trial judge, after reviewing the Schell correspondence and pointing out that the Company\u2019s representative at head office had written to say that he had never called on this retailer during the whole time that he was in Vancouver, went on to say:\nThis would indicate that Army & Navy was not a Sunbeam retailer and may not have received copies of Exhibits 4 and 5. While it would appear that the period of three weeks in which the calls were made by Schell on Army & Navy Stores was within the period set out in the count, such fact is not clear. The evidence as to inducement on this count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.\nIn considering the 4th count, the learned trial judge reviewed the evidence contained in the letter from Thompson to his head office concerning ABC Television & Appliances Limited and concluded:\nThere is here neither sufficient evidence of inducement on the part of the accused nor that the alleged offence took place within the time charged. This charge must therefore be dismissed.\nThe italics are my own.\nAs the evidence on the 3rd and 4th charges was almost entirely documentary, the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal turns in some measure on the meaning to be attached to the provisions of s. 41(2) of the Act which read as follows:\n(2) In a prosecution under Part V,\n(a) anything done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant, shall prima facie be deemed to have been done, said or agreed upon, as the case may be, with the authority of that participant;\n(b) a document written or received by an agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed to have been written or received, as the case may be, with the authority of that participant; and\n(c) a document proved to have been in the possession of a participant or on premises used or occupied by a participant or in the possession of an agent of a participant shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence\n(i) that the participant had knowledge of the document and its contents,\n(ii) that anything recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed upon by any participant or by an agent of a participant was done, said or agreed upon as recorded and, where anything is recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant, that it was done, said or agreed upon with the authority of that participant,\n(iii) that the document, where it appears to have been written by any participant or by an agent of a participant, was so written and, where it appears to have been written by an agent of a participant, that it was written with the authority of that participant.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Schroeder expressed the view that the Crown\u2019s proof as to the 3rd and 4th counts was \u201csufficiently clear and cogent to support a conviction on these charges\u201d (the italics are my own) and that as no evidence was called on behalf of the defence, the trial judge was not justified as a matter of law in acquitting the accused. In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Justice Schroeder cited, amongst other cases, the decision of this Court in Girvin v. The King[3] where Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J.C., speaking for the Court at page 169, said:\nI have always understood the rule to be that the Crown in a criminal case is not required to do more than produce evidence which if unanswered and believed is sufficient to raise a prima facie case upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict.\nI do not think that any authority is needed for the proposition that, when the Crown has proved a prima facie case and no evidence is given on behalf of the accused, the jury may convict, but I know of no authority to the effect that the trier of fact is required to convict under such circumstances. The Girvin case was an appeal from the verdict of a jury which had found that the Crown\u2019s evidence established the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was held that there was sufficient evidence to support that verdict. In the present case the learned trial judge found that the case presented by the Crown did not establish the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and as I have indicated, the main question raised by this appeal is whether that finding involved a question of law alone so as to entitle the Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal under the provisions of s. 585(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, or whether it was a finding of fact or one of mixed fact and law.\nIn dealing with the evidence contained in the letters from the appellant\u2019s salesmen in which reference was made to their conversations with the retailers named in counts 3 and 4 of the indictment, Mr. Justice Schroeder, applying the provisions of s. 41(2), found that the statements so made by the salesmen \u201cconstitute direct proof by way of admissions of the attempts charged against the respondent in both counts\u201d and he went on to say:\nThat evidence is not only sufficient to get the case past the judge to the jury, but there being no issue as to the weight or credit to be given to it, it is sufficient to counterbalance the general presumption of innocence and require affirmative action by the court in convicting the accused where, as here, it is not countered or controlled by evidence tending to contradict it or render it improbable, or to prove facts inconsistent with it.\nThe italics are my own.\nWith the greatest respect I cannot agree with Mr. Justice Schroeder that the provisions of s. 41(2) in any way preclude a judge or jury from considering the weight to be attached to the evidence contained in the letters in question in determining the issue of whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\nSection 4(2)(c) simply provides that documents, such as these letters, which were in the possession of the accused \u201cshall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence\u201d that the accused had knowledge of the documents and their contents and that anything recorded in them as having been done, said or agreed upon by the accused or its agent, was done, said or agreed upon. This does not mean that the trial judge, having accepted the letters as prima facie evidence of their contents, is precluded from assessing the weight to be attached to that evidence in considering the issue of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence.\nMr. Justice Schroeder, however, went on to say:\nLooking at the correspondence between these two salesmen and the Assistant General Sales Manager of the respondent in the light of all the evidence as to the formulation of its carefully conceived plan and the various steps taken to put it into execution across the country, there is no ground upon which their statements\u2014in effect admissions\u2014should be disbelieved. In simply basing his dismissal of the charge against the accused on counts 3 and 4 on the doctrine of reasonable doubt, the learned Judge failed to direct his mind to the fact that the Crown had raised a prima facie case against the accused which clearly afforded evidence of facts from which the accused might have cleared itself, but which it did not even attempt to answer or explain. In the absence of such explanation or contradiction the Crown\u2019s proof was confirmed and became sufficiently clear and cogent to support a conviction. The learned Judge\u2019s failure to direct himself upon this well-settled principle was nondirection amounting to misdirection, and his consequent non-observance of it constituted an error in law which afforded the Crown a right of appeal against the acquittal.\nThe italics are my own. It appears to me that Mr. Justice Schroeder\u2019s reasoning in the last quoted paragraph is predicated on his finding that the Crown\u2019s proof was \u201csufficiently clear and cogent to support a conviction\u201d. This may well be so and if a judge or jury had convicted the accused on the 3rd and 4th counts on the evidence tendered by the Crown, I doubt very much whether such a conviction could have been set aside, but we are not dealing with an appeal from a conviction; here the accused was acquitted by the trial judge and the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was an appeal from that acquittal. While the reasoning employed by Mr. Justice Schroeder would be sound in the case of an appeal from a conviction it is not, in my respectful opinion, applicable to such an appeal as this.\nIn considering whether or not this appeal \u201cinvolves a question of law alone\u201d I think that reference may usefully be had to what was said by Rinfret J., speaking on behalf of this Court in Fraser v. The King[4], where he was considering the submission made on behalf of the accused that circumstantial evidence adduced by the Crown was equally consistent with innocence as with guilt, and he had occasion to say of that argument, at p. 301:\nTo a certain extent, this would assimilate verdicts based on circumstantial evidence \u2018as consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the accused\u2019 to verdicts where it is claimed that there is no evidence at all to support them, the view being that the court of appeal is empowered to set aside those verdicts on the ground that they are unsatisfactory, whether on account of a total lack of evidence or for want of sufficient legal evidence to support them.\nLet it be granted, however, that such a question should be deemed a question of law, or of mixed law and fact, when once it is established that the evidence is of such a character that the inference of guilt of the accused might, and could, legally and properly be drawn therefrom, the further question whether guilt ought to be inferred in the premises is one of fact within the province of the jury\u2026\nI think that these observations have a direct bearing on the present case and that, accepting the view of Mr. Justice Schroeder that the evidence here was sufficient to support a conviction, the further question of whether the guilt of the accused should be inferred from that evidence, was one of fact within the province of the judge. The law applicable to the meaning to be placed on s. 584(1) (a) under the present circumstances is stated in the judgment of this Court delivered by Taschereau J. in Rose v. The Queen[5], where he said at p. 443:\nThe trial judge sitting without a jury was fulfilling a dual capacity. He had, therefore, to discharge the duties attached to the function of a judge and also the duty of a jury. As a judge he had to direct himself as to whether any facts had been established by evidence from which criminal negligence may be reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say whether from these facts submitted, criminal negligence ought to be inferred. Metropolitan Railway Company v. Jackson, 1877 3 A.C. 193 at 197, The King v. Morabilo, 1949 S.C.R. 172 at 174. I think that the trial judge directed himself properly and that when he decided on the facts submitted to him that criminal negligence ought not to be injerred, he was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a question of fact.\nThe italics are in the original judgment.\nIn the quotations which I have taken from the judgment of the trial judge and of Mr. Justice Schroeder, I have italicized the words \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201csufficiently\u201d wherever they occur, as it appears to me that the fundamental difference between the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal was that the Court of Appeal was of opinion that the evidence on the 3rd and 4th counts was sufficient to require a verdict of guilty, whereas the trial judge did not consider it to be sufficient to support such a verdict. It is well-settled that the sufficiency of evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law and the law in this regard is well stated by Trenholme J., speaking on behalf of the Quebec Court of King\u2019s Bench in Rex v. White[6], where he said at p. 75:\nWe hold White had gone through his trial legally and the question of sufficiency of the evidence to convict is a question of fact for the judgment of the magistrate. A question of no evidence is a question of law. But it is a question of sufficiency of evidence here; it is not a question of law. Sufficiency of evidence, is always a matter for the jury to decide, or the Judge in place of the jury, and the Judge is entitled to say there is no evidence to go to the jury, but as to whether the evidence brought before the jury-supports the condemnation or acquittal is for the jury alone, and is a question of fact. Therefore, the question of the sufficiency of the evidence in the case is a question of fact and not a question of law. The reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice St. Jacques in Regina v. Boisjoly[7] are to the same effect. He there said, at page 23:\nAlors, le jury a rendu son verdict et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le pr\u00e9venu non coupable, et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par chacun des jur\u00e9s. Il y a donc eu un verdict et c\u2019est, en effet, ce verdict que la Couronne demande \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019Appel de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nComment cette Cour peut-elle le faire, \u00e0 moins de prendre connaissance de toute la preuve vers\u00e9e au dossier, afin de d\u00e9clarer, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du juge et au verdict du jury, qu\u2019il y avait suffisamment de preuve pour rendre un autre verdict que celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9? Est-ce l\u00e0 un appel en droit uniquement? Assur\u00e9ment non, puisque la Cour aurait \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les faits prouv\u00e9s pour d\u00e9duire une autre conclusion que celle \u00e0 laquelle le jury en est arriv\u00e9.\nThese cases were both followed in the Quebec Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in 1961 in the case of Regina v. Ferland[8], and it will be found that the courts of the other Provinces have been uniform in their adoption of the views above expressed. See for example, Rex v. Gross[9], per Roach J.A., page 19; R. v. J.[10] (Alberta); The King v. Toubret and Davis[11] (N.S.); Rex v. F.W. Woolworth Company[12] (B.C.), in which latter case the respondent company was charged with discriminating against its employees contrary to s. 4(2) (a) of the Industrial Conciliation Arbitration Act, 1947 (B.C.), c. 44, and Chief Justice Sloan, speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said, at page 176:\nI am unable to see how we can say that the learned judge below erred in finding that the Crown had failed to prove the offence charged, unless we ourselves weigh the evidence and reach our own and differing conclusions of fact thereon.\nThis, however, as a Crown appeal, is limited to questions of law alone. It follows therefore that in my opinion we have no jurisdiction to entertain it.\nIn the case of The Queen v. Warner[13], the Court of Appeal of Alberta had allowed an appeal from a conviction of murder on the ground that the evidence at trial was not sufficient to support it and this Court decided that that ground did not raise a question of law so as to give it jurisdiction to hear a further appeal. In the course of the reasons for judgment which he rendered on behalf of himself, Taschereau and Abbott J., Chief Justice Kerwin said, at page 147:\nIn my opinion there is no jurisdiction in the Court to hear this appeal. The first two sentences of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta, speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, are as follows:\nI am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction.\nI read the first sentence as meaning that the Chief Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction,\u2014which is a question of fact.\nIn the same case, the present Chief Justice, with whom Taschereau and Abbott J. agreed, said, at page 149:\nI do not find it necessary to consider the several errors of law alleged by the appellant to have been made by the Appellate Division as I think it is clear that the Appellate Division allowed the appeal on two main grounds:\n(1) that, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, the verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence, and\n(2) that there had been errors in law in the charge of the learned trial judge.\nSo far as the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to interfere with it. The question whether the Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a mixed question of fact and law.\nThe effect of these observations, which represent the view of the majority of the Court, is that the question of whether or not the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction is a question of fact.\nMr. Justice Schroeder, however, while recognizing that there was nothing in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge to \u201cdisclose ex facie what may be denoted as a positive error of law\u2026\u201d went on to say:\nIt is not essential that a misconception of law should appear on the face of the judgment or the reasons therefor if the determination upon the evidence was such that, in the opinion of a reviewing court, no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant principles of law could have reached. If that is readily apparent, as I believe it is here, then this Court is entitled to assume that some misconception of law is responsible for the decision. It appears to me that Mr. Justice Schroeder has cited an excerpt from the reasons delivered on behalf of this Court by Anglin C.J., in Belyea and Weinraub v. The King[14] as some authority in support of this proposition. That was a case in which the trial judge had acquitted the appellants on charges of offences against the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy contrary to the provisions of s. 498 of the Criminal Code and, holding that the error of the trial judge raised a question of law, this Court affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which had reversed the acquittal on the following grounds:\n\u2026the Appellate Division\u2026s of the opinion that the learned trial judge had misdirected himself, in that he held that, although it was proven, if not admitted, that they (the appellants) \u2018took an active part in the original scheme,\u2014the conspiracy which formed the basis for the prosecution,\u2026use (they) were not proved to have taken part in subsequent overt acts,\u2019 they should be acquitted,\u2026\nIn my view that case is distinguishable from the case at bar because the trial judge had there made a clear finding of fact against the accused, (i.e., that they had participated in the formation of the combine or agreement which was charged as a conspiracy) from which it followed as a matter of law that they were guilty of the offence with which they were charged. The trial judge did not appear to appreciate the fact that the agreement was the essence of the offence and seems to have thought that in order to find the accused guilty there had to be evidence from which he could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they had participated in overt acts done in furtherance of the agreement. This was a manifest error in law which raised a question over which the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction. I cannot see that any such question as was there decided arises in the present case because here there was no finding of fact against the accused in respect of the 3rd and 4th counts which, as a matter of law, required the trial judge to convict.\nIn the present case the trial judge accepted the evidence as contained in the letters above referred to and thus gave full effect to s. 41(2) of the Combines Investigation Act, but he concluded that this evidence was not sufficient to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were guilty on the 3rd and 4th counts. However wrong the Court of Appeal or this Court may think that he was in reaching this conclusion, I am of opinion, with all respect for those who hold a different view, that this error cannot be determined without passing judgment on the reasonableness of the verdict or the sufficiency of the evidence, and in my view these are not matters over which the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nMr. Justice Schroeder, however, further relies upon the case of Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v. Bairstow[15] and he makes particular reference to the reasons for judgment of Lord Radcliffe in that case. That was an appeal from a decision of the Commissioners for the General Purpose of the Income Tax Act on a case stated by them. The facts were not in dispute and the sole question was whether a taxpayer\u2019s profits arose out of an \u201cadventure or concern in the nature of trade\u201d within the meaning of s. 237 of the English Income Tax Act, 1918.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Lord Radcliffe said, at page 33:\nMy Lords, I think that it is a question of law what meaning is to be given to the words of the Income Tax Act \u2018trade, manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade\u2019 and for that matter what constitute \u2018profits or gains\u2019 arising from it. Here we have a statutory phrase involving a charge of tax, and it is for the courts to interpret its meaning, having regard to the context in which it occurs and to the principles which they bring to bear upon the meaning of income.\nHis Lordship then observed that:\n\u2026the law does not supply a precise definition of the word \u2018trade\u2019:\u2026\nand went on to say:\nIn effect it lays down the limits within which it would be permissible to say that a \u2018trade\u2019 as interpreted by section 237 of the Act does or does not exist.\nBut the field so marked out is a wide one and there are many combinations of circumstances in which it could not be said to be wrong to arrive at a conclusion one way or the other. If the facts of any particular case are fairly capable of being so described, it seems to me that it necessarily follows that the determination of the Commissioners, Special or General, to the effect that a trade does or does not exist is not \u2018erroneous in point of law\u2019; and, if a determination cannot be shown to be erroneous in point of law, the statute does not admit of its being upset by the court of appeal. I except the occasions when the commissioners, although dealing with a set of facts which would warrant a decision either way, show by some reason they give or statement they make in the body of the case that they have misunderstood the law in some relevant particular.\nAll these cases in which the facts warrant a determination either way can be described as questions of degree and therefore as questions of fact.\nLord Radcliffe was, however, of the opinion that the agreed facts in the Bairstow case were consistent only with the conclusion that the profit there in question \u201cwas the profit of an adventure in the nature of trade\u201d. In concluding his judgment, Lord Radcliffe made the following general observation concerning appeals from income tax commissioners at page 38:\nAs I see it, the reason why the courts do not interfere with commissioners\u2019 findings or determinations when they really do involve nothing but questions of fact is not any supposed advantage in the commissioners of greater experience in matters of business or any other matters. The reason is simply that by the system that has been set up the commissioners are the first tribunal to try an appeal, and in the interests of the efficient administration of justice their decisions can only be upset on appeal if they have been positively wrong in law. The court is not a second opinion, where there is reasonable ground for the first. But there is no reason to make a mystery about the subjects that commissioners deal with or to invite the courts to impose any exceptional restraints upon themselves because they are dealing with cases that arise out of facts found by commissioners. Their duty is no more than to examine those facts with a decent respect for the tribunal appealed from and if they think that the only reasonable conclusion on the facts found is inconsistent with the determination come to, to say so without more ado.\nI am satisfied, after having read the reasons for judgment of Lord Radcliffe, that the Bairstow case was one in which the court was required to decide whether the facts found by the Commissioners were such as to bring the taxpayer within the language employed in s. 237 of the English Income Tax Act, 1918, and that the question of law upon which the House of Lords decided that case was \u201cwhat is the meaning to be given to the words of the Income Tax Act of \u2018trade, manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade\u2019 \u201c? I must say, with all respect, that that case does not appear to me to afford any authority for the proposition that in an appeal against a judgment of acquittal under s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code \u201ca question of law alone\u201d is involved whenever a reviewing court is of opinion that the finding of the trial judge was unreasonable and improper having regard to the evidence.\nIf the phrase \u201ca question of law alone\u201d as it occurs in that section were to be so construed, then the result in my opinion would be not only to extend the Attorney General\u2019s right to appeal under that section, but also to enlarge the meaning of the phrase \u201ca question of law\u201d as it occurs in other sections of the Criminal Code dealing with appeals not only to the Court of Appeal but to this Court. In my opinion such an interpretation could result in a broadening of the scope of appellate jurisdiction under the Criminal Code beyond the limitations which are stipulated in the express language of the Code itself.\nThe provisions of s. 592(1) (a) of the Code provide that:\n592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that\n(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or\n(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;\u2026\nThe italics are my own.\nParliament has thus conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal against a conviction on three separate grounds, one of which is the very ground upon which the Court of Appeal allowed the present appeal, i.e., that \u201cthe verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence\u201d. The fact that s. 592(1) (a) recognizes this ground as being separate and distinct from \u201cthe ground of a wrong decision on a question of law\u201d appears to me to be the best kind of evidence of the fact that Parliament did not intend the phrase \u201ca question of law\u201d as it is used in the Code to include the question of whether the verdict at trial was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. It is noteworthy that having accorded the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear appeals against conviction on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable, Parliament did not confer the same jurisdiction on that Court in appeals by the Crown. No authority is needed for the proposition that appellate jurisdiction must be expressly conferred and with all respect for those who may hold a different view, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal has exceeded its jurisdiction by allowing this appeal on a ground reserved for appeals against conviction which does not extend to appeals by the Attorney General.\nFor all these reasons I would allow the appellant\u2019s appeal against the verdict of guilty on counts 3 and 4 of the indictment which was substituted by the Court of Appeal for the verdict of acquittal at trial on these counts and I would set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this regard.\nThe appellant has also appealed from that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which varied the Order of Prohibition made by the learned trial judge. As Mr. Justice Laskin has said:\nThe heart of the variation lies in extending the prohibition to cover the commission of the like offence in respect of any person other than the retailers particularly mentioned in the counts on which convictions were made and to cover the use of any other means by which, within the definition of the offence, it may be committed. In my view, section 31 of the Combines Investigation Act is ample enough to comprehend a prohibitory order in such terms.\nI would not disturb the order of the Court of Appeal in this regard.\nIn the result, I would allow the appellant\u2019s appeal in part.\nThe judgment of Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[16] delivered on March 31, 1967, whereby that Court in a majority judgment allowed an appeal from the judgment of Grant J. delivered on March 18, 1966, by which he convicted the accused (here appellant) on counts 1 and 2 in the indictment and acquitted the accused (here appellant) on counts 3 and 4 in the said indictment.\nFrom the acquittal on counts 3 and 4, the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal and the accused (here appellant) cross-appealed from the conviction on counts 1 and 2.\nAt the hearing of the appeal before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the accused abandoned its appeal against the conviction on counts 1 and 2. The Court of Appeal for Ontario by reasons delivered by Schroeder J.A. and concurred in by Porter C.J.O., F.G. MacKay and J.L. McLennan JJ.A., allowed the appeal of the Crown and registered a conviction upon the said counts 3 and 4, and also altered and extended the form of the order for prohibition which had been granted by Grant J. after trial. Laskin J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal by the Crown.\nThe accused corporation was charged as follows:\n1. The Jurors for Her Majesty the Queen present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st day of December, 1960, by actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of St. Catharines, in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce Cavers Brothers Limited, sometimes known as Cavers Bros., of the said City of St. Catharines to resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric shavers at prices not less than the minimum prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited and did thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act, Section 34(2)(b).\n2. The said Jurors further present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st day of December, 1960 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, unlawfully did, by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce New Era Home Appliances Limited sometimes known as New Era, of the City of Toronto, to resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric floor conditioners at prices not less than the minimum prices specified therefor by Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited and did thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act, Section 34(2)(b).\n3. The said Jurors further present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st day of December, 1960, by actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce Army & Navy Department Store Limited, sometimes known as Army & Navy Stores, of the said City of Vancouver to resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric fry pans at prices not less than the minimum prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited and did thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act, Section 34(2) (b).\n4. The said Jurors further present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and being a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The Combines Investigation Act, between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st day of December, 1960 by actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce ABC Television & Appliances Ltd., sometimes known as ABC T.V. to resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric floor conditioners at prices not less than the minimum prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, and did thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act, Section 34(2) (b).\nAt trial, before Grant J. sitting without a jury, as directed by s. 40(3) of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, the Crown\u2019s case was put simply by the production of the admission of the accused given under the provisions of s. 562 of the Criminal Code, and by producing and having filed as exhibits a very large number of documents which had been seized by investigators in the premises of the accused corporation in Toronto, Ontario, and which were submitted as proof under the provisions of s. 41 of the said Combines Investigation Act, as amended. Specified reference will be made to this section hereafter.\nSection 34 of the said Combines Investigation Act was amended in the year 1960 by c. 45 of the Statutes of Canada for that year by the addition of subs. (5) thereto. This section, which has been referred to from time to time as the \u201closs leader section\u201d, was as Schroeder J.A. points out in his reasons for judgment, enacted as a measure of relief to a dealer who had refused to sell or supply or who had counselled the refusal to supply of commodities contrary to s. 34(3) of the statute if he could establish certain things. Almost immediately thereafter the accused corporation evolved a scheme known as the Minimum Profitable Resale Price Scheme, to which I shall refer hereafter as MPRP, and proceeded to put into effect throughout Canada the said MPRP scheme.\nThe representatives of the accused attended meetings with retail dealers in many cities throughout Canada, forwarded, first to their distributors and later to the retail dealers, literature outlining the scheme making statements therein which statements proved relevant to the counts in the indictment.\nTo summarize very briefly, the scheme was as follows: The accused corporation was in the business of manufacturing and selling a very large range of electrical appliances including such things as electric razors, toasters, coffee percolators, floor polishers, and many others. The accused corporation sold directly to a very limited number of large retailers such as the T. Eaton Company Limited, the Robert Simpson Company Limited, the Hudson Bay Company and some few others. The remainder of its sales was made by the accused corporation to distributors throughout Canada and those distributors in turn sold the products to retail dealers who again resold to the consuming public. The accused corporation purported, through its long experience in the marketing of electrical appliances, to know the average gross profit which a distributor needed in order to carry on its business profitably and also the average gross profit which a retail dealer, in turn, needed to carry on its own business profitably. The accused corporation having fixed its selling price on each of the appliances to the distributors calculated the gross profit which in its opinion any distributor should obtain on the sale of such appliances to a retail dealer and thereby to use its own words, \u201cestablish the distributors\u2019 price\u201d. Then again it calculated the gross profit which a retail dealer should obtain upon its cost on the purchase of an appliance from the distributor and established what it calls the Minimum Profitable Resale Price, i.e., the MPRP. The circular which was forwarded to all the distributors and with which was enclosed a schedule showing the various appliances and in successive columns the distributors\u2019 net price, the suggested dealers\u2019 price (i.e., the price from distributor to dealer), the Minimum Profitable Resale Price (i.e., the price from dealer to consumer), the fair retail value and sales tax allowance, concluded with a paragraph:\nhereafter if we find that sales are being made at prices less than those suggested above, we shall give consideration as to whether such sales are loss leader sales and assess our position as it relates to the marketing of our products.\nSimilarly, the circular to retail dealers in which was included a price list containing in columns the suggested dealer price, the minimum profitable resale price (MPRP), and fair retail value, contained these two paragraphs:\nIt is our opinion that a person loss-leads our products when he sells them at a gross margin less than his average cost of doing business plus a reasonable profit.\nWe have drawn conclusions from evidence available as to the operating costs of a variety of dealers who sell appliances and are efficiently organized to merchandise effectively and provide reasonable service. These conclusions are set forth specifically in the column headed \u201cMinimum Profitable Resale Price\u201d in our new Dealer Price Sheet enclosed, effective September 15, 1960. The offering of our products below these prices will be investigated as cases of loss-leading. It is our intention to withhold supply, from persons who make a practice\n\u2014of loss leading our products\u2026\nIt was the contention of counsel for the accused corporation throughout that this MPRP scheme was only intended as notice that distributors and dealers advertising for sale and selling at less than that MPRP price would be investigated as possible examples of loss leading and that if after investigation such loss leading were established then supply could be cut off from the offending dealer.\nThe Crown showed as to the first two counts involving Cavers Brothers Limited of St. Catharines, and the New Era Home Appliances Limited of Toronto, that in fact the said corporation had attempted to induce the dealer to sell the article at not less than a specified minimum price. The learned trial judge therefore convicted the accused corporation on those counts which were, it should be noted, counts of breach of s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines Investigation Act, which provides: 34. (2) No dealer shall directly or indirectly by agreement, threat, promise or any other means whatsoever, require or induce or attempt to require or induce any other person to resell an article or commodity\n(b) at a price not less than a minimum price specified by the dealer or established by agreement.\nCount 3 in the indictment laid exactly the same charge against the accused corporation as to the Army and Navy Stores of the City of Vancouver, and count 4 of the said indictment again laid the same charge against the accused corporation as to ABC Television and Appliances Limited, also of the City of Vancouver. It should be noted that the charge was of an attempt to induce the specified dealer to resell appliances at not less than the specified minimum price. The same evidence as to those two counts as had been relevant to counts 1 and 2, was adduced, i.e., the circular letter to the distributor with its attached price list and the circular letter to the dealer with its attached price list. I have already referred to these documents.\nThere was in addition as to count 3, the count in reference to the Army and Navy Stores, a letter from one A. R. D. Schell, an employee of the accused corporation in British Columbia, to one J. C. Hall, an officer in the head office of the corporation in Toronto, dated October 9, 1960, which I quote in full:\nDear Joe:\nArmy & Navy Stores, Vancouver, have been stocking some of our items and selling them at very low prices. For instance, they have the S 5 iron on at $14.49, FPM\u2014$15.95 FPL $19.49 and a few other items.\nI have called on Mr. Ludwig who is in charge of this department and presented our resale pricing programme to him. Each time I called, he would agree to bring the prices up to the minimum, but when I went back, they were exactly the same. This has now been going on for three weeks, in which time I have called on Mr. Ludwig five times.\nAs yet I have had no complaints from any Account on this matter, but I feel should we let it go, it just might start something. He has been giving G.E. the same run around.\nThey have been buying their Sunbeam and G.E. from Mc. & Mc.\nJoe, these are the details, and am passing them on to you for your advice.\nR. D. Schell.\n(The underlining is my own.) The learned trial judge pointed out that that letter had been replied to by one from Mr. J. C. Hall to R. D. Schell, dated October 14, 1960, which read, in part:\nI would suggest, Dick, that seeing you are going in and calling on this Mr. Ludwig that you continue to do so endeavouring to obtain his co-operation by pointing out that no one will be selling any less than he is and doing your best to get him to come up to our prices on this basis.\nThe trial judge pointed out that there is no evidence that Schell ever made any further calls on Ludwig or in any way thereafter attempted to carry out Hall\u2019s suggestion or passed on any of the contents of Hall\u2019s letter to Ludwig, and. the learned trial judge then concluded:\nThe evidence as to inducement on this count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.\nIt must be remembered that the evidence at trial as I have pointed out consisted so far as the Crown\u2019s case was concerned of the admissions and of the production of all of these documents. Counsel for the accused corporation called two witnesses neither of whom in his evidence dealt with the two letters of October 9 and of October 14, 1960, to which I have just referred.\nSection 41 of the Combines Investigation Act provides:\n41. (1) In this section,\n(a) \u201cagent of a participant\u201d means a person who by a document admitted in evidence under this section appears to be or is otherwise proven to be an officer, agent, servant, employee or representative of a participant,\n(b) \u201cdocument\u201d includes any document appearing to be a carbon, photographic or other copy of a document, and\n(c) \u201cparticipant\u201d means any accused and any person who, although not accused, is alleged in the charge or indictment to have been a co-conspirator or otherwise party or privy to the offence charged.\n(2) In a prosecution under Part V,\n(a) anything done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed to have been done, said or agreed upon, as the case may be, with the authority of that participant;\n(b) a document written or received by an agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed to have been written or received, as the case may be, with the authority of that participant; and\n(c) a document proved to have been in the possession of a participant or on premises used or occupied by a participant or in the possession of an agent of a participant shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence (i) that the participant had knowledge of the document and its contents,\n(ii) that anything recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed upon by any participant or by an agent of a participant was done, said or agreed upon as recorded and, where anything is recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed upon with the authority of that participant,\n(iii) that the document, where it appears to have been written by any participant or by an agent of a participant, was so written and, where it appears to have been written by an agent of a participant, that it was written with the authority of that participant.\nTherefore, by virtue of s. 41(2) (c), the documents, i.e., those two letters of the 9th and 14th of October 1960, having been proved to be in the possession of the accused or on its premises, were prima facie evidence (1) that the accused had knowledge of the documents and their contents, and (2) that anything recorded therein as having been done was done and was done by the agent with the authority of the accused. Therefore, the only evidence before the learned trial judge as to count 3 was the evidence that the agent Schell with the authority of the accused, had on five occasions in the three weeks prior to October 9, 1960, called on Mr. Ludwig in the Army and Navy Stores in Vancouver and presented to him a resale pricing programme and that on each of those occasions Ludwig \u201cwould agree to bring the prices up to the minimum\u201d. Under those circumstances, it matters not whether Mr. Ludwig or the Army and Navy Stores had ever received a copy of the circular to dealers to which I have referred above, or had any previous knowledge of the MPRP programme, the plain statement in the letter reporting is that on five different occasions Schell had attempted to have Ludwig agree to increase his prices to a specified minimum price.\nThere can be no doubt as to the occasions having been within the time specified in the indictment and that therefore the attempt in count 3 was between September 1, 1960, and December 31, 1960. The letter reporting was dated October 9, 1960, and it speaks of actions within the previous three weeks, i.e., commencing some time after September 1, 1960. In fact, the letters to distributors had only gone out on September 14, 1960, and the report by the head office of the accused corporation in Toronto to the U.S. head office in Chicago, Illinois, outlining the MPRP scheme which was produced at trial as an exhibit was only forwarded on September 14, 1960.\nAs I have already pointed out, this was the only evidence before the learned trial judge. Reasonable doubt must be based upon evidence adduced at the trial and there was, therefore, no basis upon which reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offence as charged in the indictment could arise.\nIn prosecuting on the 4th count, i.e., that dealing with ABC Television, the Crown relied on the said circulars to distributors and dealers to which reference has been made above, and also on a letter from one Bill Thompson, an agent of the accused corporation in Vancouver, to Mr. J. C. Hall, dated September 20, 1960, the third paragraph of which read:\nI have been checking with dealers, and not one of the dealers I have contacted have received the letter from Sunbeam that I understood was to be sent out the 15th. Has there been a change of plans? Dick and I are trying to get prices set here, and without actual price sheets it is a difficult job. As far as my Floor Care Div dealers go, the only dealer that is cutting our polishers at present (that I know about) is Collin Ryan of A.B.C. TV. I talked to Collin today, but he wouldn\u2019t assure me of raising and I hesitate to do anything until the before-mentioned letters and price sheets are here.\nMr. Hall replied to that letter by his of September 29, 1960. The third paragraph of that letter reads as follows:\nI can imagine that Collin Ryan of A.B.C. Television is causing you a problem. I have had similar ones with him in the past, Bill, but after a lot of hard talking I have managed to persuade him to come up to the price that I wanted him to do so. I can only suggest first that you try every means you can to get him to raise his prices to our minimum profitable resale prices, then if he absolutely refuses and if he runs any ads, let us have them and we will take action immediately. I would like you to keep me posted on this or any other discrepancies there may be with other dealers in the British Columbia area.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nThe learned trial judge in dealing with count 4 concluded:\nThere is no evidence that Thompson carried out Hall\u2019s instructions concerning Ryan except that the latter had put his prices up after a long talk. There is.here neither sufficient evidence of inducement on the part of the accused nor that the alleged offence took place within the time charged. This charge must therefore be dismissed.\nTherefore, the only evidence upon this count in addition to the outline of the scheme as contained in the circulars to dealers and distributors was Thompson\u2019s report of September 20, in which he said \u201cI talked to Collin today but he wouldn\u2019t assure me of raising and I hesitate to do anything until the before mentioned letters and price sheets are here\u201d and his report of October 15 where he said Ryan had put his price up yesterday \u201cafter quite a long talk\u201d. Surely, this being the only evidence, it is the plain statement by Thompson, the agent of the accused corporation, that he had attempted, before the 20th of September, to induce Ryan to raise his sale price to a specified minimum price and that he had again made an attempt, which was successful, on October 13, 1960, there can be no other conclusion than that none of the acts took place prior to the 1st of September 1960 as the scheme only went into effect in the middle of that month and since the inducement and successful inducement was reported on October 14, 1960, and that the acts took place within the period charged. Again I point out that the charge was a charge of attempting to induce and these letters amount to an admission of an attempt to induce a dealer to sell at not less than a specified minimum. That such minimum was the MPRP price is shown clearly by Mr. Hall\u2019s letter to Bill Thompson dated September 29, 1960 which I have quoted. Since a reasonable doubt must be based on evidence and there was no evidence which could give rise to any such reasonable doubt to rebut the presumption created by s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act, there was no course but to convict the accused.\nThe problem arises as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to consider the appeal from the acquittal by the learned trial judge. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was taken by virtue of s. 584 of the Criminal Code which provides:\n584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal (a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,\u2026\n(The underlining is my own.)\nCounsel for the accused corporation took the position before the Court of Appeal for Ontario and before this Court that the appeal of the Crown was not based on a ground of law alone but at best was upon a ground of mixed law and fact and upon such ground no appeal lay.\nSchroeder J.A. in his reasons sets out the grounds of law advanced by the Crown in, the Court of Appeal for Ontario as follows:\n1. He erred in law in refusing to consider the entire documentation as relevant to each count;\n2. He erred in law in failing to give effect to uncontradicted documentary evidence which had made out a prima facie case under section 41 and which, not having been contradicted or explained by the accused, became conclusive;\n3. He erred in the effect which he gave to the words \u201cattempt to induce\u201d as they are used in section 34(2)(b).\nWith respect, I agree with Schroeder J.A. that it does not appear from the record that the learned trial judge erred in refusing to consider the entire documentation as relevant to each count and that ground, therefore, need not be considered further.\nI turn next to ground 3 in the list above. Laskin J.A. said in his reasons:\nCounsel for the Crown did not press the third ground because it did not involve a question of law alone on the basis on which he proposed to argue it.\nI am unable to understand this statement. It would appear at any rate that counsel for the Crown held no such view before this Court as in the first paragraph of the argument in the respondent\u2019s factum it is set out:\n37. It is respectfully submitted that the learned trial judge misdirected himself as to the meaning and effect of Section 34(2) (b) of The Combines Investigation Act in considering the evidence relating to inducement and thereby erred in law.\nSchroeder J.A. in reference to the third ground of appeal said:\nThe third ground of error assigned by counsel is more serious, since in stating that the \u201cevidence of inducement\u201d in counts 3 and 4 was inadequate to support a criminal charge, the learned Judge either overlooked the fact that the charge was confined to attempted inducement or disregarded the decision of this court in Regina v. Moffatts Limited. (1957) O.R. 93, as stated at p. 106, . . .\nWith respect, I agree with Schroeder J.A. Although the learned trial judge on the same page of his reasons said:\nThe substance of the third count is that the accused within the same period of time by actions taken [sic] place partly in Metropolitan Toronto, partly in the City of Vancouver, unlawfully by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempted to induce Army and Navy Department Stores to resell\u2026\n(The underlining is my own.)\nwhen he concluded his consideration of the third count, he said:\nThe evidence as to inducement on this count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nThe learned trial judge pointed out earlier in his reasons what Estey J. said in, this court in Rex v. Quinton[17]:\nThis section requires that one to be guilty of an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some act toward the accomplishment of that objective, that act must be beyond preparation and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof. It is the existence of both the intent and the act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal offence.\nIn the present case, the charge in count 3 was that the accused, here appellant, \u201c\u2026unlawfully did by agreement, threat, promise or other means, attempt to induce Army and Navy Department Stores\u2026to resell articles or commodities. at prices not less than the minimum prices specified\u2026\u201d\nThe intention to commit the completed offence is quite clearly demonstrated by Mr. Hall\u2019s letter to Mr. Schell dated October 14, 1960, to which I have referred, when he states:\nI would suggest, Dick, that seeing you are going in and calling on this Mr. Ludwig that you continue to do so endeavouring to obtain his co-operation by pointing out that no one will be selling any less than he is and doing your best to get him to come up to our prices on this basis.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nAgain, in his general reporting letter dated September 13, 1960, to Mr. R.P. Gwinn, the chief officer of the U.S. head office, E.F. Bond, the vice-president of the appellant corporation said, in part:\nWe have held and will hold distributor meetings in all major marketing centres throughout Canada for the purpose of explaining our programme. Actually it is similar to GE\u2019s in that we will do the following two things:\n(1) Establish maximum discounts allowed by distributors for quantity purchases by dealers (5% on any assortment of 12)\n(2) Establish minimum profitable resale prices for dealers.\nThe second item is a clear statement of the intent. The acts toward the accomplishment of the objective in the case of count 3 were Schell\u2019s five attendances upon Mr. Ludwig in an attempt to obtain Ludwig\u2019s agreement to sell only at the specified minimum prices. Whether or not Schell was successful in such attempt is irrelevant. I accept the law as outlined in Regina v. Moffatts Limited[18] that it is not essential on an attempt-charge under s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines Investigation Act to prove that the attempt was successful.\nSimilarly, when one deals with count 4 which was that the appellant, \u201cunlawfully, did by agreement, threat, promise or other means attempt to induce\u2026ABC Television and Appliances Ltd. to resell articles or commodities\u2026at prices not less than the minimum prices specified\u2026\u201d, one finds the attempt specified in the Bond letter to Gwinn of September 13, 1960, to which I have referred, and also in the paragraph I have quoted from the letter of Bill Thompson to J.C. Hall dated September 20, 1960. The overt act toward the accomplishment of the objective is set out in the same letter, i.e., the attendance upon Collin Ryan, and in the further report of October 15, 1960 \u201cCollin Ryan of ABC TV took his price up to that figure yesterday after quite a long talk\u201d. Again, in this case, both elements necessary to prove an attempt to induce, which was the offence charged, are proved conclusively in the documentation. There was no evidence given to contradict them although Mr. Bond was called as a witness for the defence. The prima facie case wrought by s. 41 (2) (c) of the Combines Investigation Act being the only evidence upon the topic therefore becomes the uncontradicted evidence and it was the duty of the learned trial judge upon such uncontradicted evidence to register convictions. It was an error in law to charge himself as, with respect, it would appear that the learned trial judge had charged himself, that the Crown in order to support the charges had to prove an inducing by agreement, threat or promise. \u201cOther means\u201d seems to have been forgotten. In order to prove the offence charged all the Crown had to prove was the intent to induce and an overt act toward the accomplishment of that intent. As I have said the Crown in each of the counts proved these on prima facie evidence which by lack of contradiction became conclusive evidence.\nThere is, therefore, in this ground 3 submitted by the appellant an error in law sufficient to give the Court of Appeal jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 584(1) of the Criminal Code. It will be realized that in coming to this conclusion I have in fact dealt with the second ground of appeal in that I have stated that the prima facie evidence wrought by the provisions of s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act not having been contradicted became conclusive. It has been objected by counsel that such a view of the effect of s. 41 takes from the learned trial judge the right and the duty to weigh all the evidence and to come to his conclusion upon the whole case whether the Crown has proved the necessary ingredients of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.\nI, of course, agree that the Court is always under the duty of so weighing all the evidence in order to come to that conclusion. The learned trial judge had already con- sidered in reference to counts 1 and 2 and in his general outline of the MPRP scheme the establishment of the intent to induce the dealers to resell at not less than the minimum specified prices and before he could have registered a conviction on counts 1 and 2 had come to the conclusion that such intent had been established beyond reasonable doubt. The intent was exactly the same in the case of counts 3 and 4 as it had been in the case of counts 1 and 2. If it were established beyond reasonable doubt as to counts 1 and 2 it had been established also beyond reasonable doubt as to counts 3 and 4.\nThe only evidence as to the overt act toward the accomplishment of that end in the case of counts 3 and 4 is in the correspondence to which I have referred. If the learned trial judge had weighed that evidence upon the question as to whether it proved beyond reasonable doubt that such overt act had taken place rather than upon the question of whether or not there had been an inducing then he could not have failed to find such an overt act proved beyond reasonable doubt as there was no evidence to weigh contra. The faults which the learned trial judge cites as to this evidence were faults as to its evidentiary value in proving beyond reasonable doubt the inducing and not the overt act in a charge of attempting to induce.\nIn my view, my conclusion, therefore does not infringe on the right and duty of a trial judge to weigh all the evidence in order to determine whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.\nSo in Girvin v. The King[19], as pointed out by Sohroeder J.A. in his reasons for judgment, Fitzpatrick C.J. said at p. 169:\nI have always understood the rule to be that the Crown, in a criminal case is not required to do more than produce evidence which, if unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to raise a prima facie case upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict.\nAnd in Belyea v. The King[20], the learned trial judge had found as a fact upon the evidence and this Court was of the opinion that such was fully justified on the evidence, that the accused took an active part in the original scheme\u2014the conspiracy which formed the basis of the prosecution\u2014but acquitted him on the ground that there was no evidence which connected him with any of the illegal operations subsequent thereto. The Appellate Division was of the opinion that the learned trial judge had misdirected himself in that he held that the latter finding entitled the accused to an acquittal. This Court upheld the decision of the Appellate Division finding that there was a ground of error in law which entitled the Crown to appeal to the Appellate Division.\nIn that case as in the instant case, it must be noted, the trial judge\u2019s error in law was not expressly formulated in his judgment. On the contrary he had, as here, expressed his erroneous conclusion as resting on a question of fact:\nIn arriving at this conclusion I have in mind the provisions of s. 69 of the Criminal Code, but, notwithstanding that section, I cannot find upon the evidence that there was any participation or complicity by O\u2019Connor in the offences established in evidence and therefore a verdict of not guilty must be found in this case.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nHowever, having quoted, among others, the above passage, Anglin C.J.C. speaking for the Court had no difficulty in holding that on the basis of the whole judgment and record, the acquittal was not actually based on wrong findings of fact nor on an incorrect weighing of the evidence, but on an unstated error of law that should be inferred. He said at p. 292:\nPresumably on the ground that the purpose of the organization was \u201cprofessedly\u201d (i.e., ostensibly) lawful, and that there is not sufficient evidence that the appellants participated in, or were privy to, the subsequent admittedly illegal acts of the Windsor group, the learned judge acquitted them.\nAnd at p. 296:\nHere, the learned trial judge apparently had already found facts from which the conclusion was inevitable that there was participation on the part of Belyea and Weinraub in the formation of the illegal combine and the conspiracy, the existence of which he had already found to be proven. On these findings, coupled with the admissions made by Belyea and Weinraub in their testimony, and the documents of which they were proved to have had knowledge, their convictions, as was held by the Appellate Division, were a necessary consequence.\nConcerning the extent of the jurisdiction of this Court in such a case, the Chief Justice said on the same page:\nThe right of appeal by the Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr.C., as enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to \u201cquestions of law\u201d. That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,\u2014especially where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.\nIt is contended that even if the evidence is found to be sufficient to support a conviction, the further question of whether the guilt of the accused should be inferred from that evidence is a question of fact and reference is made to Fraser v. The King[21] and Rose v. The Queen[22]. Those were cases in which facts necessary to establish the guilt of the accused had to be inferred, in the first, from circumstantial evidence, in the other, from other proven facts. In neither case was there a statutory provision enacting that the proven facts would constitute prima facie evidence of the other facts required to establish the guilt of the accused and, therefore, the making or not making of an inference was not a question of law alone although it might be unreasonable. However, when there is, as in this case, a statutory presumption to be applied, once the facts necessary to give rise to it are found by the trial judge to be established beyond reasonable doubt, the question whether the inference should be made is no longer anything but a question of law alone: the statute does not provide that the facts to be inferred may be deemed to exist but that they shall be. To say that such evidence does not bear the quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case of a criminal charge is to ignore or contradict the statute and is, therefore, an error in law and nothing else.\nAs against this, it is contended that the legal presumption is not a presumption of guilt but a presumption of some facts and that the trier of the facts has to weigh the evidence before reaching a final conclusion.\nIn Rose v. The Queen, supra, Taschereau J., as he then was, said at p. 443:\nThe trial judge sitting without a jury was fulfilling a dual capacity. He had, therefore, to discharge the duties attached to the functions of a judge, and also the duties of a jury. As a judge he had to direct himself as to whether any facts had been established by evidence from which criminal negligence may be reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say whether, from those facts submitted, criminal negligence ought to be inferred. Metropolitan Railway Company v. Jackson, (1877), 3 App. Cas. 193 at 197, King v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172 at 174. I think that the trial judge directed himself properly, and that when he decided on the facts submitted to him that criminal negligence ought not to be inferred, he was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a question of fact.\nHowever, in that case, the trial judge in coming to his decision that the accused should have been acquitted was performing a function of weighing the evidence. The charge was one of causing death by the operation of a motor vehicle, and the evidence dealt with the conduct of the accused in driving his automobile against a red traffic signal. The learned trial judge found that the accused was not keeping a proper lookout but that his speed was not above the normal at the intersection and reached the conclusion that the accused had not seen the red light. The trial judge, weighing those facts, came to the conclusion that they did not show the wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons required for conviction of the offence charged. Therefore, the learned trial judge had evidence one way and the other way to weigh and a conclusion to arrive at as a result of that weighing whether such conduct showed the standard of negligence required by the provisions of the Criminal Code. In the present case, the learned trial judge had no such task of weighing. There was no evidence contra; there was nothing which needed to be inferred beyond the inference required by the section of the statute. There was a simple admission established as prima facie evidence by the provisions of s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act that the accused through its agent had attempted to induce these persons to sell at not less than the specified minimum price. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the enunciation of the varying duties of the judge and jury as set out above with which, with respect, I agree, do not apply in the present case to make the learned trial judge\u2019s acquittal of the accused a mere matter of fact.\nWith respect, I agree with the view expressed by Evans J.A. in Regina v. Torrie[23] where he said at p. 11:\nI recognize that the onus of proof must rest with the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, but I do not understand this proposition to mean that the Crown must negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which might be consistent with the innocence of the accused.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario including its direction as to the amendments of the Order of Prohibition issued by Grant J.\nAppeal allowed in part, JUDSON, SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\n[1] [1967] 1 O.R. 661, 1 C.R.N.S. 183, [1967] 3 C.C.C. 149, 53 C.P.R. 102, 62 D.L.R.

The said intersection was a controlled intersection within the meaning of s. 128 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253. It was dark at the time of the accident and the plaintiff was crossing to the west in a crosswalk. She was wearing a long, light coloured winter coat. She testified that she looked to the north and to the south, and seeing no vehicles approaching, started to cross. She remembered taking a few steps but nothing more. She was rendered unconscious, sustaining extremely serious injuries.\nThe defendant was travelling southward on the west side of the highway. He said that he saw a form darting from his left to his right in the crosswalk area and immediately applied his brakes. The plaintiff was hit by the front of the car towards the left centre. She had travelled westward some 55 feet in the crosswalk before she was struck. The defendant knew of the crosswalk and that pedestrians might be expected to be crossing the highway at this point. He had been travelling at about 50 m.p.h. as he came southward, and as he approached the intersection took his foot off the accelerator and poised it over the brake pedal.\nAt the trial of the plaintiffs\u2019 action for damages, the jury found that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the female plaintiff. The judgment dismissing the action was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and a new trial held limited to the question of damages.\nThe first question put to the jury should have been as to whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendant which caused or contributed to the accident. If the jury found negligence on the part of the defendant and gave particulars, the next question would be whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed to the accident. The reversing of this order had a serious effect upon the manner in which the trial judge charged the jury and in the jury\u2019s consideration of the whole question of liability.\nIt was a serious error on the part of the trial judge to indicate that the ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked in this case, and evidence given by the driver of another car to the effect that some ten minutes before the accident he had seen a woman, whom he later identified as the injured person, run out from a curb at the intersection and then dart back was improperly admitted.\nThere was no evidence on which the jury could find or infer that the female plaintiff left a curb or other place of safety or that she walked or ran into the path of the defendant\u2019s vehicle and, accordingly, s. 169(2) of the Motor-vehicle Act did not apply.\nThe defendant had failed in his duty to (1) keep a proper look-out; (2) to enter the intersection at such a speed that he could slow down or stop, if necessary, before striking a pedestrian who was lawfully in the pedestrian crosswalk; and (3) to yield right-of-way to the pedestrian as he was required to do by s. 128(11)(a) of the Act. There being no evidence upon which a finding could be made that the female plaintiff started across the highway without looking to see if it was safe to do so or that she did anything to jeopardize her own safety, she was entitled to assume that the driver of the motor vehicle in question would obey the law and yield right-of-way.\nJardine v. Northern Co-operative Timber and Mill Association, [1945] 1 W.W.R. 533; Toronto Railway Co. v. King, [1908] A.C. 260, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, rejecting an appeal from a judgment of Macdonald J. with a jury, dismissing the appellants\u2019 action for damages. Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nThomas Braidwood and Robert Brewer, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nR.E. Ostlund, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia which rejected an appeal from a judgment of Macdonald J. with a jury, dismissing the appellants\u2019 action for damages. The appellants are husband and wife.\nThe female appellant was injured when she was struck by an automobile owned and driven by the respondent while she was crossing from east to west on the King George Highway near Vancouver at the intersection of the highway with what is known as Kennedy Road (88th Avenue). King George Highway is a main arterial highway. There are residential areas on either side. Provision for pedestrians to cross was made at the intersection of Kennedy Road by a pedestrian crosswalk on the south side of the intersection. This crosswalk was outlined by lines painted on the pavement.\nThe situation at the intersection in question was as shown on the following plan:\nThere was no safety island or curbed area in the centre of the highway, only the painted lines as indicated. At or about 5:30 p.m. on December 16, 1963, the female appellant, age 51, was on her way home from visiting her daughter who lives in the area east of the King George Highway. She had to cross the highway to reach her home which was on Kennedy Road west of the highway. On her way home she purchased some loaves of bread and arrived at the south\u2011east corner of the intersection of the highway and Kennedy Road where she proceeded to cross to the west in the crosswalk shown on the plan. It was dark at this time. She was wearing a long, light coloured winter coat and carrying the bread in a paper bag. She testified that she looked to the north and to the south, and seeing no vehicles approaching, started to cross. She remembers taking a few steps but nothing more. She was rendered unconscious, sustaining extremely serious injuries and she remained unconscious for several days.\nThe respondent was travelling southward on the west side of the highway, and as he came towards the intersection in question he was in the lane to the west of the left turn lane as shown on the plan. He knew the intersection well and that there was a pedestrian crosswalk on the south side of the intersection. It was the only pedestrian crosswalk for a considerable distance north or south of the area. He had driven over this intersection a great many times. He said he saw \u201cthis form darting from my left to my right\u201d in the crosswalk area and immediately applied his brakes. Skid marks extending from 40 feet north of the crosswalk were identified and traced to his car which came to rest some 91 feet south of the crosswalk. The overall skid marks measured 141 feet. The skid marks north of the crosswalk came in a straight line, showing that the car had not been turned nor had it swerved either to right or to left. The respondent said that his car struck this form or object at about the south side of the crosswalk at a point some 8 to 10 feet into the lane for southbound traffic. It was only then that he realized that it was a pedestrian that had been hit. His evidence as to this was as follows: \u201cYes, I hit at this time an object. I understand later it was a pedestrian, and I carried her on the hood of my car for some distance\u2026\u201d The female appellant was hit by the front of the car towards the left centre. The distance from the edge of the asphalt at the north side of the crosswalk was, as the plan shows, some 85 feet. This means that the pedestrian had travelled westward at least 55 feet in the: cross-walk before she was struck. The respondent also testified that when he first saw her, she was running and that she moved about 8 or 9 feet from when he first saw her until the car hit her. His testimony as to the impact was as follows:\nQ. How many steps would you say you saw this object move before you struck it?\nA. I don\u2019t believe I would even attempt to\u2014as soon as I saw this object I tried to avoid it.\nQ. Did you continue to look at this object or did you direct your attention to something else?\nA. I tried to avoid it.\nQ. I am asking you what you did with your eyes, with your vision. Did you continue to look at this object or did you direct\u2014\nA. You naturally look at it.\nQ. You did continue to look at it until you struck it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you cannot say how far you saw it move or how many steps at any rate?\nA. No.\nQ. Can you say how far you saw it move in terms of feet or yards?\nA. Well, it was\u2014I first saw it in through my windshield running from my left to my right.\nQ. Yes. How far did you see it?\nA. Now, it hit the left front of my car.\nQ. Or may we also put it this way, the left front of your car hit the pedestrian?\nA. Well, I say the pedestrian was running.\nQ. Yes?\nA. My car, we\u2019ll put it this way, my car came in contact or vice versa, we came in contact.\nQ. How far did you see this object move, can you say?\nA. A very short distance from when I first saw it.\nOn his examination for discovery he said:\n175 Q. Now, what was she doing when you first saw her?\nA. Moving rapidly from my left to my right, and I presume she was running.\nThe respondent said that he did not see the pedestrian (object) sooner because the lighting conditions at the intersection were bad; that the intermittent flashing amber light suspended above the intersection as indicated on the plan caused a blind area to the south which was the area which contained the crosswalk. He knew the crosswalk was there and that pedestrians might be expected to be crossing the highway at this point. He had been travelling at about 50 miles per hour as he came southward, and as he approached the intersection took his foot off the accelerator and poised it over the brake pedal. He estimates that his speed was reduced to about 45 miles per hour. However, it must be noted that the highway in question has a slight downhill grade from north to south at this point which could negative the effect of taking the foot off the accelerator. Other than the respondent, no eye witness gave evidence as to the impact.\nAs the intersection in question was a controlled intersection within the meaning of s. 128 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, the provisions of subss. 9(b) and 11(a) apply. These read:\n(9) When rapid intermittent flashes of red light are exhibited at an intersection by a control signal,\n(b) A pedestrian facing the flashes of red light may proceed across the roadway within a marked or unmarked crosswalk with caution.\n(11) When rapid intermittent flashes of yellow light are exhibited at an intersection by a traffic-control signal,\n(a) The driver of a vehicle facing the flashes of yellow light may cause the vehicle to enter the intersection and proceed only with caution, but shall yield the right\u2011of\u2011way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk;\nThe learned trial judge put the following questions to the jury and these questions were answered as shown:\nTHE CLERK: Number one, was the plaintiff Rodojka Petijevich guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the cause of the accident? Yes. If so, what was her negligence? One, proceeded without reasonable caution through crosswalk. Two, by running through crosswalk. Three, did not employ an evasive action, such as stopping or stepping back.\nTwo, was the defendant guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the cause of the accident? No. If so, what was his negligence? None.\nIt will be observed that the usual order of questions was reversed. The first question should have been as to whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendant which caused or contributed to the accident. This is the prime question. If the answer is \u201cNo\u201d that ends the matter. The foundation of the action are the allegations of negligence made against the defendant. Then, if the jury finds negligence on the part of the defendant and gives particulars, the next question would be whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed to the accident. This reversing of the order had, I think, a serious effect upon the manner in which the learned trial judge charged the jury and in the jury\u2019s consideration of the whole question of liability.\nAlthough a question involving ultimate negligence was not put to the jury, the learned trial judge, in charging the jury, indicated that the ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked, and he proceeded to tell the jury that they might, in effect, find that the female appellant had had the last clear chance to avoid the accident. This was not a case for the application of the ultimate negligence doctrine. It was a serious error which, apart from everything else, must have misled the jury and which, according to the record, caused the jury to ask questions which showed that they did not correctly understand the law applicable to the case.\nEvidence was tendered on behalf of the respondent and received without objection from one Jack Melvin Shaw to the effect that some minutes before the female appellant was struck he had been driving westward on Kennedy Road intending to turn north on the King George Highway. He had come to a stop before entering the highway as he was required to do and he said that as he started up a woman ran out from the curb at the north-east corner of the intersection and that when she saw his vehicle was moving towards her, she darted back. He continued northward, picked up a passenger and returned some 10 minutes later to the intersection, and seeing that an accident had happened, stopped and said he identified the injured person as the woman he had seen a few minutes before by recognizing the coat she was wearing. That was his only item of identification. Now, regardless of whether he was able to identify the woman or not, his evidence was not admissible and its admission was, in my view, fatal to the verdict because not only was the evidence improperly admitted, but in his charge to the jury the learned trial judge said:\nThen the defendant says to you that she failed to take reasonable care for her own safety because she was running, and points out to you that this is the evidence that the defendant Law gave. The defendant says that you should infer from what happened according to Mr. Shaw\u2019s evidence, when he testified that he saw the female plaintiff running from the northeast corner in a westerly direction, and from evidence suggesting that she was late in getting home, that from these things you should infer that she was running just before impact in this case.\nNorris J.A., in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, stated that in his opinion the evidence of Shaw was admissible as part of the res gestae. I cannot agree. He also said that in any event, even if the evidence was not admissible, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was occasioned thereby. With respect, I am of the view that the admission of this evidence, coupled with the reference thereto in the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, was bound to have an adverse effect on the appellants\u2019 case with the jury.\nIn addition to quoting the relevant subsections of s. 128 to the jury, the learned trial judge instructed the jury that s. 169(2) of the Motor-vehicle Act of British Columbia applied in the instant case and had to be considered. Section 169(2) reads:\nNo pedestrian shall leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so close that it is impracticable for the driver to yield the right-of-way.\nThere was no evidence on which the jury could find or infer that the female appellant left a curb or other place of safety or that she walked or ran into the path of respondent\u2019s vehicle. She was more than half way across the intersection when she was hit and was at least 55 feet from the curb or east edge of the highway and had only two or three steps to go before she would be clear of the path of respondent\u2019s vehicle and out of harm\u2019s way. Accordingly, s. 169(2) was not applicable in the circumstances of this case.\nSection 128(11)(a) says that the driver of a vehicle facing flashes of yellow (amber) light may cause his vehicle to enter the intersection and proceed only with caution but shall yield right\u2011of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk. The female appellant was lawfully in the crosswalk and the respondent was, accordingly, required to yield right-of-way to her. The reason he gave for not doing so was because he did not see her soon enough and he did not see her sooner because the lighting conditions at the intersection in question were such that the crosswalk area was a blind area to him as he came from the north. His duty in those circumstances was to enter the intersection at such a speed and keeping such a look-out that if a pedestrian should be in the crosswalk he would be able to yield the right-of-way to that pedestrian. There is nothing in the evidence to justify any suggestion that the female appellant ran from the east side of the highway because she says she started across walking slowly, and the evidence as to her running comes at a time almost coincident with being struck and perhaps she was making a last second effort to avoid being hit.\nI have no doubt that the jury\u2019s verdict cannot stand. The next question is whether there should be a new trial on the question of liability and damages or as to damages only. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia has the power to give the judgment which the trial court could have given: Rex v. Hess (No. 2)[1]. The power of the Court is discussed by O\u2019Halloran J.A. at pp. 597 and 598 and this Court has the power to do the same. The principle to be applied in determining whether there should be a new trial as to liability or as to damages only was discussed by O\u2019Halloran J.A. in Jardine v. Northern Co-operative Timber and Mill Association[2], where he says at p. 535:\nWhere as here the evidence is of such a character that only one view can reasonably be taken of its effect, it is not a case for a new trial, see McPhee v. E. & N. Ry. Co. (1913) 5 W.W.R. 926, 49 S.C.R. 43, Duff, J. at p. 55 (with whom Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J. and Brodeur, J. concurred) and also the decision of the old Full Court (Hunter, C.J., Irving and Martin, JJ.) in Yorkshire Guar. & Securities Corpn. v. Fullbrook & Innes (1902) 9 B.C.R. 270, but we ought now give the judgment which the plain facts proven conclusively at the trial demanded, and that is, judgment for the plaintiff-appellant as asked for in the statement of claim, less the sum of $286.48, mentioned shortly; see also Paquin Ltd. v. Beauclerk [1906] A.C. 148, 75 L.J.K.B. 395 (H.L.) and also Canada Rice Mills Ltd. v. Union Marine and Gen. Insur. Co. (No. 1) [1941] 3 W.W.R. 401, [1941] A.C. 55, 110 L.J.P.C. 1, Lord Wright at 65.\nIn the instant case all the evidence that could have any bearing on the liability of the respondent or on the contributory negligence, if any, of the female appellant was before the Court. There is no suggestion that anything new in the way of evidence would be forthcoming if the question of liability were to be retried. Any verdict which would exonerate the respondent from negligence in this case would, in my view, be perverse because on the evidence of the respondent himself, it is incontrovertible he failed in his duty to (1) keep a proper look-out; (2) to enter the intersection at such a speed that he could slow down or stop, if necessary, before striking a pedestrian who was lawfully in the pedestrian crosswalk; and (3) to yield right-of-way to the pedestrian as he was required to do by s. 128(11)(a) of the Motor-vehicle Act. On the other hand, the only evidence lawfully before the Court regarding the contributory negligence, if any, of the female appellant is that of the respondent that as he saw her she was running or walking very fast and this was, as he says, within \u201ca very very short time\u201d of the impact. There is no evidence upon which any finding could be made that the female appellant started across the highway in question without looking to see if it was safe to do so or that she did anything to jeopardize her own safety once she had made a substantial entry into that intersection. She was then entitled to assume that the driver of a motor vehicle coming from the north would obey the law and yield her right-of-way: Toronto Railway Co. v. King[3].\nI would accordingly allow the appeal and direct a new trial limited to the question of damages only. The appellants will have judgment against the respondent for the damages so assessed. The appellants are entitled to their costs in this Court and in both Courts below.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Braidwood, Nuttall & MacKenzie, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Russell & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\n[1] [1949] 1 W.W.R. 586.\n[2] [1945] 1 W.W.R. 533.\n[3] [1908] A.C. 260, 7 C.R.C. 408.\n"

For the next twenty years A managed the property exclusively and although the children realized that they had some sort of interest in it, they did not interfere with or even question the management thereof by A. In 1960 she listed the property for sale without notifying the children of what she intended to do and only two actually knew of the listing. Early in 1963 she accepted, in the presence of one of her daughters, the plaintiff\u2019s offer to purchase. The other two children were subsequently informed of the sale, but there was a failure on the part of all the children to make any protest when they learned what their mother had done. However, on being informed that their signatures were required on the deed, they refused to sign, and later refused to close when formal tender was made on the closing date.\nThe plaintiff had previously been granted permission by A, again without consulting her children, to enter the property and make repairs on the basis that such permission was not to be construed as possession. The plaintiff carried out the repairs as well as substantial renovations to the house and later he and his family moved in without obtaining permission to do so. A\u2019s children having refused to close, the plaintiff commenced an action for specific performance. His action was successful at trial and, on appeal, the decision of the trial judge was upheld by a majority of the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nNo agency relationship existed between the mother and her children at the time of sale. She had no express authority to bind the children to the contract; nor was it possible to draw any inference of actual authority. The children were not estopped by their silence and inaction after they had learned of the contract from denying that their mother had authority to sell their interests in the property. Silence and inactivity in the circumstances of this case were not a representation to a third party that their mother had authority to sell. Nor did the silence of the three children amount to ratification of their mother\u2019s act. The mother did not purport to act as agent for the others.\nAccordingly, the appeal by the children against the decree of specific performance as to their respective interests in the property succeeded and it was held that specific performance against the mother\u2019s interest should not be granted. The plaintiff\u2019s alternative claim for damages against the mother for breach of warranty of authority was allowed. A counterclaim for occupation rent for the period during which the property was occupied less an allowance to the plaintiff for the amount expended by him by way of repairs was also allowed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], upholding by a majority, a decision of Parker J. that respondent was entitled to specific performance of an agreement for the purchase and sale of certain lands and premises. Appeal allowed.\nW.J. Smith, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario1 upholding by a majority, a decision of Parker J. that the respondent was entitled to specific performance of an agreement for the purchase and sale of a property consisting of fourteen acres and a house.\nIn 1943, pursuant to the will of William James Crampsey, the husband of the appellant Anna Maud, the Capital Trust Corporation, as executor, transferred the property to Anna and her three children, Patricia, Teresa and James (all of whom were then of age) as joint tenants and not tenants in common. Capital Trust had managed the property from 1921, the date of William Crampsey\u2019s death, to 1943, the date of the transfer to the four beneficiaries. From 1943 to 1963, the year of the purported sale, Anna managed the property exclusively and received the rents from it, some of which she distributed among the children. They did not at any time interfere with or even question her management of the property although they realized that they had some sort of interest in it.\nIn May 1960, Anna, without consulting any of her children, listed the property for sale with a real estate firm at $4,000 per acre for a term of six months. Patricia and Teresa knew of the listing but James was never aware of it. No one was attracted by the offer. However, in February 1963, Deveney offered to purchase the property for $2,400 per acre. By this time Anna was very eager to sell. She had had trouble with a tenant of the house. She signed an agreement dated February 19, 1963, accepting the offer, which provided for a down payment of $250, $7,800 cash payable on the closing date of August 1, 1963, and the balance secured by mortgage. Teresa was present when her mother signed the agreement. The day after Anna telephoned Patricia and informed her of the sale. James was not informed immediately but he came to know of it some time before the actual closing date, which, after a number of extensions, was finally fixed at November 15, 1963.\nIn April, at the request of the purchaser\u2019s solicitor, the vendor\u2019s solicitor sent a draft deed which indicated that all four of the appellants were grantors. The former immediately wrote back asking for proof that the grantors were in fact the widow and all the children of William James Crampsey. In May, Deveney\u2019s solicitor asked for permission for his client to enter the property and make repairs on the basis that such permission was not to be construed as possession. Anna, without consulting any of the children, through her solicitor, granted permission on these terms. Deveney carried out the repairs as well as substantial renovations to the house and in September he and his family moved in without obtaining permission to do so. In late October, after numerous extensions of the closing date had been agreed upon, Anna\u2019s solicitor asked for an extension so that he might obtain the signatures of the children. This was granted. The children, however, on being informed that their signatures were required, refused to sign, and later refused to close when formal tender was made on the closing date. The respondent commenced an action for specific performance. Two questions are raised by this appeal. Was Anna an agent for her children with authority to sell the property on the above-recited terms, and if not, were the children estopped from denying that she had the authority to sell their respective interests in the property? In my view, no agency relationship existed between Anna and her children at the time of the sale. It is true that she had managed the property and collected the rents for many years. She always asserted her right to do this and that she alone had the right to sell and to sign the deed. No one in the family questioned her assertions. The fact that Anna had the property listed for sale in 1960 does not take the matter any further. She had no authority from the children to do so. Indeed, she did not even notify them of what she intended to do and only two actually knew of the listing.\nOn these facts, which are but a brief summary of the findings of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, Anna had no express authority to bind the children to this contract of sale. Nor is it possible to draw any inference of actual authority. Indeed, her position was all to the contrary\u2014that she did not need their authorization. None of the children presumed to contradict her.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge\u2019s order for specific performance against all four joint tenants by applying the doctrine of agency by estoppel. This doctrine is defined in 1 Hals., 3rd ed., pp. 158-9 in the following terms:\nAgency by estoppel arises where one person has so acted as to lead another to believe that he has authorised a third person to act on his behalf, and that other in such belief enters into transactions with the third person within the scope of such ostensible authority. In this case the first\u2011mentioned person is estopped from denying the fact of the third person\u2019s agency under the general law of estoppel, and it is immaterial whether the ostensible agent had no authority whatever in fact, or merely acted in excess of his actual authority.\nThe majority judgment held that the three children negligently or culpably stood by and allowed their mother to contract on the faith of a fact which they could have contradicted. They could not afterwards dispute that fact in an action against them. (Freeman v. Cooke[2].)\nMcGillivray J.A., in his dissent, would have held that the three inactive joint tenants, who believed their mother\u2019s honest but mistaken assertions of her right to sell and who did not know the precise nature of the interest which they had taken in the property under their father\u2019s will, were not estopped by their silence and inactivity after they had learned of their mother\u2019s acceptance of the offer to purchase.\nWe have nothing in this case except the following:\n(a) The knowledge of the children that the property had been listed for sale in 1960. Whether they knew of the precise terms of that listing does not appear from the evidence.\n(b) The knowledge of one daughter, Teresa, that her mother was contemplating a sale early in 1963 and her presence with her mother in the real estate agent\u2019s office when the mother signed her acceptance of the offer.\n(c) The failure on the part of all the children to make any protest when they learned what their mother had done.\nWhen Deveney made his offer, all that he knew was that a certain person had listed for sale a 14-acre property at a price of $4,000 per acre. He knew nothing of three other persons who were interested in the property and whom he seeks to bind by his contract. They made no representations to him. I agree with McGillivray J.A. that their silence and inaction after all three had learned of the contract cannot be built up into a representation by them to the purchaser that their mother had authority to sell their interests in the property. Silence and inactivity in the circumstances of this case are not a representation to a third party that their mother had authority to sell.\nIt was also argued that the silence of the three children amounted to ratification of their mother\u2019s act. Only the trial judge made a finding of ratification. I agree with the Court of Appeal that ratification cannot be found on the facts of this case. The silence and inactivity are not evidence of approval and adoption of the contract but rather of disquiet disapproval and ignorance of rights and, in the case of one of them, lack of knowledge that a contract had been made. It is unnecessary to discuss Keighley, Maxsted & Co. v. Durant[3], although the case is directly in point. The mother did not purport to act as agent for the others. She was acting for herself and asserting that she had that right.\nThe appeal by the children against the decree of specific performance as to their respective interests in the property-succeeds. I agree with McGillivray J.A. that specific performance against Anna\u2019s interest should not be granted and I can add nothing to what was said by him on this point. There remains the question of whether Deveney\u2019s alternative claim for damages against Anna for breach of warranty of authority should succeed.\nThe draft deed was drawn by the vendor\u2019s solicitor to show all four joint tenants as grantors. This was sent on April 8, 1963. The purchaser\u2019s solicitor, on April 9, sent in his requisitions, one of which was a requirement of proof that the grantors were the widow and all the children of William James Crampsey, deceased. At this time the purchaser\u2019s solicitor knew that his client had signed a contract with only one of four joint tenants.\nIn spite of this, on May 8, 1963, the purchaser\u2019s solicitor wrote to say that his client wanted to repair the house on the property before closing and he sought permission to do this subject to the condition that it was not to be construed as taking possession. Permission was given on these terms. This was a very hazardous thing to do with knowledge of the state of the title, although the solicitor may have been lulled into a feeling of security by the delivery of a draft deed showing all the joint tenants as grantors. In spite of the possible difficulties, Deveney made the repairs and more, in the form of substantial additions and renovations. He moved his family in in September without any further authorization and he was still in possession at the date of the trial. The defendants did not know that he was in possession until November 1, 1963.\nThe vendor\u2019s solicitor had not found out that Anna was not the sole owner until October 29, 1963, the eve of the date of closing as extended. The explanation is that the title had been searched and the draft deed drawn by a law clerk. The date of closing was then extended to November 15, 1963, but on November 7, 1963, he was compelled to inform the purchaser\u2019s solicitor that three of the joint owners refused to sign. Deveney understood throughout that Anna was the sole owner of the property. His solicitor had not informed him of the draft deed showing all four joint tenants as grantors. Even in October, when he wanted to make some change in the contract to provide for a payment of less cash, he negotiated directly with Anna.\nOn the question of damages, again I agree with McGillivray J.A. This is not a case of failure to convey through defective title. One joint tenant was purporting to contract to sell the complete interest. This was the cause of the inability to convey. McGillivray J.A. made the following award:\n(a)\nReturn of deposit....................................................\n$ 250.00\n(b)\nLoss of bargain......................................................\n2,000.00\n(c)\nRepairs and improvements..................................\n12,130.00\n$ 14,380.00\nThere was a counterclaim in this action for occupation rent at $100 per month for the period during which it was occupied, less a fair allowance to the plaintiff for the amount expended by him by way of repairs and improvements.\nI would therefore give judgment in this Court in the terms specified by McGillivray J.A., as follows:\nI would allow the appeal and vary the judgment by striking out the order for specific performance and provide in its stead judgment against Anna Maud Crampsey for $14,450 [this figure should be $14,380] and costs less any sum which this plaintiff recovers for repairs in the counterclaim with a direction that the plaintiff have a lien against the interest of Anna Maud Crampsey for the amount by which this award exceeds that on the counterclaim. The action should be dismissed against her co\u2011defendants without costs.\nThe judgment dismissing the counterclaim will be struck out and judgment entered for the plaintiffs by counterclaim for occupation rent at $100 per month for the period of occupation and for costs of the counterclaim less an allowance to the defendant by counterclaim for the amount expended by him by way of repairs. The plaintiffs by counterclaim are to be allowed their costs.\nIn the event that the parties fail to agree regarding the amounts awarded a reference is directed to the Master.\nThe defendants other than Anna Maud Crampsey will be allowed costs of the appeal.\nIn this Court the appellants are entitled to their costs. The costs in the Court of Appeal are dealt with in the reasons of McGillivray J.A., which I propose to adopt. The judgment for costs at the trial should be against Anna Maud Crampsey only and the defendants are entitled to their costs on the counterclaim.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendants, appellants: W.J. Smith, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Pallett & Pallett, Port Credit.\n[1] [1967] 1 O.R. 647, 62 D.L.R. (2d) 244.\n[2] (1848), 2 Exch. 654.\n[3] [1901] A.C. 240.\n"

Shortly thereafter, the company\u2019s solicitor forwarded to the defendant a copy of the document together with a letter which referred to an interpretation by the landlord permitting the defendant to assign the lease to his nominee. This letter was accepted and confirmed by the defendant.\nSubsequently, the defendant\u2019s nominee went into possession and paid rent for a time. It later fell into arrears and finally ceased operations. The plaintiff then brought action against the defendant for the arrears of rent, additional rent required by the lease and for damages. The trial judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action and on appeal the Court of Appeal by a majority decision dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Bissett J. Appeal dismissed. C. Benne Burchell, Q.C., and Allan E. Sullivan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. Merlin Nunn, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe following judgment was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for the Court):\u2014Mr. Nunn, we do not find it necessary to call upon you. We are satisfied that the document ex. M-1 referred to during the argument as a lease is not a lease because the lessee is named as \u201cMuise or his nominee\u201d.\nUnder this document Muise was not liable as a lessee. He subsequently named Olympic as his nominee and this company went into possession and paid rent for a time. No assignment of the purported lease was necessary or attempted to bring about this result. The letter ex. M\u20112 in referring to an interpretation permitting Muise to assign the lease to his nominee does not transform Muise into a lessee under the original document.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Burchell, Sullivan, Smith & Campbell, Sydney.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: D.

The loan was advanced in two parts and for each advance L signed a demand note in favour of the defendant. The security delivered to the bank consisted of a certified cheque and two government bonds. A change in the form of holding the cash portion of the pledge was made in 1954, and the plaintiff\u2019s bonds were converted to a new issue in 1958.\nDuring the period from 1952 to 1962 the defendant dealt actively with the principal debtor without consulting the plaintiff. The notes were renewed from time to time at increased rates of interest, and in 1957 the bank took from L a new note for the amount of principal then owing in substitution for the two original notes.\nIn 1962 the defendant\u2019s manager, after making efforts to get L to pay off the balance of the principal or to reduce that balance, took steps to realize on the pledged securities. A transaction was carried out which involved the withdrawal of funds from the plaintiff\u2019s account. An action subsequently brought by the plaintiff for moneys had and received by the defendant in trust for the use of the plaintiff was successful at trial.

On October 2, 1964, the Attorney-General of the province caused criminal charges to be laid against the plaintiff alleging his unlawful acceptance of benefits in his capacity as chairman of the Purchasing Commission. On the same day an Order in Council was passed purporting to relieve the plaintiff from all his duties with respect to the Commission until further notice. On January 15, 1965, the criminal charges against the plaintiff were dismissed and on March 8, 1965, an appeal of the Attorney-General from the acquittal of the plaintiff was, on motion made by counsel on behalf of the plaintiff, stricken out as frivolous and vexatious.\nThe plaintiff having refused to vacate his office, the Provincial Secretary on February 25, 1965, introduced a government bill in the Legislature entitled: \u201cAn Act to Provide for the Retirement of George Ernest Pascoe Jones\u201d. This bill passed the Legislature and received the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor on March 26, 1965.\nOn March 5, 1965, the defendant in the course of a speech which he delivered at a meeting of supporters of his political party used the following words: \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about the Jones boy. I could say a lot, but let me just assure you of this; the position taken by the government is the right position.\u201d\nIn an action for slander based on the words spoken by the defendant at the meeting of March 5, 1965, the plaintiff was successful at trial. On appeal, the Court of Appeal in a unanimous judgment allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal and dismissed the action. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe Court agreed with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that the words in question in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory and calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his office as Chairman of the Purchasing Commission.\nThe defence of qualified privilege failed. The Court was not prepared to assent to the proposition asserted by the defence that whenever the holder of high elective political office sees fit to give an account of his stewardship and of the actions of the government of which he is a member to supporters of the political party to which he belongs he is speaking on an occasion of qualified privilege. However, assuming, but far from deciding, that had no newspaper reporters been present the occasion would have been privileged, any privilege which the defendant would have had was lost by reason of the fact that the defendant must have known that his words would be communicated to the general public because while he was speaking two reporters sat at a press table in full view of the speaker\u2019s table.\nAs to the defence of fair comment, it was clear that the controversy between the plaintiff and the government was a matter of public interest and a proper subject for comment by any member of the public but the sting of the words complained of did not appear to be comment at all.\nDouglas v.

Berger, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 pronounced on January 15, 1968, allowing the appeal of the defendant from a judgment of Ruttan J. pronounced on March 3, 1967, whereby the plaintiff had been awarded $15,000 damages for slander. The judgment of the Court of Appeal directed that the action be dismissed.\nIt is necessary to state the facts in some detail.\nThe plaintiff was appointed on February 15, 1956, to be a member and Chairman of the Purchasing Commission established by the Purchasing Commission Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 281. Under this Act all supplies needed in the public service of British Columbia were required to be purchased through the Purchasing Commission.\nOn October 2, 1964, the Attorney-General of British Columbia caused criminal charges to be laid against the plaintiff alleging his unlawful acceptance of benefits in his capacity as Chairman of the Purchasing Commission. On the same day an Order in Council was passed purporting to relieve the plaintiff from all his duties with respect to the Commission until further order. The plaintiff refused to move out of his office, having been appointed to hold office during good behaviour and being removable only by the Lieutenant-Governor on address of the Legislative Assembly. These events were given widespread publicity throughout British Columbia.\nOn January 15, 1965, the criminal charges against the plaintiff were dismissed after trial at Victoria in County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court.\nOn February 10, 1965, the Attorney-General of British Columbia filed a notice of appeal against the acquittal on a ground involving a question of law alone although the acquittal of the plaintiff was based on the merits as well as on the legal ground that the plaintiff was not \u201can official of the Government\u201d within the meaning of the section of the Criminal Code under which the charges had been laid.\nOn February 25, 1965, the Provincial Secretary introduced a Government bill, No. 34, in the Legislature of British Columbia entitled \u201cAn Act to Provide for the Retirement of George Ernest Pascoe Jones\u201d. The bill provided that the plaintiff be deemed to have been retired and removed as a member and Chairman of the Purchasing Commission as of October 8, 1964, and it provided that he should receive $15,675 in lieu of salary and remuneration from October 1, 1964, to February 15, 1966, less deductions for income tax and superannuation contributions. The bill also provided that the plaintiff would have an option to take either a refund of his past contributions to the Civil Service Superannuation Fund or to receive a superannuation allowance under that statute as if he had remained in office until February 1966. The introduction of this bill created, in the words of one witness, \u201ca storm of controversy\u201d.\nOn March 5, 1965, when Bill 34 was still under debate in the Legislature, the defendant, who was and is the Premier of British Columbia, addressed a meeting of the Social Credit Association at Victoria, B.C., concerning various matters relating to the public affairs of the Province of British Columbia and of political interest and concern to the electors and to the members of his party. Most of the persons present were either members or supporters of the Social Credit Party. The Attorney\u2011General and the Minister of Mines as well as several members of the Legislature were present. Two newspaper reporters were also present. The defendant spoke to the meeting briefly commenting on several matters that were then of current interest to the public including the proposed Bank of British Columbia, the generally bright future of the province, the year\u2019s budget and the conduct of the members of the opposition parties in the Legislature. During his speech the defendant also made reference to the plaintiff and to the action of the government in introducing Bill 34 with respect to him and, as found by the learned trial Judge, used the following words:\nI\u2019m not going to talk about the Jones boy. I could say a lot, but let me just assure you of this; the position taken by the government is the right position.\nOn March 8, 1965, the appeal of the Attorney-General from the acquittal of the plaintiff was, on motion made by counsel on behalf of the plaintiff, stricken out as frivolous and vexatious.\nOn March 15, 1965, the plaintiff in the course of an address to the students of the University of Victoria said that he did not think that the defendant was anxious to get rid of him but that the government had had bad legal advice on the case from its own \u201cnon-practising lawyers\u201d, and that there were four persons in the government who wanted to get him out.\nOn March 26, 1965, Bill 34 passed the Legislature and received the assent of the Lieutenant\u2011Governor. On the same day the plaintiff commenced this action for slander based on the words spoken by the Premier at the meeting in Victoria on March 5, 1965, which have been quoted above.\nIn the statement of claim the substance of the facts recited above, other than the making of the plaintiff\u2019s statement to the students of Victoria University, is set out and the pleading continues:\n17. The Defendant never publicly gave any explanation or any reason for retiring and removing the Plaintiff from office at any time, either in the Legislative Assembly or outside the Legislative Assembly.\n18. All of the facts hereinbefore recited were widely publicized by the press and other news media and were well known to the public. 19. At a meeting of the Social Credit Association of Victoria held on the 5th day of March, 1965, at Victoria, B.C., the Defendant, referring to the Plaintiff, falsely and maliciously spoke and published of the Plaintiff the following words:\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about the Jones boy. I could say a lot, but let me just assure you of this; the position taken by the government is the right position.\u201d\n20. By the aforementioned words the Defendant meant, in addition to their natural and ordinary meaning, and was understood to mean that the Plaintiff was dishonest and unfit to act as Chairman of the Purchasing Commission and that the Plaintiff ought to be removed from office.\n21. The Defendant spoke and published the aforementioned words well knowing that newspaper reporters were present at the meeting and with the knowledge that his words would be printed and published in newspapers throughout the Province and disseminated by other news media throughout the Province, and the aforementioned words were printed and published in newspapers throughout the Province and disseminated by other news media throughout the Province.\n22. The aforementioned words were calculated to disparage the Plaintiff in his office as Chairman of the Purchasing Commission.\n23. By reason of the premises the Plaintiff has been greatly prejudiced and injured in his credit and reputation and has suffered damage.\nIn the statement of defence the defendant pleaded\n(i) a denial that he had spoken the words complained of;\n(ii) that the words in their natural and ordinary meaning are not actionable and did not disparage the plaintiff in his office;\n(iii) that the words complained of are incapable of bearing the meaning alleged in the innuendo set out in para. 20 of the Statement of Claim;\n(iv) a denial that the defendant \u201chad any knowledge that reporters were present at the alleged meeting or that such words would be printed or disseminated as alleged or at all\u201d;\n(v) a plea of qualified privilege;\n(vi) a plea of fair comment.\nThe plea of qualified privilege is set out in para. 24 of the statement of defence in the following words:\n24. The Defendant repeats paragraphs 19, 20 and 22 of this Statement of Defence and in the alternative the Defendant says in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim that if he spoke or published the aforesaid words (which is not admitted but is specifically denied) the same were spoken or published to certain electors and members of the Social Credit Association on an occasion of qualified privilege, particulars of which are as follows, namely:\nThe Defendant as the Premier of the Province of British Columbia and also as the head of a political party, namely the Social Credit Party of British Columbia, had a duty to communicate the position of the Government to electors and to members of his political party who had a legitimate interest in legislation before the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia concerning and regarding the removal from public office of the Plaintiff. The said words were spoken in good faith and in the honest belief that they were true and were spoken without malice towards the Plaintiff and in the premises the Defendant and the aforesaid electors and members of the Defendant\u2019s political party had a common and corresponding interest in the subject matter and publication of the said words.\nThe plea of fair comment is contained in para. 25 of the statement of defence which reads:\n25. In the further alternative and in further answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim the Defendant repeats paragraph 24 of this Statement of Defence and says that if he spoke or published the aforesaid words (which is not admitted but is specifically denied) the said words were a fair and bona fide comment upon a matter of public interest namely the aforesaid legislation regarding the removal of the Plaintiff from public office and the said words were published by the Defendant without malice and the publication thereof was for the public benefit.\nThere was no plea of justification.\nThe action was tried before Ruttan J. without a jury. At the trial counsel for the plaintiff stated that he was not relying on the innuendo which had been pleaded, his submission being that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning, taken in all the circumstances of the case, were defamatory and disparaged the plaintiff in his office of Chairman of the Purchasing Commission.\nAfter a careful review of the evidence the learned trial judge found as a fact that the defendant had spoken the words complained of, as pleaded in para. 19 of the statement of claim quoted above, and went on to hold that, applying the test of what the ordinary man would infer from them, the words in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory and calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his office as Chairman of the Purchasing Commission. These findings were accepted by the Court of Appeal and I agree with them. On this branch of the matter I do not find it necessary to add anything to what has been said in the Courts below.\nThe learned trial Judge rejected the defence of qualified privilege. He held that there was no need or duty which required the defendant to make the statement complained of and concluded his reasons on this point with the paragraph:\nIn any event the occasion was not used to communicate information, for the premier specifically stated he was not going to say anything. In fact he did leave them only with a slanderous imputation against Jones which cannot be justified on the grounds of interest or duty.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously reached a contrary conclusion. In that Court during the oral argument counsel for the plaintiff made a concession which is recited and relied on in the reasons of each member of the Court. Bull J.A. refers to it as follows:\nIn my respectful view, the learned trial judge took too narrow a view both of the occasion and the revelations made thereat, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances. It is unnecessary to express my reasons for this conclusion, as counsel for the respondent conceded before us, in my opinion correctly, that the dinner meeting at which the appellant\u2019s speech was made, was, under the circumstances, an occasion of qualified privilege, and that the \u201caffair\u201d with respect to the respondent could have been, if properly dealt with, a proper subject of qualified privilege protected within that privileged occasion. On this branch of the appeal, the respondent submits that any privilege was lost relying on two general contentions: (1) That apart from malice the appellant did not take advantage of the privileged occasion to make statements about the respondent that would have been within and protected by that privilege, but, on the contrary, uttered defamatory words not reasonably necessary or germane to the occasion and therefore in \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cabuse\u201d thereof; and (2) That there was sufficient evidence before the learned trial judge to support a finding of express malice, which the learned trial judge should have found proven, thereby displacing or rendering nugatory the defence of qualified privilege.\nIt is clear that no such concession was made at any stage of the trial.\nAt the opening of the appeal we informed counsel that each member of Court had read all of the reasons for judgment in the Courts below, that we did not regard ourselves as bound by the admission made by counsel in the Court of Appeal and that we wished to hear full argument on the question whether the occasion on which the words complained of were uttered was one of qualified privilege having regard especially to the fact that, to the knowledge of the defendant, newspaper reporters were present at the meeting. Following this, we had the advantage of hearing full and able argument from both counsel.\nParagraph 24 of the statement of defence in which the defence of qualified privilege is set up has already been quoted. It involves the assertion that whenever the holder of high elective political office sees fit to give an account of his stewardship and of the actions of the government of which he is a member to supporters of the political party to which he belongs he is speaking on an occasion of qualified privilege. I know of no authority for such a proposition and I am not prepared to assent to it. I will assume for the purposes of this appeal that each subject on which the defendant spoke to the meeting was one of public interest. It is not suggested that at the date of the meeting an election was pending. The claim asserted by the defence appears to me to require an unwarranted extension of the qualified privilege which has been held to attach to communications made by an elector to his fellow electors of matters regarding a candidate which he honestly believes to be true and which, if true, would be relevant to the question of such candidate\u2019s fitness for office. It is, of course, a perfectly proper proceeding for a member of the Legislature to address a meeting of his supporters at any time but if in the course of addressing them he sees fit to make defamatory statements about another which are in fact untrue it is difficult to see why the common convenience and welfare of society requires that such statements should be protected and the person defamed left without a remedy unless he can affirmatively prove express malice on the part of the speaker.\nHowever, I do not find it necessary to pursue this line of inquiry further because, assuming, although I am far from deciding, that had no newspaper reporters been present the occasion would have been privileged, I am satisfied that any privilege which the defendant would have had was lost by reason of the fact that, as found by the learned trial judge:\nThe Premier must have known that whatever he did say would be communicated to the general public. The two reporters sat at a press table in full view of the speaker\u2019s table.\nThis finding was concurred in by the Court of Appeal and is amply supported by the evidence.\nIn view of the unanimous judgments of this Court in Douglas v. Tucker[2], particularly at pp. 287 and 288, and in Globe and Mail Ltd. v. Boland[3], it must be regarded as settled that a plea of qualified privilege based on a ground of the sort relied on in the case at bar cannot be upheld where the words complained of are published to the public generally or, as it is sometimes expressed, \u201cto the world\u201d.\nThe case at bar must be distinguished from such cases as Adam v. Ward[4], where a false charge had been published to the world and it was held that in refuting it the defendant was entitled to address the same audience as had been chosen by the maker of the charge.\nIn my opinion the defence of qualified privilege fails.\nTurning next to the defence of fair comment, it is clear that the controversy between the plaintiff and the government was a matter of public interest and a proper subject for comment by any member of the public but the sting of the words complained of does not appear to me to be comment at all. I am content to adopt the reasons of the learned trial judge for rejecting this defence. The Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to deal with the defence of fair comment as they had upheld the defence based on qualified privilege.\nIt was submitted that the amount of damages awarded by the learned trial judge was excessive but I can find no ground for interfering with his assessment.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: Thomas R.

He alleged that a number of quotations from the article in their plain and ordinary meaning were defamatory of him and said that the words used were meant and were understood to have certain meanings. The defendants admitted publication of the said words but denied that they were defamatory. At the trial the defendants moved for a nonsuit. Instead of disposing of the motion for nonsuit, the trial judge reserved his decision and let the case go to the jury. Later, after the jury had brought in its verdict, he dismissed the motion. However, in his charge to the jury, he made several references to the difficulty he was having in deciding the motion.\nThe jury in a general verdict found that the plaintiff had been libelled and assessed the damages at $1. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal, basing his appeal against the award of $1 damages. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial both as to liability and quantum. The defendants then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed; judgment of the Court of Appeal varied.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: There should be a new trial on the issue of damages. The trial judge was in error when in his charge to the jury he referred to the fact that he was reserving his decision on the motion for nonsuit and that he was having difficulty in deciding whether or not the words were capable of a defamatory meaning. Agreement was expressed with the Court below that, reading the charge as a whole, the judge, time and again, must have confused and misled the jury on the matter of compensation. There was no reason for retrying the issue of libel or no libel. A jury had already made a valid finding on this aspect of the case.\nPer Spence J.: The trial judge, despite what might be described as a classic charge on libel so far as libel was concerned, did not sufficiently stress the jury\u2019s function to come to their conclusion not only on the question of libel but on the question of damages without feeling in any way bound by his personal views as to the facts and, therefore, there should be a new trial which, however, should be limited to the assessment of damages only.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Stark J. and ordering a new trial in a libel action.

The article in question carried the title \u201cThese Were The Years That Made Our World\u201d. The respondent alleged that 17 quotations from the article as set out in para. 10 of the statement of claim, preceded by the following words:\n10. In the said issue the Defendants printed or caused to be printed and falsely and maliciously published or caused to be published of the Plaintiff and of him in the way of his profession as an author, and in relation to his conduct, photographs and words as follows:\nwere libellous. He alleged that the quotations in their plain and ordinary meaning were defamatory of the respondent and in a subsequent paragraph said that the words used were meant and are understood to mean that the respondent:\n(a) is a spend-thrift;\n(b) a person whose contribution to the security of Canada was incidental and was of no great value;\n(c) a trouble maker;\n(d) a ward of the R.C.M.P.;\n(e) a dishonest man seeking to have the government do his family chores;\n(f) a lazy man and a work-shirker; (g) a man deluded by delusions of great wealth;\n(h) a washed out author;\n(i) an ungrateful person;\n(j) a person not worthy of the goodwill of his fellow Canadian citizens.\nThe appellants admitted publication of the words complained of but denied that they were defamatory, and further alleged by para. 8 of the defence that:\n8. In so far as the words set out in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim consist of statements of fact they are true in substance and in fact and in so far as the said words consist of expressions of opinion they are fair and bona fide comment made without malice upon the said facts which are a matter of public interest.\nThe trial was a short one. Certain questions and answers from the examinations for discovery of appellants were put in evidence by the respondent. The appellants called no witnesses. They moved for a nonsuit. Instead of disposing of the motion for nonsuit, the learned trial judge reserved his decision and let the case go to the jury. Later, after the jury had brought in its verdict, he dismissed the motion. However, in his charge to the jury, he made several references to the difficulty he was having in deciding the motion, and I will be dealing with this aspect of the matter later in these reasons.\nNo defence evidence having been tendered in support of their pleas by the appellants, the learned trial judge correctly charged the jury that they were not concerned with the truth or falsity of the article, he put it this way:\nNow remember, we are not concerned, as I say, with the truth or falsity of that statement. We presume it is false, and there is no evidence about that, but the question is: did that photograph and do those words detract from his, Gouzenko\u2019s reputation? These are the questions that you are going to provide the answers for.\nHe further charged them that certain of the passages complained of were not capable of being defamatory. Then he told the jury of the motion made by counsel for the appellants \u201cthat I should stop the case right then and there, and he argued that the words were not capable of having a defamatory meaning\u201d. He went on to say:\nNow when the plaintiff finished his case yesterday you gentlemen were asked to leave the room for a while, you will recall, and counsel for the defence rose to his feet and urged upon me this very matter, that I should stop the case right then and there, and he argued that the words were not capable of having a defamatory meaning. In other words that the plaintiff hadn\u2019t even crossed that first bridge. I reserved my deci- sion and I have been giving this question a lot of thought and last night in the rather late hours I was reading these words over and over again to try and decide that preliminary question, and I hope I have made it clear what that preliminary question is, whether the words are capable of being construed by reasonable men as defamatory, and that is not a simple question like the obvious examples that I mentioned a few moments ago: the thief, the liar, the rogue, that type of example. The result of all this is that I am still reserving my decision on this question and I am going to give this matter further thought and all I am going to say at this time is I am not going to rule that these words or some of them are completely incapable of a defamatory meaning. In other words I may not be too impressed by the seriousness of these allegations but I must be scrupulously fair to the plaintiff and what I am saying is this: that I am not satisfied that there is not some evidence to go before you and I am not going to take it away from you. I am simply saying I am not going to rule that these words are completely incapable of a defamatory meaning. I am quite sure a lot of them are completely incapable. There may be some that are not and I am not going to take it away from the jury at this time. Regardless of what your verdict is I may still change my mind, or rather, I may still make up my mind one way or the other and for that reason I am reserving that portion of the decision. So all I am saying to you now is that I am puzzled, I am not sure whether these words are capable in the minds of reasonable men of being construed in a defamatory sense. I am not sure that they are incapable and so I am going to ask you as reasonable men to decide whether in fact they did libel the plaintiff.\nIn so doing, he was, in my view, in error. Comments such as these are not for the ears of the jury.\nInstead of putting specific questions to the jury, the learned trial judge, with the consent of counsel, asked the jury for a general verdict. This procedure was criticized in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I am of opinion that this was a case in which asking for a general verdict was eminently the right course to follow.\nThe jury brought in a general verdict as follows:\n\u201cVerdict libel. Damages $1. Foreman Lester Bolton.\u201d\nThe respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, basing his appeal against the award of $1 damages. The Court of Appeal[2] ordered a new trial both as to liability and quantum.\nI am unable to agree with the Court of Appeal in so far as a new trial being required on the question of liability. The jury was properly charged on the question of libel or no libel. The verdict of \u201clibel\u201d justified the respondent\u2019s action. The Court of Appeal appears to have considered a new trial necessary on the question of liability because in its view specific questions should have been put to the jury. Kelly J.A. said in this regard:\nHad the jury in this case been asked to answer specific questions, in all probability a new trial, limited to the assessment of damages, could have been appropriately ordered.\nWhat the respondent Gouzenko was complaining of in the Court of Appeal was misdirection as to damages, and in this regard his argument in the Court of Appeal and here was that the learned trial judge had, at various times in his charge to the jury and particularly in discussing his own doubts in relation to the nonsuit motion, so denigrated the respondent\u2019s case for substantial damages and made light of the whole matter that what he did amounted to misdirection and resulted in the jury awarding nominal damages only.\nIn his reasons for judgment, Kelly J.A. said:\nIn this action the duty of the jury was to determine liability and, having done so, to assess damages. These were separate functions and should not have been intermixed. The jury\u2019s finding as to liability should have been made with respect to words which the Judge had already ruled capable of being defamatory or instructed the jury to assume to be so. The assessment of damages should have been made uninfluenced by the charge with respect to liability. The effect of this charge was to invite the jury to belittle the damages by the doubt that was thrown on liability.\nI agree with Kelly J.A. that, reading the judge\u2019s charge as a whole as one should do, the judge, time and again, must have confused and misled the jury on the matter of compensation. I am of opinion that there must be a new trial on the issue of damages. I see no reason for retrying the issue of libel or no libel. A jury has already made a valid finding on this aspect of the case.\nI would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal but vary the judgment of the Court of Appeal by restricting the new trial to the issue of damages only. The respondent should have his costs of this appeal.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014I would allow this appeal and restore the judgment at trial which allowed the plaintiff damages in the amount of $1 and the costs of the trial.\nThe plaintiff complained of libel in the issue of MacLean\u2019s Magazine dated September 5, 1964. The greater part of this issue contained an historical survey of the 1940\u2019s. As part of this survey there were approximately two columns devoted to the plaintiff. In his statement of claim the plaintiff referred to seventeen passages from these two columns as being libelous in their plain and ordinary meaning. This is all that we are concerned with in this appeal. There were no innuendoes, either pleaded or proved.\nMy opinion is that only two of these passages could possibly have been found to be capable of any defamatory meaning, including the one assigned by the plaintiff in his statement of claim, and there would have been no error if the trial judge had so instructed the jury. Instead of following this course he went through the passages one by one and expressed his opinion on them. He withdrew all but three passages from the jury\u2019s consideration and in leaving those three to the jury, he expressed a doubt whether they were capable of being defamatory. It was within his power to do this and that this power should not be restricted in the way proposed by the Court of Appeal. The jury brought in a general verdict of libel and assessed the damages at $1.\nI do not agree that the course followed by the judge had the effect of belittling the damages. His instruction on damages was emphatic and correct and there were no objections taken to his charge by either side. This was a highly exaggerated claim and the jury must have appreciated that fact. The plaintiff did not give evidence.\nI do not think that the new trial should be restricted to an assessment of damages. A jury assessing damages should not be restricted to a mere reading of the article in its context and to a hearing of whatever oral evidence is given on damages. If there is to be a new trial, the better course would be to direct that it be both on liability and damages.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Hall and have come to the conclusion that I shall concur therein. I need not repeat the recital of the circumstances and the course of litigation outlined in those reasons. As did my brother Hall, I agree with the statement of Kelly J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he said:\nThis statement of his difficulties in deciding whether the words were capable of a defamatory meaning was repeated three times in different but equally compelling language. In the light of the statement of Lord Porter in Turner v. M.G.M. Pictures Ltd., [1950] 1 All E.R. 449 at p. 454, I doubt if this is a case where the trial judge should have reserved his ruling on the issue of whether the words were capable of a defamatory meaning, but, assuming it was an appropriate case to reserve his ruling, he should simply have told the jury to assume that the words were capable of a defamatory meaning and that it was their duty to decide whether they were so in fact. He should not have told them of the motion made in their absence or have said anything about his difficulty in arriving at a conclusion as to whether the words were capable of a defamatory meaning. What happened in the jury\u2019s absence was wholly irrelevant to the function of the jury.\nHad the jury returned an answer that there was no libel, the plaintiff (here the respondent) would have had a very grave cause to complain as to the learned trial judge\u2019s charge. The jury, however, answered that there was a libel and, surely, that answer completely disposes of the objection to the learned trial judge\u2019s charge except as to the question of damages, with which I shall deal hereafter.\nKelly J.A. in the Court of Appeal found that there were other reasons which would justify a new trial as to both libel and damages. The learned trial judge had excluded evidence which was urged by the plaintiff as being admissible to prove express malice and the judgment of the Court of Appeal approved that ruling so that issue need not be further considered. The plaintiff in addition to pleading the libel in the ordinary and natural meaning of the word had assigned in para. 12 of the statement of claim some ten different innuendoes. The learned trial judge withdrew from the consideration of the jury seven of the ten meanings ascribed in the said innuendoes. Kelly J.A. in his reasons for judgment said:\n\u2026 I do not think it desirable to say more than the words complained of taken in their entirety are capable of supporting some of the other innuendoes set out in the statement of claim in addition to those which the learned trial Judge left with the jury.\nAt the trial, the plaintiff did not appear and the only evidence adduced was on behalf of the plaintiff and consisted of the reading of the actual article complained of and certain limited portions of the examination for discovery of the three defendants Lefolii, Spears and Fraser. I cannot understand how under those circumstances any innuendoes, in the primary meaning of that word, could be supported. There was no one who appeared to say that because of some extraordinary circumstance the words meant something other than their natural and ordinary meaning: Grubb v. Bristol United Press Ltd[3], per Upjohn L.J. at p. 392. This distinction was pointed out by the learned trial judge when he said when dealing with the submission of counsel for the defence that the consideration of the innuendoes should be taken from the jury as they had not been supported by the evidence:\nThen there is also a form of innuendo we commonly use whereby we do not much more than define the words or in fact the various meanings that the words may have.\nIn short, they were the mere extended definitions of the ordinary and natural meaning of the words. Therefore, a new trial as to liability is not required to deal with these alleged innuendoes. It must be remembered the jury, by its answer, did find a libel. The judge presiding at the new trial for the assessment of damages only could simply charge the jury that the words having already been found to be libel it was their function to determine the damages which accrued to the plaintiff as a result of the publication of such libel.\nI turn now to the problem of whether the plaintiff should have a new trial limited to the assessment of damages only or whether the judgment at trial should be restored.\nKelly J.A. in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario followed the statement which I have quoted above with these words:\nThe emphasis placed upon his difficulties in making up his mind could have one effect and one effect only on the jury to cause them to believe that, if the words were defamatory at all, the effect on the reputation of the appellant was trivial and that the damages suffered by the appellant were likewise trivial. It may be that what was said of the appellant was not serious: in a proper context a trial judge may properly express to the jury his own views in regard to the words used. But he should not permit his uncertainty as to the capability of the words to be defamatory, to influence the jury\u2019s assessment of the gravity of the injury to the appellant caused by those words.\nI am in agreement with the view of Kelly J.A. that the effect of the emphasis to the jury by the learned trial judge of his difficulty in making up his mind as to the possible defamatory nature of the words could cause the members of the jury to believe that the damages suffered by the plaintiff were trivial. As Kelly J.A. notes, the trial judge may properly express to the jury his own view of the facts. That is so whether the said facts are relevant to either liability or damages. The rather unique feature of an action for libel is that the libel, i.e., the thing which creates the liability, is also to a large degree the measure of the damages and, therefore, it is most important that in a libel action the warning, which it is the duty of the trial judge to give to the jury, that any expression of his personal view of the facts must be understood to be without any authority whatsoever and to be only an honest attempt to assist them in the performance of their duty should be stressed. He should be careful, in fact, to encourage the jury to disregard his personal views, which as I have said he had every right to express, at any time those views of the facts should fail to accord with his own.\nI have come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge in the present case, despite what might be described as a classic charge on libel so far as libel is concerned, did not sufficiently stress the jury\u2019s function to come to their conclusion not only on the question of libel but on the question of damages without feeling in any way bound by his personal views as to the facts and that, therefore, there should be a new trial which, however, as my brother Hall has pointed out, should be limited to the assessment of damages only. It is this unique feature of a trial of an action for libel which makes a new trial limited only to the assessment of damages a procedure of doubtful efficiency. I am only moved to resort to such a procedure in the present case because of the unusual fashion in which the plaintiff put forward his case. The plaintiff not only gave no testimony on his own behalf but did not even appear at the trial. The defendant MacLean-Hunter Publishing Company Limited, admitted publication. The plaintiff, as I have said, read in portions of the examinations for discovery of the defendants Lefolii, Spears and Fraser. These defendants adduced no evidence. Therefore, no witness gave evidence under oath at the trial. Under these unusual circumstances, there would seem to be no good reason why an assessment of damages could not proceed by a mere reading to the jury of the whole article in the magazine followed by the address of counsel and the judge\u2019s charge. I do not wish to be understood as so directing but merely mention these factors as moving me to concur with my brother Hall to limiting the new trial to an assessment of damages only. I also agree with my brother Hall\u2019s disposition of costs.\nAppeal dismissed but judgment varied, with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Smith, Rae, Greer, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Luck and Harris, Rexdale.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 262, 63 D.L.R.

Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited, [1969] S.C.R. 305\nDate: 1968-12-20\nCity of Prince Albert (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nUnderwood McLellan & Associates Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1968: May 8, 9, 10; 1968: December 20.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nGuarantee and suretyship\u2014Subrogation\u2014Respondent employed by appellant to prepare plans for and supervise construction of reservoir\u2014Performance bond by surety company provided by contractors\u2014Collapse of reservoir because of faulty method of backfilling\u2014Failure of respondent to properly supervise operation\u2014Payment made by contractors to surety and from surety to appellant\u2014Whether action brought in name of appellant against respondent champertous\u2014Whether appellant\u2019s right to recover from respondent extinguished.\nUnder a contract in writing the appellant city employed the respondent, a firm of engineers, to prepare plans for and to supervise the construction of a reservoir. A contract of construction prepared by the respondent was entered into between the city and a firm of contractors. Pursuant to a term of the construction contract requiring them to furnish a performance bond covering the faithful performance of the contract, the contractors provided such a bond by a surety company. Several months after work on the erection of the reservoir was begun the structure collapsed during the process of backfilling.\nFollowing the collapse the contractors took the position that they would not rebuild or complete the contract except without prejudice to the rights of all concerned. The respondent was unwilling to let the matter proceed on this \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d basis. Later, upon receipt of a certificate from the respondent that sufficient cause existed to justify such action, the city sent a notice to the contractors terminating their employment and advising them that the city intended \u201cto take immediate possession of the premises and finish the work by whatever method the City may deem expedient all in accordance with the provisions of the said contract\u201d. Following this the appellant employed another contractor to rebuild and finish the reservoir which was done in accordance with the original design and specifications at a cost of $149,191.88.\nSubsequently, under written agreements between the appellant and the surety and between the contractors and the surety, the contractors paid to the surety the sum of $101,039.28, i.e., the cost of rebuilding the reservoir less the amount owing by the appellant to the contractors under the original contract of construction, which amount the appellant held back. The sum of $101,039.28 was in turn paid by the surety to the city. It was provided, inter alia, that subrogated rights of the surety to sue in the name of the city should be exercised under the control of the contractors.\nAn action against the respondent brought in the name of the city was successful at trial, where it was held that the failure of the respondent to properly supervise the backfilling operation \u201cwas the prime factor in the collapse of the reservoir\u201d. On appeal, the Court of Appeal by a majority allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored subject to a variation as to quantum.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The surety company became an assignee by way of subrogation and by virtue of its agreement with the appellant, to which the appellant had to give effect by allowing the action to be taken in its name. No element of champerty or maintenance arose here.\nThe contention that the action was champertous having failed, nothing stood in the way of the appellant being entitled to judgment against the respondent for breach of their contract as found by the trial judge unless the payment made by the surety under its agreement with the appellant extinguished the appellant\u2019s right to recover from the respondent.\nThe payment in question was not a \u201crealization\u201d out of the contractors as stated by Riddell J.A. in Campbell Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Bowes; Campbell Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Ellis (1914), 32 O.L.R. 270 at 280, or a recovery within Imperial Bank of Canada v. Begley, [1936] 2 All E.R. 367. Here the payment was conditional. If the appellant had not permitted the action to be brought in its name it would have had to refund the money it got under the agreement. In that agreement the appellant did not purport to release the respondent nor the contractors, but specifically provided that the surety company should be subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the appellant against the contractors as well as against the respondent or any other persons arising out of the failure of the reservoir structure.\nFurther defences, viz., that the appellant was estopped and that the agreement between the appellant and the surety was ultra vires, were also rejected.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: As held by the Court of Appeal no question of subrogation arose in this case and the appeal was to be decided on the basis of the rights of the appellant against the respondent. The bonding company was not paying pursuant to its bond; it paid an amount larger than the penalty in the bond and did so with money furnished by the contractor and as its agent. A principal debtor who pays his debt has no right of subrogation.\nThe action failed because the appellant was not able to prove that it suffered any loss; indeed it was proved that before the action was commenced the appellant\u2019s loss had been paid in full.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Bence C.J.Q.B. Appeal allowed and trial judgment restored subject to a variation as to quantum, Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. dissenting. Alan W. Embury, Q.C., and John M. Embury, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.L. Robertson, Q.C., and K. Barton, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts and material documents are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall. A brief summary will be sufficient to make plain the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nOn the findings in the Courts below, which are fully supported by the evidence, the cause of the collapse of the reservoir was the faulty manner in which the backfill was applied by the contractor, Smith Bros. & Wilson Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe contractor\u201d. I think it clear that there was a breach of contract by the contractor but this need not be decided as it has actually paid the whole of the loss suffered by the appellant.\nThere is no doubt that there was a breach of contract on the part of the engineer, the present respondent, in failing to supervise the application of the backfill by the contractor and that this breach was a cause of the collapse.\nThe contractor was not a party to the contract between the appellant and the respondent and the respondent was not a party to the contract between the appellant and the contractor. In my view when the reservoir collapsed the appellant had causes of action against both the contractor and the respondent but these were independent and distinct causes of action.\nWe are concerned only with the action between the appellant and the respondent. In my view this action fails on the ground that the loss which was undoubtedly sustained by the appellant has been fully paid to it by the contractor partly in cash and partly by the appellant retaining the sum of $48,152.60 held back by it which, but for its breach, would have been payable to the contractor. The matter is, in my view, covered by the following sentence in the judgment of Riddell J.A. in Campbell Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Bowes; Campbell Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Ellis[2]:\nIt is true that, if the full amount of the damages were realised out of the contractors, no action (except perhaps for nominal damages) would lie against the architects, but that is on an entirely different principle, namely, that the plaintiffs have suffered no damage from the default of the architects.\nThe reasons given in the case just cited and in the passage from Mayne on Damages quoted in Truth & Sportsman Ltd. v. Kethel[3] for refusing to enquire into the existence of liability of a stranger to the contract for the loss caused by the breach by the defendant of its contract with the plaintiff have no application where that stranger is not merely said to be liable for but has actually paid the whole loss suffered by the plaintiff.\nI agree with the unanimous conclusion of the Court of Appeal that no question of subrogation arises in this case and that the appeal is to be decided on the basis of the rights of the appellant against the respondent. If the bonding company had in fact paid the appellant under its bond questions might have arisen as to whether it could claim to be subrogated to the appellant\u2019s right of action against the respondent but the contracts recited in the reasons of my brother Hall make it plain that the bonding company was not paying pursuant to its bond; it paid an amount larger than the penalty in the bond and did so with money furnished by the contractor and as its agent. A principal debtor who pays his debt has no right of subrogation.\nIn my view the action fails because the appellant is not able to prove that it suffered any loss; indeed it is proved that before the action was commenced the appellant\u2019s loss had been paid in full.\nThe proposition that a person who has suffered a loss and who has separate causes of action against more than one person to recover the amount of that loss cannot recover more than the total amount thereof is treated as too plain for argument in Imperial Bank of Canada v. Begley[4], a judgment of the Privy Council affirming the judgment of this Court in Begley v. Imperial Bank of Canada[5]. Lord Maugham giving the judgment of the Board says at p. 375:\nIt is clear that in the circumstances the respondent was not put to her election to sue either McElroy or the appellants: she could sue both or either, subject of course to this that she could not recover more than the total sum due to her.\nWhile it is clear that there was a breach of contract by the respondent and consequently the appellant may well have been entitled to a judgment against it for nominal damages, no claim for any such judgment was put forward either in the Courts below or before us and under the circumstances I think that the judgment of the Court of Appeal providing that the action be dismissed with costs ought not to be disturbed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[6] (Woods J.A. dissenting) which allowed an appeal by the respondent from a judgment by Bence C.J.Q.B. in favour of the appellant for $160,784.53.\nThe litigation arises out of the collapse of a water reservoir being built for the appellant city. The city employed the respondent, a firm of engineers, to prepare detailed plans and specifications for the proposed reservoir under a contract in writing dated July 28, 1961. This contract contained the following clauses:\nArticle 1 Branches of the Project:\nThe Engineer will perform engineering services as outlined in Article II, for the following branches of the project:\n1. New storage reservoir and pumphouse.\n2. Other items directly related to the provision of the above as agreed.\nArticle II Engineering Services:\nThe Engineer will perform the following services under this contract:\n1. Preliminary sketch plans and cost estimates. Attendances at any necessary meetings to discuss the project.\n2. Design of structures and ancillary items, selection of equipment and materials. Preparation of detail plans and specifications, call, receive and tabulate tenders and make recommendations to council for tender award. 3. Supervise construction of the project including all office functions such as checking of shop drawings and changes in methods and materials, prepare and submit monthly progress estimates and including resident supervision for continuous daily inspection and guidance of the contractor. Final \u201cas built\u201d plans and operating manuals will be submitted for record purposes.\n4. Arrange for soils investigation and materials testing as required.\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe respondent recommended a cylindrical type of reservoir having a diameter of 131 feet and a height of 30 feet to be constructed in an excavation, the whole of which when completed and capped would be surrounded by and covered with earth. The reservoir was to be constructed of concrete and was designed to utilize a particular preload or pre-stressed process owned by a firm known as Canadian Gunite. This process permits the use of a thinner wall than that type of construction which is confined to reinforced steel. It includes reinforced steel but in addition involves the installation of a series of wires under tension around the outside of the cement wall and a special composition added to the outside surface. This method provided a lighter overall structure and strengthened the walls against the internal pressure exerted when filled with water. The filling in of the excavated area surrounding the concrete structure by the process known as backfilling was something which had to be done with great care. Earth had to be placed in layers all around the structure so that no undue pressure would be exerted at any particular area on the wall of the reservoir. This was of special importance because of the comparative lightness of the pre-stressed concrete and its susceptibility to being moved by uneven external pressure.\nTenders were called for in accordance with the terms of the contract between the parties. The tender of a firm known as Smith Bros. & Wilson Ltd. was accepted and a contract of construction prepared by the respondent was entered into between the appellant city and said contractors. That contract, including the specifications as a part thereof, contained inter alia the following:\n10. Engineer and Contractor\nThe Engineer shall have general supervision and direction of the work, but the Contractor shall have complete control, subject to Clause 12, of his organization. The Engineer is, in the first instance, the interpreter of the contract and the judge of its performance; he shall use his powers under the contract to enforce its faithful performance by both the parties hereto.\n20. Emergencies\nThe Engineer has authority to stop the progress of the work whenever in his opinion such stoppage may be necessary to ensure its proper execution. In an emergency affecting or threatening the safety of life, or the structure, or of adjoining property, he has authority to make such changes and to order, assess and award the cost of such work extra to the contract or otherwise as may in his opinion be necessary.\nIn the specifications A under General Instructions:\n(11) (e) All materials to be incorporated in the work shall be stored under suitable conditions to prevent damage, deterioration, contamination, etc. No materials to be incorporated in the work shall be temporarily used or installed as a facility for construction purposes except with the express approval of the Engineer.\nB under General Trades:\n(8) Backfilling:\n(a) All free water surrounding concrete structures in excavation prior to backfilling must be completely removed and only dry unfrozen material may be used for backfill. Backfilling generally, unless otherwise particularly specified or noted, shall consist of gravel or of clean earth, particularly against concrete walls.\n(b) All backfill and embankment required around the structure shall be deposited in layers and carefully consolidated to the lines and grades indicated on the drawings, as indicated by the Engineer, but not previous to 21 days after completion of placing the concrete for the walls. Where additional fill is required to comply with the drawings, it shall be furnished by the Contractor without additional remuneration.\n(c)\u2026\u2026\n(d) Backfilling shall not be done against walls that have been waterproofed, until the waterproofing has been inspected and approved by the Engineer; then it shall be placed in layers, and consolidated in such a manner as to not damage the waterproofing.\n(e) Local pockets of materials which in the opinion of the Engineer are unsuitable for slab support shall be removed to such depth as the Engineer may require and replaced with compacted pit-run gravel.\n(f) Backfill over the reservoir shall consist of 3\u201d of gravel and clean earth to the elevations noted. Consolidation of fill over the reservoir shall be done with light machinery to minimize the possibility of damage.\n25. Leakage Test: After the covercoating has been applied but before waterproofing and backfilling the reservoir and pumpwell shall be water-tested.\nThe pumpwell shall be left empty while the reservoir is tested. This will indicate any leaks in walls of the pumpwell.\nThe chamber shall be filled to operating level with clear water and shall remain standing for 24 hours. If no leaks develop and on approval of the Engineer, the Contractor may proceed with waterproofing and backfilling as further specified herein. If leaks do develop, they shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer. After leaks have been repaired, the chambers shall be re-tested to ensure that the repairs are satisfactory. All visual leaks shall be repaired.\n. . .\n26. Waterproofing: The perimeter walls (interior and exterior) and reservoir roof shall receive two coats of asphalt waterproofing, Flintkote Static Asphalt Protective Coating Type I, or approved equal. The inside of the perimeter wall may be waterproofed prior to testing but the exterior surface shall not be waterproofed until after testing.\n. . .\nThe Contractor shall obtain the approval of the Engineer on the first coat before proceeding with the second coat. After approval has been received on the second coat, the Contractor shall proceed with backfilling as specified elsewhere herein.\n(Emphasis added.)\nClause 27 of the construction contract required the contractors to furnish a performance bond covering the faithful performance of the contract. Pursuant to this clause the contractors provided a bond by Western Surety Company in the sum of $93,500. That bond reads in part as follows:\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that SMITH BROS. & WILSON LIMITED, a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of Saskatchewan, (hereinafter called the Principal) and WESTERN SURETY COMPANY, a corporation created and existing under the laws of the Dominion of Canada and whose principal office is located in Regina, Saskatchewan (hereinafter called the Surety), are held and firmly bound unto CITY OF PRINCE ALBERT (hereinafter called the Obligee), in the full and just sum of NINETY-THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED\u2026\u2026.xx\/100 Dollars, lawful money of the Dominion of Canada, to the payment of which sum, well and truly to be made, the said Principal binds itself, its successors and assigns, and the said Surety binds itself, its successors and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents. Signed, sealed and delivered this 15th day of June, A.D. 1962. WHEREAS, said Principal has entered into a certain written contract with the Obligee, dated April 25, 1962 for the construction of water storage reservoir, which by reference hereto is made part hereof as fully to all intents and purposes as though recited in full herein. NOW, therefore, the condition of the foregoing obligation is such that if the said Principal shall well and truly indemnify and save harmless the said Obligee from any pecuniary loss resulting from the breach of any terms, covenants and conditions of the said contract on the part of the said Principal to be performed, then this obligation shall be void; otherwise to remain in full force and effect in law;\nSmith Bros. & Wilson Ltd. will hereinafter be referred to as the contractors.\nThe work on the erection of the reservoir was begun in the month of April 1962, with one Jenkins as superintendent in charge on behalf of the contractors and an engineer representing the respondent by the name of Farley. Farley was replaced in mid-September 1962 by one Palichuk also employed by the respondent who had graduated in electrical engineering in the spring of 1962 and had worked for the respondent for one year prior to that time. He became a professional engineer in 1964. Both Jenkins and Palichuk continued in their respective positions until the reservoir collapsed. The collapse occurred on November 29, 1962, during the process of the backfilling operation.\nThe events preceding the collapse are set out in the judgment of Bence C.J.Q.B. as follows:\nWhen the reservoir was filled with water to test it for leaks prior to proceeding with the water-proofing of the exterior it was found that a portion consisting of approximately thirty per cent of the perimeter in the south-east section showed wet spots.\nAccording to Jenkins, Palichuk was on the job at the time the testing was done and instructed him to proceed to repeat the water-proofing on the inside of the thirty per cent. It was necessary for this purpose to drain the water out, which was done. While this was going on the construction company proceeded with the exterior water-proofing on the seventy per cent area which was free of leaks. Jenkins stated that he asked permission from Palichuk to proceed with the backfilling on the seventy per cent and that Palichuk gave him such permission subject to any water in the trench being removed. Palichuk confirmed this in his evidence.\nBackfilling operations commenced on Friday, November 23rd, which was the day after the said permission was given by Palichuk. It continued on Saturday and also on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the following week. The collapse occurred at about five o\u2019clock on the Thursday. At no time was there ever any backfilling on the said thirty per cent. Apparently the exterior water-proofing on the seventy per cent was going on at the same time as the backfilling. The exterior waterproofing was finished on Tuesday, November 26th.\nAccording to Palichuk, he left the job site Monday morning for Shellbrook to examine another construction job being undertaken at that point. He stated that before doing so he told Jenkins not to go beyond the limits of six to eight feet around the reservoir. This is denied by Jenkins, who said that the only warning that was ever given by Palichuk to him was not to use too large lumps in the backfill.\nPalichuk remained in Shellbrook that night and returned to Prince Albert around three o\u2019clock the following afternoon and arrived on the job site at approximately 4:00 p.m. He stated that he found the backfill was up to the grade level, which is 20 to 24 feet from the bottom of the excavation. He said that when he observed this he talked to Jenkins and asked him why he had gone beyond the six to ten feet. Again, according to him, Jenkins replied that the reason he did so was that there would be enough counter action around the seventy per cent to prevent damage to the walls. Palichuk testified that his reply was merely: \u201cI told him it is up to you Bill, you are doing the work.\u201d Nothing further was done and no warnings were given. Jenkins said that any instruction given to him by Palichuk were carried out. He insisted he received no advice or warnings from any one that the method of backfilling that he was doing was dangerous. He did state that the backfill which he did do was deposited in layers as these were the instructions in the specifications and also the instructions of the resident engineer Palichuk.\nBence C.J.Q.B. found and the finding is fully supported by the evidence that the reservoir collapsed because of the faulty method of backfilling in which about seventy per cent of the circumference was covered leaving the remaining thirty per cent without support. This was described as unsymmetrical loading and contrary to the specifications in the construction contract.\nThe care which had to be exercised in the back-filling operation was well known to Palichuk. One Davidson representing the Canadian Gunite Company visited the construction project on October 12, 1962, and testified that he had a discussion on the site with both Palichuk and Jenkins and that he described to them the proper procedure to be followed which was to go around the entire structure with the fill material in layers of about one foot in depth. Davidson followed up his concern about the backfilling operation by calling upon the respondent\u2019s officials in Saskatoon and discussing the procedure with them. He then returned to his company\u2019s office in Calgary where, being still apprehensive concerning the backfilling, he wrote a letter to the respondent dated October 16, 1962, as follows:\nUnderwood McLellan & Associates Ltd.,\nBox 539,\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\nAttention: Mr. K. Mountain, P. Eng.\nReference: Prince Albert Reservoir\nGentlemen:\nAt this time we take the liberty of writing to you regarding the pending backfill work at the Prince Albert Reservoir. As is the case with any concrete reservoir the backfill must be properly placed to avoid damaging the walls and we mention the following points here in case you would wish to pass any or all of them along to the contractor or persons responsible for this work.\n\u2014Care must be taken to avoid uneven loading to structure.\n\u2014Backfill material must be soft earth, free from rock and stones.\n\u2014No machines should be allowed close enough to increase side pressure on the wall.\n\u2014Backfill material must be placed successively about the structure so as to avoid uneven loading.\n\u2014If compaction is required this too should be done in a manner avoiding uneven loading and impact. Mr. Warder has enquired regarding the possibility of using a \u2018cutback\u2019 type asphalt as an exterior wall treatment material and we are now waiting for a reply from the suppliers of the rubber jointing materials in this regard. You will hear from us soon.\nYours very truly,\nTHE CANADA GUNITE COMPANY LIMITED,\nSgd. \u201cR.G. DAVIDSON\u201d\nR.G. Davidson,\nBranch Manager.\nThis letter was entered as ex. P. 10. The contractors were not sent a copy nor any similar communication.\nPalichuk testified that he received a copy of Davidson\u2019s letter (P.10) from his principals and that he showed the copy to Jenkins. Jenkins denied having been shown a copy prior to the collapse. Regarding this conflict in the evidence, the learned trial judge said: \u201cI prefer to accept Jenkins\u2019 testimony in this regard.\u201d\nThe appellant city brought action against the respondent claiming:\n(1) that the design was faulty.\n(2) in the alternative that the defendant failed to use reasonable and proper skill in supervising the construction of the reservoir particularly during the backfilling operation and permitted and indicated through its resident engineer a backfill operation around part of the circumference of the reservoir leaving a gap in the backfill and causing the wall to collapse where it was unsupported by backfill in the area of such gap.\nThe claim based on faulty design was dismissed by Bence C.J.Q.B. and was not urged in this Court.\nThe learned trial judge made the following findings of fact:\n(a) It was generally agreed by the witnesses, and I have no hesitation in finding, that the cause of the collapse was the faulty method used in backfilling by the completion of about seventy per cent of the circumference while leaving the balance of thirty per cent without any support. This is described as unsymmetrical loading.\n(b) In the light of the knowledge which Palichuk says he had about the necessity of proper backfilling, his awareness of the information contained in the said letter, Exhibit P.10, and his familiarity with the specifications, I have come to the conclusion that he was negligent in not insisting at the time of his return from Shellbrook that no further work should be done on the backfilling. His attitude that it was up to Jenkins as he was doing the work is inexplicable. It is my view that it was his duty under the contract to have insisted that Jenkins stop and if there had been a refusal the matter should have been immediately reported both to the management of the contracting company and to the officials of the defendant. (c) Palichuk was further negligent by giving Jenkins permission in the first place to proceed with the backfilling when he knew that it could not be done around the thirty per cent. He did state that the thirty per cent could have been water-proofed up to the places where the water leak marks showed, these marks being above the grade level, but there is no evidence that he suggested that this be done.\n(d) It seems to me also that Palichuk should not have left the job at this rather critical juncture for a period of over a day. He failed to give \u201ccontinuous daily inspection and guidance\u201d.\n(e) For the reasons I have indicated I find the defendant through its agent Palichuk was negligent in the discharge of his duties and responsibilities and that such negligence resulted in the collapse of the reservoir. If he had acted as he should have done and provided proper supervision the damage which incurred could have been avoided.\n(f) I have found that the defendant\u2019s failure to discharge its responsibility under the contract was the reason for the collapse of the reservoir. Smith Bros. & Wilson Ltd. believed that this was so and in my opinion were justified in adopting the stand they did.\n(g) I find that the defendant did have a responsibility with respect to supervising the proper carrying out of the operation, that it failed in its discharge thereof and that such failure was the prime factor in the collapse of the reservoir.\nThe Court of Appeal summarized the learned trial judge\u2019s findings of negligence under three headings:\n(1) In his failure to stop continuance of backfilling operations on his return to the site after absence from a Monday morning to late Tuesday afternoon, when backfilling had then reached grade level;\n(2) In granting permission to commence backfilling operations when it could not be done on the thirty per cent area;\n(3) In absenting himself from the work for a period in excess of twenty-four hours, and this during what the trial judge termed a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d.\nMaguire J.A. concurred in finding that there had been a breach of contract by the respondent. He said:\nI think there is evidence upon which the learned trial judge could make his first finding of breach of contract by the engineer. The engineer company employee, Palichuk, when he returned to the site on the Tuesday late afternoon and observed that backfill on the seventy per cent of the circumference had proceeded almost to grade level and thus most substantially in excess of what he states he had authorized or approved, knew, or should have known, that this constituted a serious menace to the safety of the structure. Even though this situation may have arisen through default of the contractor, the engineer, in performing his duties to the City, failed to act and take what appears to be a rather obvious precaution for the safety of the structure, namely by ordering cessation of further backfill, until such fill could be brought up to level in the remaining thirty per cent circumference.\nHe did not deal with 2 and 3 holding it was not necessary to do so. In my view all the findings of negligence made by the learned trial judge and so summarized by Maguire J.A. were fully supported by the evidence. The contractors were not parties to the action nor was any application made to join them as might have been done under the Saskatchewan Queen\u2019s Bench Rules of Court. The learned trial judge did not make any finding of negligence against the contractors. Regarding the cause of the collapse, he found specifically:\nThat the defendant\u2019s failure to discharge its responsibility under the contract was the reason for the collapse of the reservoir. Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited believed that this was so and in my opinion were justified in adopting the stand they did.\nand that the failure of the respondent to properly supervise the backfilling operation \u201cwas the prime factor in the collapse of the reservoir\u201d.\nMaguire J.A., in dealing with this last finding, said:\nI do not interpret the trial judgment as absolving the contractor from negligence in the performance of its duties during construction. The learned trial judge directed his consideration to whether, as between the city and the engineer, and under the terms of the engineer\u2019s contract, it had committed a breach or breaches in the performance of its contractual duties. The findings that the negligence of the engineer was the \u201cprime cause\u201d of the failure of the structure goes no further than this.\nWhile, as Maguire J.A. says, this does not absolve the contractors, it does not in any way constitute a finding of negligence against them but even if it did, the collateral liability, if any, of the contractors to the appellant under a separate and distinct contract cannot be used to defeat the appellant\u2019s right to judgment against the respondent, Campbell Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Bowes; Campbell Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Ellis[7]; Truth & Sportsman Ltd. v. Kethel[8], and Mayne & McGregor on Damages, 12th ed., p. 162, nor could the liability of the contractors be determined in the present action as constituted, they not being parties. Mayne on Damages, 10th ed. at p. 127.\nThe appellant was, therefore, entitled to succeed against the respondent unless under another aspect of the case which must now be examined, it has suffered no damage.\nThis second aspect has its foundation in certain agreements made between the appellant and Western Surety Co. on the one hand and between the contractors and Western Surety Co. on the other after the collapse of the structure. Following the collapse the appellant made a demand on the surety company but that company denied liability under the bond by letter dated March 14, 1963, as follows:\nThe City Clerk,\nCity Hall,\nPRINCE ALBERT, Saskatchewan.\nDear Sir:\nRe: New Water Storage Reservoir and Pump House\nWe have your registered letter of March 8th, 1963, with enclosures.\nWe understand from Smith Bros. & Wilson Ltd. that they take the position the City has wrongfully and without sufficient cause terminated their contract and that there has been no breach of contract or other default on their part.\nThis being the case, our Company contemplates taking no action at this time.\nYours very truly,\nWESTERN SURETY COMPANY.\n(sgd) \u201cL.N. RAY\u201d\nLionel N. Ray,\nGeneral Manager.\nFollowing the collapse of the structure, the contractors took the position that they would not rebuild or complete the contract except without prejudice to the rights of all concerned. In a letter to the respondent dated January 3, 1963, they said in part:\nUnderwood, McLellan & Associates Ltd.,\nConsulting Professional Engineers,\n1721\u20148th Street East,\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan.\nDear Sirs:\nRe: Prince Albert Reservoir\nYou have indicated to us that you do not intend to reply to our letter of December 11th, nor to acknowledge that any work of repair carried out by us is to be without prejudice to the rights of all concerned, and is not to be construed as an admission of liability on our part.\nWithout such an agreement and acknowledgment from you and the City of Prince Albert, we find it impossible to undertake the responsibility of making repairs.\nWe do not ask that you or the City abandon any rights that you may have in the matter, but we ask simply that the question of liability be kept open and unaffected, and that our undertaking to make repairs is without prejudice to our right to claim payment for the same in addition to the contract price.\nHowever, if you and the City are unwilling to facilitate matters as requested we must decline to proceed with the repairs. A copy of this letter was sent to the appellant. The appellant replied on January 21, 1963, through its solicitor as follows:\nI have been retained by the City of Prince Albert in connection with the difficulties which have arisen in the matter of the completion of the New Storage Reservoir and Pumphouse.\nI have before me and have perused your tender of April 19, 1962, for the construction of this work; the agreement made on the 25th day of April, 1962, between your Company as Contractor and the City of Prince Albert as Owner; General Conditions of the contract; instructions to bidders and specifications.\nIn our opinion it is clear that your Company undertook and agreed to do and fulfill everything which is indicated by the above documents and the drawings and to complete the work within the time specified.\nThe work has not been completed in terms of the agreement and is at present in a state requiring major repairs to the work which was done.\nIn the above circumstances the City hereby gives you the Notice and makes the demands following:\nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT THE CITY HEREBY requires you to complete the construction of the Water Storage Reservoir and Pump House referred to in the Agreement of April 25, 1962, in accordance to the terms of the said agreement, general conditions of the contract, the instructions to bidders, the specifications, the tender and the drawing above referred to;\nAND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE THAT UNLESS you agree to proceed with the completion of the work the City will have no alternative but to terminate the agreement and\/or call upon the Bonding Company to complete the work.\nIn giving this notice and in making this demand the City agrees that, while denying any liability or responsibility, you may proceed on the understanding that it is without prejudice to any legal right or claim you may have against it for payment for the repair work in addition to the Contract price and by the same token without prejudice to any legal right or claim the City may have against your Company to claim payment for expenses or damages incurred or suffered by it or to enforce any other right which it may have.\nThe respondent was, however, unwilling to let the matter proceed on this \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d basis. It stated its position in a letter to the solicitors for the contractors dated February 14, 1963, reading:\nYesterday in our meeting with Mr. Cuelenaere, you asked Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited to agree that if your client Smith Brothers and Wilson completed the reservoir at Prince Albert according to its contract with the City, its so doing would be \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d to any right it might have against Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited.\nWhile we do not know of any right your client may have in this regard, we have discussed your request at some length with our principals and are instructed to say that they do not agree to it. On February 25, 1963, the respondent, purporting to act under the provisions of the construction contract, certified to the appellant as follows:\nIN THE MATTER OF A CONTRACT DATED THE 25TH DAY OF APRIL, 1962, BETWEEN THE CITY OF PRINCE ALBERT AND SMITH BROTHERS & WILSON LTD. FOR THE ERECTION OF A RESERVOIR:\nCERTIFICATE\nWHEREAS Smith Brothers & Wilson Ltd. is the Contractor named in a certain contract dated the 25th day of April, 1962, between it and the City of Prince Albert;\nAND WHEREAS Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited is the Engineer of the City named in said contract;\nAND WHEREAS the said Smith Brothers & Wilson Ltd., under the provisions of said contract contracted and agreed with the City of Prince Albert to perform and complete the work, including the erection of the reservoir, described and specified in said contract by not later than the 21st day of August, 1962;\nAND WHEREAS said Smith Brothers & Wilson Ltd. has not performed and completed the work, including the erection of said reservoir, which it was required to do under said contract, and the said Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited estimates that the said work cannot now be completed until about July 1st, 1963, at the earliest;\nAND WHEREAS the said Smith Brothers & Wilson Ltd. Has done no work under said contract since about the 29th day of November, 1962, notwithstanding requests both verbal and in writing to proceed with and complete said work, including the erection of said reservoir;\nNOW THEREFORE the said Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited does hereby certify that in its opinion, and because of the foregoing, the Contractor is in substantial violation of the provisions of said contract and that, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, sufficient cause exists to justify the City of Prince Albert, by written notice to the said Smith Brothers and Wilson Ltd., terminating the employment, under said contract, of the said Smith Brothers & Wilson Ltd., taking possession of the premises on which said work was to have been executed and all materials, tools, structures and appliances thereon and finishing the work, without undue expense or delay by whatever method may be deemed expedient, all in accordance with the provisions of the said contract.\nIt will be noted that this certificate makes no reference to the collapse of the structure or to any allegation of negligence in respect thereto on the part of the contractors. The substantial violation asserted against the contractors was that:\nSmith Bros. & Wilson Ltd. has done no work under said contract since about the 29th day of November, 1962, notwithstanding requests both verbal and in writing to proceed with and complete said work, including the erection of said reservoir. The appellant thereupon gave the contractors the following notice on March 5, 1963:\nIN THE MATTER OF A CONTRACT DATED THE 25TH DAY OF APRIL, 1962, BETWEEN SMITH BROTHERS & WILSON LTD., AS CONTRACTOR AND THE CITY OF PRINCE ALBERT, AS OWNER, FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A WATER STORAGE RESERVOIR AND PUMPHOUSE:\nNOTICE\nTAKE NOTICE that the City of Prince Albert having received the Certificate of the Engineer, Underwood McLellan & Associates Limited that sufficient cause exists to justify such action, a copy of which said certificate is attached hereto, does hereby give you Notice terminating your employment as Contractor and does hereby notify you that the City intends to take immediate possession of the premises and finish the work by whatever method the City may deem expedient all in accordance with the provisions of the said contract.\nFollowing this the appellant employed another contractor to rebuild and finish the reservoir which was done in accordance with the original design and specifications at a cost of $149,191.88.\nWhen the reservoir had been rebuilt and the cost of so doing ascertained the surety company on June 2, 1964, entered into an agreement with the appellant under which the appellant received $101,039.28. No doubt negotiations between the appellant and the surety company and the contractors must have taken place in the months preceding June 1964 although the record is silent in this respect. This agreement reads:\nWHEREAS by a contract in writing between Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited, a body corporate carrying on business in the Province of Saskatchewan, and the above named City of Prince Albert, the said Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited contracted to erect a certain reservoir for the said City of Prince Albert in the said City to certain designs and specifications outlined in the said contract.\nAND WHEREAS the said City of Prince Albert entered into a contract in writing with Underwood McLellan and Associates Limited, a body corporate carrying on business in the Province of Saskatchewan, to provide engineering services and supervision for the erection of the said reservoir.\nAND WHEREAS Western Surety Company entered into its Bond Number 01-1-4461 for the due performance of the said contractor, Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited, in the construction of the said reservoir.\nAND WHEREAS on the 29th day of November, A.D. 1962, the structure of the said reservoir failed before construction had been completed and expenses were incurred in reconstruction and completion resulting from the said failure.\nAND WHEREAS the City of Prince Albert has completed the said repairs and construction of the said reservoir at a cost of $149,191.88 and claims the said sum less $48,152.60 owing by it to Smith Bros. & Wilson under the original contract of construction, namely, $101,039.58 from the said Western Surety Company pursuant to the terms of the said bond.\nNOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH:\n1. That in consideration of the premises and the payment of the sum of $101,039.28 now paid by the said Western Surety Company unto the City of Prince Albert (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged), the City of Prince Albert does hereby release, remise and forever discharge the said Western Surety Company from all claims, demands, actions or causes of actions whatsoever which the said City of Prince Albert may have against Western Surety Company under and by virtue of the said bond.\n2. By virtue of such payment, the said City of Prince Albert acknowledges and agrees that Western Surety Company is subrogated to all of the rights and remedies for recovery of the City, both in contract and in tort, in law and in equity, enjoyed at any time by the City of Prince Albert arising out of either its contract with Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited or Underwood McLellan and Associates Limited or any other persons whatsoever arising out of the failure of the said reservoir structure, with the right in Western Surety Company to sue in the name of the City of Prince Albert against any person or corporation as it may be advised for the full enforcement of such rights, remedies and recoveries, and the City of Prince Albert agrees it will deliver to Western Surety Company all original contract documents, correspondence or any other relevant documents, vouchers or accounts in its possession and will co-operate fully with the said Western Surety Company in the prosecution of any action for such recovery, subject always to the condition that such co-operation and subrogation shall be at the expense of the said Western Surety Company; provided further that the said Western Surety Company will save the City harmless from any legal costs incurred in any action taken in the name of the City of Prince Albert from any judgment on any claim or counterclaim for engineering services incurred in demolition and rebuilding; and the City of Prince Albert agrees that if in any such action the costs of demolition and rebuilding of the said reservoir shall be found by the court to be less than the sum paid by the City of Prince Albert for this purpose, then the City of Prince Albert will refund to Western Surety Company the sum in excess of such court finding, if any, now paid to the City of Prince Albert under and by virtue of the terms of this release and subrogation agreement; and further Western Surety Company agrees to clear the title of the works of claims for lien arising prior to the 29th day of November, A.D. 1962.\n3. The City of Prince Albert agrees that it will not rescind or revoke this agreement to the prejudice of the Western Surety Company at any time hereafter.\nOn the same day the contractors and the surety company entered into the following agreement:\nWHEREAS Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited are indemnitors to the bond of Western Surety Company numbered 01-1-4461 for the due performance by Smith Bros & Wilson Limited of a certain contract for the construction of a reservoir for the City of Prince Albert by the said Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited dated the 25th day of April, A.D. 1962, and have requested Western Surety Company to secure the rights in subrogation of the City of Prince Albert as indicated in a certain release and subrogation agreement hereunto annexed and marked as Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto.\nAND WHEREAS Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited have paid unto Western Surety Company the sum of $101,039.28, who in turn are paying the same to the City of Prince Albert for the acquisition of the said rights in subrogation pursuant to the said release and subrogation agreement.\nAND WHEREAS Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited desires that the said rights in subrogation of the City of Prince Albert be exercised under its control in the name of the City of Prince Albert and at its expense by the issue of a writ against the engineers referred to, namely, Underwood McLellan and Associates Limited, a body corporate carrying on business in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nNOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH:\n(1) Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited hereby agrees to save Western Surety Company harmless and fully indemnifies it from all claims, counterclaims, demands, costs or expenses whatsoever which may be incurred and arising out of the prosecution of the said action in the name of the City of Prince Albert under and by virtue of the said release and subrogation agreement hereunto annexed and marked as Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto.\n(2) Western Surety Company hereby agrees that Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited shall have control of the said action in subrogation to prosecute the same against the said Underwood McLellan and Associates Limited as it may be advised.\n(3) Nothing in this agreement contained nor anything done in pursuance thereof shall, in any way, prejudice the rights of Western Surety Company under the agreement of indemnity given by Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited in respect to the bond given by Western Surety Company in this connection, or in any way operate as a waiver, release or postponement of the rights of Western Surety Company under the said agreement of indemnity by Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited and the said agreement of indemnity is hereby ratified and confirmed and Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited hereby authorizes and confirms the entering into of the agreement marked as Schedule hereto.\nIn the statement of defence as originally delivered the respondent\u2019s main defence was that the collapse of the structure had been caused by the default and negligence of the contractors and it specifically denied any negligence on its part or on the part of its employee, Palichuk. However, at the trial of the action the statement of defence was amended by order of the learned trial judge permitting the respondent to plead in the alternative that all damage alleged to have been suffered by the appellant had been paid to it in the following manner:\n(a) By Western Surety Company, for and on behalf of Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited, paying the sum of $101,039.28 to the Plaintiff, the said Western Surety Company being the Surety named in a certain bond (numbered 01-1-4461 by Western Surety Company for the purposes of its own records) dated June 15, 1962, wherein the Plaintiff was named as Obligee and Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited as Principal, the condition of which was that if the said Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited should well and truly indemnify and save harmless the City of Prince Albert from any pecuniary loss resulting from the breach by it (that is by Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited) of any of the terms, covenants, and conditions of the said contract the obligation under the said Bond should be void otherwise to remain in full force and effect; and\n(b) By holding back from payment to Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited under the provisions of said contract dated the 25th day of April, 1962, the sum of $48,152.60 or thereabouts and applying said sum plus said sum of $101,039.28 to the cost of completing the construction work required to be done by Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited under its said contract with the Plaintiff.\nand there was filed in evidence an admission of facts by the appellant as follows:\n1. That Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited, on or shortly before June 2nd, 1964, paid the sum of $101,039.28 to Western Surety Company.\n2. That Western Surety Company paid said sum of $101,039.28 to the Plaintiff on June 2nd, 1964.\n3. That on June 2nd, 1964 Western Surety Company entered into an Agreement with the Plaintiff, a true copy whereof is hereunto annexed and marked \u201cA\u201d.\n4. That on June 2nd, 1964 Western Surety Company entered into an Agreement with Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited a true copy whereof is hereunto annexed and marked \u201cB\u201d.\n5. That Western Surety Company has no interest in this action excepting only as may be evidenced by said Agreements marked \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d.\n6. That Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited procured and paid for the bond described in the Statement of Defence wherein the Plaintiff is named as \u201cObligee\u201d, Western Surety Company as \u201cSurety\u201d and Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited as \u201cPrincipal\u201d.\nThe agreements referred to as \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d in the foregoing admission of facts are the agreements of June 2, 1964, previously referred to. In substance the defence thus put forward by the respondent on this branch of the case is that the surety company did not become subrogated to the rights of the appellant and the appellant having received the reservoir it contracted for at no extra cost to it, had no right of action.\nThe respondent contended also that the action was a champertous one and that the agreement between the appellant and the surety company of June 2, 1964, was ultra vires the powers of the appellant and it also contended that the appellant was estopped from asserting a claim against the respondent because of having acted upon the respondent\u2019s certificate of February 25, 1963, previously referred to.\nThe contention based on the subrogation issue was fully gone into by the learned trial judge and I am in agreement with him that the surety company became an assignee by way of subrogation and by virtue of the agreement of June 2, 1964, to which the appellant had to give effect by allowing the action to be taken in its name. I agree with the learned trial judge and with Maguire J.A. that no element of champerty or maintenance arises here.\nIn any event it is significant to point out as was done by Woods J.A. in his dissenting judgment that the action is in the name of the appellant only; that neither the surety company nor the contractor claims any status in the action.\nThe contention that the action is champertous having failed, nothing stands in the way of the appellant being entitled to judgment against the respondent for the breach of their contract as found by the learned trial judge unless the payment made by the surety under the agreement of June 2, 1964, extinguished the appellant\u2019s right to recover from the respondent. The case of Campbell previously cited arose out of somewhat similar circumstances. The facts in Campbell\u2019s case were: the plaintiffs employed a firm of architects to draw plans and specifications for a building and to superintend the construction thereof; and entered into a contract with a firm of builders to erect the building. The plaintiffs brought an action against the builders for breach of the building contract by placing defective materials in the building, and another action against the architects for negligence in supervising the construction by reason of which the defective material was not condemned. The actions were begun on the same day. The trial judge, Latchford J., consolidated the two actions and found that both the architects and the builders were in breach of their separate and distinct contracts and gave judgment against both for the damages sustained by the owners. Both the architects and the builders appealed, the former as to liability and the latter on quantum only.\nThe architects argued that the owners were bound to elect which set of defendants they would sue and that the judgment against the builders was a bar against the owners being given judgment against the architects. The Court of Appeal held that as the Rules then read, the actions should not have been consolidated, but regardless of the error in procedure held that the judgment against the architects was proper. In the result the owners had judgment against both the architects and the builders.\nIt is in this context that Riddell J.A. said at p. 280:\nIt is true that, if the full amount of the damages were realised out of the contractors, no action (except perhaps for nominal damages) would lie against the architects, but that is on an entirely different principle, namely, that the plaintiffs have suffered no damage from the default of the architects.\nThat sentence came after he had said:\n\u201cWhere there are joint and several contracts, or joint and several debts, or where the several parties are independently and collaterally bound by the same obligation, the recovery of judgment against one of such separate contractors or separate debtors is no bar to an action against the others, until the judgment has been satisfied:\u201d Addison on Contracts, 11th ed., p. 193. This is as old as Queen Elizabeth\u2019s time (Blumfield\u2019s Case (38 & 39 Eliz.), 5 Co. R. 86 B), and cannot be doubted. See per Montague Smith J., giving the judgment of the Court in Vestry of Bermondsey v. Ramsey (1871), L.R. 6 C.P. 247, at p. 251; per Stirling J. in Blyth v. Fladgate, [1891] 1 Ch. 337, at p. 353. And it makes not the slightest difference that the amount secured by the independent contracts is the same and for the same debt.\n* * *\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs had two separate and distinct contracts, the one with the contractors, which was in writing, the other with the architects, which was, as in Jameson v. Simon, (not in writing but) implied from the employment. The contractors broke their contract when they put bad material into the building; at the same moment the architects broke theirs because they allowed this to be done. Under the circumstances, the damages are the same under either contract; but that is wholly immaterial. The contracts are not the same; and, if judgment were to be obtained in the action against the contractors, it would destroy their contract quoad hoc, but it could not affect the contract of the architects\u2014that non transit in rem judicatum, but remains a simple contract.\nand following the sentence above quoted, he continued:\nThe result is, that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against both the contractors and the architects, and that is what the judgment in appeal gives them.\n* * *\nThe plaintiffs might have insisted on a judgment in both cases with costs, either set of defendants to be at liberty to move, in the nature of an audita querela, to stay their action on payment of costs if and when the amount was made out of the other set, and either set of defendants to be at liberty to bring an action to recover from the other any sum paid by them, etc. (I do not suggest that any such action will lie on the facts, but the defendants should not be precluded from litigating the question if so advised.) The case of Imperial Bank of Canada v. Begley[9] is authority for the proposition that a person who has suffered a loss and who has separate causes of action against two or more persons to recover the amount of that loss, cannot recover more than the total amount of the loss. That situation does not arise here. The city will not recover more than its actual loss. Under the agreement of June 2, 1964, it must account to the surety for all moneys it may recover in this action.\nThe payment made by the surety to the appellant was not, in my opinion, a \u201crealization\u201d out of the contractors as stated by Riddell J.A., or a recovery within Imperial Bank of Canada v. Begley. Here the payment was conditional, the condition being as set out in para. 2 of the agreement of June 2, 1964, previously quoted. If the appellant had not permitted the action to be brought in its name it would have had to refund the money it got under that agreement. The surety was potentially liable to the appellant under the performance bond because, whatever the reason may have been, the reservoir was not constructed within the time provided, and if liable under the bond the surety had the right to be reimbursed by the contractors. The fact that it received reimbursement prior to or simultaneously with payment to the appellant is immaterial. That does not alter the conditional character of the payment, and it is important to note that in the agreement between the appellant and the surety the appellant did not purport to release the respondent nor the contractors, but specifically provided that the surety company should be subrogated to all the right and remedies of the appellant against the contractors as well as against the respondent or any other persons arising out of the failure of the reservoir structure. In this way litigation between the appellant and the surety was no doubt avoided and the rights of the surety preserved.\nUnder Saskatchewan Rule of Court 48, the contractors could have been brought into the action by the respondent as parties \u201c\u2026 whose presence before the Court may be necessary, in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate and settle all the questions involved in the cause or matter\u2026\u201d and the rights of these parties inter se dealt with, but for reasons best known to the respondent this was not done. The action, accordingly, falls to be disposed of in the form in which it was dealt with at the trial, in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nOn the record before this Court the appellant is entitled to succeed. There has been no judicial determination of negligence against the contractors. The respondent sought to overcome this fact by contending that the payment by the contractors through the surety to the appellant was the equivalent of such a determination, or, alternatively, was an admission of the contractors\u2019 liability. However, in view of the position taken by the contractors and by the surety in their respective letters of January 3, 1963, and March 14, 1963, and the findings of the learned trial judge previously quoted, that contention is not tenable. There has not been a \u201crealization\u201d of the appellant\u2019s damages from the contractors nor a payment of those damages by the contractors in the procedure which was adopted in this instance. The contractors were not relieved of their liability by the payment but that liability, if any, was specifically continued by the agreement of June 2, 1964.\nThere remain the defences of estoppel and ultra vires to deal with. First, as regards estoppel, this contention cannot succeed. There were no representations of fact made by the appellant to the respondent which the respondent acted upon to its prejudice nor was any prejudice alleged.\nAs to the defence that the agreement of June 2, 1964, between the appellant and the surety company was ultra vires the appellant, it should first be noted that this defence was not raised in the pleadings nor was it referred to in the judgments below. In any event it cannot be said that the appellant had not the power to stipulate for the indemnity bond from the contractors. Having received the indemnity bond, the appellant had the right to assert a claim under it and it must follow that it necessarily had the right to receive payment, and having received payment it became by the process of subrogation answerable to the surety for any damages it might recover. Nor can it be contended that the appellant had not the right to sue for a breach of the contract. The mere existence of the in- demnity bond could not extinguish the appellant\u2019s right to recover damages from the respondent if the contract with it was breached as found by the learned trial judge.\nThe learned trial judge allowed as part of the appellant\u2019s damages an item of $17,573.57 being the fee paid the respondent for services in respect of the construction in question including the plans and specifications used both before and after the collapse. Counsel for the appellant admitted here and in the Court of Appeal that not all such fees had been thrown away by reason of the collapse. This clearly follows from the dismissal of the claim for faulty design. The structure was actually completed according to the original plans and specifications. I am in agreement with Maguire J.A. that the onus was on the appellant to establish what portion, if any, of the $17,573.57 was so thrown away and in the absence of such evidence the Court cannot speculate on the amount. The award of this item cannot stand and the judgment should be varied accordingly.\nThe appeal will, therefore, be allowed subject to this variation with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored subject to a variation as to quantum, with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Embury, Molisky, Gritzfeld & Embury, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Schmitt, Robertson, Muzyka, Beaumont & Barton, Saskatoon.\n[1] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 577, 65 D.L.R.

Limitation of actions\u2014Motor of tank truck used to operate pump in delivery of fuel oil\u2014Damage not caused by use or operation of motor vehicle\u2014The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, s. 147(1).\nA fire which originated in the basement of a building owned by the respondent caused extensive damage to the said building and the property of the occupants as well as to an adjoining building and the property of the tenants therein. Ten different writs were issued by various plaintiffs against the defendants A Co. and H. A Co. was a fuel distributing firm and H was a fuel delivery man acting at all material times in the course of his employment with A Co. All of the actions were tried together and were dismissed by the trial judge. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held: (1) that the provisions of s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, did not apply to bar the action despite the fact that the writs were issued considerably longer than a year after the occurrence; (2) that the negligence of the plaintiff (the present respondent) contributed to the damage which had arisen from the negligence of H, therefore, the provisions of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 261, applied, and that the fault should be apportioned 40 per cent to the plaintiff and 60 per cent to the defendants. The defendants appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as that judgment held that the limitation provision of The Highway Traffic Act did not apply to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action. The plaintiff cross-appealed asking that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied to permit him to recover the full amount of his loss:\nOn the day of the fire H pumped 471 gallons of fuel oil into the respondent\u2019s premises, although the storage tank had a capacity of only 300 gallons. The excess oil escaped through a faulty connection of the overflow pipe, spread across the basement floor and shortly thereafter ignited. H made the delivery of oil from a tank truck by the operation of a pump which discharged oil from the tank of the truck into the fill pipe leading to the storage tank in the basement. The motor of the truck was used to operate the pump, being connected to the pump by a special transmission and lever which the. operator of the truck manipulated to put the pump in operation.\nThere was a vent alarm system to warn the delivery man when the tank was full. By standing near the outside end of the vent pipe the employee would hear a whistle which sounded as long as air was being expelled from the tank. Following a short interval after the sound of the whistle ceased, a sound of the gurgle of oil would be heard in the pipe and finally, if the pumping continued, the oil would be driven up the pipe to fall outside on the ground with a plop.\nThe end of this pipe which had been inserted into a rubber compression collar at the top of the respondent\u2019s storage tank had become disengaged from the collar. Although the respondent knew that his equipment was old and that there was some slack in the vent pipe connection with the storage tank, and that the smell of oil was found after the periodic deliveries, he, failed to make any repairs. H\u2019s evidence was that the whistle was faint and that at times he failed to hear it. He heard no gurgle or plop, nor did any oil escape outside. After the pump had been operating for some eleven minutes, H checked the number of gallons that had been pumped into the fill pipe and realizing that the amount was far in excess of the ordinary receipt at the respondent\u2019s premises, he shut off the pump and entered the building, where he found that the basement floor was completely covered with oil. He left the premises immediately to obtain assistance in the removal of the spilled oil without cutting off the emergency power switch or without warning anyone of the excessive danger of fire. A short time thereafter the fire commenced.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nThe provisions of s. 147(1) of the Highway Traffic Act did not apply to bar the action of the plaintiff. The damage was not caused by the use or operation of a motor vehicle but was caused by the use or operation of the pump mounted on the motor vehicle when the motor vehicle itself was stationary.\nThe sole negligence which caused or contributed to the damage was that of the defendant H, who failed to stop the pump on the tank truck as soon as the sound of the whistle ceased, and of the defendant A Co., for that defendant had notice of both the faintness of the whistle and of the smell of oil which had been present for the last fill of the tank. The negligence, if any, of the plaintiff, being not negligence which caused or contributed to the damage, the plaintiff was entitled to recover his damages in full.\nDufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v.

Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nRowell K. Laishley, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nAdrian T. Hewitt, Q.C., and John L. Nesbitt, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014In this matter, ten different writs were issued by various plaintiffs against the defendants F.W. Argue Limited and Clifford Hemphill. All of the actions were tried together and were dismissed by Landreville J. in his judgment of June 16, 1966.\nIn the Court of Appeal[2], the appeal of certain of the plaintiffs was allowed in full and it was adjudged that they should recover the full amount of their losses to be ascertained upon a reference to the Local Master. Three of the plaintiffs had abandoned their appeal from the judgment of Landreville J. It was further adjuged that Robert Bingham Howe recover from the defendants 60 per cent of his loss to be ascertained upon such reference. The defendants appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in so far as the said judgment held that the limitation provision of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, s. 147(1) did not apply to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action. The plaintiff Robert Bingham Howe cross-appealed asking that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied to permit him to recover the full amount of his loss as assessed upon the reference.\nRobert B. Howe was the owner of a building on the north-east corner of Bank Street and Second Avenue in the City of Ottawa, and had, for many years, operated therein a pharmacy business known as Howe\u2019s Drug Store. Later, Howe sold the drug store business to one Alan Francis Forhan, and leased to him the building in which the business was carried on. In the basement of this building there were two furnaces both of which had been converted to the use of fuel oil. To store the fuel oil, there was a 300\u2011gallon tank along the south wall of the basement. In the top of that tank, there were two openings, one of which was connected by a solid joint to a two-inch inlet pipe which led through the wall to the outside of the building and into which the oil was poured when the tank was filled. In the second opening, there was inserted by a threaded connection a device known as a vent alarm or whistle. This device consisted of a pipe running through the upper wall of the tank down some inches inside it. As the fuel oil flowed into the tank through the inlet pipe, it displaced the air which had occupied the empty portion of the tank, and that air rushing through this vent alarm caused a clearly audible whistle until the level of the oil in the tank reached the lower end of the vent alarm pipe when, of course, the whistle ceased. The sound of this whistle was transferred to the area of the outside from which the tank was being filled, by a three-quarter-inch pipe. That pipe had been connected to the vent alarm or whistle by a compression rubber collar and it ran from such collar through the outer wall and then perpendicularly up the wall for about seven feet, so that the operator supervising the pouring of the fuel oil into the outside end of the inlet pipe could hear this whistle sounding as the tank filled.\nThe defendant F.W. Argue Limited had, for some years, supplied the fuel oil to the plaintiff, here respondent, Robert B. Howe. Prior to the year 1959, the device on the outer end of the inlet pipe had been known as the \u201cfast fill system\u201d and that device seems to have consisted of a rubber diaphragm into which was inserted the nozzle of the hose from the tank truck. The purpose of the rubber diaphragm was simply to prevent splashing back of the oil. In the year 1959, the defendant F.W. Argue Limited installed in these and other premises to which they supplied oil in the City of Ottawa a different device known as the \u201cUnifil system\u201d. This system was said by the witness John Argue to have two advantages over its predecessor: firstly, it was more efficient, permitting the operator to make a more rapid connection between the hose from the tank truck and the inlet pipe, and, secondly, it permitted the oil to flow into the customer\u2019s tank at a more rapid rate. The previous rate of flow was 32 gallons per minute and the rate with Unifil was 40 gallons per minute. It would seem, on all of the evidence, that the Unifil system had another very distinguishing feature. It provided, if not a solid, at least a very tight connection between the hose from the tank truck and the inlet pipe, while its predecessor had provided a connection which was much less tight. The result was that the full pressure of the pump on the tank truck was transmitted through the hose and the nozzle at the end thereof into the inlet pipe and down into the tank. The previous system had permitted a break in that line of pressure. Although there has been no finding, it may be that the displacement of the end of the vent pipe which had been inserted in the rubber compression collar on the top of the plaintiff\u2019s storage tank could have been caused by this additional pressure in the fuel oil tank after the installation of the Unifil system. It should be noted that the plaintiff-respondent Howe was never informed of this alteration in the method of connecting the tank truck hose with the inlet pipe.\nThe witness Bullis, who was an inspector in the service of the Energy Board of the Province of Ontario, agreed with the learned trial judge that this rubber collar would be the weakest point and under pressure \u201cit would be the one that would go\u201d.\nIn mid-January 1961, the defendant Argue delivered fuel oil to the plaintiff Howe\u2019s premises from a tank truck. This outfit, I avoid the use of the word \u201cvehicle\u201d as that word is given a definition in the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, consisted of an ordinary truck driven, of course, by the usual gasoline motor and, mounted on that truck, a large tank for carrying fuel oil and also a pump with a long hose to connect the pump with the customer\u2019s inlet pipe. The motor of the truck was used to operate the pump, being connected to the pump by a special transmission and lever which the operator of the truck manipulated to put the pump in operation. The speed at which the pump was operated was controlled by the speed of the only motor on the outfit, that which propelled the truck when it was in motion. There was a nozzle at the end of the pipe which was connected to the Unifil device on the outer end of the inlet pipe in the fashion which I have described and which the operator could control by a hand valve. There was, in addition, a meter on the pump so that the operator could determine the exact gallonage which had been pumped from the truck into the consumer\u2019s tank. On the occasion of the filling of the tank in mid-January 1961, and on a considerable number of occasions before, the operator of the truck had noted that the sound of the whistle coming from the vent alarm system was faint and the operator Hemphill had reported this fact to his employer the defendant Argue. It was said that that circumstance did not cause any particular concern as some other vent alarm whistles were faint.\nOn January 28, 1961, the defendant Argue delivered another supply of oil to the plaintiff\u2019s (Howe\u2019s) premises. On that occasion, and on the two previous deliveries, the operator of the defendant Argue\u2019s tank truck was the defendant Hemphill. The trial judge found that the defendant Hemphill, although he had a certain degree of instruction in carrying out the operation, was comparatively untrained. He connected the hose from the tank truck to the inlet pipe and started the pump. Hemphill\u2019s evidence was that the whistle was faint and that at times he failed to hear it. He purported not to have been concerned at his failure to hear the whistle which, of course, ordinarily would have indicated that the oil in the plaintiff\u2019s tank had not reached the level of the lower end of the whistle pipe because he blamed it on traffic noise in the neighbourhood. The inlet was only some few feet away from Bank Street, a main business street. He gave as a further reason for his unconcern the fact that he heard no gurgle. Now if a vent alarm whistle and the sound-carrying pipe are connected in the fashion I have already described when the whistle stops because the level of the oil has reached the bottom of the whistle pipe after an interval the sound of the whistle is replaced by the sound of the gurgle of the oil in the whistle pipe and the connecting pipe to the outside, and finally if the pumping is continued the oil is driven up that connecting pipe and falls outside on the ground with a plop. The three forms of warning were referred to during the trial as \u201cwhistle, gurgle, and plop\u201d. Hemphill heard no gurgle or plop, nor did any oil escape outside. At long last he became somewhat concerned at the length of time that the oil had been pumped, checked his gauge and was astounded to find that he had pumped in 471 gallons. He realized immediately that the amount was far in excess of the ordinary receipt at the plaintiff\u2019s premises. He shut off the pump, entered the premises, spoke to Forhan, the tenant, and asked to see the storage tank in the basement. As Hemphill and Forhan descended the steps into the basement, they saw that the floor of the basement was completely covered with oil. The depth of that covering was not determined. Although there was an emergency switch which could have cut off the power to the oil burner, Hemphill left the premises immediately to obtain assistance in the removal of the spilled oil without cutting off that switch or without warning anyone of the excessive danger of fire. Some short time after he left\u2014no more than from fifteen minutes to half an hour\u2014a fire commenced. Forhan attempted to extinguish that fire but was unsuccessful. A very serious conflagration ensued damaging extensively not only the plaintiff\u2019s building and Forhan\u2019s drug stock and equipment but also the neighbouring premises.\nOther circumstances should be recounted. After the defendant Argue\u2019s employee Hemphill had filled the plaintiff\u2019s tank in mid-January of 1961, the plaintiff\u2019s tenant Forhan reported to the plaintiff that there was a smell of oil permeating the building. The plaintiff went to the premises, descended into the basement, opened a panel in the end of a plywood shell surrounding the storage tank, and aided by a flashlight sought evidence of oil spillage. He found no oil on or under the tank and it seemed to him that the vent alarm pipe was sitting in its rubber compression collar. The learned trial judge pointed out that that observation could not have been dependable when made under the circumstances I have outlined, and in fact found that:\nFurthermore, in light of all the evidence, I have arrived at the conclusion that the vent pipe had worked its way out of its proper connection for many months past. How it came into that position is problematic. The defence wishes me to assume that the cause is the pressure exercised by the cement step on the horizontal portion of the pipe outside the wall. Alternatively the moving by hand of the outside upright piece of pipe which was not bracketed to the wall by some unknown person may have given the torque necessary to unseat it at the tank connection. In my opinion, it is pointless to make such a finding. At any rate, the fact that the plaintiff found no evidence of oil about the outside of the tank or underneath it in mid-January, in my view, shows that the delivery which had been made at that time had not resulted in any overflow and that therefore the faint whistle carried to the outside by the vent pipe despite the fact that its end was displaced from the collar was sufficient to warn the driver on that occasion when he had filled the tank up to the bottom of the whistle pipe. So, on that occasion, immediately previous to the one when the damage occurred, the operator Hemphill acting on the cessation of the vent alarm whistle did not need either the gurgle or the plop warnings.\nThe plaintiff testified that immediately after this inspection, he attended the office of the defendant Argue and there spoke to Mr. Murphy, whom he knew, and who was then the sales manager of the defendant Argue, paid the oil account to that date, and informed Mr. Murphy of this smell of oil. Mr. Murphy, in examination for discovery, testified that no such attendance had been made by the plaintiff. At trial, in examination-in-chief, he indicated that he had searched the corporate records and found a receipt had been issued which convinced him that the plaintiff had attended the premises about January 18, 1961, but stated flatly that the plaintiff had not then complained about any smell of oil. However, this statement, although repeated during the cross-examination with much less force, was really a conclusion based on the fact that he had not passed on such complaint to the mechanical side of the defendant Argue\u2019s business, as he said was his invariable practice on such occasions.\nThe trial judge found and I accepted his finding:\nThe faintness only begged greater attention and diligence by Hemphill. In my opinion, it does not excuse him. This condition of the whistle, as well as the smell of oil in the basement whenever the tank was being filled, had been reported to the office, not only on the one occasion by Cleary, but also by Howe in the other case. I find that the defendant company had notice and was negligent in not investigating these two abnormalities.\nThe delivery of the oil and the consequent fire occurred on January 28, 1961. The actions were instituted by the various writs of summons issued on June 5, 1962. On the basis of these facts, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held, firstly, the provisions of s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O; 1960, c. 172, did not apply to bar the action despite the fact that the writs were issued considerably longer than a year after the occurrence; secondly, that the respondent and cross-appellant Howe\u2019s negligence contributed to the damage which had arisen from the negligence of Hemphill, therefore, the provisions of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 261, applied, and that the fault should be apportioned 40 per cent to the plaintiff Howe and 60 per cent to the defendants.\nLittle need be said as to the negligence of the defendant Hemphill, for whose negligence, of course, the defendant Argue is responsible, as the negligent acts were committed during the course of his employment. The trial judge made specific findings as to such negligence as follows:\n1. that Hemphill, the delivery man, was negligent in the performance of his duty and that negligence was a direct cause of the spillage of oil of some two or three hundred gallons on the basement floor;\n2. the oil coming in contact and flowing into the firebox of the furnace was ignited later, when, by thermostat, the oil burner went on, spread and set fire to the building;\n3. that the negligence of Hemphill was a direct cause of the fire which consumed the building.\nLaskin J.A., in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, said:\nHemphill\u2019s negligence in this case consisted in his failure to shut off the flow of oil when he no longer heard the whistle, and particularly when he could hear no gurgle. He had made two previous deliveries of oil to the premises, on January 10 and January 19, discharging 241 and 151 gallons respectively on those occasions. Knowing the rate of flow, he should have realized, if he was at all alert to time, that he was overtaxing the capacity of the tank. Beyond this he showed poor judgment in leaving the premises, after seeing the basement flooded with oil, without turning off the oil furnace or ensuring that this would be done.\nThere are, therefore, concurrent findings as to Hemphill\u2019s negligence and such findings are amply supported by the evidence. Counsel for the appellant in this Court made no attempt to contest such findings.\nThe first important question to be decided must be whether the Court of Appeal for Ontario was correct in holding that s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic, Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, did not apply under the circumstances which occurred to bar this action. The subsection provides:\n147. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) no action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained.\nSubsections (2) and (3) are irrelevant for the purposes of this consideration.\nMany cases were cited and analyzed in the careful argument of counsel, some of which, however, I do not deem to be relevant. Those are cases such as Stevenson v. Reliance Petroleum Limited; Reliance Petroleum Limited v. Canadian General Insurance Company[3]; Irving Oil Company Limited v. Canadian General Insurance Company[4], and Law, Union & Rock Insurance Company Limited v. Moore\u2019s Taxi Limited[5]. All of those cases dealt with the liability of an insurance company under a policy and depended for their decision upon the words of the policy. In my view, it mattered not that the words of the policy were also the words of the statute because if there was a statute involved that statute was not a limitation provision of the Highway Traffic Act but was a provision of the Insurance Act of Ontario. As an example, in the Stevenson and Reliance Petroleum cases, the clause in one policy covered claims \u201c\u2026 against the liability imposed by law upon the insured\u2026 for loss or damage arising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile\u201d. Those words form part of the standard owner\u2019s form of automobile insurance approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of Ontario. The present statutory provisions as to the contents of a standard owner\u2019s policy appears in The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, as s. 213, and the coverage as outlined in subs. (1)(a) thereof is \u201carising from the ownership, use or operation of any such automobile in Canada \u2026\u201d. In so far as the cases may be considered cases dealing with the interpretation of the statute as well as the actual words of insurance contract, they are words which interpret the provision of the Insurance Act and not the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act.\nThe relevant section of the Highway Traffic Act, as Laskin J.A. pointed out in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, has appeared in the statute in substantially the same words since it was first enacted in 1923. The important words of the section are, of course, \u201coccasioned by a motor vehicle\u201d, and, as Laskin J.A. notes, counsel for the plaintiff seeking to avoid a bar created by the section stresses the words \u201cby a motor vehicle\u201d and counsel for the defendant seeking to establish a bar to the action stresses the word \u201coccasioned\u201d. The section has been considered in at least two cases in this Court and like sections have been considered in several cases in other Courts throughout Canada. I think one may commence with Dufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger and Derbyshire[6]. There, the plaintiffs sued for damages which had been caused to their residence on Beech Avenue in the City of Toronto by heavy vibrations. The vibrations were caused by the passage along Beech Avenue of large cement ready-mix trucks. These trucks, although beyond the weight permitted by the Highway Traffic Act, had been permitted to use the street by a special authority granted by the City of Toronto, such special authority being permitted under the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act. The action was laid in \u201cnuisance\u201d and not \u201cnegligence\u201d and there was no evidence that the driving of the heavy trucks had been negligent or that they were driven in a manner contrary to the provisions of the said permission. The writ was issued more than a year after anything but a negligible portion of the damage had been caused. It was the unanimous judgment of this Court that the action was barred by the provisions of the said statute. All the members of the Court adopted the rule of construction that if the words were in themselves precise and unambiguous then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves in such case best declare the intention of the lawgiver. Crocket J., said at p.183:\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that the concrete mixing trucks were motor vehicles within the meaning of s. 1(h) of the Highway Traffic Act, nor that Beech Avenue was a highway within the terms of that statute. The learned trial judge having clearly found that the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, for which compensation was sought in this action, was caused by the operation of these cement mixing trucks upon the highway and that the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act and the municipal by-laws and regulations were lived up to in connection with their movement along that highway, I am at a loss to perceive how it can well be said that this action was not an action \u201cfor the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle,\u201d within the meaning of s. 53 of the Highway Traffic Act or that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover for such damages was a common law right entirely beyond the scope and purview of that statute.\nAnd at p. 184, he said:\nThe section itself says nothing about the damages sued for being occasioned by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle upon a highway. It is directed wholly to the bringing of actions \u201cfor the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle\u201d\u2014a motor vehicle, which can only be lawfully operated on a highway under a permit granted in accordance with the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act.\nAs to the contention of the appellants that the section was limited to bar negligent operation upon the highway, Crocket J. said at p. 185:\nIt seems to me, with the highest respect, that we could not give effect to the distinction now relied upon in support of the judgment a quo without reading into the language of a perfectly clear, precise and unambiguous enactment, words which it does not contain, and, moreover, without holding that the section was enacted as a protection only for those who violated the provisions of the statute, and not for those who observed them.\nKerwin J., as he then was, carefully considered the evidence to determine whether there was any evidence that the vibrations which caused the damage were the result of rotation of the cement mixer on the truck as distinguished from the vibration caused by the moving vehicle with its rotary mixer. It is of some significance that in this, the Dufferin Paving case, the mixer was rotated by a different motor than that which propelled the vehicle and that the mixer rotated whether it was filled or empty. Kerwin J. was unable to find that there was any evidence of damage which arose from vibrations caused by the rotation of the mixer as distinguished from the overall vibration occurring. At p. 188, he said:\nWhile, no doubt, throughout the trial emphasis was placed upon the fact that the cement mixers operated while trucks were in motion upon the highway both when carrying cement and when empty, and while it may be a fair inference that the mixers and auxiliary motors did set up vibrations, I am unable to find any evidence to warrant a finding that these vibrations caused damage to the respondents\u2019 house. I therefore conclude that in this case the damages were caused by motor vehicles.\nThe italicizing is my own.\nI am of the opinion that the Dufferin Paving case is an authority only for the proposition that when damage is occasioned by a motor vehicle used as such whether that damage sounds in negligence or in nuisance or in breach of statutory regulations, the section is a bar to actions instituted by the issuance of a writ more than twelve months after the damage occurred. I find a distinct inference in the words of Kerwin J. which I have quoted above that if the damage was occasioned by some operation of the apparatus other than its operation as a motor vehicle, the section would not apply to bar the action. With respect, I agree with the comment of Laskin J.A. in reference to this case, when he said:\nI find nothing in the Dufferin Paving case incompatible with the view I would take of section 147(1), namely, that it applies only where the damage is occasioned by a motor vehicle which is used in that character and not where it is used for another purpose to which it has been adapted, as, for example, a stationary pumping machine.\nIn Heppel v. Stewart and Domingos[7], this Court considered the following circumstances. On June 15, 1964, a motor vehicle owned by one defendant and operated by the defendant Domingos ran into the rear of a motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff Stewart when it was stopped, causing personal injuries and property damage. The writ of summons was issued on April 21, 1965, i.e., still within the twelve\u2011month period. The statement of defence was delivered on June 17, 1965, i.e., two days after the twelve- month period had expired. In the statement of defence, the defendants alleged that the brakes on the automobile had been repaired by one Heppel, a short time prior to the accident, and that the brakes had operated satisfactorily until the time of the accident. The plaintiff Stewart only then made application to add the appellant as a party defendant, and this application was resisted on the allegation that any action against Heppel was barred by the said section 147(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. This Court held, reversing the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the section was a bar. Martland J., giving the judgment for the Court, said:\nThe learned judge of first instance was of the opinion that the subsection applied if the damages claimed were physically caused by the motor vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that the provision applied only if the legal basis of the claim is the use or operation of the motor vehicle.\nWith respect, I do not agree with this interpretation of the subsection. It does not purport to apply only to causes of action of a particular nature. It does not refer to the use or operation of a motor vehicle. It states specifically that no action shall be brought to recover damages occasioned by a motor vehicle. If a motor vehicle is the occasion for the damage, i.e., if it is the vehicle which brings it about, then the limitation period applies.\nThe Dufferin Paving case was cited as the authority.\nAgain, I stress that in the Heppel case, the damage was occasioned by a motor vehicle acting as a motor vehicle and not when stationary acting as a fuel pumping device.\nMartland J. in Heppel v. Stewart cited and adopted Kerwin J., as he then was, in the Dufferin Paving case, at p. 189:\nTaken by themselves the words used in this subsection are clear and unambiguous. In terms they are not limited to circumstances where damages are occasioned by a motor vehicle on a highway; they are not restricted to cases where damages are caused by a motor vehicle coming in contact with a person or thing; they do not state that the damages must have been occasioned by negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle or by reason of the violation of any of the provisions of the Act. It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the subsection must be construed in a narrower sense and that such a claim as the present, based as it is on an alleged nuisance at common law, is not within its purview.\nand continued:\nI agree with this interpretation of the subsection and, in my opinion, in terms, it covers the circumstances in the present case. In fact, in the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the appellant clearly is founded upon the use and operation of a motor vehicle; i.e., one with defective brakes.\nI am of the opinion that the Heppel case should not be applied to find that the statutory bar applies in, the present case. In the present case, the damage was not caused by the use or operation of a motor vehicle but was caused by the use or operation of the pump mounted on the motor vehicle when the motor vehicle itself was stationary. I agree, with respect, with Laskin J.A., that the fact that the engine which propelled the tank truck along the highway was also the motor which drove the pump does not mean that the damage which ensued by such pumping when carried out negligently was \u201cdamage occasioned by a motor vehicle\u201d. I, further, with respect, agree with the learned justice in appeal when, citing the definitions appearing in s. 1(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, in para. 15 thereof \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d includes \u201can automobile, motorcycle, and other vehicle propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power\u2026\u201d, and in para. 29 thereof \u201cvehicle\u201d \u201cincludes a motor vehicle, trailer, traction engine, farm tractor, road\u2011building machine and any vehicle drawn, propelled, or driven by any kind of power, including muscular power\u2026\u201d, he concludes that the definitions convey a suggestion of something propelled or driven along a surface and not a stationary pump.\nDickson J. in Peters et al. v. North Star Oil Limited et al.; Derksen et al. v. North Star Oil Limited et al.[8] considered circumstances somewhat similar to those here. In that case, the fluid which was negligently allowed to overflow and caused a fire was gasoline being delivered to a service station. The action was commenced more than twelve months after the time when damages were sustained. Section 98(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, provided:\nNo action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle\n\u2026 At p. 334, Dickson J. said:\nIn my view, the words \u201cdamages occasioned by a motor vehicle or by the operator thereof\u201d do not embrace situations where damage is occasioned\u2014the vehicle being stationary\u2014by the use of auxiliary equipment attached to, but not forming an integral part of, a vehicle, and used for a purpose unrelated to the operation of the vehicle qua vehicle.\nDickson J., as I have, concluded that cases dealing with the provisions of insurance policies have no application to this issue.\nCounsel for the respondent in this Court also cited Harvey v. Shade Brothers Distributors Ltd.[9] That case may hardly be considered as a persuasive authority because Tyrwhitt-Drake, L.J.S.C., adopted as his authority the Court of Appeal decision in the case presently under appeal to this Court. I wish, however, to cite and, with respect, to adopt the words of Tyrwhitt\u2011Drake, L.J.S.C, at p. 189:\nShortly put, the test to be applied when considering the character of a multi-purpose article at any given time is the purpose for which, at that time, it was being used. To take an extreme example: to hold that in all circumstances a self-propelled gun is a vehicle, and never a piece of artillery, would be an obvious absurdity. Similarly, to say that a self\u2011propelled supply tank is invariably a vehicle and never a supply tank\u2014these uses being exclusive in essence\u2014does not make sense;\u2026\nFor these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the provisions of s. 147(1) of the Highway Traffic Act do not, in the circumstances of this case, apply to bar the action of the plaintiff despite the fact that the writ was issued more than twelve months after the damage occurred. I, therefore, would dismiss the appeal.\nI now turn to consider the respondent\u2019s cross-appeal. By that cross-appeal, the respondent asks that he be allowed to recover his damages against the defendants in full rather than merely the 60 per cent thereof allowed to him by the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. This reduction in the damages allowed to the plaintiff, here cross-appellant, is based upon the finding of negligence made in the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the words I have already quoted. By those words, Laskin J.A. outlined Howe\u2019s negligence as consisting of his failure to put and keep his heating equipment in repair when he knew that it was old and that there was some slack in the vent pipe connection with the storage tank, and that the smell of oil was found after a delivery, such deliveries having been made periodically. For the purpose of the disposition of this case, I am content to accept that finding of negligence as against the plaintiff Howe. I am, however, with respect, not in agreement with Laskin J.A.\u2019s sentence immediately following such finding, \u201cThis negligence contributed to the damage arising from the negligence of Hemphill.\u201d As I have already demonstrated, the negligence of Hemphill was his negligence in failing to stop the pump on the tank truck as soon as the sound of the whistle ceased. That sound of a whistle may have been faint. The evidence showed that other whistles on vent alarm systems were faint. The evidence showed that on previous occasions, despite the faintness of the whistle which had persisted for some considerable time over several deliveries, there had not been any overflow.\nIn my view, Hemphill, by failing to heed, if he had ever listened for the cessation of the sound of the whistle, and by relying on possible subsequent alarms such as a gurgle in the pipe or finally the plop of oil on the outside of the building, simply continued his negligence. This was not a case where a whistle had stopped and then some short time thereafter the oil gurgled up the vent pipe and plopped onto the ground causing some little damage by way of stain on ground or building. This was a case in which Hemphill poured 471 gallons of oil into the plaintiff\u2019s basement. Since the oil was pumped at the rate of 40 gallons a minute, pumping this amount took over eleven minutes. Although Hemphill was not under any duty to know the capacity of the plaintiff\u2019s storage tank, he had to realize, had he paid any attention whatsoever, that pumping for eleven minutes at the rate of 40 gallons a minute was delivering an amount of oil far in excess of that similarly delivered during similar climatic conditions.\nThe plaintiff and cross-appellant, by failure to have the looseness of the rubber compression collar\u2019s grip on the vent pipe repaired some time before might have resulted in his suffering a larger amount of damage than he would have had such repair been made; but on the other hand there has been no evidence to prove that the vent pipe became disengaged from the collar due to the looseness and not due to the pumping of the oil into the storage tank under the increased pressure which resulted from the Unifil system or perhaps even on the occasion of this very incident by the over-filling of the tank. Upon the whole of the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that the sole negligence which caused or contributed to the damage was that of the defendant Hemphill and of the defendant Argue, for that defendant company had notice of both the faintness of the whistle and of the smell of oil which had been present for the last fill of the tank.\nUnder these circumstances, the negligence, if any, of the plaintiff, cross-appellant, being not negligence which caused or contributed to the damage, the plaintiff should be entitled to recover his damages in full. I would, therefore, allow the cross-appeal and direct that the judgment at trial be varied to the effect that Robert Bingham Howe recover against the defendants the full amount of his loss, to be ascertained upon a reference to the Local Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Ottawa, together with his costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Hughes, Laishley, Mullen & Touhey, Ottawa,\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Hewitt, Hewitt and Nesbitt, Ottawa.\n[1] [1966] 2 O.R. 615, 57 D.L.R.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal dismissed.\nReginald Lake, in person.\nE.G. Achborn, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave of this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced November 23, 1967. By that judgment the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from the conviction registered by the Magistrate at Ottawa on October 14, 1966, upon the charge that:\nReginald Lake between the 6th day of June A.D. 1966 and the twenty-eighth day of July A.D. 1966, at the City of Ottawa, in said County of Carleton, did unlawfully obtain a sum of or about $285.00 from Wilfred Bauer, by false pretences and with intent to defraud, contrary to section 304(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe leave to appeal granted by this Court was upon the following questions of law:\n1. Was there any evidence on which it was open to the learned Magistrate to hold that there was a false pretence made by the appellant which induced Wilfred Bauer to pay money to him?\n2. Was there any evidence on which it was open to the learned Magistrate to hold that the appellant had the intent to defraud Wilfred Bauer?\n3. Was there any evidence on which it was open to the learned Magistrate to hold that Wilfred Bauer was defrauded of anything?\nIt is not necessary for these purposes to recite the evidence in any detail, and it is sufficient to say that there was evidence on which the Magistrate could find reasonably that the appellant did obtain from the said Wilfred Bauer by false pretences the sum of about $56, the said false pretences being that the appellant falsely represented himself to be a bailiff of the Division Court at Ottawa acting on a process of that Court and in particular that he falsely represented that he was empowered to and did take a bond from the said Wilfred Bauer and demanded and obtained certain amounts of money for the \u201cregistration\u201d of the said bond as fees therefor.\nIt is true that the Magistrate said in giving judgment after a recess:\nContinuing my remarks regarding judgment in this case, and considering the evidence I would have to find that the whole of the monies obtained by Mr. Lake in this case\u2014some $285.00\u2014that all of that money was obtained by false pretences, and I say this because of the use of the word \u201cbailiff\u201d by the accused when he wasn\u2019t a bailiff and knew it.\nAlthough this Court is not ready to affirm the conviction as to the obtaining by false pretences of the whole $285, it is apparent that the Magistrate had earlier in his reasons addressed his mind to the obtaining by false pretences of the smaller sum only when he said:\nI find him guilty of obtaining funds by false pretences, and in particular, monies pertaining to the bond, six dollars whatever it was on this occasion, and the monies listed on those receipts for costs.\nand that therefore the conviction for obtaining the smaller amount by false pretences should be confirmed. That such a course is a proper one is, I think, demonstrated by the judgments in R. v. Scott[1], Ontario Court of Appeal, as confirmed in this Court[2] in the same volume at p. 187, where at p. 186 Magee J. said:\nThe amount charged as being stolen $7,835, no doubt corresponds with the total of the three credits; but if, instead of five cheques amounting to $755, the accused had cashed one, two, or three cheques for $7,000 in all, three days after the fraudulent entries, could it be said that, although his act amounted to theft, proof could not be given of it? What the Crown set out to prove, as I venture to think, is that Scott\u2019s employers had been defrauded out of $7,835, or some greater or less sum, by some act which amounted to theft. The evidence might fail to shew theft at all. It would be sufficient if part were stolen. The Criminal Code, sec. 857, allows proof of three distinct charges of theft.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nand the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Castle[3], where at p. 80, Rowell C.J.O. said:\nIn reference to the first ground of appeal, it is quite clear that a person accused of theft can be convicted upon an indictment charging theft upon proof of theft of a smaller sum than that charged in the indictment: Rex v. Scott (1920), 57 D.L.R. 309, 34 Can. C.C. 180, 48 O.L.R. 452, affirmed in the Supreme Court, 58 D.L.R. 242, 34 Can. C.C. 187.\nThe question arises whether this Court in dismissing the appeal and confirming the conviction should amend the latter. I am of the opinion that it is proper to do so. It would appear that upon the evidence the appellant should only have been convicted of obtaining by false pretences the amount of $56. The charge as laid contained a reference to a figure of about $285. This Court has the jurisdiction to make the appropriate amendment by virtue of s. 600(1) of the Criminal Code which provides:\n600. (1) The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this part, make any order that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect to its judgment.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has power to amend the conviction to set out the smaller amount by virtue of s. 592(3) of the Criminal Code which provides:\n592. (3) Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal under subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subsection (1), it may substitute the verdict that in its opinion should have been found and affirm the sentence passed by the trial court or impose a sentence that is warranted by law.\nThe paragraph referred to therein, i.e., 592(1)(b)(i), provides:\n592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n...\n(b) may dismiss the appeal where\n(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment,\n(The underlining is my own.)\n1. In R. v. Norcross[4], (B.C.C.A.), the Court amended a conviction of theft by reducing the amount mentioned in the charge.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal. Acting under the provisions of the Criminal Code, I would substitute a conviction that the appellant between the 6th day of June 1966 and the 28th day of July 1966, at the City of Ottawa, in the County of Carleton, did unlawfully obtain the sum of $56 from Wilfred Bauer by false pretences and with intent to defraud, contrary to s. 304(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario.\n[1] (1920), 34 C.C.C. 180, 48 O.L.R. 452, 57 D.L.R. 309.\n[2] (1920), 34 C.C.C. 187, 58 D.L.R. 242.\n[3] (1937), 68 C.C.C. 78, [1937] O.W.N. 245.\n[4] (1957), 24 W.W.R. 160 at 165, 27 C.R. 220, 120 C.C.C. 108.\n"

The evidence disclosed that during the years in question, the taxpayer carried out exploration work on properties in which it held some kind of interest, but that its chief task was the development and management of properties owned by other companies. The Minister contended that the taxpayer\u2019s principal business was the management of its large investment portfolio and the providing of management, technical and financing services to other mining companies. The assessment was set aside by the Tax Appeal Board and by the Exchequer Court. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe principal business of the taxpayer company in the years in question was mining or exploring for minerals within the meaning of s. 83A(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act. The taxpayer could be engaged in the business of mining or exploring for minerals just as well as the owner if, under its contract with that owner, it did the mining or exploring for minerals. The respondent was in fact engaged in mining or exploring for minerals.\nAlthough the source of the income of a corporation is an important element to be considered in determining which is its principal business, it is not the only matter to be considered and not necessarily the determinant factor. As stated by the Tax Appeal Board, the financing function of a mining company is an integral part of its business.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014D\u00e9penses de prospection, d\u2019exploration et de mise en valeur\u2014Compagnie mini\u00e8re\u2014Son entre- prise principale est-elle \u00abl\u2019exploitation mini\u00e8re ou l\u2019exploration pour la d\u00e9couverte de min\u00e9raux\u00bb\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, ch. 148, art. 83A(3)(b).\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que son entreprise principale durant chacune des ann\u00e9es 1957 \u00e0 1960 \u00e9tait \u00abl\u2019exploitation mini\u00e8re ou l\u2019exploration pour la d\u00e9couverte de min\u00e9raux\u00bb et tente de d\u00e9duire, en vertu de l\u2019art. 83A(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, les \u00abd\u00e9penses de prospection, d\u2019exploration et de mise en valeur\u00bb faites par elle au Canada durant les ann\u00e9es en question.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nG.W. Ainslie and M.A. Mogan, for the appellant.\nR.E. Shibley, Q.C., and M. O\u2019Brien, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] pronounced on December 21, 1965, whereby that learned judge dismissed an appeal from the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board made on February 9, 1965. By the latter decision, the board had allowed an appeal by the taxpayer from the assessments made by the Minister as to the years 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960, and referred the said assessments back to the Minister for reassessment in accordance with the agreement of counsel.\nAs was said by Mr. Weldon, giving the reasons for judgment of the Tax Appeal Board, and repeated by Gibson J. in his reasons, there is only one issue to be decided in this appeal, namely, was the principal business of Mogul in the taxation years under appeal mining or exploring for minerals for the purposes of s, 83A(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148? That section reads, in part, as follows:\n83A (3) A corporation whose principal business is\n(a) production, refining or marketing of petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas, or exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas, or\n(b) mining or exploring for minerals,\nmay deduct, in computing its income under this Part for a taxation year, the lesser of\n(c) the aggregate of such of\n(i) the drilling and exploration expenses, including all general geological and geophysical expenses, incurred by it on or in respect of exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas in Canada, and\n(ii) the prospecting, exploration and development expenses incurred by it in searching for minerals in Canada,\nas were incurred after the calendar year 1952 and before April 11, 1962, to the extent that they were not deductible in computing income for a previous taxation year,\n\u2026\nThe respondent company was created by letters patent under the Companies Act of the Province of Ontario under date of May 29, 1945, with the name \u201cMogul Gold Mines Limited (No Personal Liability)\u201d. The name was subsequently changed to \u201cConsolidated Gold Mines Lim- ited\u201d and, since the appeal to this Court was launched, to the name \u201cMogul Mines Limited\u201d. It is significant that the name has always made reference to mining.\nThe purposes and objects as set out in the letters patent are as follows:\n(a) TO acquire, own, lease, prospect for, open, explore, develop, work, improve, maintain and manage mines and mineral lands and deposits, and to dig for, raise, crush, wash, smelt, assay, analyze, reduce, amalgamate, refine, pipe, convey and otherwise treat ores, metals and minerals, whether belonging to the Company or not, and to render the same merchantable and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same or any part thereof or interest therein; and\n(b) TO take, acquire and hold as consideration for ores, metals or minerals sold or otherwise disposed of or for goods supplied or for work done by contract or otherwise, shares, debentures or other securities of or in any other company having objects similar, in whole or in part, to those of the Company hereby incorporated and to sell and otherwise dispose of the same.\nCameron J. in American Metal Company of Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue2[3], in referring to the words of the Statutes of Canada, 1947, c. 63, s. 16(4) \u201ca corporation whose chief business is that of mining or exploring for minerals\u2026\u201d, said at p. 306:\n\u201cChief business\u201d is not defined in either of the Acts, and the phrase, so far as I am aware, has not been the subject of judicial interpretation. In my view, it is a question of fact to be determined by an examination and comparison of all the facts concerning each of the various types of business in which the company is engaged.\nIt is to be noted that the statute presently under consideration also contains no definition of \u201cprincipal business\u201d although \u201cbusiness\u201d is defined in s. 139(1) (e) in a manner not here relevant. I adopt Cameron J.\u2019s view and seek to apply the same tests.\nThe evidence of G.D. Pattison, the secretary-treasurer of the respondent company throughout, was that although the respondent had been inactive from the time of its incorporation until 1954, it had in that year entered actively into the business of mining generally and proceeded to develop one of its properties known as \u201cHarvey Hill Mine\u201d as well as to explore a great number of others. Harvey Hill Mine, in the District of Megantic, Quebec, was brought into operation but its operations were suspended at the end of January 1957 due to a world\u2011wide depression in the price of copper. The respondent\u2019s costs for exploration and development of the Harvey Hill Mine between the years 1955 and 1960 amounted to $588,469 and its general exploration expenses during the same years amounted to $430,892. Although it continued after the year 1957 to carry out considerable exploration work on properties in which it held some kind of interest, its chief task in the years which are now under appeal seems to have been the development and management of properties owned by other companies. In such companies the respondent had some share-interest usually acquired by the contract made between the respondent and such company. These contracts provided for the investment in the shares of the various companies and then the control of the expenditure of the proceeds of such sales of shares by the various companies in the exploration and development of the various mining prospects. The chief of those companies represented by such mining and management contracts were Consolidated Halliwell Limited with a mining property in Haiti, North Rankin Nickel Mines Limited at Rankin Inlet in the Canadian Northwest Territories, Coldstream Copper Mines Limited near Kashabowie, Ontario, St. Patrick\u2019s Copper Mines Limited in Ireland, and Silver Mines, Lead and Zinc Company Limited in County Tipperary in the Republic of Eire.\nIt should be noted that s. 83A(3) grants the right to make a deduction to a company whose \u201cprincipal business is mining or exploring for minerals\u201d without requiring that such mining or exploring for minerals should be done within Canada or should be done upon properties in which the taxpayer seeking the deduction has an interest in the property, although the deductions therefrom, if the tax payer comes within the definition of one having its principal business as mining or exploring for minerals, can only be for drilling and exploration expenses incurred by it in Canada and prospecting, exploration and development expenses incurred by it in searching for minerals in Canada. Therefore, it is not relevant in determining whether the respondent comes within the definition that much of its efforts were devoted to work in connection with properties outside of Canada and in connection with properties in which it had only a share-holding interest in the company owning such properties.\nCounsel for the Minister took the position strongly that the respondent under its management and development contracts with such companies as Halliwell and North Rankin, etc., was not engaged in mining or exploring but in management, and that the mining and exploring was carried on by the company which owned the property. I am not ready to accept that distinction. The respondent may be engaged in the business of mining or exploring for minerals just as well as the owner of the property if, under the contract with that company, it does the mining or exploring for minerals.\nI agree with the learned member of the Tax Appeal Board when he said:\nFrom the standpoint of: its corporate name; its purposes and objects as enumerated in said Letters Patent dated May 29, 1945; its Prospectus dated September 28, 1955; the development of its Harvey Hill Mine during the years 1955, 1956 and 1957 right to the point of production on a commercial basis at an expenditure of well over half a million dollars; its general and continuing mining, development and exploring activities during the relevant taxation years; its said management contracts under which it undertook very serious and extensive mining operations on behalf of several mining companies bringing them to a successful conclusion; the way so many mining companies seemed to turn to Mogul for scientific and technical services as well as for financing help, and its experienced and specialized officers and staff, to mention a few of the more obvious indications, Mogul unquestionably, gave every appearance of being, as was strongly argued by counsel for the appellant [here respondent], a company that was engaged in mining or exploring for minerals.\nI am further of the opinion that the respondent not only \u201cgave every appearance\u201d but was in fact engaged in mining or exploring for minerals and that was certainly a large part of its business. Was that business, however, its principal business? Again counsel for the Minister stressed the large investment portfolio held by the respondent and submits that its principal business was the management of that investment portfolio. It may be said generally that although the source of the income of a corporation is an important element to be considered in determining which is its principal business it is not the only matter to be considered and not necessarily the determinant factor. See Cameron J. in American Metal Company v. M.N.R., supra, at p. 307.\nAs the learned member of the Tax Appeal Board. remarked:\nSo, it would appear to be reasonable to assume that the multiplicity of arrangements which exist between mining companies and the constant juggling of shareholdings for various necessary purposes is just part and parcel of the mining business. In my view, it shows lack of understanding of the mining business to point to the financing arrangements of a mining company as a separate business activity to that of mining. Obviously, the financing function of a mining company is an integral part of its business.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.G. McDonald, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] Ex. C.R. 350, [1966] C.T.C. 16, 66 D.T.C. 5008.\n[2] [1966] Ex.

Respondents.\n1968: March 8, 11; 1968: October 1.\nPresent: Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nCrown\u2014Injunction\u2014Whether National Harbours Board subject to injunction\u2014National Harbours Board Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 187.\nBy a petition for interlocutory injunction, the respondents, owners of properties bordering on the St. Lawrence river, asked that the National Harbours Board be restrained from carrying out certain works on the river which, it was claimed, would injuriously affect their respective properties. The Board moved by way of declinatory exception to dismiss the petition on the ground that, being an agent of the Crown, it was not subject to injunction. The exception was dismissed at trial, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The Board was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The appellant corporation has the capacity to be sued and is, for the purposes of the Act which created it, a servant of the Crown. But it does not thereby enjoy an immunity from claims in tort, if it acts wrongfully. A personal liability will result when a person, whether individual or corporate, although a Crown agent and purporting to act as such, commits an unlawful act. The position of an agent of the Crown is not different because the agent is a corporation and not an individual. If a corporation commits a wrongful act, it is liable therefor and it cannot escape liability by alleging that it is not responsible for anything done outside its corporate powers. This is true whether it is purporting to act as a Crown agent or not. If a corporation can be held liable civilly in damages for wrongs which it has itself committed or ordered, it is obvious that a person threatened with the commission of an unlawful act by a corporate Crown agent can seek the assistance of the Court to prevent the corporation from doing that which it is not authorized to do as a Crown agent. The appellant cannot prevent the Court from inquiring into the legal justification for its conduct merely by saying that because it is an agent of the Crown it is immune from suit.\nCouronne\u2014Injonction\u2014Peut-on obtenir une injonction contre le Conseil des ports nationaux\u2014Loi sur le Conseil des ports nationaux, S.R.C. 1952, c. 187.\nLes intim\u00e9s, ayant des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s le long du fleuve St-Laurent, ont demand\u00e9 contre le Conseil des ports nationaux une injonction interlocutoire lui enjoignant de discontinuer certains travaux dans le fleuve qui, ils ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9, ruineront la valeur de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s respectives. Le Conseil des ports nationaux a oppos\u00e9 une exception d\u00e9clinatoire, demandant que la requ\u00eate d\u2019injonction soit rejet\u00e9e pour le motif que, \u00e9tant un mandataire de la Couronne, une injonction ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cern\u00e9e contre lui. L\u2019exception a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel. Le Conseil a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa corporation appelante est habile \u00e0 ester en justice et est, pour les fins de sa loi constitutive, un serviteur de la Couronne. Mais, elle ne jouit pas de ce fait d\u2019une immunit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des r\u00e9clamations bas\u00e9es sur la faute, lorsqu\u2019elle agit ill\u00e9galement. Lorsqu\u2019un individu ou une corporation, mandataire de la Couronne et agissant comme tel, commet un acte ill\u00e9gal, il en r\u00e9sulte une responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle. La condition de mandataire de la Couronne n\u2019est pas diff\u00e9rente lorsque ce mandataire est une corporation au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre un individu. Si une corporation commet un acte ill\u00e9gal, elle encourt une responsabilit\u00e9, et elle ne peut pas \u00e9chapper \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 en all\u00e9guant qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas responsable de ce qui est fait en dehors de ses capacit\u00e9s. Ceci est vrai, qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tende agir comme mandataire de la Couronne ou non. Si une corporation peut \u00eatre tenue civilement responsable en dommages pour la faute qu\u2019elle a elle-m\u00eame commise ou ordonn\u00e9e, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019une personne, menac\u00e9e de la commission d\u2019un acte ill\u00e9gal de la part d\u2019une corporation, mandataire de la Couronne, a droit d\u2019obtenir l\u2019aide des tribunaux pour emp\u00eacher la corporation de faire ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9e de faire comme mandataire de la Couronne. La corporation appelante ne peut pas emp\u00eacher les tribunaux d\u2019examiner la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de sa conduite pour le seul motif qu\u2019\u00e9tant un mandataire de la Couronne elle est \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute poursuite.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], confirmant un jugement du Juge Mitchell qui avait rejet\u00e9 une exception d\u00e9clinatoire. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Mitchell J. dismissing a declinatory exception. Appeal dismissed.\nLaurent E. B\u00e9langer, Q.C., and J.M. Jacques, for the appellant.\nPaul Trudeau, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec[2], dismissing an appeal by the appellant from a decision of the Superior Court which dismissed a declinatory exception made by the appellant against a petition by the respondents for an interlocutory injunction. The circumstances which gave rise to these proceedings are stated by the learned trial judge as follows:\nThe petition for interlocutory injunction alleges in substance that the Petitioners are proprietors of properties in Pointe-aux-Trembles bordering the St. Lawrence river; that for several days Respondents National Harbours Board and Shell Canada Ltd. had been carrying out or procuring the carrying out illegally of the filling in of the St. Lawrence river for the purpose of creating a new and extensive parcel of land of a width of 500 feet and installing thereon reservoirs, thereby illegally displacing the limits of the river which borders Petitioners\u2019 property; that the continuation and realization of this work will cause serious and irreparable harm to the Petitioners, ruining for ever their properties, as well from the residential as from the commercial point of view; that the Respondent City of Pointe-aux-Trembles has issued a permit to construct in the immediate vicinity of Petitioners\u2019 property huge reservoirs of 48 feet in height even before the site had been prepared; praying for the issue of an interlocutory injunction, enjoining Respondents, their employees and representatives to cease and cause to cease all works of construction or preparation of the ground now in process on the bed of the St. Lawrence adjacent to the Petitioners\u2019 property.\nPetitioners also requested the issue of an immediate interim injunction, and after hearing the parties, an interim injunction was issued as prayed for by Mr. Justice Caron on the 28th March 1966, to remain in force until the 14th April 1966, pending hearing and disposition of the prayer for the interlocutory injunction.\nAt the hearing for the interim injunction Respondent National Harbours Board appears to have orally objected to the jurisdiction of the Court as regards it, but no judgment having been rendered thereon, a formal motion by way of declinatory exception was duly filed and, after argument, was taken on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Pending judgment on the exception the interim injunction was continued in force until April 20th, 1966 and the petition for an interlocutory injunction continued to the same date.\nThe basis for the declinatory exception is that Respondent National Harbours Board is an emanation or instrumentality of the Crown, and is therefore exempt from any process, upon the principle that the King can do no wrong, the Court therefore being incompetent ratione materiae to adjudicate with respect to it.\nThe appellant is a body corporate created by the National Harbours Board Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 187. The sections of that Act, which are relevant to this appeal, are the following:\n3. (1) There shall be, under the direction of the Minister, a Board to be known as the \u201cNational Harbours Board\u201d consisting of four members, namely, a Chairman, a Vice\u2011Chairman and two other members, who shall be appointed by the Governor in Council to hold office during good behaviour for ten years.\n(2) The Board is a body corporate and politic and shall be and be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada.\n(3) The Board has the capacity to contract and to sue and be sued in the name of the Board.\n39. (1) Subject, as hereinafter provided any claim against the Board arising out of any contract entered into in respect of its undertaking or any claim arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Board while acting within the scope of his duties or employment may be sued for and prosecuted by action, suit or other proceeding in any court having jurisdiction for like claims between subjects.\n(2) Any such action, suit or other proceeding may be commenced and prosecuted to judgment in the same manner and subject to the same rules of practice and procedure and to the same right of appeal as nearly as may be as in cases between subjects.\n(3) The said court has the same jurisdiction to order or adjudge the payment of costs either by plaintiff or defendant as in like cases in the said court between subjects. The learned trial judge held that the claim in question here fell within s. 39(1), holding that the \u201cnegligence\u201d referred to in that subsection meant tortious liability as understood at common law, or for fault, as contemplated by articles 1053 et seq. of the Civil Code, and that \u201cinjury to property\u201d included injurious affection of property rights.\nThis decision was sustained on appeal, Pratte J. dissenting. Choquette J., with whom the other three members of the Court agree, said as follows:\nOutre l\u2019article 39 de la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, il y a Particle 3, dont les paragraphes 2 et 3 se lisent comme suit:\n3. (2) Le Conseil est un corps constitu\u00e9 et politique, et, pour toutes les fins de la pr\u00e9sente loi, il est et est cens\u00e9 \u00eatre le mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada.\n(3) Le Conseil est habile \u00e0 passer des contrats ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ester en justice en son propre nom.\nComme on le voit, ce n\u2019est que \u00abpour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente loi\u00bb que le Conseil \u00abest cens\u00e9 \u00eatre le mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9\u00bb. Si le Conseil exc\u00e8de les pouvoirs que la loi lui conf\u00e8re, si, par exemple, il s\u2019empare de \u00abterrains ou d\u2019un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9, ou d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat limit\u00e9 dans des terrains\u00bb sans l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du gouverneur en conseil et sans l\u2019expropriation ou le consentement pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 11, il ne peut \u00eatre dit que le Conseil agit comme mandataire de la Couronne. Dans ce cas, le Conseil est dans la position d\u2019un ministre qui outrepasserait ses attributions, engageant ainsi sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle.\nCe n\u2019est donc pas contre la Couronne que les intim\u00e9s demandent une injonction, mais contre le \u00abcorps constitu\u00e9 et politique\u00bb qui a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ses pouvoirs et qui est quand m\u00eame \u00abhabile \u00e0 ester en justice en son propre nom\u00bb pour se voir ramener dans les limites de son mandat. L\u2019injonction est aussi dirig\u00e9e contre les repr\u00e9sentants et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s du Conseil.\nThe appellant contends that s. 39 is not applicable, there being no claim for damages and no allegation of negligence as against any officer or servant of the appellant and there being no provision for remedy by way of injunction. It is also submitted that the appellant, being an agent of the Crown, enjoys all of the immunities of the Crown at law, and cannot be sued at all, save to the extent that such suit is specifically permitted by statute. It was also argued that the National Harbours Board, as such, was incapable of acting in any way, save as an agent of the Crown, and that if, in fact, its powers were exceeded, any such act could not be that of the Board, but would be only the act of the individuals involved. These latter propositions raise a question of considerable importance. If correct, they would involve the conclusion that no subject, threatened with an unlawful act by a corporate Crown agent, would have any recourse to the courts against such corporation in order to prevent it.\nThe appellant is a corporation created by a statute which defines its corporate powers. It has the capacity to be sued. It is, for the purposes of the Act which created it, a servant of the Crown. Does it thereby enjoy an immunity, in the same manner as the Crown itself, from claims in tort, if it, i.e., the corporation itself, acts wrongfully?\nA convenient starting point for the consideration of this matter is to be found in the well known statement by Dicey, \u201cThe Law of the Constitution\u201d, 10th ed., p. 193:\nIn England the idea of legal equality, or of the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary courts, has been pushed to its utmost limit. With us every official, from the Prime Minister down to a constable or a collector of taxes, is under the same responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any other citizen. The Reports abound with cases in which officials have been brought before the courts, and made, in their personal capacity, liable to punishment, or to the payment of damages, for acts done in their official character but in excess of their lawful authority. A colonial governor, Mostyn v. Fabrigas, (1774) 1 Cowp. 161; Musgrave v. Pulido, (1879) 5 App. Cas. 102; Governor Wall\u2019s Case, (1802) 28 St. Tr. 51, a secretary of state, Entick v. Carrington, (1765) 19 St. Tr. 1030; K. & L. 174, a military officer, Phillips v. Eyre, (1867) L.R. 4 Q.B. 225; K. & L. 492, and all subordinates, though carrying out the commands of their official superiors, are as responsible for any act which the law does not authorise as is any private and unofficial person.\nThis principle was applied in this Court in Roncarelli v. Duplessis[3]. The quotation was cited in his reasons by-Abbott J., at p. 184.\nThe proposition was clearly stated in Feather v. The Queen[4], by Chief Justice Cockburn, at p. 297:\nBut in our opinion no authority is needed to establish that a servant of the Crown is responsible in law for a tortious act done to a fellow subject, though done by the authority of the Crown\u2014a position which appears to us to rest on principles which are too well settled to admit of question, and which are alike essential to uphold the dignity of the Crown on the one hand, and the rights and liberties of the subject on the other. It was stated again by Viscount Finlay in Johnstone v. Pedlar[5]:\nIt is the settled law of this country, applicable as much to Ireland as to England, that, if a wrongful act has been committed against the person or the property of any person the wrongdoer cannot set up as a defence that the act was done by the command of the Crown. The Crown can do no wrong, and the Sovereign cannot be sued in tort, but the person who did the act is liable in damages, as any private person would be.\nIn Nireaha Tamaki v. Baker[6], the Privy Council considered a claim for an injunction by a person who claimed a native title of occupancy to certain lands in New Zealand. The respondent was the Commissioner of Crown Lands in the provincial district of Wellington. The Governor had advertised for sale lands, including those claimed by the appellant, and the appellant sued for a declaration that the land still remained land owned by natives, under their customs and usage, to which undisturbed possession had been guaranteed by treaty, and for an injunction against selling the same. The respondent objected that the interest of the Crown in the lands in question could not be attacked by this proceeding. At p. 575 Lord Davey says:\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal thought that the case was within the direct authority of Wi Parata v. Bishop of Wellington, 3 N.Z.J.R. (N.S.) S.C. 72, previously decided in that Court. They held that \u201cthe mere assertion of the claim of the Crown is in itself sufficient to oust the jurisdiction of this or any other Court in the Colony. There can be no known rule of law,\u201d they add, \u201cby which the validity of dealings in the name and under the authority of the Sovereign with the native tribes of this country for the extinction of their territorial rights can be tested\u201d. The argument on behalf of the respondent at their Lordships\u2019 bar proceeded on the same lines.\nTheir Lordships think that the learned judges have misapprehended the true object and scope of the action, and that the fallacy of their judgment is to treat the respondent as if he were the Crown, or acting under the authority of the Crown for the purpose of this action. The object of the action is to restrain the respondent from infringing the appellant\u2019s rights by selling property on which he alleges an interest in assumed pursuance of a statutory authority, the conditions of which, it is alleged, have not been complied with. The respondent\u2019s authority to sell on behalf of the Crown is derived solely from the statutes, and is confined within the four corners of the statutes. The Governor, in notifying that the lands were rural land open for sale, was acting, and stated himself to be acting, in pursuance of the 136th section of the Land Act, 1892, and the respondent in his notice of sale purports to sell in terms of s. 137 of the same Act. If the land were not within the powers of those sections, as is alleged by the appellant, the respondent had no power to sell the lands, and his threat to do so was an unauthorized invasion of the appellant\u2019s alleged rights.\nIn the case of Tobin v. Reg., 16 C.B. (N.S.) 310, a naval officer, purporting to act in pursuance of a statutory authority, wrongly seized a ship of the suppliant. It was held on demurrer to a petition of right that the statement of the suppliant shewed a wrong for which an action might lie against the officer, but did not shew a complaint in respect of which a petition of right could be maintained against the Queen, on the ground, amongst others, that the officer in seizing the vessel was not acting in obedience to a command of Her Majesty, but in the supposed performance of a duty imposed upon him by Act of Parliament, and in such a case the maxim \u201cRespondeat superior\u201d did not apply. On the same general principle it was held in Musgrave v. Pulido, (1879) 5 App. Cas. 102, that a Governor of a Colony cannot defend himself in an action of trespass for wrongly seizing the plaintiff\u2019s goods merely by averring that the acts complained of were done by him as \u201cGovernor\u201d or as \u201cacts of State\u201d. It is unnecessary to multiply authorities for so plain a proposition, and one so necessary to the protection of the subject. Their Lordships hold that an aggrieved person may sue an officer of the Crown to restrain a threatened act purporting to be done in supposed pursuance of an Act of Parliament, but really outside the statutory authority.\nPart of this passage is cited by Newcombe J., who delivered the reasons of the majority of this Court in Rattenbury v. Land Settlement Board[7]. In that case the appellant complained of the imposition of taxes against his land in British Columbia and against himself under the Land Settlement and Development Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 128, alleging that certain sections of that Act, relied upon by the respondent, were ultra vires of the provincial legislature. He claimed a declaration, damages and an injunction. The respondent pleaded, inter alia, that it was a branch of the provincial Department of Agriculture, a servant and agent of the Crown, that it possessed no other capacity, that its acts were done in that capacity and that it could not be sued.\nAt p. 62, Newcombe J. says:\nFor myself, I see no reason to doubt that the defendant Board is sued in its official capacity. It is described and identified in the action not otherwise than by its corporate name; it is thus the corporation, and not its individual members, which is the party defendant; and as a statutory body, it has no capacity other than that which it derives from its constituting Act. I do not question the general truth involved in the proposition expressed by Bankes L.J., in Mackenzie-Kennedy v. Air Council, (1927) 2 K.B. 517, at p. 523: In the absence of distinct statutory authority enabling an action for tort to be brought against the Air Council, I am of opinion, both on principle and upon authority, that no such action is maintainable. The Air Council are not a corporation, and even if it were to be treated as one the respondent\u2019s position would not be improved.\nThe learned Lord Justice mentions the case of Roper v. Public Works Commissioners, (1915) 1 K.B. 45; and he quotes from an Irish case, Wheeler v. Public Works Commissioners, (1903) 2 Ir. Rep. 202, a passage from the judgment of Palles C.B., as follows:\nNow, if a corporation be constituted for the sole purpose of doing acts for the Crown, it is prima facie outside its powers to do anything except for the Crown, and, as in law a wrongful act cannot be done for the Crown, such a corporation is not capable of doing such wrongful act in its corporate capacity. In such a case, therefore, the wrongful act cannot be deemed that of the corporation, but must be deemed the personal act of those who committed it.\nWith these observations, however, are to be contrasted what was said by Atkin L.J., at p. 533 of the Air Council case, (1927) 2 K.B. 517. But whatever may be said about the Air Council, and while it is certainly true that the revenues of the Crown cannot be reached by judicial process to satisfy a demand against an officer or servant of the Crown in any capacity, whether incorporated or not, it is common practice, founded upon general principle, that the court will interfere to restrain ultra vires or illegal acts by a statutory body, and, when it is charged, as in this case, that the proceedings in question, though authorized by the letter of the statute, are nevertheless incompetent, by reason of defect in the enacting authority of the legislature, the court must, I should think, have jurisdiction so to declare, and to restrain the ultra vires proceedings, although directed by the statute and in strict conformity with the legislative text. To this extent, in my view, the action is properly constituted; indeed, upon this point the authority is conclusive.\nAfter citing from the Tamaki case, he goes on to say:\nIt is not necessary for me. to consider the position of the individual members of the Board, because I hold that, as such, they are not before the Court; but, upon the authorities, it seems to be established that the doer of a wrongful act cannot escape liability by setting up the authority of the Crown, unless in proceedings by a foreigner against a British subject, in which case an exception is introduced, as appears by Feather v. The Queen, (1865) 6 B. & S. 257, at pp. 279, 295, 296, in which Baron Parke\u2019s charge in Buron v. Denman, (1848) 2 Exch. 167, was explained. It seems to be only in such a case that it is of any use to justify upon the authority of an act of State. Walker v. Baird. (1892) A.C. 491.\nIn the Mackenzie-Kennedy case[8], to which he refers, it was held that the appellant\u2019s action in tort did not lie against the Air Council. The Air Council was not an incorporated body. Bankes L.J. said that it was a Department of State. It was held that an action for tort would not lie against the statutory body set up under that name. Bankes L.J. cited with approval what was said by Romer J. in Raleigh v. Goschen[9]:\nI will state some general principles of law which I conceive govern this class of cases; and if you challenge any portion of what I am about to say, then I will hear you in reply. It appears to me that if any person commits a trespass (I use that word advisedly as meaning a wrongful act or one not justifiable) he cannot escape liability for the offence, he cannot prevent himself being sued merely because he acted in obedience to the order of the executive Government, or of any officer of State; and it further appears to me, as at present advised, that if the trespass had been committed by some subordinate officer of a Government Department or of the Crown, by the order of a superior official, that superior official\u2014even if he were the head of the Government Department in which the subordinate official was employed, or whatever his official position\u2014could be sued; but in such a case the superior official could be sued, not because of, but despite of, the fact that he was an officer of State. I think it is clear that the head of a Government Departmen is not liable for the neglect or torts of officials in the Department, unless it can be shown that the act complained of was substantially the act of the head himself; in which case he would be liable as an individual, just as a stranger committing the same act would be.\nAtkin L.J., at p. 532, has this to say, as to what might have been the position had the Council been incorporated:\nApplying these considerations to this action it appears clear that unless the Air Council is incorporated the name is but a name for the individuals that compose it. I do not think that it can be used at all as the equivalent of the names of its members in a suit which is directed against the members in their private capacity. In any event in this case I think it is plain, plainer even than in the case of Raleigh v. Goschen, (1898) 1 Ch. 73, where at least the Lords Commissioners were individually named, that this present action is directed against the members of the Air Council in their official or, as I prefer to say, representative capacity as servants of the Crown, and therefore will not lie. If, however, the Air Council were incorporated different considerations might apply. The Crown may and does employ as its servant or servants, an individual, a joint committee or board of individuals, or a corporation. None can be made liable in a representative capacity for tort; the individuals may be made liable in their private capacity, and I see no reason why this liability should not extend to the juristic person, the corporation, as well as to the individual. It may be true that the corporation in such a case will have no private assets available to meet execution, but that may also be true of the individual. One must also face the difficulty that such a corporation will have no servants, for as in the case of individual officials, those who serve under it are not its servants, but servants of the Crown. It is, therefore, only for torts actually committed by it, or to which it is directly privy, as by giving orders for their performance, that it can be made liable. But for such a tort proved, for example, by a minute of an incorporated board expressly commanding the commission of a tort, in principle, as it appears to me, an action would lie, however unprofitable such an action would be. The case chiefly relied upon by the appellant was City of Halifax v. Halifax Harbour Commissioners[10]. That case, however, only held that the Commissioners, who occupied Crown property in Halifax for the exercise of their powers, were not assessable for business tax as an \u201coccupier\u201d because their occupation of the property was for the Crown.\nThis case was followed in Cour de Recorder et Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada[11] in respect of the respondent\u2019s liability for municipal sales tax.\nThese cases are not of assistance in respect of the issue which is before us. They illustrate that, where a Crown agent is properly exercising its function as such, its acts, being those of its principal, the Crown, are to be dealt with on that basis.\nWhat is in issue here is the responsibility of a person, whether individual or corporate, who, though a Crown agent, and purporting to act as such, commits an act which is unlawful. My understanding of the law is that a personal liability will result. The liability arises, not because he is an agent of the Crown, but because, though he is an agent of the Crown, the plea of Crown authority will not avail in such event.\nThere are some authorities which have stated, in terms which I consider to be too broad, the proposition that an instrumentality of the Crown enjoys the same immunity, from an action in tort, as does the Crown itself. Thus, as an example, in Peccin v. Lonegan and T. & N.O. Railway Commission[12], Davis J.A. says this:\nThe principle is that the privileges enjoyed by departments of State and by the officials thereof are so enjoyed by virtue of the Crown\u2019s prerogative, such departments and their officers being, as it were, representatives of the Crown and deriving their powers therefrom. As it was put in Gilbert v. Corporation of Trinity House (1886), 17 Q.B.D. 795, at p. 801: \u201cAll the great officers of state are\u2026 emanations from the Crown. They are delegations by the Crown of its own authority to particular individuals.\u201d\nOn the facts of that case, however, the decision went no further than to say that the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission, a body appointed by the Crown to administer a public undertaking of the Crown, enjoyed the Crown immunity from suits in tort for the tortious acts of its servants or agents.\nAs to the phrase \u201cemanation from the Crown\u201d, I would refer to what is said by Luxmoore L.J., in the Privy Council, in International Railway Co. v. Niagara Parks Commission[13]:\nKelly J. in his judgment referred to the Commission not only as being the agent or servant of the Crown but also as \u201can emanation of the Crown\u201d. The latter phrase is also used by McTague J.A. Their Lordships are unable to appreciate the precise meaning intended to be attributed to this phrase by the Courts below. If it is intended to refer to the Commission in some capacity other than that of agent or servant it is impossible to ascertain from the judgments delivered what the legal significance of that capacity may be. The word \u201cemanation\u201d is hardly applicable to a person or a body having a corporate capacity. Its primary meaning is \u201cthat which issues or proceeds from some source\u201d and it is commonly used to describe the physical properties of substances (e.g. radium) which give out emanations of recognizable character. The words seem first to have been used by Day J. in Gilbert v. Trinity House (1886), 17 Q.B.D. 795.\nAfter referring to the judgment of Day J., in which the phrase is used, he goes on to say:\nThe learned Judge in the passage quoted seems to use the word as synonymous with servant or agent and in no other sense. Their Lordships are of opinion that it would avoid obscurity in the future if the words agent or servant were used in preference to the inappropriate and undefined word \u201cemanation\u201d.\nAfter reviewing the authorities cited by counsel, and a number of other cases, which I do not think it is necessary to list, my understanding of the position of servants or agents of the Crown, at common law, in respect of a claim in tort, is this:\nFirst is the proposition that the Crown itself could not be sued in tort.\nSecond is the proposition that Crown assets could not be reached, indirectly, by suing in tort, a department of government, or an official of the Crown. As to a government department, there was the added barrier that, not being a legal entity, it could not be sued. Third is the proposition that a servant of the Crown cannot be made liable vicariously for a tort committed by a subordinate. The subordinate is not his servant but is, like himself, a servant of the Crown which, itself, cannot be made liable.\nFourth is the proposition that a servant of the Crown, who commits a wrong, is personally liable to the person injured. Furthermore, if the wrongful act is committed by a subordinate, at his behest, he is equally liable, not because the subordinate is his servant, but because the subordinate\u2019s act, in such a case, is his own act. This is what is said in the passage from Raleigh v. Goschen, previously cited.\nIs the position any different because the agent in this case is not an individual, but a corporation? I think not, and I agree with the reasoning of Atkin L.J. in the Mackenzie\u2011Kennedy case.\nAs Choquette J. has pointed out, in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, s. 3(2) of the National Harbours Board Act declares that the Board \u201cshall be and be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada\u201d. (The italicizing is my own.) It is only when the Board is lawfully executing the powers entrusted to it by the Act that it is deemed to be a Crown agent.\nI am not prepared to accept the proposition enunciated in Wheeler v. Public Works Commissioners[14], supra, that a corporation constituted for the sole purpose of doing acts for the Crown is not capable of doing a wrongful act in its corporate capacity, unless that statement is to be limited in its meaning to say that such a wrongful act is not authorized by its corporate powers. Otherwise the statement subscribes to the theory that a corporation cannot be made liable in tort because its corporate powers do not authorize it to commit a wrong. In my opinion, if a corporation, in the purported carrying out of its corporate purposes, commits a wrongful act, it is liable therefor and it cannot escape liability by alleging that it is not responsible for anything done outside its corporate powers. This is true whether it is purporting to act as a Crown agent, or not. This view appears to be implicit in the statement of Duff J., as he then was, in The Quebec Liquor Commission v. Moore[15]:\nThe broad principle, of course, is that the liability of a body created by statute must be determined by the true interpretation of the statute. It is desirable, perhaps, to advert first of all to a discussion of the subject in The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v. Gibbs (1864) L.R. 1 H.L. 93. Mr. Justice Blackburn, delivering the opinion of the judges in that case, proceeded upon the principle stated by him in these words (p. 107):\nIt is well observed by Mr. Justice Mellor in Coe v. Wise, (1864) 5 B. & S. 440; 4 New Rep. 352, of corporations like the present, formed for trading and other profitable purposes, that though such corporations may act without reward to themselves, yet in their very nature they are substitutions on a large scale for individual enterprise. And we think that in the absence of anything in the statutes (which create such corporations) showing a contrary intention in the legislature, the true rule of construction is, that the legislature intended that the liability of corporations thus substituted for individuals should, to the extent of their corporate funds, be co-extensive with that imposed by the general law on the owners of similar works.\nAn exception is recognized, however, in the judgment of Mr. Justice Blackburn, as well as in the speeches of the Lords in the case of public officers who are servants of the Government; that is to say, officers fulfilling a public duty, appointed directly by the Crown and acting as officers of the Crown. Such a public officer is not responsible for the acts of inferior servants or officials merely because the superior officer has the right of the selection and appointment, as well as the right of removal at pleasure. Canterbury v. The Attorney-General, (1842) 1 Ph. 306 at p. 324. It is now recognized also that there is nothing to prevent the Crown being served by a corporation, and nothing to prevent such a corporation claiming the same immunity as an individual. Bainbridge v. The Postmaster General, (1906) 1 K.B. 178 at pp. 191-192, and Roper v. The Commissioners of His Majesty\u2019s Works and Public Buildings, (1915) 1 K.B. 45.\nWhat he is saying here is that a corporation which is a servant of the Crown enjoys the same immunity as an individual servant of the Crown, and is not vicariously liable for torts committed by its servants. It follows that, its immunity being no greater, its liability is also the same as that of an individual servant of the Crown.\nIn the matter of liability for the acts of its servants, the matter has now been dealt with, so far as the appellant is concerned, by s. 39 of the Act.\nIf it can be held liable civilly in damages for wrongs which it has itself committed or ordered, it is obvious that a person threatened with the commission of an unlawful act by a corporate Crown agent can seek the assistance of the Court to prevent the corporation from doing that which it is not authorized to do as a Crown agent. This is clearly the principle laid down in the Tamaki and the Rattenbury cases.\nIn the present case the respondents allege that the appellant commenced to engage in and intended to continue the commission of an unlawful act which injuriously affected them. They seek an injunction to prevent it. If that which the appellant seeks to do is lawfully justified that is the end of the matter. But in my opinion the appellant cannot prevent the Court from inquiring into the legal justification for its conduct merely by saying that because it is an agent of the Crown it is immune from suit.\nI have reached my conclusions without reference to s. 39 of the National Harbours Board Act. The purpose of that section was, I think, to make it clear that actions of the kind described in it were not to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court. That Court, when the National Harbours Board Act was passed, had exclusive jurisdiction in respect of claims arising out of contracts entered into by or on behalf of the Crown and claims against the Crown arising out of death or injury to person or property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe Board was given capacity to contract, but, as it was an agent of the Crown, it might have been considered, therefore, as contracting on behalf of the Crown. At common law, an agent of the Crown was not vicariously liable for the acts of his subordinates, who were not his servants, but were servants of the Crown.\nSection 39 made it clear that the Board itself could be sued on its contracts and, also, as vicariously liable for the negligence of its officers and servants, and the recourse in such event was not limited to proceedings in the Exchequer Court against the Crown.\nBut, as already stated, there was always recourse in the common law courts in respect of acts done, without legal justification, by an agent of the Crown, and the Board, on that principle, is liable if it commits itself, or orders or authorizes its servants to commit, an act done without legal justification. Equally, if it threatens to commit an act, without legal justification, a subject, whose legal rights are thereby threatened, has recourse to the Courts to restrain the commission of such act.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the appellant: J.M.

Freud Respondent.\n1968: March 15, 18; 1968: October 1.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Deductions\u2014Capital outlay or deductible expense\u2014Expenses incurred by individual in trying to develop and sell prototype of sports car\u2014Adventure in the nature of trade or investment\u2014Corporation formed to promote venture\u2014Whether existence of corporation affects deductibility of loss from other income\u2014Business losses to be deducted from other income in year in which they were incurred\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 12(1)(a), (b), 27(1)(e), 139(1)(e), (x).\nIn 1958 the taxpayer, practising law in Detroit and residing in Windsor, conceived, with an associate, the idea of designing and developing a prototype of a sports car with the intention of selling their concept, embodied in the prototype, to a manufacturer of cars who could be interested in putting it into production. A corporation was formed to carry out the project and shares were issued to the two associates and others who put money in the undertaking. In 1960, the taxpayer advanced to the corporation a sum of $13,840.47 in a final attempt to sell the idea to a manufacturer. Part of this money was paid to the corporation and part consisted of direct payments for labour, materials and expenses. When the venture became a total loss in 1960, the taxpayer sought to deduct the $13,840.47 from his other income for that year. The Tax Appeal Board upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment and ruled that the money was not deductible as it was to be regarded as a capital outlay. This judgment was reversed by the Exchequer Court which held that the moneys were spent by the taxpayer for the purpose of obtaining an income. The Minister appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe amount in question must be considered as an outlay for gaining income from an adventure in the nature of trade and not as an outlay or loss on account of capital. It could not be considered as an investment. From its inception, the venture was not for the purpose of deriving income from an investment but for the purpose of making a profit on the sale of the prototype. The payments made by the taxpayer were purely speculative. If a profit had been obtained it would have been taxable irrespective of the method adopted for realizing it. The fact that a corporation was formed to carry out the venture did not affect the matter. If the taxpayer and his friends had been successful in selling the prototype, they might well have done it by selling their shares in the company instead of having the corporation sell the prototype. There can be no doubt that if they had thus made a profit it would have been taxable. The same rule must be followed when a loss is suffered. The payments made by the taxpayer could not be considered as a separate operation isolated from the initial venture and had none of the characteristics of a regular loan. In the circumstances, the loss should be deducted from the other income of the taxpayer in the year in which it was sustained, namely 1960.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014D\u00e9bours\u00e9 de capital ou d\u00e9pense d\u00e9ductible\u2014Sommes d\u00e9pens\u00e9es par un individu dans le but de construire et de vendre un prototype d\u2019une automobile de sport\u2014Affaire d\u2019un caract\u00e8re commercial ou placement\u2014Compagnie constitu\u00e9e pour l\u2019affaire\u2014L\u2019existence de la corporation n\u2019emp\u00eache pas de d\u00e9duire la perte des autres revenus du contribuable\u2014Perte commerciale d\u00e9ductible des autres revenus dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e dans laquelle elle est subie\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 12(1)(a), (b), 27(1)(e), 139(1)(e), (x).\nEn 1958 le contribuable, un avocat de D\u00e9troit r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Windsor, et une autre personne ont con\u00e7u l\u2019id\u00e9e de construire un prototype d\u2019une automobile de sport avec l\u2019intention de vendre leur id\u00e9e, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans le prototype, \u00e0 un fabricant d\u2019automobiles qui pourrait \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire la fabrication. Une compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e pour mettre ce projet \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution et des actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises aux deux associ\u00e9s et \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes ayant mis de l\u2019argent dans l\u2019entreprise. En 1960, dans une derni\u00e8re tentative de vendre l\u2019id\u00e9e \u00e0 un fabricant, le contribuable a avanc\u00e9 une somme de $13,840.47 \u00e0 la compagnie. Une partie de cette somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la compagnie et une partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e directement pour main\u2011d\u2019\u0153uvre, mat\u00e9riaux et d\u00e9penses. Lorsque l\u2019op\u00e9ration est devenue une perte totale en 1960, le contribuable a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9duire le montant de $13,840.47 de ses autres revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en question. La Commission d\u2019appel de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a maintenu la cotisation et a jug\u00e9 que la somme n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9ductible parce qu\u2019elle devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une perte de capital. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier qui a statu\u00e9 que la somme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9e par le contribuable en vue d\u2019obtenir un revenu. Le Ministre en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Le montant en question doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une somme d\u00e9bours\u00e9e en vue de gagner un revenu provenant d\u2019une affaire d\u2019un caract\u00e8re commercial et non pas comme un d\u00e9bours\u00e9 ou une perte de capital. Le montant ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un placement. D\u00e8s ses d\u00e9buts, l\u2019op\u00e9ration n\u2019avait pas pour but de tirer un revenu d\u2019un placement mais de faire un profit sur la vente du prototype. Les paiements faits par le contribuable \u00e9taient purement sp\u00e9culatifs. Si un profit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 imposable quelle qu\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e pour le r\u00e9aliser. Le fait qu\u2019une compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e pour mettre l\u2019affaire \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution ne change rien. Si le contribuable et ses amis avaient r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un profit en vendant le prototype, ils auraient pu le r\u00e9aliser aussi bien en vendant leurs actions dans la compagnie au lieu que ce soit la compagnie qui vende le prototype. Il n\u2019y a aucun doute que si un profit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi r\u00e9alis\u00e9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 imposable. On doit suivre la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle lorsqu\u2019une perte a \u00e9t\u00e9 subie. Les paiements faits par le contribuable ne peuvent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une op\u00e9ration distincte et isol\u00e9e de l\u2019entreprise initiale et n\u2019avaient aucune des caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un pr\u00eat r\u00e9gulier. Dans les circonstances, la perte doit \u00eatre d\u00e9duite des autres revenus du contribuable dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e dans laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 subie, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire 1960.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], infirmant une d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019appel de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a judgment of the Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nAlban Garon and Pierre H. Guilbault, for the appellant.\nP.N. Thorsteinsson and M.J. O\u2019Keefe, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The facts of this case are somewhat unusual. The respondent who resided in Windsor, Ontario but practised law in Detroit, Michigan had, in conjunction with one Kettlewell, a tool and die maker, conceived the idea of designing a small personal sports car. Their intention was not to start a manufacturing operation but to interest a manufacturer to produce such a car. Together with one Porritt, a retired mechanical engineer, they embarked upon the project in 1958 and a first prototype was made in that year. The monies put up in carrying on this project were advanced by respondent and Kettlewell to a company incorporated in Michigan. Shares were issued to them and also to some of their friends who were persuaded to put money in the undertaking. Further prototypes were made and contacts were had with various corporations in an unsuccessful attempt to sell the idea to one of them. In 1960, the other shareholders declined to put up any further monies. The respondent, however, spent a sum of $13,840.47 in a final attempt to sell to the Seagrave Corporation the concept of the small personal sports car embodied in the last prototype which was driveable. Part of this money was disbursed by cheques to the company and another part by direct payments for labour, materials and expenses. For some months the Seagrave Corporation expressed interest but, in the end, it made no offer and the venture became a total loss.\nThe issue on this appeal is whether the sum of $13,840.47 expended by respondent in the circumstances above described, is deductible from his other income in the year 1960 for the purpose of computing his taxable income. The assistant chairman of the Tax Appeal Board held that it was not deductible saying that it must be regarded as a capital outlay that, it was hoped, would bring about a marketable asset. On appeal to the Exchequer Court[2] this was reversed, Gibson J. holding that the monies paid out in 1960 by the respondent were monies spent by him for the purpose of obtaining an income. In this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that:\n(1) the corporate existence of the company cannot be ignored;\n(2) the company alone was engaged in the development of a sports car;\n(3) the sum spent was not an outlay for gaining income from a business, property or other source; and\n(4) this amount was an outlay or loss on account of capital.\nBefore dealing specifically with these contentions, some general observations appear desirable. In 1952, Parliament eliminated from the Income Tax Act the rule in s. 13 (s. 10 of the Income War Tax Act) whereby the deduction of losses incurred in accessory business ventures was prohibited by providing that a taxpayer\u2019s income \u201cshall be deemed to be not less than his income for the year from his chief source of income\u201d, and in 1958 s. 27(1)(e) was amended to provide for business losses being carried back or forward against income from any business instead of income from the same business only. Thus our law no longer looks askance at taxpayers who do not believe in \u201cthe adage that the cobbler should stick to his last\u201d. They are not subjected to discriminatory fiscal treatment by being taxed if successful but denied a deduction if unsuccessful.\nIt must also be noted that the Income Tax Act defines business so as to include \u201can adventure or concern in the nature of trade\u201d (s. 139 (1)(e)). By virtue of this definition, a single operation is to be considered as a business although it is an isolated venture entirely unconnected with the taxpayer\u2019s profession or occupation. This consequence of the definition has been recognized and given effect to in many cases but I will refer only to one of them namely McIntosh v. Minister of National Revenue[3] in which it was held that a single venture of speculation in land gave rise to taxable income when profit was obtained as a result of an acquisition made with a view to a profit on the resale. Kerwin C.J. said (at pp. 120-121):\nIt is quite true that an individual is in a position differing from that of a company and that, as stated by Jessel M.R. in Smith v. Anderson (approved by this Court in Argue v. Minister of National Revenue),\nSo in the ordinary case of investments, a man who has money to invest, invests his money and he may occasionally sell the investments and buy others, but he is not carrying on a business.\nHowever, it is also true, as well in the case of an individual as of a company, that the profits of an isolated venture may be taxed: Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v. Bairstow et al. It is impossible to lay down a test that will meet the multifarious circumstances that may arise in all fields of human endeavour. As is pointed out in Noak v. Minister of National Revenue, it is a question of fact in each case, referring to the Argue case, supra, and Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue, to which might be added the Jugment of this Court in Kennedy v. Minister of National Revenue, which affirmed the decision of the Exchequer Court. In the present case I agree with Mr. Justice Hyndman\u2019s findings with reference to the appellant that:\nHaving acquired the said property there was no intention in his mind to retain it as an investment, but to dispose of the lots, if and when suitable prices could be obtained.\nSuch being the principles to be applied in cases when a profit is obtained, the same rules must be followed when a loss is suffered. Fairness to the taxpayers requires us to be very careful to avoid allowing profits to be taxed as income but losses treated as on account of capital and therefore not deductible from income when the situation is essentially the same.\nIn the present case, appellant does not deny that the venture in itself was an adventure in the nature of trade so that if respondent and his friends had embarked upon it in their own names, the loss would be deductible. It is in this light that the four contentions advanced on behalf of appellant must now be examined.\nOn the first question, the decision of this Court in Fraser v. Minister of National Revenue[4] appears to be in point. It was there held that where real estate operators had incorporated companies to hold real estate, the sale of shares in those companies rather than the sale of the land was merely an alternative method of putting through the real estate transactions and the profit was therefore taxable. This decision does not in my view necessarily imply that the existence of the companies as separate legal entities was disregarded for income tax assessment purposes. On the contrary, it must be presumed that the companies remained liable for taxes on their operations and their title to the land, unchallenged. I must therefore consider that the decision rests on the view that was taken of the nature of the outlay involved in the acquisition of the companies\u2019 shares by the promoters.\nIt is clear that while the acquisition of shares may be an investment (Minister of National Revenue v. Foreign Power Securities Corp. Ltd.[5]), it may also be a trading operation depending upon circumstances (Osier Hammond and Nanton Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[6]; Hill-Clarke-Francis Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[7]). Due to the definition of business as including an adventure in the nature of trade, it is unnecessary for an acquisition of shares to be a trading operation rather than an investment that there should be a pattern of regular trading operations. In the Fraser case, the basic operation was the acquisition of land with a view to a profit upon resale so that it became a trading asset. The conclusion reached implies that the acquisition of shares in companies incorporated for the purpose of holding such land was of the same nature seeing that upon selling the shares instead of the land itself, the profit was a trading profit not a capital profit on the realization of an investment. This principle appears equally applicable in the circumstances of this case. If the respondent and his friends had been successful in selling the prototype sports car, they might well have done it by selling their shares in the company instead of having the company sell the prototype, and there can be no doubt that if they had thus made a profit it would have been taxable. Because no sale could be made, respondent and his friends obviously never reached the point at which consideration would be given to the method to be adopted for realizing the profit. This should not alter the situation because the decision in the Fraser case implies that, irrespective of the method adopted, any profit would have been income, not capital gain. Also in that case it must be noted that the companies alone held the land just as in the present case the company owned the prototype sports car. This appears to dispose of the first two questions raised by appellant.\nAppellant further contends that the disbursements made by respondent should be considered as a loan to the company. This is somewhat doubtful because while reimbursement of the sums advanced to the company could probably have been claimed as money had and received, the sums paid direct to third parties might well have been considered as voluntary payments and not recoverable (Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 8, p. 231). Assuming that the whole amount should properly be considered as a debt due by the company, this does not necessarily imply that the outlay was an investment. Obligations to pay money can be trading assets just like other things (Scott v. Minister of National Revenue[8]; Minister of National Revenue v. Maclnnes[9]; Minister of National Revenue v. Curlett[10]). It is true that in those cases the conclusion that the acquisition of mortgages at a discount was a speculation, not an investment, rests upon a consideration of the large number of operations of a similar nature that were effected. But, on account of the definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d, this is not the only basis on which this conclusion can be reached. As previously pointed out, a single venture in the nature of trade is a business for the purposes of the Income Tax Act \u201cas well in the case of an individual as of a company\u201d.\nIt is, of course, obvious that a loan made by a person who is not in the business of lending money is ordinarily to be considered as an investment. It is only under quite exceptional or unusual circumstances that such an operation should be considered as a speculation. However, the circumstances of the present case are quite unusual and exceptional. It is an undeniable fact that, at the outset, the operation embarked upon was an adventure in the nature of trade. It is equally clear that the character of the venture itself remained the same until it ended up in a total loss. Under those circumstances, the outlay made by respondent in the last year, when the speculative nature of the undertaking was even more marked than at the outset due to financial difficulties, cannot be considered as an investment. Whether it is considered as a payment in anticipation of shares to be issued or as an advance to be refunded if the venture was successful, it is clear that the monies were not invested to derive an income therefrom but in the hope of making a profit on the whole transaction.\nAt this point, the decision of this Court in Minister of National Revenue v. Steer[11] must be considered. In that case, it was held that a guarantee given to a bank for a company\u2019s indebtness was a deferred loan to the company and that a large sum paid to the bank to discharge this indebtedness was a capital loss. The decision cannot imply that loans are always investments but only that such was the character of the loan in the circumstances of that case because, as we have seen, there are at least three recent cases in this Court where loans were held to be trading operations with the consequence that profits and losses were on income not capital account. It must also be added that the decision cannot imply that an outlay for the acquisition of an interest in an oil well drilling venture such as the company involved in the Steer case, can never be a trading venture because in Dobieco Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[12] such an interest was treated as a trading asset of an underwriting and trading firm. As we have seen while there is a presumption against an isolated operation having such a character in the hands of an individual, this presumption can be rebutted and it may be shown that even a single operation is in fact a venture in the nature of trade and therefore a \u201cbusiness\u201d for income tax purposes.\nIn the present case as we have seen, the basic venture was not the development of a sports car with a view to the making of a profit by going into the business of selling cars but with a view to a profit on selling the prototype. Therefore, the venture, from its inception, was not for the purpose of deriving income from an investment but for the purpose of making a profit on the resale which is characteristic of a venture in the nature of trade. Nothing indicates that the character of the operation had changed when the outlays under consideration were made. On the contrary, the venture had become even more speculative, it was abundantly clear that respondent could have no hope of recovering anything unless a sale of the prototype could be accomplished. The outlays cannot be considered as a separate operation isolated from the initial venture, they have none of the characteristics of a regular loan.\nIn my view, the payments made by respondent could not properly be considered as an investment in the circumstances in which they were made. It was purely specula- tion. If a profit had been obtained it would have been taxable irrespective of the method adopted for realizing it. Such being the situation, these sums must be considered as outlays for gaining income from an adventure in the nature of trade, that is a business within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, and not as outlays or losses on account of capital.\nI now find it necessary to point out that while s. 27(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act as amended in 1958 clearly provides for the deductibility of business losses in the taxation year immediately preceding and in the five taxation years immediately following the year in which they are sustained, there is no explicit provision for such deductibility in that last mentioned year. Due to s. 2(3), this is a matter of no small difficulty although the definition of loss in s. 139(1)(x) clearly contemplates such deductibility. Seeing that the loss in question if not deductible in the year in which it was sustained would undoubtedly be deductible in six other years from income of the kind from which it is sought to be deducted, namely professional fees which come within the definition of income from a business, and that appellant does not contend that if the loss is deductible it cannot be deducted in the year in which it was sustained but, on the contrary, that it must be applied against any other income in that year, this appears to be the proper conclusion for the purpose of this case.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

When the company discovered these breaches of duty, it discharged the three employees. The employees then filed grievances that they had been unjustifiably discharged. A board of arbitration, by a majority, held that the employees\u2019 conduct did not constitute proper cause for dismissal. The board substituted periods of suspension in the place of dismissal.\nThe award was quashed on certiorari. On appeal the Court of Appeal, by a majority, restored the award of the board of arbitration. The company then appealed to this Court, asking for the restoration of the order made at trial quashing the award.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nUnder the terms of the collective agreement, the company had the right to discharge for proper cause. The task of the board of arbitration was to determine whether there was proper cause. On the facts there was only one proper legal conclusion, namely, that the employees had given the management proper cause for dismissal. The board, however, did not limit its task in this way. It assumed the function of management. It determined, not whether there had been proper cause, but whether the company, having proper cause, should have exercised the power of dismissal. The board substituted its judgment for the judgment of management and found in favour of suspension. The sole issue in the case was whether the three employees left their jobs for someone else and whether this fact was a proper cause for discipline. Once the board had found that there were facts justifying discipline, the particular form chosen was not subject to review on arbitration.\nAs to the question whether this Court had by certiorari a power of review over the award made by this board of arbitration, the wording of the provisions of s. 34 of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, was clear and unambiguous. The parties to a collective agreement were required to arbitrate their dispute. There was no alternative course of action open to them. The legislation compelled recourse to an arbitration board and that board was therefore a statutory creation and hence subject to review in the Courts by certiorari.\nQuite apart from this, the board\u2019s award was subject to review in this Court. Under the common law an ordinary motion could be made to the Court to set aside an award on the ground that there was error of law on the face of it.\n[Re International Nickel Co. of Canada Ltd. and Rivando, [19561 O.R. 379, approved and applied; R. v.

(2d) 135, referred to.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Brooke J. Appeal allowed.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJohn H. Osler, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Three employees of the appellant, Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company, stayed away from their employment for the purpose of taking temporary employment with another employer. Two of them, Jack Geravelis and Patrick Manduca, left work before the end of their shifts on Monday, April 11, 1966. They gave sickness as their reason for so doing. This was an untrue statement. They both then drove to Terrace Bay where, according to arrangements that they had already made, they worked for F.W. Brunwin Welding Limited on April 11, 12 and 13, 1966. John W. Beaucage was absent from work from April 11 to April 15, 1966, both days inclusive. During that time he was working for Barnett-McQueen Company Limited at Marathon, Ontario. He told the company that he intended to take a week off without pay.\nWhen the company discovered these breaches of duty, it discharged the three employees. The employees then filed grievances that they had been unjustifiably discharged. A board of arbitration made the findings of fact which I have just summarized but held by a majority that they did not constitute proper cause for dismissal. The board substituted periods of suspension in the place of dismissal.\nThe company then applied before a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario to quash the award. This was done by the judgment of Mr. Justice Brooke. On appeal by the union on behalf of the men, the Court of Appeal[2], by a majority, restored the award of the board of arbitration. The company in this appeal asks for the restoration of the order made by Mr. Justice Brooke quashing the award.\nThe collective agreement in force at the time of dismissal provides in art. Ill for Management Rights:\n3.01 The Union recognizes the Management\u2019s authority to manage the affairs of the Company, to direct its working forces, including the right to hire, transfer, promote, demote, suspend and discharge for proper cause any Employee and to increase, or decrease the working force of the Company, provided that the Company shall not exercise these rights in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.\n3.02 An employee affected by the exercising of this authority who feels that he has cause for dissatisfaction may have the complaint dealt with in accordance with the \u201cGrievance Procedure\u201d.\nArticle VIII deals with Grievance Procedure and Arbitration. Section 8.17 provides:\n8.17 The Board of Arbitration shall not alter, modify, amend or make any decision inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.\nThe proceedings in this case relating to a discharge were begun under s. 8.20:\n8.20 In all cases of grievance over layoff or discharge, a written grievance naming the individual grievor must be submitted by the Grievance Committee to Management within two (2) working days after the termination of employment and the settlement procedure is to continue as specified above starting at Sub-Section 8.08. The sections beginning with s. 8.08 and continuing to s. 8.14 deal with the institution and conduct of proceedings on arbitration.\nThe reason why I have set out or summarized these sections is that the arbitration was concerned only with a grievance over discharge, as mentioned in s. 8.20. It was not an arbitration at large contemplated by s. 8.03, which reads:\n8.03 Any difference arising between the Union and the Company relating to the interpretation, application or administration of this Agreement, or where an allegation is made that the Agreement has been violated, shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII, commencing at Sub-section 8.08.\nThe provisions relating to seniority, absence and leave of absence are next set out Section 9.03(b) reads:\n9.03 (b) Seniority Holders will be recalled, in the reverse order of lay-off, as required by the work at hand. Such recall shall be through the Personnel Office and shall be recorded.\nSection 9.04 provides for cancellation of seniority rights and one of the grounds is:\n9.04 (d) If an Employee is absent for five (5) consecutive working days without establishing a satisfactory reason with the Personnel Office.\nSection 11.03, dealing with leave of absence, reads:\n11.03 Leave of absence shall not be granted to any employee for the purpose of engaging in employment elsewhere or to engage in his own business.\nIt is apparent that in the case of Beaucage, he lost his seniority under s. 9.04 (d) and that all three employees were in breach of s. 11.03, which prohibited the granting of leave of absence to any employee for the purpose of engaging in any employment elsewhere.\nThe proposition of the appellant company is that the board had no power to substitute suspension for dismissal. I deliberately avoid the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d. The company, under art. Ill dealing with management rights, has the right to discharge for proper cause. I draw no distinction between \u201cproper\u201d cause and \u201cjust\u201d cause. This is subject only to s. 3.03, which gives the employee a right to have his case dealt with according to grievance procedure. The only limitation on the power of management is that it shall not be exercised \u201cin a manner inconsistent with the terms of this agreement\u201d. In this case there cannot be any suggestion that there was anything in the agreement that the company breached.\nThe task of the board of arbitration in this case was to determine whether there was proper cause. The findings of fact actually made and the only findings of fact that the board could possibly make establish that there was proper cause. Then there was only one proper legal conclusion, namely, that the employees had given the management proper cause for dismissal. The board, however, did not limit its task in this way. It assumed the function of management. In this case it determined, not whether there had been proper cause, but whether the company, having proper cause, should have exercised the power of dismissal. The board substituted its judgment for the judgment of management and found in favour of suspension.\nThe sole issue in this case was whether the three employees left their jobs to work for someone else and whether this fact was a proper cause for discipline. Once the board had found that there were facts justifying discipline, the particular form chosen was not subject to review on arbitration. This was the opinion of Mr. Justice Brooke and Mr. Justice Schroeder, dissenting on appeal, and with this opinion I agree.\nNotwithstanding obvious and serious breaches of the collective agreement by these three individuals, the board has, in effect, said \u201cWe will hold that these breaches are not a proper cause for dismissal but call for suspension\u201d.\nA collective agreement is binding on employer and employees. These were not trivial breaches and the board had no power to substitute its own judgment for that of management in the circumstances of this case. If this kind of review is to be given to a board under s. 3.03, it should be given in express terms, namely, that the management\u2019s authority to demote, suspend or discharge will be subject to full review by the board of arbitration. Management would then understand what its position would be. But as the agreement is presently drawn, the board\u2019s power is limited to a determination whether management went beyond its authority in this case. The question before them was, could an honest management, looking at the group of employees as a whole and at the interests of the company, have reached the conclusion that they did? In other words, did management go beyond its rights? There is only one answer to this question and the answer is \u201cNo\u201d. It was the board that exceeded its authority in reviewing the decision of management by purporting to exercise a full appellate function.\nAfter the conclusion of argument the question was raised whether this Court had by certiorari a power of review over the award made by this board of arbitration. Counsel were invited to submit written argument on this point.\nIt is clear that the prerogative writs of prohibition and certiorari will not lie against a non\u2011statutory tribunal. The reasons for this are mainly historical and are explained by Lord Denning in R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, Ex. p. Shaw[3], At one point in his judgment the learned judge referred specifically to awards of arbitrators and pointed out that, (p. 351),\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench never interfered by certiorari with the award of an arbitrator, because it was a private tribunal and not subject to the prerogative writs.\nSimilarly in R. v. National Joint Council for the Craft of Dental Technicians (Disputes Committee) et al, Ex p. Neale[4], where the question was whether the Council was a private arbitration body constituted by agreement or a statutory entity, Lord Goddard C.J., after some general remarks on the scope of the prerogative writs, said, at p. 708:\nThere is no instance of which I know in the books where certiorari or prohibition has gone to any arbitrator except a statutory arbitrator, and a statutory arbitrator is one to whom by statute the parties must resort.\nThus, the question is whether the board of arbitration whose award is the subject of this litigation is a statutory body to which the parties to a collective agreement must resort. This depends upon what interpretation is to be given to certain provisions of the Ontario Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202. Section 34(1) of that Act provides:\nEvery collective agreement shall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration, without stoppage of work, of all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable.\nThis provision is supported by nine other subsections all of which (with the exception possibly of the tenth subsection) are directed towards ensuring that the arbitration process is carried through to its conclusion. And although somewhat general in nature, they do provide a clear and defined framework within which the parties must conduct the process of arbitration.\nIn Re International Nickel Co. of Canada Ltd. and Rivando[5], the Court of Appeal for Ontario considered these provisions and came to the conclusion that the parties to a collective agreement were compelled to arbitrate their differences. Aylesworth J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said at pp. 386-387:\nConsideration of these statutory provisions makes it abundantly clear that the parties are under compulsion to arbitrate their differences. The parties are directed by statute as to the matters which must be governed by arbitration; they are told that they must abide by the award and they are also told, (a) that if they fail to include in their collective agreement an arbitration provision, then the statutory provision in subs. (2) will form part of their agreement, subject in proper cases to modification of the provision by the Labour Relations Board, and (b) that if they fail to appoint an arbitrator or to constitute a Board of Arbitration, the necessary appointments will be made by the Minister of Labour.\nWith respect, it seems to me that the element and degree of compulsion inherent in the Labour Relations Act regarding arbitration of industrial disputes establishes the instant Board of Arbitration as a statutory Board. If this be so, then admittedly certiorari may issue to it from this Court.\nThis decision was referred to in this Court in Howe Sound Co. v. International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (Canada), Local 663[6]. In that case this Court considered the same question as confronted the Court of Appeal of Ontario, but under the relevant provisions of the British Columbia Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, and held that certiorari would not lie against the arbitration board as it was a private tribunal constituted by agreement between the parties. Cartwright J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, adopted and endorsed what was said by Tysoe J.A. in the Court of Appeal[7]. Tysoe J.A., in his reasons for judgment, said at pp. 78-79:\nCertiorari does not lie against an arbitrator or Arbitration Board unless the arbitrator or board is a statutory arbitrator or statutory board\u2014that is a person or board to whom by statute the parties must resort. Prerogative writs of certiorari and prohibition do not go to ordinary private Arbitration Boards set Up by agreement of parties: R. v. Nat\u2019l. Joint Council for the Craft of Dental Technicians, [1953] 1 Q.B., 704. We must, therefore, decide whether this Arbitration Board is a private arbitration body set up by agreement, or a statutory board.\nIn my opinion, if the Arbitration Board qualifies as a statutory board, it does so only by reason of the provisions of s. 22 of the Labour Relations Act. Without them, I doubt if anyone would suggest the Board would be other than a private arbitration body. The question would, therefore, seem to be, does s. 22 have the effect of constituting the Arbitration Board to which the parties to the collective agreement have agreed to refer for the final settlement of differences, a statutory arbitral tribunal? In my opinion, the answer to this question is in the negative.\nSection 22 does not create an arbitral tribunal or any other tribunal or body. It merely requires the parties to a collective agreement to agree between themselves on a method for finally and conclusively settling any differences without stoppage of work, and to embody their agreement in the collective agreement. If they do not do this, the Minister is to do it for them and his method becomes embodied in and forms part of the collective agreement. The method may be \u201cby arbitration or otherwise\u201d. The parties may select and provide their own method and the only condition is that it shall achieve the desired result, namely, the final and conclusive settlement of differences without stoppage of work. The Legislature has not said the parties must resort to an Arbitration Board or to any particular person or body of persons. It has left the parties complete freedom of choice in this respect. All the Legislature has said is that there must be a method by which disputes will be finally and conclusively determined without stoppage of work. To find the method one turns to the agreement.\nIt is true that the British Columbia legislation is very similar to that in effect in Ontario. But there are differences, the most important of which is that the British Columbia legislation provides for the settlement of disputes under the collective agreement by arbitration or otherwise, whereas the Ontario legislation provides for no alternative except arbitration. This was recognized by Cartwright J., who expressly reserved his opinion on whether the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Rivando were correct in their interpretation of the Ontario legislation. He said at p. 329:\nIn support of this submission the appellant relies, amongst others, on the case of Re International Nickel Company of Canada Limited and Rivando, [1956] O.R. 379; 2 D.L.R. (2d) 700, a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nWhether this argument is entitled to prevail must depend chiefly on the wording of the statute which is said to compel the creation of the tribunal and to require the parties to resort to it, and there are differences between the Ontario legislation and that in force in British Columbia.\nThe Howe Sound decision was referred to and followed by Riley J. in the Alberta decision of Re Ewaschuk, Western Plywood (Alberta) Ltd. v. International Woodworkers of America. Local 1-207[8]. However, the relevant provision of the Alberta Labour Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 167, is substantially the same as that of the British Columbia Act, and Riley J. noted that the Ontario legislation was different. He said at p. 702:\nSection 22(1) of the British Columbia Labour Relations Act and s. 73(5) [rep. & sub. 1960, c. 54, s. 21] of the Alberta Labour Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 167, are substantially the same in that neither section sets up arbitration as the only means for settling disputes. Conversely, in Ontario, the Labour Relations Act requires that every collective agreement provide for the final settlement of grievances solely by arbitration. Consequently, Arbitration Boards in that Province have been held to be statutory boards against which certiorari will run: Re International Nickel Co. and Rivando (1956), 2 D.L.R. (2d) 700, [1956] O.R. 379.\nTo the same effect is the recent Nova Scotia decision of R. v. Board of Arbitration, Ex p. Cumberland Railway Co.[9], where the relevant provision was s. 19(1) of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Inventigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152, which is substantially the same as that of the British Columbia Act. McKinnon J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, after a consideration of the Howe Sound decision, said at pp. 141-142:\nAn examination of the above sections will show that the wording of s. 19(1) of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, with which we are concerned herein, is, for our purposes the same as the British Columbia section which was under consideration in the Howe Sound case, and which the Court found did not constitute the board a statutory one. On the other hand, the Ontario Act, being the Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, s. 34(1). is as follows:\n\u201c34(1) Every collective agreement shall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration, without stoppage of work, of all differences between the parties\u2026\u201d\nThis was the section which the Court took under consideration in the International Nickel & Rivando case.\nConsidering the above, it would seem that the Courts have distinguished private and statutory arbitration boards by the wording of the statutes which provided for the setting up of such boards, and where such statutory provision included the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d following the words \u201cby arbitration\u201d, this did not create a statutory tribunal or body. \u201cIt merely requires the parties to a collective agreement to agree between themselves on a method for finally and conclusively settling any differences...\u201d: Howe Sound Co. v. International Union, 29 D.L.R., (2d) at p. 79.\nThe Courts of Ontario have consistently followed Rivando. This Court reserved its opinion on the correctness of that decision in the Howe Sound case and made no comment upon it apart from a reference to it in Imbleau et al. v. Laskin et al.[10] It is therefore open to this Court to adopt the reasoning of Aylesworth J.A. and I propose to do so. The wording is clear and unambiguous. The parties to a collective agreement must arbitrate their dispute. There is no alternative course of action open to them. The legislation compels recourse to an arbitration board and that board is therefore a statutory creation and hence subject to review in the Courts by certiorari.\nQuite apart from this, I am of the opinion that the board\u2019s award is subject to review in this Court. In R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, supra, Lord Denning pointed out that under the common law an ordinary motion could be made to the Court to set aside an award on the ground that there was an error of law on the face of it. He said at p. 351:\nLeaving now the statutory tribunals, I turn to the awards of arbitrators. The Court of King\u2019s Bench never interfered by certiorari with the award of an arbitrator, because it was a private tribunal and not subject to the prerogative writs. If the award was not made a rule of court, the only course available to an aggrieved party was to resist an action on the award or to file a bill in equity. If the award was made a rule of court, a motion could be made to the court to set aside for misconduct of the arbitrator on the ground that it was procured by corruption or other undue means: see 9 & 10 Will. 3, c. 15. At one time an award could not be upset on the ground of error of law by the arbitrator, because that could not be said to be misconduct or undue means; but ultimately it was held in Kent v. Elstob (1802) 3 East 18, that an award could be set aside for error of law on the face of it. This was regretted by Williams J. in Hodgkinson v. Fernie (1857), 3 C.B.N.S. 189, but is now well established. This remedy by motion to set aside is, however, confined to arbitrators.\nAnd in the Howe Sound decision, Cartwright J. said:\nIn my view it is open to the parties should occasion arise, to question the jurisdiction of the board or the validity of any award it makes in such manner as is permitted by the Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 14 or by the common law.\nThe main consequence of s. 34(10) of the Ontario Act which provides that the Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 18, does not apply to arbitrations under collective agreements, is that the power of the Supreme Court of Ontario to review and quash awards of private arbitrators and boards of arbitration comes from the common law. It is an inherent power not affected nor limited in any way by the Arbitrations Act. This was made clear by Wright J. in his reasons for judgment in Beach v. Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario[11], which were affirmed on appeal[12], but on other grounds. However, the Court of Appeal did not dispute his opinion on this point.\nIn Ontario relief by way of certiorari is obtained in an originating motion and no writ is issued. This is the same procedure that is used to quash an award of a private arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. The notice of motion in these proceedings makes it clear that the relief asked for is an order quashing the award. It does not seem to me to be of any consequence that the motion contains a reference to certiorari. The procedure is the same and in my opinion this notice of motion is sufficient to justify an order quashing the award.\nFurthermore, and as I have already indicated, there is no doubt in my mind that the award should be quashed. An arbitration board of the type under consideration has no inherent powers of review similar to those of the Courts. Its only powers are those conferred upon it by the collective agreement and these are usually defined in some detail. It has no inherent powers to amend, modify or ignore the collective agreement. But this is exactly what this board did in this case and it was clearly in error in so doing, and its award should be quashed.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the order of Brooke J. quashing the award, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy and McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Jolliffe, Lewis & Osler, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 49, 62 D.L.R.

Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accept\u00e9 la version du demandeur et a rejet\u00e9 celle du d\u00e9fendeur pour la raison que celle-ci \u00e9tait contredite par celle\u2011l\u00e0.

Ayant signal\u00e9 l\u2019erreur affectant le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et ayant fait un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la preuve, elle s\u2019est form\u00e9 sur la question de fait une opinion diff\u00e9rente.

The plaintiff was injured when he was struck by an automobile belonging to the defendant and driven by him in a westerly direction in the city of Montreal. The plaintiff says that, after parking his car on the north side of the street, he was struck by the defendant\u2019s automobile coming from his right as he was standing beside the left front door of his car, which he was in the process of locking. The defendant says that the plaintiff came out suddenly into the street from between two parked cars and that he could not avoid the accident. The trial judge accepted the plaintiff\u2019s version and rejected the one submitted by the defendant on the ground that the latter was contradicted by the former. The Court of Appeal held that the tribunal of first instance could not come to the conclusion that all the witnesses for the defence were mistaken for the sole reason that they were contradicted by the witnesses for the plaintiff, substituted its own appreciation of the evidence and came to the conclusion that the weight of the evidence and the balance of probabilities favoured the version of the defence. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Martland J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Court of Appeal applied the principles pursuant to which a first Court of Appeal must necessarily interfere, examine the record and form its own opinion on the evidence. Having pointed out the error in the judgment at trial and having thoroughly examined the evidence, the Court of Appeal came to a different conclusion on the question of fact. It was impossible to be clearly satisfied that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was erroneous.\nPer Martland J., dissenting: This case was one which an appellate tribunal should not have interfered. It was incumbent on the defendant to demonstrate manifest error, to show that the trial judge was plainly wrong in his finding of fact. It was not enough for the defendant to finecomb the depositions, as he did, in order to find reasons to support his own version. There was no basis for holding that there was manifest error in the reasons or conclusions of the trial judge nor for saying that the judge was plainly wrong.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Challies, Associate Chief Justice.

Le fait de l\u2019accident n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9. La difficult\u00e9 est de d\u00e9terminer comment il se produisit. Suivant l\u2019appelant, il venait de stationner sa voiture, au c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord, sur le bord du trottoir et alors que, \u00e9tant sur la rue, face \u00e0 son v\u00e9hicule, il s\u2019appr\u00eatait \u00e0 en mettre la porte avant gauche sous clef, il fut heurt\u00e9 par l\u2019automobile de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui venait \u00e0 sa droite; de ce moment \u00e0 celui o\u00f9 il reprit connaissance dans l\u2019ambulance, il ne se souvient de rien. Suivant l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019appelant d\u00e9boucha subitement devant lui d\u2019entre deux voitures stationn\u00e9es sur le bord du trottoir et bien qu\u2019en freinant, il ait immobilis\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule presque imm\u00e9diatement, il ne put \u00e9viter de le frapper.\nDans un jugement clair et concis, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a consid\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u2019une part, que la version de l\u2019appelant est support\u00e9e par Gilles Paquin, t\u00e9moin produit par l\u2019appelant. Paquin n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sur les lieux de l\u2019accident mais il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019au temps de cet accident, il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 au garage de l\u2019appelant, qu\u2019\u00e0 la demande de ce dernier, il est all\u00e9, vers la fin de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi du jour m\u00eame de l\u2019accident, chercher l\u2019automobile de son patron, demeur\u00e9e stationn\u00e9e sur la rue Marie-Anne et qu\u2019il en trouva alors les clefs dans la serrure de la porte avant gauche. La Cour a consid\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u2019autre part, que la version de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est elle-m\u00eame confirm\u00e9e par trois membres de sa famille qui \u00e9taient passagers dans son automobile. Il appert du t\u00e9moignage de ces derniers que l\u2019appelant d\u00e9boucha subitement et en courant d\u2019entre deux automobiles. Par ailleurs, la Cour a not\u00e9 deux faits de nature \u00e0 mettre en doute la version de l\u2019appelant. Le premier de ces faits est que l\u2019appelant fut bless\u00e9, par l\u2019automobile qui venait \u00e0 sa droite, \u00e0 la jambe gauche, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 la rotule, soit \u00e0 l\u2019avant du genou, et non \u00e0 la jambe droite; ce qui indiquerait que l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit de la fa\u00e7on indiqu\u00e9e par l\u2019automobiliste et ses trois passagers et non de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9crite par le pi\u00e9ton. La Cour dispose de cette question en disant qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident, l\u2019appelant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, se tenait un peu de biais, sa jambe gauche se trouvant un peu \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de sa jambe droite. Le second fait est que les portes d\u2019automobiles fabriqu\u00e9es par la compagnie General Motors,\u2014telle l\u2019automobile de l\u2019appelant,\u2014peuvent se verrouiller et se verrouillent habituellement de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, sans l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une clef; ce qui rend un peu surprenante l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il aurait utilis\u00e9 ses clefs et que c\u2019est en ce faisant qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9. La Cour dispose de la question en retenant l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant qui dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019obligation d\u2019utiliser ses clefs en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 de la serrure, caus\u00e9e par un accident ant\u00e9rieur. Le jugement, par ailleurs, ne fait aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la question de savoir si Paquin \u00e9tait vraiment l\u2019employ\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant comme lui\u2011m\u00eame et l\u2019appelant en ont attest\u00e9, nonobstant l\u2019importance que cette question avait prise au cours des interrogatoires visant \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, et le doute assez s\u00e9rieux que jette sur le point le t\u00e9moignage de Jean-Paul St-Charles, comptable qui s\u2019occupait des affaires de l\u2019appelant et que ce dernier appela comme t\u00e9moin pour \u00e9tablir ses dommages. Enfin, appel\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 choisir entre deux versions irr\u00e9conciliables dont l\u2019une, celle de l\u2019appelant, \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 imputer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le fait de l\u2019accident et dont l\u2019autre, celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de ses t\u00e9moins, \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 repousser enti\u00e8rement la pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 qui, suivant l\u2019ancienne loi, pesait contre lui, le tribunal accueillit la premi\u00e8re en s\u2019exprimant comme suit:\nThe Court accepts the version of Plaintiff supported as it is by the examination on discovery at page 6 when Plaintiff was Defendant\u2019s witness, and by the evidence of Paquin. The keys could only have been in the door if Plaintiff\u2019s version of the accident were correct.\nEt, en ce qui concerne la seconde, la Cour ajouta:\nThe Court does not believe that Defendant and his witnesses perjured themselves but that they were merely mistaken.\nD\u2019o\u00f9 la condamnation. En appel, l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour obtenir l\u2019intervention de la Cour d\u2019appel dans cette cause o\u00f9 le conflit porte sur une simple question de fait, plaida particuli\u00e8rement qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sence des motifs s\u00e9rieux qu\u2019il y avait de douter de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages de la poursuite, le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance ne pouvait, comme il l\u2019a fait, conclure \u00e0 une erreur de la part de tous les t\u00e9moins de la d\u00e9fense, uniquement parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient contredits par ceux de la poursuite, qu\u2019il fallait d\u2019autres motifs et que le jugement ou le dossier n\u2019en r\u00e9v\u00e9lait aucun. La Cour d\u2019appel jugea que, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cet argument \u00e9tait suffisamment bien fond\u00e9 pour d\u00e9pouiller le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance de la pr\u00e9somption jurisprudentielle de plus grande cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la partie dont les t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillis de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ceux de l\u2019autre partie, et lui permettre de substituer sa propre appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve \u00e0 celle du juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nAu m\u00e9rite et dans des notes qui ont re\u00e7u l\u2019accord de ses coll\u00e8gues, M. le Juge Brossard, apr\u00e8s avoir fait une revue d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de toute la preuve au dossier, jugea que le poids de la preuve et la balance des probabilit\u00e9s favorisaient avec une pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance ind\u00e9niable la version de la d\u00e9fense. En fait et pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, il consid\u00e9ra particuli\u00e8rement que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avant du genou de la jambe gauche et aucunement \u00e0 la jambe droite; qu\u2019\u00e0 moins de reconna\u00eetre une erreur certaine d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la part des t\u00e9moins entendus sur la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019endroit pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019accident, il fallait conclure que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas devant son v\u00e9hicule au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 heurt\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il se trouvait beaucoup plus \u00e0 l\u2019est, \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 il n\u2019avait manifestement pas pu \u00eatre projet\u00e9 par un v\u00e9hicule voyageant vers l\u2019ouest; qu\u2019il y avait des divergences majeures entre le t\u00e9moignage au pr\u00e9alable de l\u2019appelant et son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate et celui de Paquin; qu\u2019au cours de son examen \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, l\u2019appelant avait affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident, il n\u2019avait qu\u2019un seul employ\u00e9 \u00e0 son garage et qu\u2019en l\u2019occurrence, cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait Paquin alors que, suivant le t\u00e9moignage du comptable St-Charles, l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait, \u00e0 la date de l\u2019accident, qu\u2019un seul employ\u00e9, soit Jean-Guy Audet. Le savant juge consid\u00e9ra, d\u2019autre part, que les t\u00e9moignages de la d\u00e9fense avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s de bonne foi, de l\u2019avis m\u00eame du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, et ne comportaient aucune contradic- tion essentielle entre eux. Et le juge Brossard de conclure qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019admettre que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9 d\u2019accepter les t\u00e9moignages de la poursuite de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ceux de la d\u00e9fense quand l\u2019unique motif le portant \u00e0 croire que ces derniers s\u2019\u00e9taient tromp\u00e9s, r\u00e9side dans le fait que leurs t\u00e9moignages n\u2019\u00e9taient pas conformes \u00e0 ceux de la poursuite. Le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance fut donc infirm\u00e9. Et de l\u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nA ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure, comme au stade de l\u2019appel en Cour du banc de la reine et celui du proc\u00e8s en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, la pr\u00e9sente cause ne soul\u00e8ve qu\u2019une pure et unique question de fait. Il s\u2019agit de savoir laquelle de deux versions irr\u00e9conciliables en fait et de cons\u00e9quences diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es en droit, doit \u00eatre retenue: celle de l\u2019appelant, version que le t\u00e9moin Paquin\u2014qui n\u2019a rien vu de l\u2019accident\u2014fut appel\u00e9 \u00e0 soutenir, ou celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de ses trois passagers, qui tous quatre ont vu l\u2019accident se produire subitement sous leurs yeux. Comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, d\u2019une part, accepta la premi\u00e8re et \u00e9carta la seconde pour la raison que celle-ci \u00e9tait contredite par celle-l\u00e0 et la Cour d\u2019appel, d\u2019autre part, jugeant cette raison insuffisante en droit et n\u2019en trouvant, au jugement, aucune autre suffisamment explicit\u00e9e, intervint, avec le r\u00e9sultat que l\u2019on sait.\nDans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, les r\u00e8gles qui doivent guider une premi\u00e8re et une seconde cour d\u2019appel, sont bien connues. En raison de la position privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e du juge qui pr\u00e9side au proc\u00e8s, voit, entend les parties et les t\u00e9moins et en appr\u00e9cie la tenue, il est de principe que l\u2019opinion de celui-ci doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e avec le plus grand respect par la Cour d\u2019appel et que le devoir de celle-ci n\u2019est pas de refaire le proc\u00e8s, ni d\u2019intervenir pour substituer son appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve \u00e0 celle du juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une erreur manifeste n\u2019apparaisse aux raisons ou conclusions du jugement frapp\u00e9 d\u2019appel. Encore faut-il, cependant, comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 M. le juge Brossard apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 les commentaires du juge Casey dans Gagnon v. Gauthier[3], que ces raisons soient en termes suffisamment explicites pour permettre \u00e0 une Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019en appr\u00e9cier la valeur au point de vue juridique. Aussi bien et si les raisons donn\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas ce caract\u00e8re, ou si l\u2019ayant, elles ne sont pas valides, la Cour doit n\u00e9cessairement intervenir, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen du dossier et former sa propre opinion sur la preuve au dossier. Il est manifeste qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour d\u2019appel a tenu compte de ces principes et les a appliqu\u00e9s; elle a signal\u00e9 l\u2019erreur dont, \u00e0 ses vues, le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 et proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la preuve, elle s\u2019est form\u00e9 sur la question de fait une opinion diff\u00e9rente de celle exprim\u00e9e au jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nQuant au principe qui doit guider une seconde Cour d\u2019appel appel\u00e9e \u00e0 reviser le jugement d\u2019une premi\u00e8re, il est aussi et depuis longtemps \u00e9tabli. On en trouve l\u2019expression dans Demers v. The Montreal Steam Laundry Company[4]:\n\u2026it is settled law upon which we have often acted here, that where a judgment upon facts has been rendered by a court of first instance, and a first court of appeal has reversed that Judgment, a second court of appeal should interfere with the judgment of the first appeal, only if clearly satisfied that it is erroneous; Symington v. Symington L.R. 2 H.L. Sc. 415.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 la r\u00e8gle suivie en cette Cour et r\u00e9cemment encore appliqu\u00e9e dans Pelletier v. Shykofsky[5]. Ainsi donc, pour intervenir dans cette cause, il faudrait \u00eatre clairement satisfait que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel est erron\u00e9, soit quant \u00e0 la raison motivant son intervention ou quant \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve au dossier. Apr\u00e8s anxieuse consid\u00e9ration, il m\u2019est impossible de former une telle opinion.\nJe rejetterais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts giving rise to this case have been stated in the reasons of my brother Fauteux. The versions of the accident given by the appellant and by the respondent are contradictory. The appellant says that he was struck by the respondent\u2019s automobile while standing beside the left front door of his car, which he was in the process of locking. The respondent describes the accident as follows:\nJ\u2019ai ralenti \u00e0 Marquette, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de continuer. Comme je d\u00e9passais la premi\u00e8re machine j\u2019ai aper\u00e7u cet homme sortir le dos \u00e0 moi entre deux chars. J\u2019ai appliqu\u00e9 les freins, j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 un coup de roue \u00e0 ma gauche, il \u00e9tait trop tard.\n* * * D. Vous dites qu\u2019il avait le dos \u00e0 vous quand vous l\u2019avez frapp\u00e9?\nR. Oui. Il a sorti en sifflant, il sortait entre deux machines.\nD. Quand vous l\u2019avez vu pour la premi\u00e8re fois, vous l\u2019avez vu de dos?\nR. Oui, certainement.\nThe only issue before the learned trial judge was one of fact. He had to decide which version he accepted. He found as follows:\nThe Court accepts the version of Plaintiff supported as it is by the examination on discovery at page 6 when Plaintiff was Defendant\u2019s witness, and by the evidence of Paquin. The keys could only have been in the door if Plaintiff\u2019s version of the accident were correct. The Court does not believe that Defendant and his witnesses perjured themselves but that they were merely mistaken. The damage to the left leg is very light due to the fact that Plaintiff had his left leg slightly behind the right leg, being slightly sideways, and that the automobile struck him on that leg. There is no fault on the part of Plaintiff himself and it remains to assess the damages.\nIt is clear from this finding that he accepted the evidence of the appellant. He found the appellant\u2019s story to be corroborated by the evidence of Paquin as to his finding the keys in the car door, and, accordingly, it is clear that he believed Paquin.\nOn this basis, in my opinion, the case was one with which an appellate tribunal should not have interfered. In the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench there is cited the statement of Casey J. on this point, in Gagnon v. Gauthier[6]:\nThe trial judge who sees and hears the witnesses is better able to assess their credibility and to determine the significance, and in many instances the meaning, of their evidence than are the members of this Court. For this reason his conclusions on the facts must be treated with great respect and his findings must not be interfered with lightly.\nFrom this two things follow: because of the position that he enjoys and of the respect to which his opinion is entitled, the trial judge owes to the parties and to the Court of Appeal the duty of disclosing the reasons that impel him to the conclusions reached; and, when the trial judge renders this type of judgment, this Court will not intervene unless appellant is able to point out a manifest error either in the reasons or in the conclusions.\nAnd here lies the difficulty; for while it is easy to state the rule of no interference without manifest error, it is extremely difficult and very risky to attempt a comprehensive definition of this term. But this much can be said; when an appellant submits evidence that contains contradictions or ambiguities and when, to find reasons to support his version, he is obliged to finecomb the depositions, he is not demonstrating the manifest error that this Court requires.\nAn appellant who asks this Court to reverse a finding of fact must be able to put his fingers on a demonstrable error in the judgment a quo. He has not the right nor should he be permitted to invite this Court to retry the case and, as the result of a process of appreciation and balance, to come to a conclusion different from that of the trial judge.\nAfter citing this passage, the judgment on appeal goes on as follows:\nTelle est la ligne de conduite \u00e0 suivre lorsque le premier juge a donn\u00e9 les raisons qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure comme il l\u2019a fait. Mais lorsqu\u2019il ne donne pas ces raisons en termes suffisamment explicites pour permettre \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019en conna\u00eetre les fondements juridiques et de faits, cette Cour a le devoir de rechercher dans la preuve les raisons qui pouvaient justifier la d\u00e9cision du premier juge et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, celles qui eussent impos\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision contraire; tel est plus particuli\u00e8rement le cas lorsque, ainsi que cela se pr\u00e9sente dans la cause actuelle, le premier juge ne donne pas les raisons ou donne des motifs purement subjectifs et arbitraires pour lesquels il accorde plus de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 aux t\u00e9moignages d\u2019une partie de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ceux de l\u2019autre et ne dit pas, par ailleurs, sur quelles circonstances externes \u00e9tablies par la preuve il s\u2019appuie pour choisir entre deux versions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es.\nDealing with the position of an appellate court in a case involving a conflict of evidence, this Court, in Prudential Trust Company Limited v. Forseth[7], adopted the statement of Sankey L.C. in Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home[8]:\nOn an appeal against a judgment of a judge sitting alone, the Court of Appeal will not set aside the judgment unless the appellant satisfies the Court that the judge was wrong and that his decision ought to have been the other way. Where there has been a conflict of evidence the Court of Appeal will have special regard to the fact that the judge saw the witnesses: see Clarke v. Edinburgh Tramways Co., per Lord Shaw, 1919 S.C. (H.L.) 35, 36, where he says: \u201cWhen a judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence, that judgment is entitled to great respect, and that quite irrespective of whether the Judge makes any observation with regard to credibility or not. I can of course quite understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the Judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses, having seen them and heard them, and does not believe another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a Court of justice. In Courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided; witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their demeanour, in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the eyelid, left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page. What in such circumstances, thus psychologically put, is the duty of an appellate Court? In my opinion, the duty of an appellate Court in those circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, Am I\u2014who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case\u2014in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.\u201d\n(The underlining is my own.)\nIn my opinion, in the present case, the learned trial judge did state reasons for accepting the appellant\u2019s version; i.e., his acceptance of Paquin\u2019s evidence. Even if he had not done so, however, having made his finding of fact, it was incumbent on the present respondent to demonstrate manifest error, to show that he was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d It was not enough for the present respondent \u201cto finecomb the depositions\u201d in order \u201cto find reasons to support his version\u201d.\nIn my opinion that is what the respondent did. The Court below reversed the learned trial judge on the basis of four points, with which I will briefly deal:\n1. The appellant\u2019s injury was to his left knee, and not his right. This point was considered by the learned trial judge, whose conclusion was that this occurred because the appellant was standing slightly sideways, with his left leg slightly behind the other.\n2. There was a discrepancy between the appellant\u2019s estimate as to his distance from the intersection at Marquette Street and that of the police constables who investigated the accident. This distance was not material to the issues in this case. At most this shows an error on the appellant\u2019s part on a matter on which he had no reason, at the time, to have made any exact estimate.\n3. The appellant described at trial how, on leaving hospital by taxi and while on his way home, he had stopped at the garage he owned, and had there seen Paquin. He had not mentioned this stop in his examination for discovery. It is suggested that there is a divergence between the two stories. When, however, one examines the examination for discovery, it is apparent that his departure from the hospital came up only incidentally in answer to a question as to how long he had been there:\nD. Combien de temps avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital?\nR. La premi\u00e8re fois?\nD. Oui. A quel h\u00f4pital avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 d\u2019abord?\nR. A l\u2019H\u00f4pital Notre-Dame.\nD. Vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 pendant combien de temps?\nR. J\u2019ai parti de l\u2019h\u00f4pital pour chez moi \u00e0 cinq (5) heures et demie, six (6) heures, si je ne me trompe pas. J\u2019ai rentr\u00e9 de nouveau le lundi.\n4. The appellant, at the trial, testified that at the garage he had asked one of his employees, Paquin, to go and get his car. He said that at the moment of the accident there was one employee at the garage.\nEarlier at the trial a witness who had been the appellant\u2019s accountant, St-Charles, when asked how many employees the appellant had had prior to April 22, 1961 (the date of the accident), answered that he had one employee, Jean Guy Audet. This witness had been called by the appellant to testify as to the number of persons employed at the garage prior to and after the accident.\nPaquin had testified that he was an employee of the appellant at the time of the accident and had worked for him for two or three months prior to that.\nThe appellant was not cross-examined as to any contradiction between his own and St\u2011Charles\u2019 evidence.\nArguments based upon contradictions in the evidence are a proper basis for urging a trial judge to refuse to accept the version of one or other of the parties. The four points previously discussed were presumably submitted to the learned trial judge, if they were considered to have been of importance. The fact that a trial judge does not, in his reasons, review each point so raised is no ground for assuming that they were not considered. But in reaching his conclusion as to which version of this accident he accepted, the learned trial judge did have the advantage of having seen the witnesses who gave the evidence.\nThis case is very similar to Maze v. Empson[9], which involved a collision between two motor vehicles. The stories of the appellant and the respondent in that case were diametrically opposed. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed the finding of the trial judge in the plaintiff\u2019s favour. After an analysis of the evidence it was concluded that the defendant\u2019s version of the collision was the more likely one. That judgment was reversed in this Court, and the statement of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in Clarke v. Edinburgh and District Tramways, & Co. Ltd., previously cited in these reasons, was applied.\nWith respect, I do not find in this case any basis for holding that there was \u201cmanifest error\u201d in the reasons or conclusions of the learned trial judge, nor for saying that he was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d, to adopt the wording of the passages which I have previously cited.\nAccordingly, in my opinion, this appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored, with costs to the appellant in this Court and in the Court below.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, LE JUGE MARTLAND \u00e9tant dissident.\nProcureurs du demandeur, appelant: Boisvert & Pickel, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9: Bumbray, Carroll, Cardinal & Dansereau, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1966] B.R. 746.\n[2] [1966] B.R. 746.\n[3] [1958] B.R. 401.\n[4] (1897), 27 R.C.S. 537 \u00e0 538.\n[5] [1957] R.C.S. 635.\n[6] [1958] Que.

Le brevet contient des revendications de la substance pr\u00e9par\u00e9e autrement que par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 brevet\u00e9.

The patent contains claims for the product not limited to the drug prepared by the process described. The antibiotic secreted by micro-organisms grown in a culture medium is in a diluted state and not usable in that raw state. An isolation process is required in order to obtain the substance capable of being used for therapeutic purposes. As a defence to the action, it was pleaded that the isolation process, by means of a solvent or by adsorption, described in the patent is a chemical process and, consequently, the claim of the substance prepared otherwise than by the patented process is invalid by virtue of s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. The plaintiff contends that the isolation process is a physical process. The Superior Court held the patent to be invalid. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal which held that the patent and the claim of the substance were valid. The injunction asked for with the action was granted. The defendant company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nAccording to the usual meaning of the expression \u201cchemical process\u201d, the isolation processes described in the patent are chemical processes within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Patent Act and, consequently, the claim by the plaintiff of the substance prepared otherwise than by the patented processes is invalid.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Puddicombe J. Appeal allowed.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant un jugement du Juge Puddicombe. Appel accueilli.\nJoan Clark et Malcolm E. McLeod, pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, appelante.\nChristopher Robinson, c.r., et Samuel Godinsky, c.r., pour la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014La question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider en cette cause est la validit\u00e9 d\u2019un brevet relatif \u00e0 un antibiotique connu sous le nom de chloramph\u00e9nicol ou chloromyc\u00e9tine. Au proc\u00e8s, l\u2019appelante a admis qu\u2019elle faisait la vente de cette substance sous le nom de sopamyc\u00e9tine et l\u2019obtenait de personnes auxquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9livr\u00e9 de permis de fabrication. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a admis que le produit vendu par l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fabriqu\u00e9 selon son proc\u00e9d\u00e9 brevet\u00e9. Vu ces admissions le proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit aux deux moyens de d\u00e9fense suivants. Premi\u00e8rement, Quentin Bartz qui a obtenu le brevet au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, est-il vraiment le seul inventeur comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa demande de brevet? N\u2019a-t-il pas plut\u00f4t parachev\u00e9 une invention faite en partie par d\u2019autres puisqu\u2019il a fait seulement l\u2019identification et l\u2019extraction de l\u2019antibiotique qui se trouvait dans un bouillon de culture (ou \u00abbi\u00e8re\u00bb) pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par d\u2019autres?\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, s\u2019agit-il d\u2019une substance pr\u00e9par\u00e9e ou produite par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques? Si tel est le cas, la revendication de la substance pr\u00e9par\u00e9e autrement que par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 brevet\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est invalide en vertu du para. 1 de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur les brevets.\nEn Cour sup\u00e9rieure, le Juge Puddicombe a accueilli les deux moyens de d\u00e9fense, rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019injonction et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le brevet invalide. En Appel[2], au contraire, les juges Hyde, Rinfret et Choquette ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement d\u2019avis que le brevet et la revendication de la substance \u00e9taient valides et ils ont d\u00e9cern\u00e9 une injonction en cons\u00e9quence pour le reste de la dur\u00e9e du brevet avec r\u00e9serve du recours en dommages.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019historique de l\u2019invention est le suivant. Au cours de recherches m\u00e9thodiques ayant pour objet la d\u00e9couverte de substances bact\u00e9ricides, on a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 dans un milieu appropri\u00e9 une culture d\u2019une esp\u00e8ce de moisissure provenant d\u2019un sol du V\u00e9n\u00e9zu\u00e9la et qu\u2019on a subs\u00e9quemment baptis\u00e9e: \u00abstreptomyces venezuel\u0153\u00bb. Par fermentation avec ce microorganisme dans un milieu nutritif appropri\u00e9, on a obtenu un liquide (\u00abbi\u00e8re A-65\u00bb) dans lequel on a constat\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une activit\u00e9 bact\u00e9ricide. A ce point le produit a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 Bartz qui, par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u2019extraction connus, est parvenu \u00e0 isoler la substance active \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat pur, \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un nouvel antibiotique et \u00e0 en d\u00e9terminer la composition chimique.\nIl est \u00e9tabli clairement que cet antibiotique, le chloramph\u00e9nicol, est s\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par les microorganismes dans le milieu de culture mais il s\u2019y trouve dilu\u00e9, m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses impuret\u00e9s et inutilisable \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat brut. Le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019extraction est indispensable pour obtenir la substance utilisable \u00e0 fins th\u00e9rapeutiques, la preuve le d\u00e9montre et l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a admis devant nous. Par cons\u00e9quent, tout le litige sur la deuxi\u00e8me question se ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la fermentation et l\u2019extraction sont des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques au sens de la Loi sur les brevets comme l\u2019appelante le pr\u00e9tend, alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et ses experts soutiennent que la fermentation est un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 biologique et l\u2019extraction, un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 physique.\nPour disposer du litige il ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher le d\u00e9bat sur la fermentation. Il suffit d\u2019examiner le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019extraction. Celui-ci comprend diverses alternatives. On peut dire que l\u2019une des m\u00e9thodes consiste \u00e0 utiliser des solvants qui ne sont pas miscibles dans l\u2019eau. Une autre consiste \u00e0 utiliser de l\u2019alumine activ\u00e9e ou du charbon activ\u00e9 pour s\u00e9parer le produit des impuret\u00e9s en adsorbant soit les impuret\u00e9s, soit le produit lui-m\u00eame. Dans certains cas, il est n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 une acidification avec un acide min\u00e9ral dilu\u00e9, mais dans d\u2019autres cela ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire. Baer, t\u00e9moin expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a affirm\u00e9 avoir fait l\u2019extraction en provoquant l\u2019adsorption sur le charbon de bois activ\u00e9 sans acidification et en d\u00e9gageant la substance du charbon activ\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019un solvant appropri\u00e9 qui est ensuite \u00e9vapor\u00e9. Parce qu\u2019au terme de ces manipulations qui comprennent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dix \u00e9tapes, la structure chimique du produit reste inchang\u00e9e, les deux experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutiennent qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 physique. Peu importe, disent-ils, que la structure chimique des impuret\u00e9s puisse \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e, celle de la substance recherch\u00e9e ne l\u2019est pas et par cons\u00e9quent il s\u2019agit, soutiennent-ils, d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 physique et non d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique.\nOn peut constater que cette fa\u00e7on de raisonner a pour effet de restreindre le sens de l\u2019expression \u00abproc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique\u00bb \u00e0 celui de proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de synth\u00e8se chimique ou de d\u00e9composition chimique. Au contraire, les experts de l\u2019appelante sont unanimes \u00e0 classer les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u2019extraction par solvant ou par adsorption comme des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques parce qu\u2019ils font appel \u00e0 des substances chimiques et mettent en \u0153uvre leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nDevant nous les deux parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord pour reconna\u00eetre que dans la Loi sur les brevets l\u2019expression \u00abproc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique\u00bb devait \u00eatre prise dans son sens usuel et non pas dans un sens scientifique. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ce qu\u2019implique n\u00e9cessairement la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Continental Soya Co. Ltd. c. J.R. Short Milling Co. Canada Ltd.[3]. On y a decide en somme que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas parce qu\u2019une r\u00e9action chimique se produisait dans l\u2019application d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait le caract\u00e9riser comme un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique. En l\u2019occurrence il s\u2019agissait du blanchiment de la farine de bl\u00e9 par l\u2019addition d\u2019une poudre extraite de f\u00e8ves soya par mouture. On a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique m\u00eame si une r\u00e9action chimique se produisait comme il s\u2019en produit dans toutes sortes d\u2019op\u00e9rations usuelles, tels que la fabrication du pain et les processus biologiques ordinaires que personne ne classe comme des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques dans le langage usuel.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, tout en admettant ainsi qu\u2019une manipulation n\u2019est pas un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique au sens de la loi du seul fait qu\u2019une r\u00e9action chimique s\u2019y produit, soutient cependant que s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas une r\u00e9action chimique modifiant la structure chimique du produit lui-m\u00eame, il n\u2019y a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique. A vrai dire, cette assertion repose uniquement sur l\u2019opinion des deux experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, opinion que l\u2019on a fait porter, tout comme celle de deux des experts de l\u2019appelante, sur la question m\u00eame qu\u2019il appartient aux tribunaux de juger, savoir: qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique au sens de la Loi sur les brevets?\nCette question n\u2019en \u00e9tant pas une de vocabulaire scientifique ne peut pas \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par la seule consid\u00e9ration des opinions d\u2019experts sur ce vocabulaire et les concepts qui s\u2019y rattachent. Nous n\u2019avons pas besoin de d\u00e9cider lesquels des experts de l\u2019appelante ou de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont raison, ceux qui affirment que scientifiquement c\u2019est un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique ou ceux qui le nient. Celui-l\u00e0 seul qui des cinq experts ayant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans cette cause s\u2019en est tenu au strict point de vue scientifique, le Dr Spencer, a expliqu\u00e9 que suivant les conceptions actuelles, les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de fermentation sont du domaine de la biochimie et les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u2019extraction par adsorption ou par solvant, du domaine de la chimie physique. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne d\u2019adsorption est non seulement un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique mais un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qui implique une r\u00e9action chimique. De m\u00eame il consid\u00e8re les extractions par solvant comme des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e9action chimique et cela pour le motif que, dans ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, l\u2019on utilise les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s chimiques d\u2019un produit chimique. Il est un fait que les experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ont pu nier, c\u2019est que les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s dont il s\u2019agit sont des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de laboratoire de chimie, des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de ce que Baer lui-m\u00eame a appel\u00e9 \u00abpreparative chemistry\u00bb. Questionn\u00e9 sur ce que l\u2019on devait entendre par \u00abchemisorption\u00bb, terme employ\u00e9 par ceux qui consid\u00e8rent l\u2019adsorption comme un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne chimique, il a r\u00e9pondu:\nThe word chemisorption implies, as I understand it, a type of chemical bonding of some material to an adsorbing surface, but this term is applied rather rarely and I must say I never read it in ordinary laboratory practice in organic chemistry, in preparative chemistry when I make use of these physical methods.\nIl n\u2019est pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019observer qu\u2019en Grande-Bretagne le Solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral si\u00e9geant en appel du Directeur des brevets a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la distillation fractionn\u00e9e \u00e9tait un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique tout comme un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de fabrication du charbon activ\u00e9. R.R.\u2019s Application[4]; H.E.P.\u2019s Application[5].\nIl convient aussi de noter qu\u2019en Suisse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a obtenu du bureau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en 1950, sur sa demande d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en ao\u00fbt 1948, un brevet intitul\u00e9: \u00abProc\u00e9d\u00e9 de pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un nouvel antibiotique\u00bb et comportant la revendication suivante:\nProc\u00e9d\u00e9 de pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un nouvel antibiotique, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 en ce qu\u2019on inocule un milieu nutritif avec le \u00abStreptomyces venezuelae\u00bb, en ce qu\u2019on fait incuber le m\u00e9lange en a\u00e9robiose et en ce qu\u2019on s\u00e9pare du milieu nutritif le produit antibiotique form\u00e9.\nOr la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale suisse sur les brevets d\u2019invention d\u00e9cr\u00e8te \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2:\nNe peuvent \u00eatre brevet\u00e9es:\n\u2026\n2\u00b0 Les inventions de rem\u00e8des et les inventions de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s non chimiques pour la fabrication de rem\u00e8des; \u2026\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, en demandant le brevet suisse, se trouvait donc \u00e0 soutenir qu\u2019au sens de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale suisse le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de fermentation et d\u2019extraction est un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique. Cela n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas aussi d\u00e9cisif que l\u2019admission d\u2019utilit\u00e9 pratique d\u00e9coulant de la demande de brevet faite aux \u00c9tats-Unis qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par cette Cour dans Parke, Davis & Company c. Empire Laboratories Limited[6]. En effet on peut supposer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulait se pr\u00e9munir contre une d\u00e9cision adverse sur sa r\u00e9clamation du produit dans d\u2019autres pays; si, par malheur, on d\u00e9cidait contre elle que cette r\u00e9clamation \u00e9tait invalide parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique, elle aurait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9tenir au moins un brevet pour le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans les pays o\u00f9, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, un brevet pour le produit ne peut \u00eatre obtenu. Il n\u2019en reste pas moins que la demande de brevet suisse d\u00e9montre que, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il faut l\u2019affirmer pour obtenir un brevet, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 soutenir qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique. Cela n\u2019est donc pas insoutenable comme ses experts l\u2019ont affirm\u00e9.\nPour ces raisons il faut conclure que, selon le sens usuel de l\u2019expression \u00abproc\u00e9d\u00e9 chimique\u00bb, les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u2019extraction d\u00e9crits dans le brevet dont il s\u2019agit sont des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques au sens du para. 1 de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur les brevets et, par cons\u00e9quent, la revendication num\u00e9ro 7 du brevet canadien num\u00e9ro 479,333 est invalide. Comme cela suffit \u00e0 disposer de la cause, il ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer sur l\u2019autre moyen. Cela n\u2019implique aucunement que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel sur cet autre moyen est tenue pour bien fond\u00e9e.\nDans les circonstances, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accorder \u00e0 l\u2019appelante tous les frais de l\u2019appel y compris ceux de la motion pour suspension de l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019injonction. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour avec d\u00e9pens, frais de motion compris, j\u2019infirmerais le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec et r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure avec d\u00e9pens en Cour d\u2019appel contre la pr\u00e9sente intim\u00e9e.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, appelante: Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse intim\u00e9e: Greenblatt, Godinsky & Resin, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1967] B.R. 975.\n[2] [1967] B.R. 975.\n[3] [1942] R.C.S. 187, 2 Fox Pat.

Ce transport a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 et publi\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1571d du Code civil et un pr\u00e9avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et publi\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 88 de la Loi sur les banques, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 48. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 faisant le commerce d\u2019escompte, s\u2019est fait consentir par la d\u00e9bitrice en diverses circonstances des transports particuliers de cr\u00e9ances. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 payait le montant escompt\u00e9 des cr\u00e9ances par ch\u00e8que \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de la d\u00e9bitrice et de la banque conjointement. Il est en preuve que la d\u00e9bitrice a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement fourni \u00e0 la banque au moment o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9posait chaque ch\u00e8que une liste des comptes faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019op\u00e9ration. Il est \u00e9galement en preuve que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la banque v\u00e9rifiaient ces listes et retranchaient le montant des comptes qui y \u00e9taient inscrits du montant des comptes recevables d\u00e9clar\u00e9s par la d\u00e9bitrice. Subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 la mise en faillite de la d\u00e9bitrice, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire de certains comptes recevables d\u00e9crits dans deux listes. Le syndic de la faillite ayant rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation, un appel fut log\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en mati\u00e8re de faillite. Seule la banque a produit une contestation. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et la Cour d\u2019appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement. La banque en appela \u00e0 cette Cour avec la permission pr\u00e9vue par la Loi sur la faillite.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa banque ne pouvait pas envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutenir que les comptes en question lui appartenaient. En n\u00e9gociant les ch\u00e8ques de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sachant pertinemment qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient la consid\u00e9ration du transport de cr\u00e9ances de la d\u00e9bitrice, la banque, \u00e9tant l\u2019une des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des ch\u00e8ques, acceptait implicitement que ces cr\u00e9ances soient c\u00e9d\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019ensemble de la preuve d\u00e9montre que la banque avait une connaissance parfaite de chacune des op\u00e9rations et v\u00e9rifiait au fur et \u00e0 mesure le montant de chacune des cr\u00e9ances transport\u00e9es et en d\u00e9duisait la somme du total des dettes actives de la d\u00e9bitrice. Rien dans la preuve ne saurait invalider l\u2019effet de ce consentement implicitement donn\u00e9.\nBanks and banking\u2014Moneys advanced by a bank and by a discount corporation\u2014General assignment by the debtor to the bank of all accounts receivable\u2014Specific assignment to the corporation of certain accounts receivable\u2014Security under s. 88 of the Bank Act\u2014Debtor in bankruptcy\u2014Claim by the corporation that it is the owner of a list of accounts\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1570 et seq.\u2014Bank Act, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 48, s. 88\u2014Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14.\nIn 1958, the debtor assigned to the appellant bank all its accounts receivable. This assignment was registered and published pursuant to art. 1571d of the Civil Code and the notice as provided for in s. 88 of the Bank Act, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 48, was given and published. The respondent, a discount corporation, obtained from time to time from the debtor specific assignments of book debts. The payment of the discounted amount of the debts was made by the corporation by cheques to the order of the debtor and of the bank jointly. It is established that the bank was regularly furnished by the debtor with a list of accounts covered by the cheques. It is also established that the bank\u2019s employees verified these lists and substracted the amount of the accounts therein inscribed from the amount of the accounts receivable as declared by the debtor. After the debtor became bankrupt, the respondent corporation filed a claim for certain accounts receivable. The claim was rejected by the trustee, and an appeal was launched to the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy. Only the bank filed a contestation. The Superior Court allowed the respondent\u2019s claim. This judgment was affirmed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. The bank appealed to this Court with leave as provided for in the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Bank could not claim the ownership of these accounts as against the respondent corporation. By negotiating the respondent\u2019s cheques, knowing pertinently that they had been given as a consideration for the assignment of the debts, the bank, as one of the beneficiaries of the cheques, accepted implicitly that these debts be assigned to the respondent corporation. The whole of the evidence shows that the bank had a perfect knowledge of each of the transactions and verified the amount of each of these assigned debts and deducted that sum from the total of the active debts of the debtor. There was nothing in the evidence which could invalidate the effect of this consent implicitly given.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of Meunier J.

Boulton, c.r., pour l\u2019appelante.\nJ.P. Bergeron, c.r., et P.E. Blain, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014Dans cette affaire l\u2019intim\u00e9e, General Factors Ltd., (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00abFactors\u00bb) a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 du syndic de la faillite d\u2019Aluminum Door and Window Co. Ltd. (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00abAldor\u00bb) une s\u00e9rie de comptes recevables d\u00e9crits dans deux listes formant un total de $122,341.94 et $8,452.18 respectivement. Le syndic a donn\u00e9 un avis de rejet de la r\u00e9clamation au motif que la d\u00e9bitrice avait, le 26 juillet 1958, c\u00e9d\u00e9 tous ses comptes recevables, pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir, \u00e0 la Banque Canadienne de Commerce, maintenant la Banque Canadienne Imp\u00e9riale de Commerce, (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00abla Banque\u00bb).\nL\u00e0-dessus, Factors a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en mati\u00e8re de faillite. Le syndic n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 la requ\u00eate par laquelle cet appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9 mais une contestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par la Banque qui \u00e9tait mise en cause. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et la Banque seule a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine2. Celle-ci ayant confirm\u00e9 par un arr\u00eat majoritaire, la Banque a form\u00e9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour avec la permission pr\u00e9vue par la Loi sur la faillite. Les deux mis-en-cause sont le syndic et l\u2019agent charg\u00e9 de la perception des comptes en litige.\nIl est constant que la d\u00e9bitrice a, d\u00e8s 1958, transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque tous ses comptes recevables et que ce transport a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, enregistr\u00e9 et publi\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1571d du Code civil. De plus, le 30 novembre 1959, un pr\u00e9avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et publi\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 88 de la Loi sur les banques et le 2 d\u00e9cembre un contrat relatif \u00e0 ce genre de garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, suivi ult\u00e9rieurement de garanties visant toute la marchandise.\nQuant \u00e0 Factors, elle s\u2019est fait consentir par Aldor en diverses circonstances des transports particuliers des cr\u00e9ances en litige. Ces transports ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 faits moyennant le paiement comptant par Factors du montant des cr\u00e9ances moins un escompte de 15 pour cent ou de 20 pour cent. Dans tous les cas, le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par ch\u00e8que \u00e0 l\u2019ordre d\u2019Aldor et de la Banque conjointement. La preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement qu\u2019Aldor a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement fourni \u00e0 la Banque, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elle d\u00e9posait chaque ch\u00e8que de Factors ou peu apr\u00e8s, une liste des comptes faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019op\u00e9ration. Il est \u00e9galement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Banque v\u00e9rifiaient ces listes et retranchaient le montant des comptes qui y \u00e9taient inscrits du montant des comptes recevables d\u00e9clar\u00e9s par Aldor. Dans ces conditions, la Banque peut\u2011elle envers Factors soutenir que les comptes lui appartiennent?\nEn premier lieu, on pr\u00e9tend que Factors n\u2019a pas fait de paiement \u00e0 la Banque parce que les ch\u00e8ques dont il s\u2019agit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au cr\u00e9dit du compte courant d\u2019Aldor et non pas au cr\u00e9dit de son compte d\u2019emprunt. Pour juger du bien fond\u00e9 de cette pr\u00e9tention, il suffit de se demander si la Banque serait recevable \u00e0 l\u2019invoquer envers un d\u00e9biteur d\u2019Aldor qui aurait acquitt\u00e9 sa dette au moyen d\u2019un ch\u00e8que fait de cette fa\u00e7on. La Banque pourrait-elle dire \u00e0 ce d\u00e9biteur \u00abla cr\u00e9ance m\u2019appartient et ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 moi mais \u00e0 Aldor que vous avez fait remise\u00bb. Le procureur de l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas os\u00e9 le soutenir devant nous. En effet, il est \u00e9vident que la Banque \u00e9tant l\u2019une des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du ch\u00e8que celui-ci ne peut \u00eatre valablement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 sans son concours. En permettant qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit de l\u2019autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, elle en dispose tout aussi effectivement que si elle jugeait \u00e0 propos de l\u2019encaisser \u00e0 son profit avec l\u2019endossement de l\u2019autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Autrement dit, lorsque les deux personnes \u00e0 l\u2019ordre desquelles un effet de commerce a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis s\u2019entendent pour l\u2019endosser et en disposer, chacune d\u2019elles participe \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration. Si ce principe doit recevoir son application dans le cas o\u00f9 le ch\u00e8que est donn\u00e9 par le d\u00e9biteur d\u2019une cr\u00e9ance qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un transport en garantie, o\u00f9 est la raison d\u2019en d\u00e9cider autrement dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019effet de commerce est donn\u00e9 par le cessionnaire de la cr\u00e9ance au lieu de l\u2019\u00eatre par le d\u00e9biteur? En n\u00e9gociant les ch\u00e8ques de Factors sachant pertinemment qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient la consid\u00e9ration du transport de cr\u00e9ances d\u2019Aldor, la Banque acceptait implicitement qu\u2019elles soient c\u00e9d\u00e9es \u00e0 Factors, tout comme dans Hurly c. Bank of Nova Scotia[3] cette banque prenant au cr\u00e9dit de son client le ch\u00e8que donn\u00e9 en paiement d\u2019un certain nombre de t\u00eates de b\u00e9tail \u00e0 elle transport\u00e9es, consentait implicitement que la vente lui en soit opposable.\nEn second lieu, on affirme que la Banque ne savait pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du transport du prix de contrats obtenus par Aldor mais croyait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de cr\u00e9ances reconnues par billet ou par ch\u00e8que postdat\u00e9. Cette pr\u00e9tention est fond\u00e9e sur le t\u00e9moignage du g\u00e9rant de la Banque, mais, ni la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, ni la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019Appel, n\u2019y ont ajout\u00e9 foi. Rien ne saurait nous justifier d\u2019en venir \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente car l\u2019ensemble de la preuve d\u00e9montre que la Banque avait une connaissance parfaite de chacune des op\u00e9rations et v\u00e9rifiait au fur et \u00e0 mesure le montant de chacune des cr\u00e9ances transport\u00e9es et en d\u00e9duisait la somme du total des dettes actives d\u2019Aldor. Le g\u00e9rant pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019on faisait cela uniquement pour d\u00e9terminer la marge de cr\u00e9dit et qu\u2019il n\u2019entendait pas permettre \u00e0 Aldor d\u2019escompter des cr\u00e9ances qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas reconnues par un effet de commerce. Cette distinction ne saurait tenir. Tout d\u2019abord les droits de la Banque \u00e9taient les m\u00eames \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux cat\u00e9gories de cr\u00e9ances. Le transport de 1958 vise explicitement non seulement les cr\u00e9ances, mais aussi les effets de commerce ou billets donn\u00e9s pour ces cr\u00e9ances. En supposant que le g\u00e9rant de la Banque aurait cru erron\u00e9ment que les transports consentis \u00e0 Factors visaient des cr\u00e9ances reconnues par effets n\u00e9gociables alors qu\u2019il n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas ainsi, cette erreur ne saurait invalider l\u2019effet du consentement implicitement donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration en permettant que les ch\u00e8ques de Factors soient encaiss\u00e9s.\nIl faut faire une semblable observation en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argument que l\u2019on tire de la r\u00e9ponse adress\u00e9e par le g\u00e9rant de la Banque \u00e0 une lettre de Factors en date du 25 juillet 1962. Dans cette lettre, on lui demandait de reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019\u00e0 la condition de faire les ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019ordre d\u2019Aldor et de la Banque conjointement, Factors obtenait un bon titre aux cr\u00e9ances n\u00e9goci\u00e9es, nonobstant le transport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de cr\u00e9ances et la garantie sous l\u2019art. 88 de la Loi sur les banques ant\u00e9rieurement consentis en faveur de la Banque. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, le g\u00e9rant tout en refusant de donner l\u2019assurance sollicit\u00e9e, d\u00e9clare que ses conversations avec M. Galet, l\u2019administrateur de Factors, avaient eu trait \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019appui accord\u00e9 par Factors \u00e0 Aldor pouvait continuer \u00e0 all\u00e9ger les difficult\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re. Il est bien \u00e9vident que Factors ne pouvait pas continuer \u00e0 aider Aldor autrement qu\u2019en continuant \u00e0 escompter des cr\u00e9ances; nulle part le g\u00e9rant de la Banque ne sugg\u00e8re que Factors faisait d\u2019autres op\u00e9rations que celle-l\u00e0. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9quivoque qu\u2019implique le refus d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse claire, la lettre implique une reconnaissance par le g\u00e9rant de la Banque de son consentement \u00e0 la poursuite d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u2019escompte entre Factors et Aldor. Du reste, comme on l\u2019a vu, ce consentement s\u2019inf\u00e8re n\u00e9cessairement du fait capital qu\u2019est la participation continuelle \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation des ch\u00e8ques.\nOn a ensuite invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du transport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de cr\u00e9ances consenti \u00e0 Factors par Aldor le 19 juillet 1962. Il est indubitable que l\u2019une des publications requises par l\u2019art. 1571d du Code civil n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Toutefois, m\u00eame si cela rend ce transport sans effet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers, cela ne saurait avoir aucune influence sur la validit\u00e9 des transports particuliers. De toute fa\u00e7on, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Banque, le transport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est sans valeur puisqu\u2019il est de plusieurs ann\u00e9es post\u00e9rieur au sien. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le transport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne saurait pr\u00e9senter d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que pour des cr\u00e9ances qui n\u2019auraient pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un transport particulier mais ce cas ne se soul\u00e8ve pas; toutes les cr\u00e9ances en litige sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9es en vertu de transports particuliers. Il est inutile de s\u2019interroger sur la suffisance de la preuve de la signification de ces transports par des copies de lettres adress\u00e9es par Factors aux d\u00e9biteurs, ni sur la validit\u00e9 de ce mode de signification car le litige n\u2019est pas entre le cessionnaire et un tiers, mais entre le cessionnaire et la v\u00e9ritable c\u00e9dante, la Banque. (Art. 1570 et 1571 c.c.).\nCela dispose \u00e9galement du dernier moyen invoqu\u00e9 par la Banque, savoir le fait qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la faillite d\u2019Aldor, des marchandises d\u2019une valeur d\u2019environ $9,000 ont servi \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de contrats dont le prix avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 Factors. \u00c9videmment ces marchandises appartenaient \u00e0 la Banque en vertu de sa garantie sous l\u2019art. 88 de la Loi sur les banques et elle soutient qu\u2019elle doit avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des cr\u00e9ances d\u00e9coulant de leur utilisation \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 sa d\u00e9bitrice avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019en avoir la possession. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cet argument, c\u2019est que la Banque \u00e9tant, par la n\u00e9gociation des ch\u00e8ques, devenue partie \u00e0 la cession du prix des contrats avant leur ex\u00e9cution, devait subir la cons\u00e9quence de la garantie de l\u2019existence des cr\u00e9ances envers Factors, si les marchandises n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es pour parachever l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des contrats, Factors aurait eu droit de r\u00e9clamer de la Banque sinon le prix des contrats, du moins le remboursement du montant vers\u00e9 en consid\u00e9ration du transport de cr\u00e9ances inexistantes. (Art. 1510 et 1576 c.c.).\nPour ces motifs l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: Lafleur & Brown, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Blain, Pich\u00e9, Bergeron, Godbout & Emery, Montr\u00e9al\n[1] [1966] B.R. 994.\n[2] [1966] B.R. 994.\n[3] [1966] R.C.S. 83, 54 D.L.R.

La Commission des Relations de Travail a alors substitu\u00e9 le nom du nouvel employeur au certificat de reconnaissance syndicale. Trois jours apr\u00e8s, une seconde union a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019\u00eatre reconnue comme repr\u00e9sentante de presque tous les autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019opposa \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et a pr\u00e9tendu que par l\u2019effet de la loi et de la d\u00e9cision de substitution de la Commission tous ses employ\u00e9s, et non pas seulement ceux de la compagnie absorb\u00e9e, \u00e9taient couverts par le m\u00eame certificat de reconnaissance syndicale alors existant. La Commission, sous la signature de son vice-pr\u00e9sident, rejeta cette contestation et accorda l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation. All\u00e9guant que la Commission avait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction, la compagnie intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 un bref de prohibition et a soulev\u00e9 les trois points suivants: (i) violation de la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem; (ii) revision ou modification ill\u00e9gale de la d\u00e9cision substituant le nom du nouvel employeur; et (iii) d\u00e9cision ultra vires parce que rendue par un vice-pr\u00e9sident agissant seul dans un cas o\u00f9 il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un litige intersyndical. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais cette d\u00e9cision fut infirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel. D\u2019o\u00f9 le pourvoi de la Commission devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli.\nSur le premier point. La r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem n\u2019implique pas qu\u2019il doit toujours \u00eatre accord\u00e9 une audition. L\u2019obligation est de fournir aux parties l\u2019occasion de faire valoir leurs moyens. Se trouvant suffisamment renseign\u00e9e par les plaidoiries \u00e9crites, les pi\u00e8ces produites et ses propres enqu\u00eates, la Commission pouvait raisonnablement juger, dans les circonstances,. qu\u2019elle pouvait et devait, sans plus d\u2019atermoiement, rendre sa d\u00e9cision.\nSur le second point. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission substituant le nom du nouvel employeur n\u2019avait pas eu pour effet, comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu l\u2019intim\u00e9e, d\u2019\u00e9tendre le certificat \u2018 alors existant \u00e0 tous les autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En cons\u00e9quence, en accr\u00e9ditant la seconde union, la Commission n\u2019a pas revis\u00e9 ou r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure. M\u00eame s\u2019il fallait tenir pour erron\u00e9es l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la port\u00e9e diff\u00e9rentes que la Commission assigne \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision de substituer le nom du nouvel employeur, cette erreur ne saurait donner ouverture au recours par prohibition, ne serait-ce qu\u2019en raison du fait que la Commission avait juridiction pour consid\u00e9rer et d\u00e9cider cette question particuli\u00e8re et qu\u2019on ne perd pas la juridiction qu\u2019on poss\u00e8de du fait qu\u2019en l\u2019exer\u00e7ant, on puisse, de bonne foi, commettre une erreur.\nSur le troisi\u00e8me point. Manifestement, il n\u2019y avait ici qu\u2019un litige intersyndical puisque la question soumise \u00e0 la Commission \u00e9tait de savoir laquelle des deux unions avait droit \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation. Le conflit devait alors \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en l\u2019occurrence par le vice-pr\u00e9sident seul. On ne peut pas pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019en exer\u00e7ant cette juridiction, le vice-pr\u00e9sident s\u2019est abstenu de faire ce que la loi l\u2019obligeait de faire. Il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 s\u2019y \u00eatre conform\u00e9.\nLabour\u2014Certification\u2014Purchase of assets of a company by another\u2014Merger of the two plants and their employees\u2014Board substituting the name of the purchaser on the certificate of recognition\u2014Application by second union to represent all other employees\u2014Writ of prohibition\u2014Whether inter-union process\u2014Sittings and decisions of the Board\u2014Labour Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, ss. 21, 36, 103, 107, 108, 115, 118.\nFollowing the purchase of the assets of a company by the respondent company, the two plants were merged and the employees of the purchased company\u2014who had formed an association of employees and were represented by a union holding a certificate of recognition\u2014became the employees of the purchaser, the respondent company. The name of the respondent company was substituted by the Labour Relations Board as the employer on the certificate. Three days later, a second union applied to the Board for recognition as representative of all the other employees of the respondent. The latter opposed the application and contended that by virtue of the Code and of the Board\u2019s substitution order all its employees, and not only those of the purchased company, were covered by the same certificate of recognition. The Board\u2019s decision, signed by its vice-president alone, rejected this contention and granted certification. Alleging that the Board had exceeded its jurisdiction, the respondent applied for a writ of prohibition and raised the following issues: (i) violation of the rule audi alteram partem; (ii) unlawful revision or modification of the Board\u2019s prior substitution order; (iii) the decision was ultra vires because it had been made by a vice\u2011president alone in a case which was not an inter-union process. The Superior Court dismissed the respondent\u2019s application, but that judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The Board appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be allowed.\nOn the first issue. The rule audi alteram partem does not imply that a hearing must always be held. The obligation is to grant to the parties an opportunity to present their case. The Board was sufficiently informed by the written pleadings, the documents produced and its own inquiries to reasonably hold that, in the circumstances, it should render its decision without further delay.\nOn the second issue. The Board\u2019s substitution order did not, as contended by the respondent, have the effect of extending the existing certificate to all the other employees of the respondent. Consequently, by issuing the subsequent certificate, the Board did not revise or revoke its earlier decision. But even if the Board erred in so interpreting its substitution order, this error was not open to prohibition. The Board had jurisdiction to consider and decide the question and could not lose that jurisdiction because of a possible error committed in good faith.\nOn the third issue. Obviously, this was an inter-union process since the question submitted to the Board was as to which one of the two unions was entitled to certification. In the present case, this conflict had to be decided by the vice-president alone. It could not be presumed that in exercising that jurisdiction, the vice-president failed to comply with the law. The contrary must be presumed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Chief Justice Dorion.

Apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et annula le bref \u00e9mis. Port\u00e9e en appel, cette d\u00e9cision fut infirm\u00e9e et la Cour d\u2019appel[2] accorda, en partie, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. D\u2019o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nVoici, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les faits donnant lieu \u00e0 ce litige entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ci-apr\u00e8s aussi appel\u00e9es la Commission et la compagnie-intim\u00e9e respectivement.\nEn novembre 1964, il existait \u00e0 Sherbrooke deux usines, situ\u00e9es tout pr\u00e8s Tune de l\u2019autre, dont l\u2019une, celle de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 375, rue Courcelette et l\u2019autre, celle de Sherbrooke Machineries Limited, \u00e0 880 Randrill. Le 21 novembre 1964, la compagnie-intim\u00e9e se porta acqu\u00e9reur de l\u2019actif de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. Comme cons\u00e9quence de cette transaction, les deux usines furent fusionn\u00e9es, les employ\u00e9s de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. se trouv\u00e8rent plac\u00e9s sous le contr\u00f4le et la direction de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, ils en devinrent les employ\u00e9s et leurs noms furent port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa liste de paye; enfin, les bureaux de comptabilit\u00e9 et d\u2019achats des deux usines furent fusionn\u00e9s en un seul et leurs produits furent mis sur le march\u00e9 par la compagnie-intim\u00e9e. Avant la fusion, l\u2019usine de celle-ci comprenait sept divisions et apr\u00e8s la fusion, on d\u00e9signa l\u2019usine de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. comme division n\u00b0 8. A l\u2019\u00e9poque de cette transaction du 21 novembre, les employ\u00e9s de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd., contrairement \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait le cas pour les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, \u00e9taient group\u00e9s en association et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, en fait, par l\u2019Association Internationale des Machinistes, loge 866, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e l\u2019Union des Machinistes. Celle-ci d\u00e9tenait un certificat de reconnaissance syndicale qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis en octobre 1953 sous le nom de \u00abAssociation Internationale des Machinistes\u00bb et qui, par la suite, fut modifi\u00e9, en ao\u00fbt 1957, pour y ajouter \u00abloge 866\u00bb. L\u2019Union des Machinistes avait n\u00e9goci\u00e9 et sign\u00e9 avec Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. la convention collective qui \u00e9tait en vigueur lors de la fusion et qui devait le demeurer jusqu\u2019au 4 novembre 1966. Deux jours apr\u00e8s la fusion, la compagnie-intim\u00e9e demanda \u00e0 la Commission de substituer, au certificat de reconnaissance syndicale, son nom \u00e0 celui de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. Ayant constat\u00e9 le fait de la fusion et le fait que l\u2019Union des Machinistes n\u2019avait aucune objection \u00e0 cette demande pourvu que les droits que lui assuraient le Code du Travail et la convention collective soient sauvegard\u00e9s, la Commission fit droit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate par une d\u00e9cision, rendue le 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964 en conformit\u00e9 avec les dispositions des arts. 36 et 37 du Code du Travail, dont le dispositif est en ces termes:\nLa Commission d\u00e9cide de changer, partout o\u00f9 elle se trouve, au certificat et \u00e0 ses amendements, la d\u00e9signation de l\u2019employeur, par la suivante:\nCanadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. Ltd.\u2014corps politique et incorpor\u00e9, ayant son si\u00e8ge social dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nTrois jours apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964, soit le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1964, les M\u00e9tallurgistes Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, local 6670, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9s l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes, demandaient \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019\u00eatre reconnus comme repr\u00e9sentants de presque tous les salari\u00e9s de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e dont l\u2019adresse indiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande \u00e9tait 375, rue Courcelette, \u00e0 Sherbrooke. La Commission informa la compagnie-intim\u00e9e de cette requ\u00eate, la pria de pr\u00e9parer un relev\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de tous les salari\u00e9s \u00e0 son emploi depuis le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1964, l\u2019avisa que sous peu ses enqu\u00eateurs se pr\u00e9senteraient pour v\u00e9rifier ce relev\u00e9 et l\u2019invita \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, dans un d\u00e9lai de sept jours, toutes repr\u00e9sentations qu\u2019elle pouvait juger \u00e0 propos de soumettre. La compagnie-intim\u00e9e s\u2019opposa \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Dans une contestation \u00e9crite, en date du 5 janvier 1965, elle soumit, en substance, que par l\u2019effet de la loi et de la d\u00e9cision rendue le 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964 par la Commission, tous les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e et non pas seulement ceux qui, avant la fusion, travaillaient pour Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd., \u00e9taient d\u00e9sormais membres de la m\u00eame unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation et couverts par le m\u00eame certificat de reconnaissance syndicale d\u00e9tenu par l\u2019Union des Machinistes et qu\u2019au surplus, l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes ne repr\u00e9sentait pas la majorit\u00e9 absolue de ses employ\u00e9s en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1964. A ceci, l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes r\u00e9pondit par \u00e9crit, le 15 janvier 1965, que la d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964, rendue par la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du certificat d\u00e9tenu par l\u2019Union des Machinistes, n\u2019avait pas eu pour effet d\u2019\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e juridique de ce certificat, non plus que la port\u00e9e juridique et la juridiction de la convention collective de travail intervenue entre l\u2019Union des Machinistes et Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. et que les droits et la situation des employ\u00e9s de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, travaillant aux \u00e9tablissements de la rue Courcelette; n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s par cette d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre. Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le dossier, tenu compte des pi\u00e8ces et de ses propres enqu\u00eates, l\u00e0 Commission rendit le 30 mars 1965, sous la signature de son vice-pr\u00e9sident, le juge G\u00e9rard Vaillancourt, la d\u00e9cision qui donna lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, l\u00e0 Commission rappelle que les salari\u00e9s que l\u2019Union des Machinistes \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter, par le certificat de reconnaissance syndicale \u00e9mis en sa faveur, \u00e9taient les salari\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. et elle d\u00e9clare que son ordonnance du 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964, rendue en vertu de l\u2019art. 37 du Code du Travail,\u2019 n\u2019avait pour fins que d\u00e9 changer, au certificat, le nom de l\u2019employeur et non d\u2019\u00e9tendre la juridiction de l\u2019Union des Machinistes \u00e0 tous l\u00e8s salari\u00e9s des sept Divisions dont \u00e9tait form\u00e9e l\u2019usine de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e avant la fusion. Elle ajoute qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de juridiction, sur une simple requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 36 du Code du Travail, d\u2019\u00e9largir ou d\u2019augmenter le groupe vis\u00e9 au certificat et que si l\u2019Union des Machinistes voulait couvrir, en plus des salari\u00e9s y mentionn\u00e9s, ceux de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e \u00e0 375, rue Courcelette, elle devait, conform\u00e9ment aux prescriptions de la section II du Code du Travail, pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en accr\u00e9ditation. Quant au m\u00e9rite de l\u00e0 demande en accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes, la Commission jugea (i) que le groupe de salari\u00e9s envers lequel il y avait lieu, apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, de consid\u00e9rer cette demande, \u00e9tait ce groupe de salari\u00e9s travaillant \u00e0 l\u2019usine de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e \u00e0 375, rue Courcelette, \u00e0 Sherbrooke, except\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s de bureau, les modeleurs (pattern makers), les gardiens (watchmen) et les salari\u00e9s travaillant \u00e0 l\u2019usine de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 880, rue Randrill, Sherbrooke, et \u00e9tant autrefois l\u2019usine de Sherbrooke Machineries Limited et (ii) que l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes repr\u00e9sentait la majorit\u00e9 de ce groupe. La Commission accueill\u00eet l\u00e0 requ\u00eate d\u00e9 l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes, lui accorda l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation envers le groupe ci-haut d\u00e9fini et lui d\u00e9cerna un certificat \u00e0 cet effet.\nAu soutien de sa requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour faire d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019en rendant cette d\u00e9cision, la Commission a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes questions que M. l\u00e9 juge en chef Dorion, saisi de l\u2019affaire, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9es en trois points:\u2014(i) violation de la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem; (ii) revision ou modification ill\u00e9gale de la d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964; et (iii) d\u00e9cision ultra vires parce que rendue par un vice-pr\u00e9sident agissant seul dans un cas o\u00f9 il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un litige intersyndical.\nSur le premier point:\u2014Le grief de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e se fonde sur le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019audition formelle. Comme cette Cour l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment dans Komo Construction Inc. et les Constructions du St-Laurent Limit\u00e9e v. Commission des Relations de Travail du Qu\u00e9bec et les M\u00e9tallurgistes Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, Local 6861[3], la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem n\u2019implique pas qu\u2019il doit toujours \u00eatre accord\u00e9e une audition. L\u2019obligation est de fournir aux parties l\u2019occasion de faire valoir leurs moyens. A mon avis, rien dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne permet d\u2019affirmer que la Commission devait n\u00e9cessairement juger que la compagnie-intim\u00e9e ne pouvait faire valoir les deux points soulev\u00e9s par elle au soutien de sa contestation de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes sans la tenue imp\u00e9raitive d\u2019une audition. D\u2019autre part et \u00e0 venir jusqu\u2019au jour o\u00f9 la Commission rendit sa d\u00e9cision, ni la compagnie-intim\u00e9e ou autre partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e n\u2019avait indiqu\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir d\u2019une audition formelle. Ce n\u2019est que dans une r\u00e9plique portant la date m\u00eame de la d\u00e9cision attaqu\u00e9e et produite plus de six semaines apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai additionnel que la Commission lui avait accord\u00e9 pour produire cette r\u00e9plique, que la compagnie-intim\u00e9e exprima ce d\u00e9sir. Manifestement, cette demande d\u2019audition ne fut pas faite en temps utile. La diligence que la Commission doit, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la paix industrielle, des employeurs, des employ\u00e9s et du public, apporter \u00e0 la solution des litiges qui lui sont soumis, ne doit pas \u00eatre paralys\u00e9e par le d\u00e9faut ou la n\u00e9gligence des parties. Se trouvant suffisamment renseign\u00e9e par les plaidoiries \u00e9crites, les pi\u00e8ces produites et ses propres enqu\u00eates, la Commission pouvait raisonnablement juger, dans les circonstances, qu\u2019en raison, d\u2019une part, de son devoir de disposer diligemment des cas dont elle est saisie et en raison, d\u2019autre part, de l\u2019inaction de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, elle pouvait et devait, sans plus d\u2019atermoiement, rendre sa d\u00e9cision. A mon avis, le Juge en chef de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de rejeter ce grief de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e. Disons imm\u00e9diatement qu\u2019il n\u2019est fait aucune mention de ce grief aux raisons de jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nSur le second point:\u2014La compagnie-intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019en amendant, le 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964, l\u00e9 certificat de reconnaissance syndicale \u00e9mis en faveur de l\u2019Union des Machinistes afin d\u2019y substituer le nom du nouvel employeur, la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 celui de l\u2019ancien, Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd., la Commission avait \u00e9tendu la juridiction que l\u2019Union des Machinistes avait sur les salari\u00e9s de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. \u00e0 tous les salari\u00e9s des sept divisions de l\u2019usine de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e. Et, poursuit-elle, en accr\u00e9ditant, par sa d\u00e9cision du 30 mars 1965, l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes comme repr\u00e9sentant les salari\u00e9s de ses sept divisions, la Commission a revis\u00e9 et renvers\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre 1964, ce que, dit-on, elle ne pouvait l\u00e9galement faire sans permettre aux parties d\u2019\u00eatre entendues et leur donner un avis \u00e0 ces fins, tel que l\u2019exigent les dispositions de l\u2019art. 118 du Code du Travail, auxquelles la Commission ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e. Cet article 118 vise le cas o\u00f9 la Commission est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 reviser ou r\u00e9voquer pour cause une d\u00e9cision ou un ordre rendu ou certificat \u00e9mis par elle. Ceci n\u2019est pas notre cas. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce que la Commission avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, c\u2019\u00e9tait le m\u00e9rite d\u2019une requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes pour \u00eatre accr\u00e9dit\u00e9e comme repr\u00e9sentant les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1964. Celle-ci contesta cette requ\u00eate et sa contestation est fond\u00e9e, en partie, sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la port\u00e9e ci-dessus qu\u2019elle attribue \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre et que la Commission et, subs\u00e9quemment, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ont, \u00e0 bon droit, rejet\u00e9es comme mal fond\u00e9es. M\u00eame s\u2019il fallait tenir pour erron\u00e9es l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la port\u00e9e diff\u00e9rentes que la Commission assigne \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision du 3 d\u00e9cembre, cette erreur ne saurait donner ouverture au recours par. prohibition, ne serait-ce qu\u2019en raison du fait que la Commission avait juridiction pour consid\u00e9rer et d\u00e9cider cette question particuli\u00e8re et qu\u2019on ne perd pas la juridiction qu\u2019on poss\u00e8de du fait qu\u2019en l\u2019exer\u00e7ant, on puisse, de bonne foi, commettre une erreur. Segal v. City of Montreal[4]. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de ne pas retenir ce deuxi\u00e8me grief dont il n\u2019est fait, comme c\u2019est le cas pour le premier, aucune mention aux raisons de jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nSur le troisi\u00e8me point:\u2014La compagnie-intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ce moyen comme suit au para. 33 de sa requ\u00eate pour prohibition:\n33.\u2014Egalement, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, rendue le 30 mars 1965 et produite sous la cote R-12, est ill\u00e9gale, nulle et ultra vires parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par un vice-pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019intim\u00e9e agissant seul et par cons\u00e9quent sans juridiction, puisqu\u2019un tel vice-pr\u00e9sident n\u2019a ce pouvoir en vertu de la loi que dans le cas de litige intersyndical, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait aucunement le cas;\nJ\u2019ai mis en italique cette partie du paragraphe o\u00f9 appara\u00eet la raison sur laquelle se fonde ce grief dont le bien ou malfond\u00e9 d\u00e9pend ainsi de la question de savoir si l\u2019affaire dont fut saisie la Commission, est ou n\u2019est pas un litige intersyndical, tel que d\u00e9fini \u00e0 l\u2019art. 108 du Code du Travail, soit une affaire o\u00f9 des associations de salari\u00e9s sont parties oppos\u00e9es ou, suivant le texte anglais, a case in which associations of employees are opposed to one another. En effet, tel que le prescrit le second para. de l\u2019art. 107 du Code du Travail, les membres de la Commission qui repr\u00e9sentent les employeurs et les salari\u00e9s ne votent pas, s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un litige intersyndical. Le conflit est alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par celui qui pr\u00e9side les s\u00e9ances de la Commission, soit le pr\u00e9sident lui-m\u00eame ou, comme ce fut le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019un de ses vice-pr\u00e9sidents, M. le juge G\u00e9rard Vaillancourt. Tenant compte de la contestation, des pi\u00e8ces produites et de ses propres enqu\u00eates, la Commission a \u00e9videmment consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait saisie d\u2019un litige intersyndical. Et M. le juge en chef Dorion, apr\u00e8s un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par le dossier, est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion qu\u2019il exprima en ces termes:\nToute la question consistait \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019Association des Machinistes poss\u00e9dait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un certificat d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation pour les employ\u00e9s de Canadian Ingersoll ou si les M\u00e9tallurgistes Unis avaient le droit de demander un tel certificat. Y a-t-il dans ce conflit autre chose qu\u2019un litige inter-syndical? Evidemment non. Surtout si l\u2019on tient compte du texte anglais de l\u2019article 108, on constate que la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9n\u00e9gation ne fait pas de doute, car il y avait certainement \u00abdans l\u2019affaire des associations d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient oppos\u00e9es l\u2019une \u00e0 l\u2019autre\u00bb. Dans les circonstances, le paragraphe 2 de l\u2019article 107 devait recevoir son application.\nOn ne saurait, \u00e0 mon avis, arriver \u00e0 d\u2019autre conclusion. Le fait que la compagnie-intim\u00e9e ait, \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019Union des Machinistes, pris l\u2019initiative de la contestation de la requ\u00eate en accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019Union des M\u00e9tallurgistes et ait, \u00e0 ces fins, invoqu\u00e9 les droits, pour le moins prioritaires sinon exclusifs, que pouvait avoir l\u2019Union des Machinistes, n\u2019est certes pas un crit\u00e8re valable pour d\u00e9terminer la nature du litige soumis \u00e0 la Commission. Comme employeur, la compagnie-intim\u00e9e avait sans doute un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la d\u00e9cision que pouvait prendre la Commission mais ceci ne d\u00e9termine pas la nature du conflit que celle-ci avait \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre. La nature de ce conflit doit s\u2019appr\u00e9cier en fonction de la question fondamentale qu\u2019on avait soumise \u00e0 la Commission et que celle-ci devait d\u00e9cider. Et cette question \u00e9tait: laquelle des deux unions, agissant Tune directement et l\u2019autre surtout par le truchement de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, avait droit, apr\u00e8s l\u2019acquisition de l\u2019entreprise de Sherbrooke Machineries Ltd. par la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, d\u2019\u00eatre accr\u00e9dit\u00e9e pour repr\u00e9senter tous les salari\u00e9s de celle-ci. Manifestement, il n\u2019y avait l\u00e0 qu\u2019un litige intersyndical. Aussi bien, ce troisi\u00e8me grief, tel que plaid\u00e9 par la compagnie-intim\u00e9e et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, fut-il, par celui-ci,, justement; \u00e9cart\u00e9 comme mal fond\u00e9.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta la requ\u00eate pour bref de prohibition, cassa et annula le bref \u00e9mis.\nAux raisons de jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, on ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re aucunement aux griefs ci-dessus, non plus qu\u2019\u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un litige intersyndical. On reconna\u00eet, par ailleurs, que si telle est la nature de l\u2019affaire soumise \u00e0 la Commission, le vice-pr\u00e9sident pouvait, comme il l\u2019a fait, en d\u00e9cider seul. Distinguant, cependant, entre les s\u00e9ances de la Commission et ses d\u00e9cisions, la Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le vice-pr\u00e9sident ne pouvait, en droit, proc\u00e9der seul aux s\u00e9ances requises pour la connaissance du litige et du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et, tenant compte du fait que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission ne mentionne aucune s\u00e9ance avec d\u2019autres membres de la Commission et trouvant la preuve au dossier suffisante pour \u00e9tablir que le vice-pr\u00e9sident avait connu seul du diff\u00e9rend, la Cour conclut que la d\u00e9cision, ainsi rendue par ce dernier sans permettre \u00e0 au moins deux de ses coll\u00e8gues d\u2019exercer leur voix consultative, est ill\u00e9gale et nulle et que la Commission ne peut y donner effet. C\u2019est l\u00e0 le motif et le seul sur lequel se fonde le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel. Et de l\u00e0 le pourvoi de la Commission \u00e0 cette Cour.\nAu seuil de l\u2019audition devant nous, la compagnie-intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 la permission d\u2019amender sa requ\u00eate pour obten- tion d\u2019un bref de prohibition, afin d\u2019y, remplacer le para. 33, ci-haut reproduit, par le paragraphe suivant:\n33.\u2014\u00c9galement, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e rendue le 30 mars 1965; et produite sous la cote R-12, est ill\u00e9gale, nulle et ultra vires, parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par un vice-pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019intim\u00e9e agissant seul et par cons\u00e9quent sans juridiction. En effet, non seulement la d\u00e9cision n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue et sign\u00e9e que par un vice-pr\u00e9sident de la commission, mais aussi ce vice-pr\u00e9sident n\u2019a pas connu du litige et n\u2019a pas d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 avec les autres membres de la Commission.\nL\u2019appelante s\u2019est fortement, oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Elle a soumis que, mis en contraste avec le texte actuel du para. 33, l\u2019amendement propos\u00e9 change fondamentalement le d\u00e9bat engag\u00e9 entre les parties et \u00e9tablit manifestement que la compagnie-intim\u00e9e cherche ainsi, injustement et ill\u00e9galement, \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier, devant cette Cour, d\u2019un moyen qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance et sur lequel s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e la Cour d\u2019appel pour motiver sa d\u00e9cision. La Cour r\u00e9serva son jugement sur cette requ\u00eate.\nAinsi donc, pour d\u00e9clarer que le juge Vaillancourt. a connu seul du diff\u00e9rend et rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans permettre \u00e0 au moins deux de ses coll\u00e8gues d\u2019exercer leur voix consultative, la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e (i) sur le fait que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission ne mentionne aucune s\u00e9ance du juge Vaillancourt avec d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues et (ii) sur la preuve, soit sur la partie ci-apr\u00e8s du t\u00e9moignage de Me Alfred Bussi\u00e8res, secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Commission:\nQ. Entre la r\u00e9ception de la requ\u00eate en accr\u00e9ditation des Steel Workers\u2014je vais les d\u00e9signer comme \u00e7a: les Steel Workers of America, et la d\u00e9cision du trente (30) mars de votre Commission, dans ce dossier, y a-t-il eu audition des parties?\nR. Il n\u2019y, a aucun proc\u00e8s-verbal, qui appara\u00eet, d\u2019audition.\nQ. Aucun proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u2019audition. Et, y a-t-il eu proc\u00e8s-verbal de d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Y a-t-il eu d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9?\nR. \u2026\u2026\u2026 je l\u2019ignore.\nMe LAURENT E. B\u00c9LANGER, POUR L\u2019INTIM\u00c9E; Je m\u2019objecte, votre Seigneurie, ce n\u2019est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\nLE T\u00c9MOIN:\nR. C\u2019est hors ma connaissance.\nLA COUR: S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u2019audition, je ne vois pas comment il va trouver un proc\u00e8s-verbal de d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nMe JEAN GAGN\u00c9, C.R., POUR LA REQU\u00c9RANTE: Parfois, ils d\u00e9lib\u00e8rent sans audition.\nR. Parfois ils d\u00e9lib\u00e8rent hors notre pr\u00e9sence, aussi.\nQ. En tout cas, on a une d\u00e9cision.\nLA COUR: Oui, c\u2019est ce qui compte, la d\u00e9cision.\nOn notera, d\u2019abord que le procureur de la Commission, Me B\u00e9langer, s\u2019est object\u00e9 \u00e0 cette partie du t\u00e9moignage du secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, parce que les faits que la compagnie-intim\u00e9e croyait peut-\u00eatre pouvoir \u00e9tablir, n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9s. De plus et ainsi que Ta soumis Me B\u00e9langer devant nous, tout ce qui ressort de ce t\u00e9moignage, c\u2019est que Me Bussi\u00e8res affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u2019audition des parties, qu\u2019il ignore s\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et qu\u2019il ajoute que les membres de la Commission d\u00e9lib\u00e8rent parfois sans audition des parties et parfois hors la pr\u00e9sence du personnel. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il m\u2019est impossible d\u2019admettre, comme \u00e9tabli au dossier, le fait sur lequel la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e pour casser le jugement du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Commission avait juridiction pour d\u00e9cider de la question soumise \u00e0 la Commission. On ne peut pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019en exer\u00e7ant cette juridiction, il s\u2019est abstenu de faire ce que la loi l\u2019obligeait de faire. Il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 s\u2019y \u00eatre conform\u00e9. La maxime Omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta re\u00e7oit ici son application. La volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur de rendre la Commission ma\u00eetresse de sa proc\u00e9dure, ainsi qu\u2019en t\u00e9moignent les dispositions de l\u2019art. 115 du Code du Travail, n\u2019implique s\u00fbrement pas que celle-ci doit, en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure, se conformer int\u00e9gralement \u00e0 la pratique prescrite ou suivie en ce qui concerne les causes mues devant les tribunaux de droit commun. La compagnie-intim\u00e9e devait satisfaire \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle Actori incumbit probatio. Elle a fait d\u00e9faut de ce faire. Pour ces raisons, je rejetterais la motion pour amender la requ\u00eate pour bref de prohibition; et, assumant que le texte non amend\u00e9 du para. 33 de cette requ\u00eate puisse, sans amendement, \u00eatre validement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 inclure comme plaid\u00e9 le moyen motivant le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, je dirais, en tout respect, qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis, le dossier ne permet pas de tenir ce moyen comme fond\u00e9.\nJe maintiendrais l\u2019appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, le tout avec d\u00e9pens, y compris les d\u00e9pens de la requ\u00eate pour amender, et r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante: L.E.

La chauss\u00e9e d\u2019environ 38 pieds de largeur \u00e9tait libre de v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 cet endroit, mais \u00e0 une quarantaine de pieds plus loin il y avait, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit et faisant face \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e, deux v\u00e9hicules de front: au bord du chemin, une voiture utilis\u00e9e par les constables municipaux et parall\u00e8lement, \u00e0 une distance d\u2019environ deux pieds de celle-ci, l\u2019automobile d\u2019un touriste am\u00e9ricain qui s\u2019\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u00e0 sur l\u2019ordre d\u2019un constable municipal. Le demandeur \u00e9tait dans le deuxi\u00e8me groupe de concurrents \u00e0 franchir la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e. Ils \u00e9taient sept dans ce groupe \u00e0 arriver de front et le demandeur se trouvait \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame gauche. Incapable de faire un arr\u00eat brusque et de passer \u00e0 droite de l\u2019automobile arr\u00eat\u00e9e, le demandeur a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 passer entre les deux v\u00e9hicules. L\u2019espace \u00e9tant insuffisant, il est tomb\u00e9 et s\u2019est bless\u00e9 gri\u00e8vement.

Cette faute consiste en ce que ces derniers, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9s par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 municipale comp\u00e9tente de faciliter l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de la course cycliste et de fournir \u00e0 cette fin une escorte sur motocyclettes pour faciliter le libre passage aux coureurs, ont, au m\u00e9pris des r\u00e8gles de la prudence, cr\u00e9\u00e9 un obstacle dangereux \u00e0 une faible distance de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e: premi\u00e8rement, en stationnant dans la rue une automobile \u00e0 leur usage; et, deuxi\u00e8mement, en laissant avancer une autre voiture \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cette automobile au moment o\u00f9 un groupe de coureurs s\u2019approchaient.\nIl faut reviser les conclusions du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur les faits, quoique confirm\u00e9es en appel, parce qu\u2019une d\u00e9claration extra-judiciaire d\u2019un tiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment re\u00e7ue en preuve et d\u2019autres erreurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises.

The pavement was approximately 38 feet wide and was free of vehicles. However, some forty feet further, two vehicles were stopped abreast on the right hand side of the street facing the finish line: at the curb, a car used by the municipal police and parallel to and some two feet from it, a car driven by an american tourist which had been stopped. The plaintiff was in the second group to cross the finish line. They were seven in that group riding abreast and the plaintiff was at the extreme left. Being unable to stop or to pass to the right of the american\u2019s car, the plaintiff tried to pass between the two vehicles. The space being insufficient, he fell and was grievously injured. His action against the municipality was dismissed by the trial judge whose decision was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. He appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe liability for the accident must fall entirely on the municipality as a result of the fault committed by its police officers in the performance of their work. This fault consisted in the fact that the officers, having been charged with the duty to facilitate the arrival of the race and to furnish for this purpose a motor cycle escort in order to facilitate the racers\u2019 right of way, created, in defiance of the rules of prudence, a dangerous obstacle at a short distance from the finish line: firstly, by parking their own car in the street; and secondly, by permitting a second vehicle to advance opposite their own car at the moment when a group of competitors was approaching.\nThe findings of fact of the trial judge must be reversed, although upheld in the Court of Appeal, because an extra-judicial statement of a third party was improperly received in evidence and other errors were committed.\nConcerning the quantum of damages, exchange premium should not be added to amounts allowed for suffering and loss of enjoyment of life any more than on expenses incurred in Canada.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of Mitchell J.

L\u2019\u00e9tape du matin ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait de Granby \u00e0 Sherbrooke. La ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9e dans la rue Wellington Sud, en face de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement commercial d\u2019un nomm\u00e9 Munkittrick. Le demandeur \u00e9tait dans le deuxi\u00e8me groupe de concurrents \u00e0 franchir la ligne. Ils \u00e9taient sept dans ce groupe \u00e0 arriver de front et le demandeur se trouvait \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame gauche. La chauss\u00e9e d\u2019environ 38 pieds de largeur \u00e9tait libre de v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e mais \u00e0 une quarantaine de pieds plus loin il y avait, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche, deux v\u00e9hicules de front: au bord du chemin une voiture utilis\u00e9e par les constables municipaux et parall\u00e8lement, \u00e0 une distance d\u2019environ deux pieds de celle-ci, l\u2019automobile d\u2019un touriste am\u00e9ricain, un nomm\u00e9 Wheeler, qui s\u2019\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u00e0 sur l\u2019ordre d\u2019un constable municipal. L\u2019appelant, incapable de faire un arr\u00eat brusque et de passer \u00e0 droite de l\u2019automobile arr\u00eat\u00e9e, a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 passer entre les deux v\u00e9hicules. L\u2019espace \u00e9tant insuffisant, il est tomb\u00e9 et s\u2019est bless\u00e9 gri\u00e8vement subissant une fracture de la cuisse droite et une fracture ouverte de la jambe droite qui n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 moins de cinq interventions chirurgicales.\nIl convient de signaler d\u00e8s maintenant que deux jours auparavant l\u2019officier en charge du service municipal de police, le capitaine Armand Genest, avait donn\u00e9 des instructions par \u00e9crit intitul\u00e9es \u00abService d\u2019ordre\u00bb. Ces instructions comportaient relativement \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des cyclistes ce qui suit:\nLE TOUR DU ST-LAURENT\nJeudi le 3 ao\u00fbt 1961\nArriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Sherbrooke, par la rue Wellington sud, chez Munkittrick aux environs de 12.00 hres P.M. DEVOIR: \u00e0 11.30 hres A.M.\nA partir des limites de la ville, deux motocyclistes et un constable sur la rue Wellington sud, pr\u00e8s de chez Munkittrick, d\u00e9taill\u00e9 par l\u2019officier en charge.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action et la Cour d\u2019Appel[2] a confirm\u00e9 par un arr\u00eat majoritaire. La majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019Appel a essentiellement endoss\u00e9 les motifs du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Ceux-ci peuvent se ramener \u00e0 trois.\nEn premier lieu, on dit que la municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas contract\u00e9 l\u2019engagement de fournir une protection sp\u00e9ciale par les membres de son corps de police \u00e0 ceux qui participaient \u00e0 la course. Il n\u2019y a rien \u00e0 redire sur ce premier point. La preuve d\u00e9montre bien que les organisateurs du Tour du Saint-Laurent ont adress\u00e9 des communications \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 municipale et aussi que des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises mais il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019aucun engagement n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9.\nEn second lieu, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance consid\u00e8re que les constables n\u2019ont commis aucune faute. Il est d\u2019avis qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas le devoir de d\u00e9tourner la circulation ni de lib\u00e9rer la rue de v\u00e9hicules stationn\u00e9s aux environs de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e. Les constables, dit-il de plus, ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des experts en course cycliste et ce qui peut \u00eatre \u00e9vident pour un expert ne l\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement pour eux. Ensuite il accepte leur version de l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de celle de tous les autres t\u00e9moins. Il ne trouve pas que la preuve d\u00e9montre que le constable post\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e ait fait signe \u00e0 Wheeler d\u2019avancer. Il dit que lorsque le constable l\u2019a vu il l\u2019a fait arr\u00eater et il affirme que c\u2019\u00e9tait la seule chose \u00e0 faire dans les circonstances.\nCes conclusions du juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur les faits ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019Appel, un motif sp\u00e9cial est n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019en \u00e9carter. Ici, il y en a plus d\u2019un.\nTout d\u2019abord, le dossier fait voir que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a permis au constable de rapporter ce que Wheeler lui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9. Objection a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 cette preuve et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie. De la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, on a soutenu que cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait admissible parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Cette pr\u00e9tention est doublement erron\u00e9e. L\u2019all\u00e9gation ne suffit pas \u00e0 rendre une preuve recevable. L\u00e9on c. Dominion Square Corporation[3]. De plus, jamais, elle ne peut avoir pour effet de permettre de faire la preuve autrement que de la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Or, il n\u2019est pas de preuve plus irrecevable que celle de d\u00e9clarations extra-judiciaires faites par un tiers. Marchand c. H\u00e9ritiers Begnoche[4]. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement contre-indiqu\u00e9 de recevoir \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge du constable impliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il avait lui-m\u00eame recueillie. Il est \u00e9vident que si la municipalit\u00e9 voulait se pr\u00e9valoir de la version de l\u2019automobiliste Wheeler, elle devait recourir \u00e0 une commission rogatoire faute de pouvoir le citer comme t\u00e9moin au proc\u00e8s.\nEnsuite le juge soutient que les constables ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des experts en course cycliste et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a pas faute de leur part d\u2019avoir omis de faire ce qui peut \u00eatre \u00e9vident pour un expert mais pas n\u00e9cessairement pour un constable. L\u2019erreur dans ce raisonnement c\u2019est de prendre pour acquis qu\u2019il fallait \u00eatre expert en course cycliste pour se rendre compte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait souverainement imprudent et dangereux d\u2019agir comme on l\u2019a fait en l\u2019occurrence. Sans demander aux constables d\u2019\u00eatre experts en la mati\u00e8re, on doit cependant exiger d\u2019eux non seulement qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent les connaissances de citoyens ordinaires mais aussi qu\u2019ils obtiennent les renseignements indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions. Il y avait sur place plusieurs personnes aupr\u00e8s desquelles ils pouvaient facilement se renseigner et qui d\u2019ailleurs leur ont spontan\u00e9ment offert des renseignements et des conseils dont ils ne paraissent pas avoir fait grand cas.\nEn effet, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a pour ainsi dire \u00e9cart\u00e9 tout ce que le commissaire de la course, Jean-Paul Hamel, un directeur, Octave Desharnais, l\u2019organisateur, Yvon Guillou, l\u2019\u00e9pouse de celui-ci et un nomm\u00e9 Eug\u00e8ne La-pointe ont relat\u00e9 des avis pr\u00e9cis donn\u00e9s aux constables pour ne retenir que le t\u00e9moignage du sergent Martin et du constable Cliche, lesquels ont pr\u00e9tendu ne pas avoir re\u00e7u d\u2019indications pr\u00e9cises. Pour appr\u00e9cier ainsi le preuve, il dit ne pas avoir de raison de ne pas ajouter foi aux constables. Il y a l\u00e0 une erreur manifeste. Ces constables sont les personnes accus\u00e9es d\u2019avoir commis la faute en raison de laquelle la municipalit\u00e9 est poursuivie. Ils seront l\u00e9galement responsables de toute condamnation prononc\u00e9e contre elle de ce chef. On ne peut pas prendre pour acquis qu\u2019ils n\u2019en subiront pas de cons\u00e9quences et ne seront pas l\u2019objet de sanctions, au contraire. Ce ne sont donc pas des t\u00e9moins d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s. M\u00eame si l\u2019on doit reconna\u00eetre chez les organisateurs du Tour une tendance \u00e0 se disculper, leur int\u00e9r\u00eat est moins direct. De plus, il n\u2019y a aucune cause de reproche contre ces cinq t\u00e9moins. Le choix fait par le juge entre leur version et celle des constables semble essentiellement fond\u00e9 sur son omission de consid\u00e9rer que les deux constables ne sont nullement en l\u2019occurrence des t\u00e9moins d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nEnsuite il faut dire qu\u2019on ne voit pas pour quelle raison le juge de premi\u00e8re instance refuse de tenir pour prouv\u00e9 que c\u2019est sur un signe fait par le constable Cliche que l\u2019automobiliste Wheeler s\u2019est avanc\u00e9 en se pla\u00e7ant en position pour d\u00e9passer la voiture des constables, ainsi que les t\u00e9moins Munkittrick et Medeiros l\u2019affirment cat\u00e9goriquement. De la part de la municipalit\u00e9, on a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce serait sur un ordre donn\u00e9 par haut-parleurs que cela se serait produit. Cette th\u00e9orie est tout \u00e0 fait invraisemblable. Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux haut-parleurs se pr\u00e9occupait de lib\u00e9rer la rue pour faciliter la circulation des cyclistes. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Medeiros, un spectateur t\u00e9moin compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9, ce que l\u2019on a annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 c\u2019est l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un groupe de coureurs. Au surplus, les paroles que l\u2019on rapporte sont en fran\u00e7ais. Rien ne permet de pr\u00e9sumer que Wheeler ait compris cette langue. De plus, quand un constable en uniforme est dans la rue pour diriger la circulation, la r\u00e8gle universelle c\u2019est qu\u2019un automobiliste ne doit pas s\u2019avancer autrement que sur son ordre. Il est tout \u00e0 fait invraisemblable que l\u2019on ne s\u2019y soit pas conform\u00e9 et c\u2019est une raison de plus pour accepter la version des t\u00e9moins d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s contre la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation impr\u00e9cise du constable Cliche. De toute fa\u00e7on, celui-ci admet que c\u2019est sur son ordre que l\u2019automobiliste s\u2019est immobilis\u00e9 dans la position qui a caus\u00e9 l\u2019accident. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance dit qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas autre chose \u00e0 faire dans les circonstances. C\u2019est ce qui n\u2019est aucunement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 car on ne voit pas pourquoi le constable n\u2019a pas fait signe \u00e0 l\u2019automobiliste de se ranger au bord de la rue en avant de la voiture de police.\nIl faut noter qu\u2019une photographie prise presque imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident fait voir que cette voiture qui \u00e9tait le premier v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 la gauche de la rue pass\u00e9 la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e, se trouvait beaucoup moins \u00e0 gauche que les autres v\u00e9hicules. Elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement sur le pavage alors que l\u2019on avait fait garer les autres voitures presque compl\u00e8tement en dehors de la chauss\u00e9e. On comprend pourquoi lorsque l\u2019on a permis aux automobilistes de s\u2019avancer, Wheeler a d\u00fb se rapprocher du centre de la rue pour doubler la voiture encombrante que les constables avaient gar\u00e9e l\u00e0. Le sergent Martin a soutenu que l\u2019on avait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 d\u2019agir ainsi par suite du manque de coop\u00e9ration des camionneurs qui accompagnaient le Tour. Cette excuse est on ne peut plus boiteuse. Les photographies font voir que les camionneurs n\u2019ont pas encombr\u00e9 la chauss\u00e9e. Elles font voir \u00e9galement qu\u2019il y avait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e au moins une voiture gar\u00e9e sur le trottoir du c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9, rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait que celle des constables f\u00fbt plac\u00e9e de cette mani\u00e8re tout comme rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt gar\u00e9e aussi \u00e0 gauche que celles des particuliers gar\u00e9es de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9-l\u00e0. Il y a plus, le Colonel Cliche, qui suivait le Tour en qualit\u00e9 de tr\u00e9sorier et est arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux un instant avant l\u2019accident, a pu garer sa voiture en dehors du chemin \u00e0 moins de 300 pieds au-del\u00e0 de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e. L\u2019accident s\u2019est malheureusement produit avant qu\u2019il ait pu intervenir pour supprimer le danger auquel les coureurs \u00e9taient expos\u00e9s.\nLes constables ne devaient pas ignorer qu\u2019il y aurait un sprint \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il fallait \u00e9viter soigneusement que les coureurs se trouvent en face d\u2019un obstacle constitu\u00e9 par des v\u00e9hicules dans la rue au-del\u00e0 de cette ligne. A cette fin, en outre de lib\u00e9rer la chauss\u00e9e aux abords imm\u00e9diats de la ligne, on avait fait garer les v\u00e9hicules en dehors de la chauss\u00e9e le plus possible. Dans ces conditions, c\u2019\u00e9tait une faute caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e de la part des constables que de placer leur voiture \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 elle se trouvait lors de l\u2019accident. C\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galement une faute apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des premiers cyclistes et alors que les haut\u2011parleurs annon\u00e7aient l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un autre groupe, que de diriger la circulation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 immobiliser la voiture de Wheeler dans une position o\u00f9 elle constituait un obstacle \u00e0 une tr\u00e8s faible distance de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance soutient que le demandeur a accept\u00e9 le risque de ce qui est arriv\u00e9. Pour admettre cette conclusion il faudrait dire que l\u2019obstacle constitu\u00e9 par la voiture de la police et celle de Wheeler plac\u00e9es de front \u00e9tait \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir et constituait l\u2019un des risques inh\u00e9rents au sport d\u2019une course cycliste dans un chemin public. Voil\u00e0 ce qui n\u2019est aucunement d\u00e9montr\u00e9. Au contraire, tout fait voir que dans le cours normal des choses, les abords de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9s d\u2019obstacles sur une distance suffisante pour que le sprint final n\u2019implique pas de risque de collision avec une automobile.\nEn troisi\u00e8me lieu, on dit que le demandeur circulait sur un chemin public et \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019observer le Code de la route. Cette affirmation ne tient pas compte du fait que la municipalit\u00e9, par son service de police, avait pr\u00e9vu une escorte polici\u00e8re pour faciliter l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des coureurs. Ceux-ci, depuis les limites de la ville, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u2019un motocycliste qui leur ouvrait le chemin. En mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 civile on n\u2019a pas \u00e0 rechercher si en agissant ainsi les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la municipalit\u00e9 se conformaient aux r\u00e8glements municipaux et s\u2019ils \u00e9taient l\u00e9galement autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles ordinaires de la circulation pour favoriser la course cycliste. Le demandeur avait droit de prendre pour acquis que les constables en uniforme avaient le droit de faire ce qu\u2019ils faisaient. Ce qu\u2019ils faisaient avec une motocyclette munie de feux sp\u00e9ciaux impliquait qu\u2019ils mettaient de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles ordinaires de circulation pour rendre possible la comp\u00e9tition sportive. Celle-ci exigeait en l\u2019occurrence que le demandeur se pr\u00e9occupe uniquement de donner l\u2019effort maximum et de respecter le r\u00e8glement qui lui prescrit de ne pas nuire aux autres concurrents. Il \u00e9tait en droit de compter que puisque le service de police lui ouvrait le chemin, ce service verrait \u00e9galement \u00e0 lui assurer le chemin libre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une distance raisonnable au-del\u00e0 de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e. La situation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la m\u00eame qu\u2019en dehors de la ville o\u00f9, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une escorte polici\u00e8re, les coureurs se trouvaient oblig\u00e9s de se pr\u00e9munir contre la circulation en sens inverse. A l\u2019arriv\u00e9e, l\u2019escorte polici\u00e8re leur signifiait que des pr\u00e9cautions suffisantes \u00e9taient prises pour leur permettre de faire la course et le sprint final de la fa\u00e7on usuelle.\nIl ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si, dans les circonstances, les repr\u00e9sentants de la municipalit\u00e9 sont en faute de ne pas avoir d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 la circulation venant \u00e0 la rencontre des coureurs. Quoi qu\u2019on ait pu dire des difficult\u00e9s que cela pr\u00e9sentait, il est s\u00fbr que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas impossible puisqu\u2019on l\u2019a fait apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident. Si l\u2019on choisissait de ne pas le faire tout en tol\u00e9rant et facilitant la course de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crite, on se devait au moins de ne pas cr\u00e9er une situation dangereuse pour les coureurs en stationnant une voiture du service de la police et en dirigeant la circulation comme on l\u2019a fait.\nOn a continu\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre de la part de la municipalit\u00e9 que le parcours et, en particulier, la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mal choisis par les organisateurs. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une question qui ne saurait influer sur la d\u00e9cision du litige. Le demandeur \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de prendre la situation comme elle se pr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 lui. Quant \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9, ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient aucunement tenus de tol\u00e9rer la course et de la faciliter s\u2019ils consid\u00e9raient l\u2019emplacement de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e mal choisi. Ce n\u2019est pas ce qu\u2019ils ont fait. Deux jours avant l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, des ordres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par celui qui exer\u00e7ait les fonctions de chef de police dans le but de faciliter la course et l\u2019arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le tout a effectivement eu lieu. Les coureurs auxquels on a fourni une escorte polici\u00e8re avaient droit de compter que les constables en charge de la circulation agiraient en cons\u00e9quence avec un soin raisonnable, ce qui implique que s\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisamment au courant des exigences de la manifestation sportive \u00e0 laquelle ils pr\u00eataient leur concours, il leur fallait se renseigner de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 faire ce que l\u2019on \u00e9tait en droit d\u2019attendre d\u2019eux. Ils sont d\u2019autant moins recevables \u00e0 plaider ignorance qu\u2019une semblable course avait eu lieu au cours de chacune de plusieurs ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\nDans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause le demandeur ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en faute pour n\u2019avoir pas regard\u00e9 assez loin devant lui de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019\u00e9viter l\u2019accident. Il ne faut pas oublier qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un usage ordinaire de la voie publique mais du sprint \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une \u00e9tape d\u2019une course cycliste. Chaque coureur doit s\u2019efforcer de ne pas se laisser d\u00e9passer et, si possible, de d\u00e9passer les autres. Il en r\u00e9sulte que ce qui serait souverainement imprudent dans la circulation normale devient la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre, la preuve le d\u00e9montre clairement et sans contredit. Le demandeur avait le droit de pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019obstacle au-del\u00e0 de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une distance suffisante pour lui permettre de s\u2019arr\u00eater. Dans des circonstances ordinaires, la prudence lui aurait command\u00e9 de ne pas rester en ligne ce qui l\u2019aurait oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 se laisser d\u00e9passer, de m\u00eame il lui aurait fallu regarder au loin ce qui l\u2019aurait emp\u00each\u00e9 momentan\u00e9ment de garder la position d\u2019effort maximum, chose incompatible avec la fa\u00e7on dont il devait courir \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\nPour ces raisons, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accident doit \u00eatre imput\u00e9e en entier \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 du chef de la faute commise par ses constables dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de leurs fonctions. Cette faute consiste en ce que ces derniers ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9s par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 municipale comp\u00e9tente de faciliter l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de la course cycliste et fournir \u00e0 cette fin une escorte sur motocyclette pour faciliter le libre passage aux coureurs ont, au m\u00e9pris des r\u00e8gles de la prudence, cr\u00e9\u00e9 un obstacle dangereux \u00e0 une faible distance au-del\u00e0 de la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e: premi\u00e8rement, en stationnant dans la rue une automobile \u00e0 leur usage; deuxi\u00e8mement, en laissant avancer une autre voiture \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cette automobile au moment o\u00f9 un groupe de coureurs s\u2019approchaient.\nComme le fait observer le juge Taschereau en Cour d\u2019Appel:\nIl n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que les officiers de police agissaient ici comme sergents de ville pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de r\u00e8glements municipaux et non comme agents de la paix. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la d\u00e9fenderesse et que celle-ci doit \u00eatre tenue responsable de toute faute qu\u2019ils auraient pu commettre dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions.\nOn peut ajouter qu\u2019en l\u2019occurrence il n\u2019y a pas lieu de rechercher si l\u2019officier en charge du service de police \u00e9tait d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 donner les ordres qu\u2019il a transmis aux constables. Cette autorisation doit se pr\u00e9sumer. Si la municipalit\u00e9 voulait soutenir qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait autrement, il lui incombait d\u2019en fournir la preuve. Cela d\u2019ailleurs n\u2019aurait pu avoir pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter sa responsabilit\u00e9 car il aurait fallu en conclure tout au plus qu\u2019il y avait eu abus des fonctions. Or, l\u2019acte fait par abus des fonctions engage la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant. Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. c. Vaillancourt[5]. Ici, cependant, il est clair que les fautes g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de la responsabilit\u00e9 sont bien des actes faits par les constables dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de leurs fonctions. En effet, il s\u2019agit de la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont dirig\u00e9 la circulation et gar\u00e9 la voiture mise \u00e0 leur disposition pour se rendre au lieu o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s d\u2019accomplir ce travail lequel entre manifestement dans le cadre de leurs fonctions.\nOn objectera peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019une municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation de prendre des pr\u00e9cautions sp\u00e9ciales pour permettre des courses cyclistes dans ses rues qui ne sont pas destin\u00e9es \u00e0 cet usage. Cet argument serait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si l\u2019on voulait fonder la responsabilit\u00e9 sur une faute de la municipalit\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame. Elle pourrait alors faire valoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas l\u2019obligation de veiller \u00e0 la protection des coureurs et qu\u2019on ne peut lui reprocher d\u2019avoir pris des mesures insuffisantes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Si le service de la police municipale avait en l\u2019occurrence refus\u00e9 de faire quoi que ce soit pour faciliter la course, ce refus n\u2019aurait pas engag\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de la municipalit\u00e9. \u00c9videmment, on ne doit pas supposer que les organisateurs auraient eu en ce cas la t\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9 de faire faire la course quand m\u00eame. De toute fa\u00e7on, ce n\u2019est pas ce qui s\u2019est produit. Le service de la police municipale a pris des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales pour permettre la course et celle-ci a eu lieu dans les conditions que l\u2019on sait. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019on a commis une faute ou une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 en prenant ces dispositions. En effet, la source de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas sa faute personnelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle mais celle de ses constables, et celle-ci ne consiste pas en une omission mais en deux actes imprudents faits dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de leurs fonctions. Ce n\u2019est pas parce que la municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas l\u2019obligation de cr\u00e9er la situation qui rendait ces actes imprudents que, celle-ci \u00e9tant cr\u00e9\u00e9e, ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s d\u2019agir avec une prudence et un soin raisonnables. M\u00eame en pr\u00e9sence du danger cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la faute criminelle d\u2019un tiers un constable reste tenu d\u2019agir avec prudence. Beim c. Goyer[6]. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ayant rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019estimation du montant des dommages. En Cour d\u2019appel, le juge Rivard a fait l\u2019estimation suivante:\nPerte d\u2019un an aux \u00e9tudes \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 5,000.00\nSouffrances \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 1,000.00\nPerte des joies de la vie \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,000.00\nIncapacit\u00e9 fix\u00e9e \u00e0 15% \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 10,000.00\nD\u00e9bours\u00e9s \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 3,902.47\n$20,902.47\nPlus 7% pour l\u2019\u00e9change \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 1,463.18\nTOTAL \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...... $22,365.65\nLe demandeur soutient avec raison que le montant pour incapacit\u00e9 est insuffisant en regard du fait \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un jeune m\u00e9decin qui, comme lui, se sp\u00e9cialise en anesth\u00e9sie aux \u00c9tats-Unis gagne d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de $20,000 \u00e0 $25,000 par ann\u00e9e.

D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, une revue de la preuve et des pi\u00e8ces au sujet des d\u00e9bours\u00e9s oblige \u00e0 les fixer \u00e0 $3,635.21 et de ce total il faut noter qu\u2019une somme de $1,378 repr\u00e9sente des frais m\u00e9dicaux et d\u2019hospitalisation encourus au Canada et auxquels il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019ajouter le pourcentage de 7 pour cent admis au proc\u00e8s comme prime \u00e0 payer sur les montants en dollars des \u00c9tats-Unis.

The trial judge held that the driver R was liable and awarded damages in the sum of $93,000. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, held that the driver D, who was driving on the wrong side of the road, was liable for the accident, and reduced the damages to $64,000. The plaintiff only appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nBoth drivers were liable. R\u2019s fault of inattention, as established in the evidence, and D\u2019s fault, which was not contested before this Court, have, in the circumstances of this case, simultaneously and inseparably contributed to make this accident inevitable.

Cet accident se produisit \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le chemin du Rang 7, en la paroisse St-Cyrille, rejoint la route 9. Une automobile Citro\u00ebn, appartenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e Windmill Point Inc. et conduite du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord vers Montr\u00e9al par l\u2019intim\u00e9 R\u00e9al Rousseau, vint en collision avec une automobile Chevrolet, appartenant \u00e0 Jean-Guy Desrosiers et conduite en sens inverse vers Qu\u00e9bec par son fr\u00e8re, Claude Desrosiers. Trois personnes y perdirent la vie: Me Jean-Marie Nadeau, seul passager de Rousseau, et Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et Georges Champagne, passagers de Desrosiers. Seuls les deux conducteurs surv\u00e9curent et en raison de la gravit\u00e9 de leurs blessures respectives, seul Rousseau a-t-il quelques souvenirs pr\u00e9cis de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame de l\u2019accident. Ce dernier et une dame Pag\u00e9 et son \u00e9poux qui voyageaient \u00e0 une assez grande distance \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de la voiture conduite par Rousseau, en sont les seuls t\u00e9moins oculaires.\nCette trag\u00e9die de la route donna lieu \u00e0 plusieurs actions dans lesquelles on chercha, en demande, \u00e0 en faire reposer la responsabilit\u00e9 sur l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des conducteurs ou sur les deux. Dame Mignault, veuve de Me Nadeau, et leurs enfants, qui sont ici les appelants, poursuivirent les deux conducteurs et propri\u00e9taires des automobiles concern\u00e9es et demand\u00e8rent contre eux une condamnation conjointe et solidaire au paiement des dommages leur r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Me Nadeau. A l\u2019audition, cependant, ils se d\u00e9sist\u00e8rent de leur recours contre Jean-Guy Desrosiers, le propri\u00e9taire de la Chevrolet. L\u2019action et les autres intent\u00e9es furent entendues et jug\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment par M. le juge Lesage de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Attachant beaucoup d\u2019importance et de poids au t\u00e9moignage de dame Pag\u00e9, le savant juge jugea que la collision \u00e9tait imputable \u00e0 Rousseau. L\u2019action de la veuve et des enfants Nadeau fut donc rejet\u00e9e quant \u00e0 Claude Desrosiers et accueillie quant \u00e0 Rousseau et Windmill Point Inc. qui furent condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 leur payer les dommages qui, au total, furent estim\u00e9s \u00e0 la somme de $93,000.\nLa d\u00e9cision concernant cette action donna lieu \u00e0 deux appels: (i) celui de dame Mignault et ses fils, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette partie du jugement exon\u00e9rant Claude Desrosiers et (ii) celui de Rousseau et Windmill Point Inc., \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la condamnation prononc\u00e9e contre eux. Ces deux appels furent entendus simultan\u00e9ment et ult\u00e9rieurement d\u00e9cid\u00e9s le m\u00eame jour. Disons imm\u00e9diatement que les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel furent unanimes \u00e0 \u00e9carter la version que dame Pag\u00e9 donna de cet accident et ce, non pas parce qu\u2019on a trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait lieu de mettre en doute la bonne foi ou la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de ce t\u00e9moin, mais parce qu\u2019on a jug\u00e9, et \u00e0 bon droit,\u2014ainsi qu\u2019il a d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu devant nous par les parties,\u2014que cette version \u00e9tait invraisemblable et irr\u00e9conciliable au regard des faits connus de cet accident. Quant \u00e0 son \u00e9poux, Jean-Paul Pag\u00e9, il ne regardait pas devant lui au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit et aucune des parties n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 devant nous le peu qu\u2019il en a rapport\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Ceci \u00e9tant, il n\u2019y aura pas lieu de revenir sur ces deux t\u00e9moignages. La Cour d\u2019appel[2] se divisa sur la question de responsabilit\u00e9. La majorit\u00e9, compos\u00e9e de MM. les juges Rinfret et Taschereau, jugea que cet accident devait \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Claude Desrosiers qui conduisait du mauvais c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la route sans qu\u2019aucune explication de sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 cet endroit n\u2019apparaisse au dossier. Dissident, M. le juge Choquette fut d\u2019avis que Desrosiers et Rousseau \u00e9taient \u00e9gale- ment responsables. Aussi bien et par suite de cette d\u00e9cision majoritaire, l\u2019action de dame Mignault et ses fils fut rejet\u00e9e quant \u00e0 Rousseau et Windmill Point Inc. et accueillie quant \u00e0 Claude Desrosiers qui fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur payer les dommages que tous les juges furent d\u2019accord \u00e0 r\u00e9duire \u00e0 la somme de $64,000.\nDesrosiers n\u2019a pas appel\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision. Il y a donc chose jug\u00e9e quant \u00e0 sa faute et sa responsabilit\u00e9. D\u2019autre part, dame Mignault et ses fils appellent \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette partie du jugement qui exon\u00e8re Rousseau et Windmill Point Inc. et c\u2019est l\u00e0 la question que nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer.\nLes faits pertinents, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis devant nous par les parties, peuvent \u00eatre expos\u00e9s bien simplement.\nL\u2019accident s\u2019est produit vers 6 heures 20 de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 la route, dont le centre est marqu\u00e9 d\u2019une ligne blanche, est droite sur une distance d\u2019environ 3 milles et large de 22 pieds avec de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 un accotement carrossable d\u2019une largeur de 7 pieds. Le temps \u00e9tait beau\u00bb Il faisait clair. La visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait parfaite. Il n\u2019y avait, au moment et \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 s\u2019est produit l\u2019accident, aucun autre v\u00e9hicule que les deux qui sont entr\u00e9s en collision. Le choc est survenu tout pr\u00e8s sinon au point m\u00eame du prolongement de la route du Rang 7, sur la route 9. Il s\u2019agit, le fait est admis, d\u2019une collision frontale qui eut lieu dans la partie nord de la route 9, soit la partie r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 Rousseau qui voyageait de l\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019ouest. Apr\u00e8s la collision, la Chevrolet, conduite par Desrosiers, s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9e sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la route, \u00e0 27 pieds \u00e0 l\u2019est des d\u00e9bris marquant l\u2019endroit du choc, et la Citro\u00ebn, conduite par Rousseau, se trouvait 18 pieds plus \u00e0 l\u2019est que la Chevrolet et \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e de reculons dans le foss\u00e9 nord de la route 9. Le v\u00e9hicule de Desrosiers n\u2019a laiss\u00e9 aucune trace de freinage. On a, par ailleurs, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord et \u00e0 3 pieds du bord de la route, relev\u00e9 quatre traces parall\u00e8les de freinage. Ces traces, elles-m\u00eames pratiquement parall\u00e8les \u00e0 la route, commen\u00e7aient et se continuaient sur une distance de 56 pieds \u00e0 l\u2019est de l\u2019endroit du choc. Contrairement au juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, qui consid\u00e9ra que ces traces n\u2019\u00e9taient pas reli\u00e9es aux voitures impliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019accident, les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel furent unanimes \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre, et je crois \u00e0 bon droit, que ces quatre traces de freinage devaient \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 la Citro\u00ebn. Cette voiture, en effet, est munie de freins sur les quatre roues et l\u2019espacement des roues \u00e0 l\u2019avant est sup\u00e9rieur de trois \u00e0 quatre pouces \u00e0 l\u2019espacement des roues \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re. Quant \u00e0 la vitesse des deux v\u00e9hicules, au moment de l\u2019accident, Rousseau d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il conduisait de 50 \u00e0 55 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure et que la voiture Chevrolet, conduite par Desrosiers, est arriv\u00e9e, comme un bolide, sur la sienne. Ce t\u00e9moignage, les dommages tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables subis par les deux v\u00e9hicules et le recul de la Citro\u00ebn caus\u00e9 par la Chevrolet font preuve qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident, les deux voitures voyageaient \u00e0 une tr\u00e8s bonne allure et que la vitesse de la Chevrolet \u00e9tait s\u00fbrement pas moindre que celle de la Citro\u00ebn. La vitesse combin\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle ces deux v\u00e9hicules s\u2019approchaient l\u2019un de l\u2019autre et le caract\u00e8re frontal de leur collision sur la partie nord de la route excluent, je crois, la possibilit\u00e9 que Desrosiers ait fait un virage subit vers la gauche, pour entrer sur cette partie de la route r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 Rousseau, et indiquent cons\u00e9quemment qu\u2019il s\u2019y \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 une certaine distance du point o\u00f9 la collision s\u2019est produite et \u00e0 une distance appr\u00e9ciable du point o\u00f9 Rousseau avait la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser le danger r\u00e9sultant de cette conduite. Rousseau reconna\u00eet, dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident, il faisait clair, que la visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait excellente et qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019endroit de l\u2019accident, la route est droite \u00e0 perte de vue. Il n\u2019a pas vu la Chevrolet s\u2019engager sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la route. En fait, et plusieurs fois, ainsi qu\u2019il appert particuli\u00e8rement du passage suivant, il en fait l\u2019aveu:\nQ. Vous l\u2019avez vue, (la Chevrolet) l\u2019accident se produisait?\nR. S\u2019est produit.\n* * *\nQ. Une autre r\u00e9ponse que vous avez donn\u00e9e \u00e0 une question qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Coroner \u00e0 la page vingt et un (21): \u00abR. Non, bien si vous ne voulez pas ces d\u00e9tails-l\u00e0; c\u2019est arriv\u00e9 comme un bolide comme \u00e7a en pleine figure, en pleine face et je me suis r\u00e9veill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital\u00bb; c\u2019est bien ce que vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Coroner?\nR. Oui.\nQ. C\u2019est bien ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, ce qui s\u2019est produit?\nR. Oui. Q. A la page trente et un (31), on vous posait la question: \u00abQ. Comme \u00e7a, vous avez vu la machine; elle arrivait sur vous, vous ne l\u2019avez pas vue venir de loin? R. Non, c\u2019est arriv\u00e9 comme \u00e7a\u00bb;\nR. Oui.\nQ. C\u2019est bien comme \u00e7a que cela s\u2019est produit?\nR. Oui.\nQ. A l\u2019endroit de l\u2019accident, par rapport \u00e0 la direction que vous suiviez, la route est droite n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Droite \u00e0 perte de vue.\nQ. A perte de vue?\nR. Oui.\nQ. En cons\u00e9quence pour vous qui veniez de Qu\u00e9bec, vous dirigeant vers Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de l\u2019accident, devant vous, la route est droite \u00e0 perte de vue; c\u2019est cela?\nR. C\u2019est cela.\nQ. Est-ce que le jour de l\u2019accident la visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait bonne?\nR. Je crois qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait excellente.\nQ. Il faisait clair?\nR. Il faisait clair, oui.\nIl se rappelle de l\u2019impr\u00e9cation qu\u2019il a lanc\u00e9e lorsque la Chevrolet est arriv\u00e9e sur sa voiture. Invoquant la gravit\u00e9 des blessures subies par Rousseau, son procureur nous a invit\u00e9s \u00e0 ne pas tenir compte des admissions ci-dessus. Je n\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 au dossier aucune justification pour ce faire. Rousseau a commis une faute d\u2019inattention. La faute de Desrosiers et celle de Rousseau ont, dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9t\u00e9 simultan\u00e9ment et ins\u00e9parablement actives pour contribuer \u00e0 rendre in\u00e9vitable l\u2019accident qui en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9. Aussi bien, je dirais, avec tout le respect pour l\u2019opinion contraire, que les deux conducteurs doivent en \u00eatre tenus responsables et ce dans une proportion que nous ne pouvons d\u00e9terminer sur le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nIl n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que lors de cet accident, Rousseau qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Windmill Point Inc., \u00e9tait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions. Il s\u2019ensuit que les intim\u00e9s et Claude Desrosiers doivent \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration des dommages que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Me Nadeau entra\u00eene pour chacun des appelants.\nEn ce qui concerne ces dommages, les parties sont d\u2019accord \u00e0 accepter la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel qui les a fix\u00e9s \u00e0 $40,000 pour dame Mignault personnellement, \u00e0 $12,000 pour dame Mignault en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice de son fils mineur Michel Nadeau, \u00e0 $7,000 pour Jean Nadeau et \u00e0 $5,000 pour Jacques Nadeau. Pour ces raisons, je maintiendrais l\u2019appel et, proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 rendre le jugement qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendu, condamnerais conjointement et solidairement les intim\u00e9s et Claude Desrosiers \u00e0 payer \u00e0 dame Mignault personnellement $40,000, et en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice de son fils mineur Michel $12,000, \u00e0 Jean Nadeau $7,000 et \u00e0 Jacques Nadeau $5,000.

Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel. La demanderesse a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli, le Juge Pigeon \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Hall: La demanderesse fonde son action sur une s\u00e9duction dolosive, et tous les montants qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de dommages r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un tort personnel se rattachant \u00e0 cette faute. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019une action qui, suivant l\u2019art. 421 de l\u2019ancien Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre instruite par un juge et un jury.

Pour les frais de g\u00e9sine donc, une cause distincte du d\u00e9lit de s\u00e9duction est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, la paternit\u00e9.

The trial judge dismissed her petition to have the case heard by a jury on the ground that a trial by jury could not be had where several causes of action, of which one is not susceptible to be heard by a jury, are joined in the same suit. This judgment was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, Pigeon J. dissenting.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Hall JJ.: The plaintiff based her action on a dolose seduction, and all the moneys claimed are claimed as damages resulting from a personal wrong connected with this fault. This was therefore an action which was, according to art. 421 of the previous Code of Civil Procedure, susceptible of being tried by a judge and jury.\nPer Pigeon J., dissenting: The whole of the demand was not included in the category of actions which can form the subject of a trial by jury. There is here a claim for damages for seduction and also one for the lying-in expenses arising from the paternity and owed even in the absence of seduction. Therefore, as to the lying-in expenses, a cause of action distinct from the delict of seduction is alleged, the paternity. That is a cause of action which is not susceptible of a trial by jury.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, affirming a judgment of Beaudoin J.

Le jugement des Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Hall fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014L\u2019appelante a intent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 une poursuite en recouvrement de dommages. Au soutien de cette action, la demanderesse d\u00e9clare en substance que, par des promesses de mariage, le d\u00e9fendeur a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 la s\u00e9duire et, par ses \u0153uvres, l\u2019a mise enceinte d\u2019un enfant auquel elle donna naissance le 31 juillet 1963 et dont, par la suite, le d\u00e9fendeur a admis la paternit\u00e9; elle d\u00e9clare que ces promesses de mariage, qu\u2019elle tenait pour sinc\u00e8res, \u00e9taient fallacieuses et qu\u2019en fait, le d\u00e9fendeur l\u2019a l\u00e2chement abandonn\u00e9e d\u00e8s qu\u2019inform\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Elle demande \u00e0 ce que ce dernier soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer tous les dommages, lui r\u00e9sultant de cette s\u00e9duction, dont ceux qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb encourir pour frais de g\u00e9sine, soit un total de $46,414.62. Le d\u00e9fendeur contesta cette action. Au jour de l\u2019inscription pour enqu\u00eate et audition, la demanderesse, optant pour un proc\u00e8s par jury, pr\u00e9senta une requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure afin que la cause soit plac\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial des proc\u00e8s par jury.\nSaisi du m\u00e9rite de cette requ\u00eate, M. le juge Beaudoin, s\u2019appuyant sur les arr\u00eats de la Cour d\u2019appel dans Forsyth v. Boyce[1] et Miss A. v. A.[2], jugea que, dans sa poursuite, la demanderesse cumule deux causes d\u2019action dont l\u2019une, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 1053 du Code Civil, est en r\u00e9clamation de dommages pour torts personnels d\u00e9coulant de la s\u00e9duction et dont l\u2019autre, fond\u00e9e sur les dispositions de l\u2019art. 2261 du Code Civil, est en recouvrement de frais de g\u00e9sine; que, suivant l\u2019art. 421 de l\u2019ancien Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, alors en vigueur, la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9clamation est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre instruite par un jury alors que la seconde ne l\u2019est pas. Invoquant la r\u00e8gle voulant que ne peut \u00eatre instruite par un jury une poursuite cumulant deux causes d\u2019action dont l\u2019une n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9e par ce mode d\u2019instruction, M. le juge Beaudoin d\u00e9clara que la demanderesse n\u2019avait pas droit au proc\u00e8s par jury et rejeta la requ\u00eate avec d\u00e9pens.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour, alors compos\u00e9e de MM. les juges Rinfret, Taschereau et Choquette. Parlant pour lui-m\u00eame et M. le juge Taschereau, M. le juge Rinfret pr\u00e9cise que le probl\u00e8me \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre se borne \u00e0 savoir si, aux termes des arts. 421 et422 C.P.C., la demanderesse a droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s par jury et si son action est v\u00e9ritablement une poursuite en recouvrement de dommages pour torts personnels. Ces articles se lisent comme suit:\nArt. 421. Le proc\u00e8s par jury peut avoir lieu dans toute action fond\u00e9e sur dette, promesse ou convention d\u2019une nature commerciale, soit entre commer\u00e7ants, soit entre une partie qui est commer\u00e7ante et une autre qui ne l\u2019est pas et aussi dans toute poursuite en recouvrement de dommages r\u00e9sultant de torts personnels ou de d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re.\nArt. 422. Il y a lieu sur la demande de l\u2019une des parties, lorsque la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l\u2019action exc\u00e8de mille piastres.\nS\u2019appuyant sur la signification donn\u00e9e aux mots torts personnels dans Robinson v. Cie des Tramways de Montr\u00e9al[3], o\u00f9 on a dit que ces mots visent\u2026 toute r\u00e9clamation fond\u00e9e sur une atteinte \u00e0 la personne d\u2019un autre, soit \u00e0 sa vie, \u00e0 son corps, \u00e0 ses membres, sa sant\u00e9 ou sa r\u00e9putation, le savant juge d\u00e9clare que, sous cette rubrique, il y a lieu d\u2019inclure la r\u00e9clamation pour s\u00e9duction, mais non celle pour frais de g\u00e9sine. Quant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il faut entendre par ces mots frais de g\u00e9sine, il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration qu\u2019en donne Sir Mathias Tellier (dissident) dans Forsyth v. Boyce, supra, \u00e0 la page 283:\nCe sont les frais du m\u00e9decin ou des m\u00e9decins dont la fille a eu besoin pour son accouchement; ceux de l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re ou des infirmi\u00e8res; ceux de l\u2019hospitalisation, quand il y en a eu; le co\u00fbt des m\u00e9dicaments et, sans doute, le co\u00fbt des aliments de la malade.\nCes frais que la m\u00e8re peut r\u00e9clamer, poursuit M. le juge Rinfret, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s dans Forsyth v. Boyce et Miss A. v. A., supra, non pas comme dommages, mais comme aliments dus \u00e0 l\u2019enfant; d\u2019o\u00f9 il suit que l\u2019action qui les r\u00e9clame ne peut \u00eatre entendue par un jury parce que n\u2019\u00e9tant pas l\u2019une des actions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019art. 421 C.P.C.\nDissident, M. le juge Choquette exprime ses vues comme suit:\nLa question en litige est clairement expos\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue M. le juge Rinfret. Je suis bien d\u2019accord que, lorsque les relations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 librement consenties, sans dol ni promesse de mariage et sans contravention au Code p\u00e9nal, les frais de g\u00e9sine r\u00e9sultant de ces relations ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s qu\u2019en vertu de la loi seule, et non en vertu d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou d\u2019un tort personnel. Dans ce cas, il ne peut \u00eatre question de proc\u00e8s par jury.\nMais si les frais de g\u00e9sine et de premiers soins \u00e0 l\u2019enfant r\u00e9sultent d\u2019une s\u00e9duction dolosive ou d\u2019un d\u00e9lit criminel, je ne vois pas pourquoi la femme ne pourrait pas les r\u00e9clamer aussi \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9coulant de ce dol ou \u00e0 (sic) ce d\u00e9lit.\nDans le cas actuel, l\u2019appelante fonde son action sur une s\u00e9duction dolosive et tous les montants qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame se rattachent \u00e0 cette s\u00e9duction. Aucune exception ni inscription en droit, totale ou partielle, ne paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 cette action. Dans ces conditions, je ne vois pas pourquoi l\u2019appelante se verrait refuser le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019article 421 C.P.\nIl appartiendra \u00e9videmment au jury ou au juge, suivant le cas, de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu s\u00e9duction ou non, si les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s sont une suite directe et imm\u00e9diate de cette s\u00e9duction et si l\u2019action est prescrite, en tout ou en partie. Nous n\u2019avons pas pour le moment \u00e0 trancher ces questions.\nDans les circonstances, je ferais droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens et accueillerais la requ\u00eate de la demanderesse. Frais r\u00e9serv\u00e9s.\nL\u2019appelante a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler de ce jugement.\nLa demanderesse fonde son action sur le fait d\u2019une s\u00e9duction suivie de grossesse et obtenue par des man\u0153uvres dolosives, des promesses de mariage fallacieuses et rompues sans juste motif. Il s\u2019agit donc, comme il est express\u00e9ment ou implicitement reconnu aux raisons de jugement en Cour d\u2019appel, d\u2019une action fond\u00e9e sur une s\u00e9duction dolosive, sur la faute. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous demander si, lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite, la demanderesse r\u00e9ussira ou non \u00e0 prouver cette s\u00e9duction, cette faute, ou \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s en sont une suite directe et imm\u00e9diate. Au stade o\u00f9 en est le proc\u00e8s, la seule question que nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est, ici comme en Cour d\u2019appel et en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, de savoir si la demanderesse a droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s par jury. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si, dans le cas d\u2019une s\u00e9duction dolosive suivie de grossesse, la femme qui en est victime peut, en droit, r\u00e9clamer, \u00e0 titre de dommages r\u00e9sultant de torts personnels, ses frais de g\u00e9sine par l\u2019action que l\u2019art. 1053 C.C. accorde \u00e0 toute personne qui, par suite de d\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits, subit un tort personnel ou si elle ne peut les r\u00e9clamer, qu\u2019\u00e0 titre d\u2019aliments ou autre mais non \u00e0 titre de dommages, par l\u2019action qui nous vient de l\u2019ancien droit et dont l\u2019existence est reconnue par l\u2019art. 2261 C.C. A la solution de cette question, je ne trouve gu\u00e8re d\u2019assistance aux arr\u00eats de Forsyth v. Boyce et Miss A. v. A., supra. Dans ces deux causes, la question qui nous occupe ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit, en effet, de cas, o\u00f9 apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite, on jugea que la preuve d\u00e9montrait, non pas que la demanderesse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de man\u0153uvres dolosives, mais qu\u2019elle avait donn\u00e9 un consentement libre et volontaire aux relations sexuelles. En tel cas, assur\u00e9ment, la femme n\u2019a aucun droit d\u2019action, en vertu de 1053 C.C., pour r\u00e9clamer, \u00e0 titre de dommages, quoi que ce soit, frais de g\u00e9sine ou autres, puisqu\u2019elle a, elle-m\u00eame, particip\u00e9 librement, volontairement, sans influence indue, sans dol ou sans violence, \u00e0 causer l\u2019acte d\u2019o\u00f9 r\u00e9sulte le pr\u00e9judice dont elle se plaint. Dans ce cas elle peut, cependant, recourir au droit d\u2019action que, indiff\u00e9remment du caract\u00e8re de la s\u00e9duction, reconna\u00eet l\u2019art. 2261 C.C. et r\u00e9clamer, de l\u2019auteur de sa grossesse, non pas \u00e0 titre de dommages mais \u00e0 titre d\u2019aliments ou autre, les frais aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 sa grossesse et \u00e0 l\u2019accouchement. C\u2019est que cette action, tant en raison des motifs qui l\u2019inspirent que de sa propre nature, n\u2019est pas une action en dommages mais une action sanctionnant l\u2019inobservation de l\u2019obligation que la loi impose, \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de la grossesse, de payer les frais m\u00e9dicaux, pharmaceutiques, d\u2019hospitalisation et tous autres, employ\u00e9s aux soins de la femme qui doit accoucher et aux premiers secours de son enfant. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un recours ind\u00e9pendant mais dont l\u2019existence ne touche en rien au droit de recourir \u00e0 celui qui sanctionne la violation du devoir de ne pas nuire \u00e0 autrui, dans les cas o\u00f9 sont r\u00e9unies toutes les conditions de l\u2019art. 1053 C.C. Aussi bien, et comme le peut toute personne qui, par suite de d\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits, subit des dommages r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un tort personnel, la femme victime d\u2019un dol ou d\u2019un viol, par exemple, peut invoquer l\u2019art. 1053 C.C. pour obtenir r\u00e9paration compl\u00e8te de l\u2019entier pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle en souffre, ce qui ne saurait exclure la r\u00e9clamation de tous les frais que lui font n\u00e9cessairement encourir sa grossesse, son accouchement et les premiers secours qu\u2019elle doit- donner \u00e0 son enfant. En somme, la demanderesse, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, fonde son action sur la faute, et tous les montants qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame, sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de dommages r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un tort personnel se rattachant \u00e0 cette faute. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019une action qui, suivant l\u2019art. 421 de l\u2019ancien Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre instruite par un juge et un jury. A ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure, on ne saurait priver la demanderesse de son droit \u00e0 ce mode d\u2019instruction, en faisant appel \u00e0 des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques qui peuvent ne pas se produire et que de toute fa\u00e7on, il appartiendra au juge, qui pourra \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 les consid\u00e9rer, d\u2019en disposer suivant les prescriptions du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure si, toutefois, elles se produisaient. On ne saurait davantage faire appel aux dispositions de ce nouveau Code pour d\u00e9cider du m\u00e9rite d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et jug\u00e9e en Cour sup\u00e9rieure au temps o\u00f9 l\u2019ancien Code r\u00e9gissait la mati\u00e8re, ce dont, d\u2019ailleurs et \u00e0 bon droit, les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel et les parties se sont gard\u00e9s, bien que le nouveau Code soit entr\u00e9 en vigueur alors que l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait pendante en Cour d\u2019appel.\nEn tout respect pour l\u2019opinion contraire et d\u2019accord avec toutes les raisons donn\u00e9es et les r\u00e9serves faites par M. le juge Choquette, je suis d\u2019opinion qu\u2019on aurait d\u00fb faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate faite par la demanderesse afin que la cause soit plac\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial des proc\u00e8s par jury.\nPour ces raisons, je maintiendrais l\u2019appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel et celui de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, et accorderais la requ\u00eate de la demanderesse-appelante. Avec d\u00e9pens.\nLE JUGE PIGEON (dissident):\u2014Le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure confirm\u00e9 avec une dissidence par la Cour d\u2019appel, a refus\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s par jury requis par la demanderesse. Dans son action, celle-ci pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9duite par le d\u00e9fendeur et avoir ult\u00e9rieurement donn\u00e9 le jour \u00e0 un enfant dont elle soutient qu\u2019il est le p\u00e8re. Dans les pi\u00e8ces de plaidoirie il est admis que les parties ont eu des relations intimes du mois de juin 1960 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019automne 1962 sinon davantage, et l\u2019enfant est n\u00e9 le 31 juillet 1963. Au para. 14 de la d\u00e9claration, la demanderesse all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle \u00aba d\u00fb encourir des frais de g\u00e9sine et pourvoir aux premiers besoins de son enfant\u00bb et elle r\u00e9clame de ce chef des sommes qui forment un total de $1,414.62. Ensuite au para. 16, elle all\u00e8gue que \u00abpar sa s\u00e9duction et son l\u00e2che abandon\u00bb le d\u00e9fendeur lui a caus\u00e9 des dommages s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 $45,000. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019action r\u00e9clame une somme totale de $46,414.62 que la demanderesse dit lui \u00eatre due \u00abpour injures personnelles\u00bb.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait \u00e0 ce sujet les observations suivantes:\nIl est \u00e0 noter que la demanderesse r\u00e9clame sous deux chefs d\u2019action diff\u00e9rents, soit pour frais de g\u00e9sine la somme de $1,414.62, soit pour dommages encourus \u00e0 la suite de la s\u00e9duction le montant de $45,000.\nLe Tribunal croit qu\u2019il faut distinguer entre le recours pour frais de g\u00e9sine, qui trouve sa source dans la loi et est d\u2019une nature alimentaire, et celui pour dommages \u00e0 la suite de s\u00e9duction qui r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit. Bien que la m\u00e8re puisse poursuivre personnellement pour s\u00e9duction et frais de g\u00e9sine, il reste que cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9clamation concerne d\u2019abord l\u2019enfant et que s\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas \u00e0 proprement parler d\u2019aliments que l\u2019enfant puisse demander, mais d\u2019une assistance, le recours est toutefois ind\u00e9pendant de celui que la m\u00e8re pourrait pr\u00e9tendre pour elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 la suite de la s\u00e9duction (ANDR\u00c9 NADEAU, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec, Vol. 8, pp. 174 et seq., Nos. 191 et seq., FORSYTH v. BOYCE (1939) 67 B.R. 270\u2014les juges Tellier et Rivard dissidents; MISS A. v. A., 1945 B.R. 545).\nCe raisonnement me para\u00eet inattaquable et conforme \u00e0 une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie quant \u00e0 la nature du recours pour frais de g\u00e9sine. Depuis longtemps les tribunaux du Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9cident uniform\u00e9ment que la fille-m\u00e8re peut exercer ce recours contre le p\u00e8re de son enfant, qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9duite ou non. Il ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer dans la pr\u00e9sente cause si, au cas de s\u00e9duction, les frais de g\u00e9sine sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de dommages d\u00e9coulant du d\u00e9lit au lieu de l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 titre d\u2019aliments dus par le fait de la paternit\u00e9. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019action de la demanderesse les r\u00e9clame clairement \u00e0 ce second titre. M\u00eame en admettant qu\u2019ils y soient \u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9s alternativement \u00e0 titre de dommages, il n\u2019en reste pas moins certain que, pour ce qui est des frais de g\u00e9sine, l\u2019action est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on que le tribunal devra les accorder \u00e0 titre d\u2019aliments s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que le d\u00e9fendeur est le p\u00e8re de l\u2019enfant m\u00eame si la s\u00e9duction n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9e ou s\u2019ils n\u2019en d\u00e9coulent pas. A l\u2019audition, le procureur de l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 que telle soit la nature de la demande. Il faut donc dire que la poursuite que l\u2019on veut faire instruire devant un jury est une r\u00e9clamation de dommages pour s\u00e9duction et aussi de frais de g\u00e9sine d\u00e9coulant de la paternit\u00e9 de l\u2019enfant et dus m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de s\u00e9duction. La jurisprudence sur le droit au proc\u00e8s par jury dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec est fix\u00e9e dans le sens que pour qu\u2019une cause soit susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi instruite, il est n\u00e9cessaire que toute la demande soit comprise dans la cat\u00e9gorie des litiges qui peuvent faire l\u2019objet de ce genre de proc\u00e8s. Aucun des juges de la Cour du banc de la reine n\u2019a mis en doute ce principe que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance applique en citant l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel dans Lacoste c. Dame Emrick[4].\nPlus que cela, le juge dissident ne nie pas que les frais de g\u00e9sine dus par le p\u00e8re en l\u2019absence de s\u00e9duction soient recouvrables \u00aben vertu de la loi seule, et non en vertu d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou d\u2019un tort personnel\u00bb. Il ajoute m\u00eame: \u00abdans ce cas il ne peut \u00eatre question de proc\u00e8s par jury\u00bb. Le seul motif de sa dissidence c\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, l\u2019appelante fonde son action \u00absur une s\u00e9duction dolosive et tous les montants qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame se rattachent \u00e0 cette s\u00e9duction\u00bb. C\u2019est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne puis le suivre. Le plus que l\u2019on puisse dire c\u2019est, comme on l\u2019a vu, que la demanderesse les r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement du chef de la s\u00e9duction tout en les r\u00e9clamant aussi du chef de la paternit\u00e9. Devant la d\u00e9claration r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme elle l\u2019est le tribunal, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas s\u00e9duction ou que les frais de g\u00e9sine n\u2019en d\u00e9coulent pas mais que par ailleurs la paternit\u00e9 est prouv\u00e9e, devra n\u00e9cessairement accueillir l\u2019action pour ceux des montants r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de frais de g\u00e9sine qui seront prouv\u00e9s et jug\u00e9s recouvrables \u00e0 ce titre. La Cour ne pourra certainement pas rejeter l\u2019action en entier dans de telles circonstances.\nIl me para\u00eet \u00e0 propos ici d\u2019expliquer pourquoi il n\u2019est pas impossible en la pr\u00e9sente instance que les frais de g\u00e9sine ne d\u00e9coulent pas de la s\u00e9duction m\u00eame si elle est prouv\u00e9e de m\u00eame que la paternit\u00e9. C\u2019est qu\u2019il est admis qu\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 presque deux ans et demi entre les premi\u00e8res relations et le d\u00e9but de la grossesse. M\u00eame si les premi\u00e8res relations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues par s\u00e9duction, il peut se faire que celles qui ont provoqu\u00e9 la grossesse doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 librement consenties et constituent par cons\u00e9quent une cause distincte (novus actus interveniens). Cela seul suffirait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer conclusivement que pour les frais de g\u00e9sine, une cause d\u2019action distincte du d\u00e9lit de s\u00e9duction est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, savoir la paternit\u00e9. Cette cause d\u2019action n\u2019est pas un d\u00e9lit et, ainsi qu\u2019on est unanime \u00e0 le dire en Cour d\u2019appel comme en premi\u00e8re instance, elle n\u2019est pas une cause d\u2019action susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre instruite devant un jury.\nSuivant l\u2019art. 427 du Code de proc\u00e9dure en vigueur lors de la demande de proc\u00e8s par jury en cette cause le juge le pr\u00e9sidant, s\u2019il \u00e9tait accord\u00e9, devrait obligatoirement, comme l\u2019ordonne encore l\u2019art. 371 du nouveau Code, formuler les questions auxquelles le jury serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre. Selon l\u2019usage invariable, ces questions sont toujours formul\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 demander une r\u00e9ponse appropri\u00e9e dans chaque alternative impliqu\u00e9e dans la contestation. Ici apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 comme premi\u00e8re question s\u2019il y a eu s\u00e9duction et naissance d\u2019un enfant en cons\u00e9quence le juge ne pourrait pas omettre de pr\u00e9voir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative, il ne pourrait pas dire: \u00abC\u2019est une situation hypoth\u00e9tique qui peut ne pas se produire?\u00bb C\u2019est une alternative que la contestation l\u2019oblige \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer. Or il ne pourrait certainement pas demander au jury dans cette alternative de dire si le d\u00e9fendeur est le p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant pour la naissance duquel la demanderesse a subi des frais de g\u00e9sine. Ce n\u2019est pas une question susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre soumise \u00e0 un jury. Va-t-on dire que le juge devrait alors retirer la cause du jury et la juger seul? C\u2019est ce que l\u2019ancien Code ne permettait pas et ce serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation uniform\u00e9ment donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la loi r\u00e9gissant les proc\u00e8s par jury dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec depuis leur introduction en 1785.\nUne revue de la jurisprudence du Qu\u00e9bec sur le droit au proc\u00e8s par jury fait voir que, d\u00e8s 1856, on d\u00e9cidait en revision qu\u2019une action en d\u00e9claration de paternit\u00e9 et dommages n\u2019est pas susceptible de ce mode d\u2019instruction. Clarke c. McGrath[5]. Cela n\u2019est pas sans importance car, depuis la premi\u00e8re loi \u00e0 ce sujet en 1785 (25 Geo. III, c. 2, art. 9) jusqu\u2019au nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile mis en vigueur le 1er septembre 1966, l\u2019expression employ\u00e9e dans la version anglaise pour d\u00e9crire la seule cat\u00e9gorie de recours o\u00f9 cette demande peut \u00eatre comprise a \u00e9t\u00e9 substantiellement la m\u00eame: \u00abdamages on personal wrongs\u00bb. Le statut de 1785 disait en fran\u00e7ais \u00abdommages dans (les actions) d\u2019injures personnelles\u00bb. Les Statuts refondus du Bas\u2011Canada 1860 disent: \u00abtorts personnels qui doivent \u00eatre compens\u00e9s en dommages\u00bb\u2014\u00abpersonal wrongs proper to be compensated in damages\u00bb; le Code de proc\u00e9dure de 1867 et celui de 1897: \u00abdommages r\u00e9sultant de torts personnels\u00bb\u2014\u00abdamages resulting from personal wrongs\u00bb; le nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile: \u00abdommages \u00e0 la personne\u00bb\u2014\u00abdamages resulting from personal injuries\u00bb (art. 332).\nIl faut noter que lorsque la l\u00e9gislature a \u00e9dict\u00e9 le Code de proc\u00e9dure de 1897 elle a reproduit sans changement le texte ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la jurisprudence \u00e9tait bien fix\u00e9e dans le sens que le droit au proc\u00e8s par jury n\u2019existe que si toute la demande est susceptible de ce mode d\u2019instruction. La loi du Qu\u00e9bec sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des statuts ne renferme pas, comme celle du Canada et de la plupart des provinces, une disposition d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que le Parlement n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9 adopter l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation jurisprudentielle en r\u00e9-\u00e9dictant un texte l\u00e9gislatif. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut consid\u00e9rer que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du texte sans modification consacre d\u00e9finitivement l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par les tribunaux. Dans La Malbaie c. Boulianne[6], le juge Rinfret (avant de devenir juge en chef) disait \u00e0 pp. 389-390:\nPendant que la jurisprudence et la pratique de la province de Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019affirmaient ainsi avec persistance, le Code Municipal a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement refondu en 1916. C\u2019est le code que nous avons actuellement. A cette \u00e9poque, les d\u00e9cisions de nos tribunaux avaient invariablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019article 743 du code (maintenant l\u2019article 670) de la fa\u00e7on que nous avons montr\u00e9e; et cependant, en 1916, la l\u00e9gislature n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 le texte de l\u2019article dans le but d\u2019indiquer une intention contraire \u00e0 celle que lui avait donn\u00e9e la jurisprudence.\nA cet \u00e9gard, nous tenons \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 ce que dit le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Casgrain v. Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. (1895 A.C. 282, at 300):\nTheir Lordships cannot assume that the Dominion Legislature, when they adopted the clause verbatim in the year 1888, were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must, on the contrary, be assumed that they understood that sect. 12 of the Canadian Act must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation. In these circumstances their Lordships, even if they had entertained doubts as to the meaning of sect. 12 of the Act of 1888, would have declined to disturb the construction of its language which had been judicially affirmed.\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau r\u00e9affirm\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on encore plus pr\u00e9cise, si possible, par le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Webb v. Outrim (1907 A.C. 80, at 89), o\u00f9 nous trouvons ce passage, que nous extrayons du jugement prononc\u00e9 par le Lord Chancelier, The Earl of Halsbury:\nIt is quite true, as observed by Griffith C.J., in the above-mentioned case of D\u2019Emden v. Pedder (1903, I Commonwealth L.R. 91, at 110) that: \u201cWhen a particular form of legislative enactment which has received authoritative interpretation, whether by judicial decision or by a long course of practice, is adopted in the framing of a later statute, it is a sound rule of construction to hold that the words so adopted were intended by the Legislature to bear the meaning which has been so put upon them.\u201d\nIl faut souligner que refuser le proc\u00e8s par jury en cette cause ce n\u2019est pas priver la demanderesse d\u2019un droit. Au Qu\u00e9bec ce mode d\u2019instruction n\u2019est pas la r\u00e8gle mais l\u2019exception. On n\u2019y a droit que dans les cas pr\u00e9vus; si la demande est telle qu\u2019elle n\u2019entre pas en entier dans les cat\u00e9gories \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es, ce droit n\u2019existe pas. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous demander s\u2019il est possible de formuler une action pour s\u00e9duction de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas y inclure une demande de frais de g\u00e9sine sans s\u00e9duction dolosive, il suffit de constater que l\u2019action dont il s\u2019agit n\u2019est pas ainsi formul\u00e9e.\nJe conclus donc au rejet de l\u2019appel mais sans frais vu la nature du litige, les faits admis ou prouv\u00e9s par \u00e9crit et la r\u00e9probation qu\u2019il convient de manifester \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9talage dans la d\u00e9fense de d\u00e9tails sordides manifestement destin\u00e9s \u00e0 accabler la femme \u00e0 laquelle le d\u00e9fendeur a pendant plus de deux ans et demi chant\u00e9 son amour et dont il a pendant tout ce temps re\u00e7u les faveurs.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens, LE JUGE PIGEON \u00e9tant dissident.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, appelante: Beaudet & Gratton, Victoriaville.\nProcureur du d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9: J.L.

The petitioner applied for a rehearing of his application for an extension of time. It appeared that the delay in presenting the application for leave to appeal was not attributable to counsel who had made that application but was due to the negligence of the attorneys who, at that time, were representing the petitioner. The Court then decided to suspend its decision on the application for a rehearing and to hear counsel on the application for leave to appeal.\nHeld: The application for a rehearing should be dismissed.\nAssuming that the application for a rehearing could be granted in this case, the application for an extension of time and for leave to appeal could not be granted. The questions raised by the petitioner, on his application for leave to appeal, were not, as required by s. 597(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, questions of law in the strict sense.\nAPPLICATION for a rehearing of a motion for extension of time and leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, which had been refused by this Court.

Cet appel fut rejet\u00e9 le 10 mars 1966 par la Cour d\u2019appel1 alors compos\u00e9e de MM. les juges Pratte, Hyde, Rinfret, Owen et Brossard qui furent unanimes \u00e0 juger que le juge au proc\u00e8s avait devant lui une preuve suffisante pour identifier Boyer comme l\u2019un des deux individus ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la commission des infractions ci-dessus.\nPar la suite et \u00e0 divers intervalles de temps entre le 5 avril 1966 et le 23 mai 1968, on produisit, au bureau du R\u00e9gistraire de cette Cour, certaines des pi\u00e8ces de proc\u00e9dure dont la production est requise dans le cas d\u2019une demande de permission d\u2019appeler faite en vertu de l\u2019art. 597(1)(b) du Code criminel. C\u2019est ainsi que le 6 avril 1966 on d\u00e9posa cinq copies d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour obtenir une extension de d\u00e9lai et permission d\u2019appeler. Rapportable le 26 avril 1966, cette requ\u00eate ne fut pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 cette date. Ce n\u2019est que le 29 avril 1968 que furent produits le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel et les raisons donn\u00e9es au soutien et ce n\u2019est que le 17 mai 1968 qu\u2019on donna avis aux personnes concern\u00e9es que la requ\u00eate, dont copies furent produites en avril 1966, serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour le 27 mai 1968. C\u2019est \u00e0 cette date que la Cour fut saisie de la requ\u00eate pour obtenir une extension de d\u00e9lai et une permission d\u2019appeler du jugement prononc\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel le 10 mars 1966.\nApr\u00e8s avoir entendu Me Beaudry, alors procureur de Boyer, sur la demande d\u2019extension de d\u00e9lai et s\u2019\u00eatre retir\u00e9e pour d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer, la Cour d\u00e9clara qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de raisons sp\u00e9ciales justifiant d\u2019accorder, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire de plus de deux ans \u00e0 celui de vingt et un jours pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 597(1)(b) et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e.\nEn septembre dernier, la Cour, ayant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 une lettre re\u00e7ue de Boyer comme une demande de r\u00e9-audition de la requ\u00eate ci-dessus, donna instructions au R\u00e9gistraire d\u2019informer l\u2019inculp\u00e9, ainsi que le Ministre de la Justice de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le procureur de la Couronne, ceux de l\u2019inculp\u00e9 et leurs agents, que cette demande serait entendue le premier jour de la session d\u2019octobre, soit le 1er de ce mois. Advenant cette date, les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s ou leurs agents se pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Cour. Me Lagac\u00e9, procureur de la Couronne, objecta \u00e0 cette demande de r\u00e9-audition et au cours de la r\u00e9ponse faite \u00e0 cette objection par Me Beaudry, il est apparu que le d\u00e9faut de faire, en temps utile, le n\u00e9cessaire pour pr\u00e9senter la requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler \u00e9tait imputable \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence, non pas de Me Beaudry qui n\u2019agissait pas alors pour Boyer, mais des procureurs qui \u00e0 ce temps \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. La Cour d\u00e9cida alors de suspendre son jugement sur la demande de r\u00e9-audition et, sous cette r\u00e9serve, d\u2019entendre ce que les procureurs pouvaient avoir \u00e0 soumettre sur la requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler.\nAu soutien de cette requ\u00eate, on invoqua deux moyens:\n(i) au regard des r\u00e8gles jurisprudentielles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019identification et \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense d\u2019alibi, il y a absence de preuve d\u2019identification;\n(ii) en droit, une personne ne peut \u00eatre simultan\u00e9ment trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019attentat \u00e0 la pudeur et de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la m\u00eame personne.\nApr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages auxquels le juge au proc\u00e8s ajouta foi, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que ces t\u00e9moignages lui permettaient de conclure, comme il Ta fait, \u00e0 l\u2019identification de Boyer et au rejet de sa d\u00e9fense d\u2019alibi. Suivant ces t\u00e9moignages, il appert particuli\u00e8rement que Boyer et son complice sont demeur\u00e9s environ deux heures au domicile de Cadotte et que pendant une demi-heure, alors que la jeune fille \u00e9tait la victime de l\u2019attentat commis sur elle par Boyer qui avait enlev\u00e9 son masque, elle a pu observer son visage et noter la d\u00e9formation dont son nez, par suite de plusieurs fractures, \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 et elle a pu ult\u00e9rieurement, sans qu\u2019aucune suggestion ne lui soit faite, identifier Boyer comme l\u2019un des participants \u00e0 la commission des crimes ci-dessus. En ce qui concerne le second moyen, il faut retenir que l\u2019attentat \u00e0 la pudeur et l\u2019acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis successivement, l\u2019un par l\u2019inculp\u00e9 et l\u2019autre par son complice. Ce sont l\u00e0 deux infractions distinctes et les t\u00e9moignages accept\u00e9s par le juge au proc\u00e8s lui permettaient de conclure que ces deux infractions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises dans des circonstances rendant Boyer et son complice parties \u00e0 chacune.\nLes questions sur lesquelles une permission d\u2019appeler peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 597(1)(b) doivent \u00eatre strictement des questions de droit. Tel n\u2019est pas le caract\u00e8re des questions soulev\u00e9es de la part du requ\u00e9rant.\nPrenant pour acquis que la demande de r\u00e9-audition peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la requ\u00eate pour extension de d\u00e9lai et permission d\u2019appeler ne peut \u00eatre accueillie. Cette requ\u00eate est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nRequ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant: Gr\u00e9goire, Dansereau, Daoust, Duceppe, Allaire, Perron, Beaudry, Blais, D\u00e9sormeau & Beaudry, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9: Le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1966] B.R. 596."

Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le d\u00e9cret prohibe toute vente le lundi avant une heure de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Le comit\u00e9 paritaire a demand\u00e9 contre la compagnie appelante une injonction lui enjoignant de cesser d\u2019enfreindre le d\u00e9cret. L\u2019appelante a contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret pour le motif que plusieurs articles exc\u00e9deraient les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi au Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil, que le d\u00e9cret ne peut exister sans ces articles et que par cons\u00e9quent il est ultra vires dans sa totalit\u00e9. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 le d\u00e9cret invalide, mais ce jugement fut renvers\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel, qui a d\u00e9cern\u00e9 l\u2019injonction. La compagnie en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe fait que l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la convention collective \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la proclamation du d\u00e9cret ne la rend pas sans valeur juridique. On ne peut pas non plus dire que, pour cette raison, la convention n\u2019a pas acquis une signification et une importance pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rantes. Puisque la Loi des d\u00e9crets de convention collective n\u2019exige pas express\u00e9ment que la convention soit entr\u00e9e en vigueur avant qu\u2019un d\u00e9cret puisse \u00eatre rendu, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache que la convention soit soumise \u00e0 une condition suspensive. C\u2019est au ministre qu\u2019il appartient de juger si ce facteur a pour cons\u00e9quence de priver la convention du degr\u00e9 d\u2019importance qui justifie un d\u00e9cret.\nPar l\u2019amendement de 1960 \u00e0 la Loi de la convention collective (8-9 Eliz. II, c. 71, art. 1), la l\u00e9gislature a voulu autoriser la fixation par d\u00e9cret des jours ouvrables et des heures de travail dans les magasins. Comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pouvoir express\u00e9ment accord\u00e9 par un texte qui fait allusion \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation du commerce, on ne peut certainement pas soutenir que le d\u00e9cret attaqu\u00e9 fait indirectement la r\u00e9glementation du commerce sous couleur de r\u00e9glementation des heures de travail.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie: On ne peut pas soutenir que le d\u00e9cret est invalide parce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend s\u2019appliquer aux \u00e9tablissements n\u2019ayant pas d\u2019employ\u00e9s. La d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur dans le d\u00e9cret ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme devant s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 une personne qui n\u2019est pas un employeur au sens de la d\u00e9finition de ce mot dans la Loi, laquelle est restreinte \u00e0 celui qui fait ex\u00e9cuter un travail par un salari\u00e9. La d\u00e9finition dans le d\u00e9cret est apte \u00e0 recevoir la signification que le mot \u00abemployeur\u00bb est cens\u00e9 englober les personnes, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou corporations, qui font ex\u00e9cuter un travail par un salari\u00e9 et qui poss\u00e8dent ou exploitent un \u00e9tablissement commercial assujetti au d\u00e9cret.\nLe Juge Pigeon: La d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur dans le d\u00e9cret (art. 1.01, par. c) d\u00e9borde le cadre de celle que l\u2019on trouve \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1(f) de la Loi. Il n\u2019y a aucune raison d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter cette d\u00e9finition autrement que dans son sens litt\u00e9ral. Dans le d\u00e9cret, la d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme elle l\u2019est dans le but d\u2019assujettir \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation propos\u00e9e tous les \u00e9tablissements de la cat\u00e9gorie d\u00e9crite, qu\u2019ils aient des employ\u00e9s ou non, et aussi d\u2019assujettir aux dispositions relatives aux heures d\u2019ouverture et de fermeture ceux qui travaillent \u00e0 leur compte aussi bien que les autres. Cependant, ce vice de la d\u00e9finition n\u2019entra\u00eene pas la nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret. Il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte aucune cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9judiciable. La disposition prohibant toute vente le lundi avant une heure (art. 3.05) vise uniquement le travail effectu\u00e9 par des salari\u00e9s. Pour la m\u00eame raison, la d\u00e9finition \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2.00 de ce qui constitue un \u00e9tablissement commercial ne peut pas \u00eatre une cause d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Les art. 7.03 et 7.04 du d\u00e9cret ne sont pas discriminatoires. Rien dans la loi ne d\u00e9finit de quelle mani\u00e8re le salaire peut \u00eatre r\u00e9glement\u00e9.\nLabour\u2014Collective agreement\u2014Decree respecting the retail food trade, Montreal region\u2014Working hours\u2014Sales forbidden on Monday up to one o\u2019clock\u2014Validity of the decree\u2014Collective Agreement Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 163\u2014Collective Agreement Decrees Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 143, ss. 2, 6.\nThe decree respecting the retail food trade in the Montreal region, enacted on May 4, 1965, pursuant to the Collective Agreement Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 163 [now Collective Agreement Decrees Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 143] determines, inter alia, the hours during which the personnel of the establishments subject to the decree can sell the products. More specifically, the decree forbids all sales until one o\u2019clock of each Monday. The Parity Committee applied for an injunction ordering the appellant company to cease to infringe the decree. The appellant contested the validity of the decree on the ground that a number of its provisions were beyond the powers conferred on the Lieutenant-Governor in Council by the Act, that these provisions were not severable and that consequently the decree was ultra vires in toto. The Superior Court held that the decree was invalid, but its judgment was reversed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal which granted the injunction. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe contention that the decree had no legal existence because the coming into force of the collective agreement was dependent upon the proclamation of the decree, could not be entertained. Nor could the decree be attacked on the basis that the collective agreement had not acquired a preponderant significance and importance. Since the Collective Agreement Decrees Act does not expressly require that a collective agreement take effect before the adoption of a decree, a convention with a suspensive condition is permitted. The Minister is charged with deciding whether this factor deprives the collective agreement of the degree of importance necessary to justify a decree.\nIt was clear from the wording of the amendment of 1960 to the Collective Agreement Act (8-9 Eliz. II, c. 71, s. 1) that the legislature intended to authorize the setting by decree of the working days and hours of work in the commercial establishments. Since this power was expressly granted with reference to the regulation of trade, it could not be said that the decree in question indirectly regulates the trade under the guise of regulating the hours of work.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The contention that the decree was invalid because it purported to apply to establishments in which there were no employees, could not be entertained. The definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in the decree ought not to be construed as extending to someone who is not an employer within the definition contained in the Act, which is restricted to those who have work done by an employee. The definition in the decree is capable of receiving the meaning that the word \u201cemployer\u201d was intended to encompass those persons, companies or corporations, who have work done by employees, which own or operate commercial establishments subject to the decree. Per Pigeon J.: The definition of employer in the decree (art. 1.01, para. c) goes beyond the definition of that word in s. 1(f) of the Act. There is no reason to interpret this definition otherwise than in its literal meaning. In the decree, the definition of employer has been so worded as to make the establishments therein described, whether they have employees or not, subject to the proposed regulations, and also to make those persons doing business in their own account as well as all others subject to the provisions relating to working hours. However, this defect in the definition has no prejudicial result and does not affect the validity of the decree. The provision prohibiting sales on Monday before one o\u2019clock (art. 3.05) is aimed exclusively at the work done by wage earners. For the same reason, the definition in art. 2.00 of what constitutes a commercial establishment cannot be a cause of invalidity. Articles 7.03 and 7.04 of the decree are not discriminatory. There is nothing in the Act which determines the manner in which salaries were to be regulated.\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing judgments of Duranleau J.

A decree having this scope was, it was submitted, beyond the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to enact under the provisions of the Collective Agreement Decrees Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 143. Section 2 of that statute provides:\n2. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may order that a collective agreement respecting any trade, industry, commerce or occupation shall also bind all the employees and employers in the Province or in a stated region of the Province, within the scope determined in such decree.\nThe definition in question is as follows:\nEmployer: The term \u201cemployer\u201d designates any person, company or corporation owning or operating a commercial establishment subject to this decree.\n\u201cCommercial establishment\u201d is defined thus:\nCommercial establishment: The term \u201ccommercial establishment\u201d designates any establishment located within the territorial jurisdiction of this decree where food products are sold on a retail basis, for outside consumption.\nThe word \u201cemployer\u201d, standing by itself, would mean a person who employs the services of one or more other persons. That is the sense in which it is defined in the Collective Agreement Decrees Act:\n1. (f) \u201cemployer\u201d includes any individual, partnership, firm or corporation who or which has work done by an employee.\nIn my opinion the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d contained in the decree ought not to be construed as extending to someone who is not an employer within the definition contained in the Act. In McKay v. The Queen[2], Cartwright J., as he then was, refers to a rule of construction which is properly applicable in this case:\nThe second applicable rule of construction is that if an enactment, whether of Parliament or of a legislature or of a subordinate body to which legislative power is delegated, is capable of receiving a meaning according to which its operation is restricted to matters within the power of the enacting body it shall be interpreted accordingly.\nThe definition in the decree is capable of receiving the meaning that the word \u201cemployer\u201d was intended to encompass those persons, companies or corporations, who have work done by employees, which own or operate commercial establishments subject to the decree. I agree with the view expressed on this point, in the Court of Appeal, by Choquette J.:\nLa d\u00e9finition du mot \u00abemployeur\u00bb dans le d\u00e9cret ne saurait modifier le sens donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce terme par la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e (art. 1, f); cette d\u00e9finition ne fait en somme que pr\u00e9ciser le genre d\u2019\u00e9tablissement commercial que cet employeur (personne, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou corporation) doit poss\u00e9der ou exploiter pour \u00eatre assujetti au d\u00e9cret. Il n\u2019en reste pas moins une personne \u00abqui fait ex\u00e9cuter un travail par un salari\u00e9\u00bb.\nI would dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Pigeon.\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014Dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, le Comit\u00e9 Paritaire de l\u2019Alimentation au D\u00e9tail, R\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00able Comit\u00e9\u00bb) a demand\u00e9 contre l\u2019appelante Steinberg\u2019s Limit\u00e9e (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00abSteinberg\u2019s\u00bb) une injonction lui enjoignant en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cesser d\u2019enfreindre le d\u00e9cret relatif au commerce de l\u2019alimentation au d\u00e9tail pour la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00able d\u00e9cret\u00bb). Le d\u00e9cret, en date du 4 mai 1965, renferme non seulement des dispositions relatives \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e du travail et au salaire du personnel des magasins d\u2019alimentation dans la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al mais il fixe \u00e9galement les heures pendant lesquelles ce personnel peut travailler \u00e0 la vente de produits alimentaires. Aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, Steinberg\u2019s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 publiquement qu\u2019elle le consid\u00e9rait juridiquement invalide et ne respecterait pas les heures pr\u00e9vues. Elle a arr\u00eat\u00e9 les poursuites p\u00e9nales par bref de prohibition et le Comit\u00e9 a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 contre elle une injonction. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 le d\u00e9cret invalide, accueilli le bref de prohibition et rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019injonction. La Cour d\u2019appel[3], au contraire, a par un arr\u00eat majoritaire d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le d\u00e9cret valide, cass\u00e9 le bref de prohibition et d\u00e9cern\u00e9 l\u2019injonction.\nLes moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du d\u00e9cret sont en substance les suivants:\n1\u00b0 La convention collective qui a donn\u00e9 naissance au d\u00e9cret est sans valeur juridique parce que suivant ses termes, son entr\u00e9e en vigueur est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la proclamation d\u2019un d\u00e9cret;\n2\u00b0 Le d\u00e9cret a pour seul objet v\u00e9ritable de r\u00e9glementer non pas les relations de travail, mais le commerce d\u2019alimentation au d\u00e9tail; 3\u00b0 La convention collective n\u2019\u00e9tant pas entr\u00e9e en vigueur avant le d\u00e9cret, ne peut pas avoir acquis une signification et une importance pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rantes;\n4\u00b0 le d\u00e9cret renferme des dispositions qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre de la loi r\u00e9gissant ces d\u00e9crets et ces dispositions ne peuvent en \u00eatre invalid\u00e9es ind\u00e9pendamment du reste.\nLe premier et le troisi\u00e8me moyens peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9s simultan\u00e9ment car ils reposent tous deux sur la m\u00eame clause de la convention collective conclue le 27 novembre 1963, entre le Syndicat de l\u2019alimentation au d\u00e9tail de Montr\u00e9al (C.S.N.) et l\u2019Association des d\u00e9taillants en alimentation du Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (Section de Montr\u00e9al), savoir:\n8.00 La pr\u00e9sente convention prendra effet \u00e0 compter du jour de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du d\u00e9cret relatif au commerce de l\u2019alimentation au d\u00e9tail dans la r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine de Montr\u00e9al et demeurera en vigueur jusqu\u2019au trente et un mars mil neuf cent soixante-six inclusivement.\nL\u2019appelante soutient que, parce que la Loi de la convention collective (S.R.Q. 1941, ch. 163, aujourd\u2019hui Loi des d\u00e9crets de convention collective, S.R.Q. 1964, ch. 143) statue \u00e0 l\u2019article 2:\nIl est loisible au lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter qu\u2019une convention collective relative \u00e0 un m\u00e9tier, \u00e0 une industrie, \u00e0 un commerce ou \u00e0 une profession, lie \u00e9galement tous les salari\u00e9s et tous les employeurs\u2026\nun d\u00e9cret ne peut \u00eatre rendu sans qu\u2019une convention collective soit d\u2019abord entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Elle pr\u00e9tend en outre que le ministre ne peut pas, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019art. 6, juger \u00abque les dispositions de la convention ont acquis une signification et une importance pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rantes pour r\u00e9tablissement des conditions de travail\u00bb, si la convention n\u2019est pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 en vigueur.\nCes pr\u00e9tentions ne r\u00e9sistent pas \u00e0 l\u2019examen. Selon les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du droit, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache qu\u2019une convention soit subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 une condition suspensive. Un contrat existe d\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu m\u00eame si les obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent sont subordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 une condition. Cela r\u00e9sulte implicitement de l\u2019art. 1081 c.c. qui rend nulle l\u2019obligation conditionnelle dans le cas seulement d\u2019une \u00abcondition purement facultative de la part de celui qui s\u2019oblige\u00bb. Il est clair que la condition dont il s\u2019agit n\u2019est pas purement facultative en ce sens, puisque sa r\u00e9alisation d\u00e9pend de la volont\u00e9 d\u2019une autorit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure. Alors que le principe m\u00eame de la loi dont il s\u2019agit est de favoriser l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des conditions de travail en prot\u00e9geant contre la concurrence d\u00e9loyale les employeurs qui y consentent, il serait bien singulier que le texte ait pour effet implicite de les obliger \u00e0 accepter de subir cette concurrence tant qu\u2019un d\u00e9cret ne serait pas rendu. Cela peut signifier un temps consid\u00e9rable puisque, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an et demi entre la signature de la convention et l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du d\u00e9cret.\nDe m\u00eame on ne peut pas voir pourquoi le ministre ne pourrait pas juger qu\u2019une convention collective a acquis une signification et une importance pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rantes quand elle n\u2019est pas encore entr\u00e9e en vigueur. \u00c9videmment, la signification et l\u2019importance d\u2019une convention collective ne sont pas les m\u00eames lorsqu\u2019elle est conditionnelle que lorsqu\u2019elle ne l\u2019est pas, mais comment peut-on pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019elles sont inexistantes? Ce n\u2019est pas aux tribunaux mais au ministre qu\u2019il appartient de juger ces facteurs. La loi n\u2019exigeant pas express\u00e9ment que la convention soit entr\u00e9e en vigueur avant qu\u2019un d\u00e9cret puisse \u00eatre rendu, le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la libert\u00e9 des conventions doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 pour admettre une convention conditionnelle. C\u2019est au ministre qu\u2019il appartient de juger si ce facteur a pour cons\u00e9quence de priver la convention du degr\u00e9 d\u2019importance qui justifie un d\u00e9cret.\nTout comme le premier et le troisi\u00e8me moyens de l\u2019appelante reposent sur une unique pr\u00e9tention, les deux autres se ram\u00e8nent \u00e9galement \u00e0 soutenir que les dispositions du d\u00e9cret d\u00e9bordent le cadre fix\u00e9 par la loi. Pour \u00e9tudier cette question il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la loi dont il s\u2019agit et de faire une br\u00e8ve revue de son \u00e9volution en regard de certains arr\u00eats des tribunaux.\nLa l\u00e9gislation dont il s\u2019agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 au Qu\u00e9bec la premi\u00e8re loi de port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir des restrictions au principe de la libert\u00e9 des conventions, dans la d\u00e9termination des conditions de travail des salari\u00e9s. Elle fut d\u2019abord d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e sous le titre de \u00abLoi relative \u00e0 l\u2019extension des conventions collectives de travail\u00bb (1924\u201424 Geo. V, ch. 56), et fut remplac\u00e9e successivement, en 1937, par la \u00abLoi relative au salaire des ouvriers\u00bb (1 Geo. VI, ch. 49) et, en 1940, par la \u00abLoi de la convention collective\u00bb (4 Geo. VI, ch. 38).\nD\u00e8s l\u2019origine, la r\u00e8gle fut de ne pas rendre obligatoires pour tous les employeurs assujettis \u00e0 un d\u00e9cret toutes les conditions de travail stipul\u00e9es dans la convention collective dont l\u2019extension \u00e9tait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e, mais uniquement les dispositions relatives \u00e0 certaines mati\u00e8res telles que le salaire et la dur\u00e9e du travail. Dans la loi de 1937 intitul\u00e9e \u00abLoi relative au salaire des ouvriers\u00bb (1 Geo. VI, ch. 49) on ajouta cependant comme article 10 la disposition que Ton trouve encore, sous une forme modifi\u00e9e, au paragraphe 1 de ce m\u00eame article et qui permet de rendre obligatoires par d\u00e9cret certaines autres dispositions de la convention \u00abainsi que celles que le lieutenant\u2011gouverneur en conseil estime conformes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi\u00bb.\nPeu apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur de ce nouveau texte l\u00e9gislatif, un d\u00e9cret fut publi\u00e9 concernant l\u2019industrie de la r\u00e9paration de la chaussure. Par ce d\u00e9cret on voulut rendre obligatoires, en outre des salaires et heures de travail, les prix minimums \u00e0 \u00eatre charg\u00e9s au public pour ces r\u00e9parations. Cette disposition fut attaqu\u00e9e par bref de prohibition et d\u00e9clar\u00e9e invalide tant par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure que par un jugement unanime de la Cour d\u2019appel: Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Qu\u00e9bec c. Dame Lazarovitch[4]. L\u2019arr\u00eat, appliquant la r\u00e8gle ejusdem generis, d\u00e9cida que les dispositions \u00abconformes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi\u00bb comprenaient seulement des r\u00e8gles relatives aux relations entre employeur et salari\u00e9. Le passage suivant des notes du juge Barclay renferme l\u2019essentiel de la d\u00e9cision:\nUpon a true construction of the Act itself, it is clear that the object and purport of the Act is to regulate the relationship between employers and employees inter se, and when recognized bodies make what appears to be a reasonable agreement considering local conditions, their agreement may be extended to and enforced against all other(s) in the same industry, even though not parties to the agreement, and the Act is careful to set forth what kind of arrangements can be made obligatory under such circumstances. But the class of persons thus affected must be employers and employees only. Other individuals and the public at large are not concerned and are not contemplated.\nCe qui donne une autorit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision c\u2019est que la l\u00e9gislature a implicitement consacr\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation de la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la loi. En effet l\u2019arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu quelques jours seulement apr\u00e8s la sanction de la Loi de la convention collective (4 Geo. VI, ch. 38) dans laquelle l\u2019article 10 de la loi 1937 \u00e9tait reproduit pratique- ment sans modifications. L\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, on y ajoutait l\u2019alin\u00e9a suivant (5 Geo. V, ch. 60, art. 1):\nLe d\u00e9cret peut rendre obligatoires des prix minima \u00e0 \u00eatre charg\u00e9s au public pour les services des barbiers et coiffeurs.\nC\u2019est le cas de dire l\u2019exception confirme la r\u00e8gle.\nUn autre jugement doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre examin\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on particuli\u00e8re parce qu\u2019il fut lui aussi suivi d\u2019une modification de la loi. C\u2019est F.W. Woolworth Co. Ltd. c. La Cour des sessions de la paix[5]. Il s\u2019agissait \u00e9galement d\u2019un bref de prohibition \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un d\u00e9cret. Celui-ci fixait la dur\u00e9e du travail dans les magasins en d\u00e9terminant \u00ables heures du commencement et de cessation du travail de vente\u00bb. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure statua qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un r\u00e8glement de fermeture et que la loi ne le permettait pas. A la suite de ce jugement rendu le 4 ao\u00fbt 1959, la l\u00e9gislature, par une loi sanctionn\u00e9e le 10 mars 1960, ajoutait \u00e0 l\u2019article 9 de la loi les alin\u00e9as suivants (8-9 Elizabeth II, ch. 71, art. 1):\nSans restreindre la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, le d\u00e9cret rend obligatoire, relativement \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e du travail, entre autres dispositions de la convention collective, celles qui d\u00e9terminent les jours ou parties de jour ouvrables et non ouvrables, ainsi que l\u2019heure \u00e0 laquelle d\u00e9bute le travail d\u2019une journ\u00e9e et celle \u00e0 laquelle il se termine pour chaque cat\u00e9gorie de salari\u00e9s.\nToutefois, dans tout territoire o\u00f9 est en vigueur un r\u00e8glement de fermeture adopt\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi de la fermeture \u00e0 bonne heure ou de toute autre loi, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou sp\u00e9ciale, ayant trait au m\u00eame objet, l\u2019heure \u00e0 laquelle d\u00e9bute le travail d\u2019une journ\u00e9e et celle \u00e0 laquelle il se termine doivent \u00eatre incluses dans la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle ledit r\u00e8glement permet de tenir ouvert le commerce vis\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s cette addition \u00e0 la loi, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9cida unanimement qu\u2019un d\u00e9cret relatif aux distributeurs de pain de la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al interdisait valablement toute livraison le dimanche et le mercredi. Richstone Bakeries Inc. c. La Cour des sessions de la paix[6].\nIl semble \u00e9vident que, par l\u2019amendement de 1960, la l\u00e9gislature a voulu autoriser la fixation par d\u00e9cret des jours ouvrables et des heures de travail dans les magasins. Le renvoi \u00e0 la Loi de la fermeture \u00e0 bonne heure l\u2019implique n\u00e9cessairement, cette loi visant exclusivement ce genre d\u2019\u00e9tablissements de commerce. De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a dans lequel se trouve ce renvoi indique comment le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu concilier le pouvoir accord\u00e9 aux municipalit\u00e9s par cette loi-l\u00e0 avec celui qu\u2019elle attribue au lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil. Celui-ci ne peut pas fixer les heures de travail en dehors de la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle le r\u00e8glement municipal permet l\u2019ouverture de r\u00e9tablissement commercial. Si l\u2019on avait voulu que le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil ne puisse pas arr\u00eater des dispositions ayant pour effet de restreindre les heures d\u2019ouverture, on aurait s\u00fbrement r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le texte autrement. La disposition comme elle est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e implique clairement qu\u2019il le peut. Comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pouvoir express\u00e9ment accord\u00e9 par un texte qui fait allusion \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation du commerce, on ne peut certainement pas soutenir que le d\u00e9cret attaqu\u00e9 fait indirectement la r\u00e9glementation du commerce sous couleur de r\u00e9glementation des heures de travail. C\u2019est un effet que le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9vu et autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 la seule condition de ne pas chercher \u00e0 permettre le travail pendant les heures o\u00f9 la r\u00e9glementation municipale interdit le commerce.\nCette observation sur un point capital ne suffit pas cependant \u00e0 disposer du litige car il faut encore se demander si toutes les dispositions du d\u00e9cret relatives aux jours ouvrables et aux heures de travail sont effectivement autoris\u00e9es par la loi dont il s\u2019agit. Celles que l\u2019appelante a contest\u00e9es devant nous sont les suivantes:\n1\u00b0 La d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur (art. 1.01 par. c):\nLe terme \u00abemployeur\u00bb d\u00e9signe toute personne, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou corporation poss\u00e9dant ou exploitant un \u00e9tablissement commercial assujetti au pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9cret.\n2\u00b0 La d\u00e9finition du commerce vis\u00e9 (art. 2.00 par. a 2e al.):\nLe commerce de d\u00e9tail vis\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9cret comprend le colportage et toute vente ou livraison dans le champ d\u2019application territorial, faits par Une personne qui n\u2019y a pas d\u2019\u00e9tablissement commercial. Tout \u00e9tablissement commercial qui fait la vente de produits alimentaires au gros et au d\u00e9tail est, pour les fins des pr\u00e9sentes, r\u00e9put\u00e9 d\u00e9taillant et est assujetti aux dispositions du pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9cret pour l\u2019ensemble de ses activit\u00e9s.\n3\u00b0 La prohibition de toute vente le lundi avant 1h. (art. 3.05):\nToute vente est prohib\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1 h. de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi dans les \u00e9tablissements assujettis au pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9cret.\nPour ce qui est de la d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur dans le d\u00e9cret il suffit de la mettre en regard de celle que l\u2019on trouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 1 de la loi pour constater qu\u2019elle en d\u00e9borde le cadre. En effet, celle-ci est la suivante (par. f):\n\u00abemployeur\u00bb comprend: tout individu, soci\u00e9t\u00e9, firme ou corporation qui fait ex\u00e9cuter un travail par un salari\u00e9.\nLe repr\u00e9sentant du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a admis \u00e0 l\u2019audition que cette disposition du d\u00e9cret ne pouvait pas valablement assujettir au d\u00e9cret comme employeur celui qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, ne l\u2019est pas. Suivant la loi un employeur est celui qui fait ex\u00e9cuter un travail par un salari\u00e9. Au contraire, suivant le d\u00e9cret, celui qui exploite un \u00e9tablissement commercial vis\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un magasin d\u2019alimentation, est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 employeur m\u00eame s\u2019il ne fait ex\u00e9cuter aucun travail par un salari\u00e9.\nPeut-on dire comme le Juge Choquette en Cour d\u2019appel:\nLa d\u00e9finition du mot \u00abemployeur\u00bb dans le d\u00e9cret ne saurait modifier le sens donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce terme par la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e (art. 1, f); cette d\u00e9finition ne fait en somme que pr\u00e9ciser le genre d\u2019\u00e9tablissement commercial que cet employeur (personne, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou corporation) doit poss\u00e9der ou exploiter pour \u00eatre assujetti au d\u00e9cret.\nJe ne le crois pas. Il est bien vrai que le d\u00e9cret ne peut valablement promulguer une d\u00e9finition qui ait pour effet de sortir du cadre d\u00e9limit\u00e9 par la loi. Cependant, cela ne veut pas dire que s\u2019il pr\u00e9tend le faire on devra le consid\u00e9rer valide mais restreint \u00e0 ce que la loi permet. La disposition exc\u00e9dant l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de celui qui la d\u00e9cr\u00e8te est nulle et non pas restreinte \u00e0 ce qui est autoris\u00e9. Il importe qu\u2019il en soit ainsi afin que les citoyens ne soient pas tenus d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des r\u00e8glements qui leur commandent plus que ce que l\u2019on a le pouvoir d\u2019exiger d\u2019eux et que les tribunaux ne soient pas oblig\u00e9s de refaire en quelque sorte la r\u00e9glementation pour en limiter la port\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qui est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre valablement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9. Il faut \u00e0 mon avis appliquer \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par d\u00e9l\u00e9gation la r\u00e8gle que le Conseil priv\u00e9 a appliqu\u00e9e aux lois du Parlement:\nThe legislation will have to be carefully framed, and will not be achieved by either party leaving its own sphere and encroaching upon that of the other.\nAtt. Gen. for B.C. v. Att. Gen. for Canada[7]. Malgr\u00e9 une disposition exprimant formellement la volont\u00e9 que la loi dont il s\u2019agissait f\u00fbt appliqu\u00e9e dans toute la mesure o\u00f9 le Parlement avait le pouvoir de la d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter, on l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9e invalide en entier en jugeant qu\u2019elle formait un tout. Je n\u2019oublie pas que Ton doit toujours, si possible, interpr\u00e9ter un texte l\u00e9gislatif de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas le rendre invalide pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir (\u00abpotius valeat quant pereat\u00bb). Cependant, comme le juge en chef de cette Cour (alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait juge pu\u00een\u00e9) l\u2019a fait observer dans McKay c. La Reine[8], cette r\u00e8gle signifie que si le texte est susceptible de deux interpr\u00e9tations dont Tune le rend valide, et l\u2019autre invalide, c\u2019est \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re qu\u2019il faut s\u2019arr\u00eater. Dans cette cause-l\u00e0, il a commenc\u00e9 par d\u00e9montrer la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive par application de l\u2019adage \u00abVerba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae\u00bb qui est transcrit \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1020 du Code civil comme suit:\nQuelque g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que soient les termes dans lesquels un contrat est exprim\u00e9, ils ne comprennent que les choses sur lesquelles il para\u00eet que les parties se sont propos\u00e9 de contracter.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause il n\u2019y a rien de tel. On ne donne aucune raison d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la d\u00e9finition autrement que dans son sens litt\u00e9ral si ce n\u2019est le fait que le d\u00e9cret ne saurait modifier la loi. Comme nous venons de le voir, la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans McKay c. La Reine n\u2019est pas qu\u2019il faut co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte interpr\u00e9ter un texte l\u00e9gislatif de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter qu\u2019il soit invalide pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir mais bien qu\u2019entre deux interpr\u00e9tations possibles il faut choisir celle qui \u00e9vite l\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Pour appliquer cette r\u00e8gle il est donc essentiel de trouver d\u2019abord une raison valable de s\u2019\u00e9carter du sens litt\u00e9ral lorsqu\u2019il conduit \u00e0 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Ici on ne donne aucun tel motif.\nPeut-on consid\u00e9rer que du seul fait que le terme d\u00e9fini est le mot \u00abemployeur\u00bb on peut pr\u00e9sumer que lorsque l\u2019auteur du texte dit \u00abtoute personne \u2026 poss\u00e9dant ou exploitant un \u00e9tablissement commercial assujetti\u00bb il veut dire en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 non pas \u00abtoute personne\u00bb mais \u00abtout employeur\u00bb parce qu\u2019il est contraire \u00e0 la notion m\u00eame d\u2019employeur que de ne pas avoir d\u2019employ\u00e9s. Cela \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 soutenir que chaque fois qu\u2019une d\u00e9finition l\u00e9gislative va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du dictionnaire on peut l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter autrement que dans son sens litt\u00e9ral m\u00eame si celui-ci est parfaitement clair et sans \u00e9quivoque. C\u2019est ce que je ne saurais admettre.\nEn premier lieu, la r\u00e8gle fondamentale c\u2019est qu\u2019il faut rechercher l\u2019intention en consid\u00e9rant ce que comporte le texte et non ce que l\u2019on peut supposer que l\u2019on a voulu dire: \u00abThe question is not what may be supposed to have been intended, but what has been said\u00bb. Toronto Railway Co. c. City of Toronto[9].\nEn second lieu, le but m\u00eame des d\u00e9finitions l\u00e9gislatives est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de s\u2019\u00e9carter du sens ordinaire du mot d\u00e9fini. Il arrive souvent qu\u2019elles s\u2019en \u00e9cartent au point d\u2019aller compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du dictionnaire.\nAinsi en 1964, la l\u00e9gislature d\u2019Ontario a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019un arc ou une arbal\u00e8te est une arme \u00e0 feu au sens de sa loi sur la chasse (12-13 Eliz. II, 1964, ch. 34, art. 1, par. 1). Cela peut-il avoir pour effet de rendre l\u2019intention douteuse et de permettre de s\u2019\u00e9carter du sens litt\u00e9ral? A l\u2019article 659 du Code criminel, le Parlement du Canada a d\u00e9fini le \u00abd\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux\u00bb de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 viser non seulement celui qui causera vraisemblablement une l\u00e9sion corporelle \u00e0 autrui mais aussi celui qui commettra vraisemblablement \u00abune autre infraction sexuelle\u00bb. M\u00eame dans un cas o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que l\u2019inculp\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dangereux au sens ordinaire de cette expression, le texte a paru d\u00e9cisif. La majorit\u00e9 en cette Cour n\u2019a pas cru pouvoir l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 en restreindre l\u2019application \u00e0 des infractions qui font du coupable un d\u00e9linquant dangereux au sens ordinaire et elle a refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer \u00e0 un cas semblable l\u2019adage invoqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McKay (Klippert c. La Reine[10]). Je ne vois pas plus de raison de refuser de prendre au pied de la lettre une d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur qui englobe celui qui n\u2019a pas d\u2019employ\u00e9s qu\u2019une d\u00e9finition d\u2019arme \u00e0 feu qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019arc et \u00e0 l\u2019arbal\u00e8te et une d\u00e9finition de d\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 celui qui n\u2019est pas dangereux mais port\u00e9 irr\u00e9sistiblement \u00e0 la r\u00e9cidive.\nComme l\u2019a dit Lord Halsbury \u00abthe law is not always logical at all\u00bb. Quinn v. Leathern[11]. Le devoir d\u2019appliquer la loi comme elle est \u00e9crite signifie que si le texte est clair, on ne doit pas l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter autrement qu\u2019il est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 parce que cela ne semble pas logique. C\u2019est qu\u2019il est possible que ce qui para\u00eet illogique soit voulu. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, on en a la preuve au dossier. La d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur dans le d\u00e9cret reproduit textuellement la d\u00e9finition du m\u00eame mot dans la partie de la convention collective dont il rend les dispositions obligatoires. Ces dispositions avaient manifestement pour objet de r\u00e9glementer sous bien des rapports les \u00e9tablissements commerciaux de vente au d\u00e9tail de produits alimentaires. Ainsi on y trouvait des articles visant les heures d\u2019ouverture et de fermeture. De plus, on s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 de viser ceux qui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement n\u2019ont pas d\u2019employ\u00e9s, tels les colporteurs. Dans le contexte de la convention collective comme elle \u00e9tait soumise au ministre du Travail avec la requ\u00eate pour en demander l\u2019extension juridique, il \u00e9tait impossible de supposer que la d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme elle l\u2019est dans un but autre que celui d\u2019assujettir \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation propos\u00e9e tous les \u00e9tablissements de la cat\u00e9gorie d\u00e9crite, qu\u2019ils aient des employ\u00e9s ou non, et aussi d\u2019assujettir aux dispositions relatives aux heures d\u2019ouverture et de fermeture ceux qui travaillent \u00e0 leur compte aussi bien que les autres. La d\u00e9finition ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite sans modification dans le d\u00e9cret, je ne puis pas voir comment on peut penser que l\u2019on a voulu qu\u2019elle ait un sens autre que celui qu\u2019elle avait indubitablement dans le texte dont on l\u2019a tir\u00e9e.\nCependant, avant de conclure comme la minorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel que le vice de la d\u00e9finition entra\u00eene la nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret il faut consid\u00e9rer, vu qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une disposition accessoire et non d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de fond, s\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9judiciable. La seule qui soit possible c\u2019est l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 3.05 qui prohibe toute vente le lundi avant 1h. aucune autre disposition du d\u00e9cret n\u2019est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qui n\u2019est pas un employeur au sens de la loi. Mais est-il bien certain que cette disposition soit applicable \u00e0 tout employeur au sens du d\u00e9cret? Il faut observer que le mot \u00abemployeur\u00bb ne s\u2019y trouve pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, la port\u00e9e de la disposition n\u2019est pas \u00e9vidente par elle-m\u00eame et doit se d\u00e9terminer selon le contexte. Dans la convention, le texte visant le lundi venait \u00e0 la suite de paragraphes r\u00e9gissant non pas les heures de travail mais les heures d\u2019ouverture et de fermeture. L\u2019article 3.02 le disait express\u00e9ment, de m\u00eame l\u2019alin\u00e9a entre les paragraphes (c) et (d) de l\u2019art. 3.04 defendant d\u2019admettre un client dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement ou d\u2019accepter une commande par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00abapr\u00e8s l\u2019heure fix\u00e9e pour la fermeture\u00bb. Il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 logique d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la disposition de l\u2019art. 3.05 dans le m\u00eame sens. Mais, dans le d\u00e9cret, les paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s et visent uniquement le travail des salari\u00e9s. Dans ce nouveau contexte, il n\u2019y a plus de raison d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le texte comme visant le travail effectu\u00e9 par les employeurs alors que la nouvelle r\u00e9daction des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u00e9montre clairement que l\u2019on entend restreindre l\u2019application de la disposition relative aux heures de travail \u00e0 ce que la loi pr\u00e9voit, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le travail des salari\u00e9s.\nAfin d\u2019\u00eatre aussi complet que possible sur ce point capital, il para\u00eet \u00e0 propos de noter que la loi mentionne l\u2019artisan dans la d\u00e9finition de \u00absalari\u00e9\u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, les d\u00e9crets peuvent s\u00fbrement r\u00e9gir les heures de travail des artisans en m\u00eame temps que celles des employ\u00e9s car ils sont des \u00absalari\u00e9s\u00bb au sens de la loi. Vu que, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il suffit pour d\u00e9cider que la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00abemployeur\u00bb n\u2019invalide pas le d\u00e9cret d\u2019en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la disposition relative au lundi vise uniquement le travail effectu\u00e9 par des salari\u00e9s, il n\u2019est aucunement n\u00e9cessaire de se demander si les exploitants d\u2019\u00e9tablissements qui ne sont pas des employ\u00e9s seraient susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des \u00absalari\u00e9s\u00bb au sens de la loi. De toute fa\u00e7on, le d\u00e9cret ne d\u00e9finit pas cette expression mais utilise au contraire le mot \u00abemploy\u00e9\u00bb en le d\u00e9finissant en des termes qui ne visent pas les artisans.\nLes observations ci-dessus suffisent pour disposer \u00e9galement de l\u2019attaque dirig\u00e9e contre l\u2019art. 2.00. Cette disposition ne fait que compl\u00e9ter la d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur en aidant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quels sont les \u00e9tablissements assujettis au d\u00e9cret. D\u00e8s que l\u2019on en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que la d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019assujettir \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation des heures de travail les personnes qui ne sont pas des \u00absalari\u00e9s\u00bb au sens de la loi, la d\u00e9finition de ce qui constitute un \u00e9tablissement commercial ne peut \u00eatre une cause d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Il en est de m\u00eame de certaines expressions qui sont \u00e9videmment demeur\u00e9es dans le d\u00e9cret simplement parce que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas tenu suffisamment compte du fait que l\u2019on avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remplacer la r\u00e9glementation des heures d\u2019ouverture et de fermeture des magasins par une r\u00e9glementation des heures de travail des salari\u00e9s. C\u2019est l\u00e0 toute l\u2019importance qu\u2019il faut attacher \u00e0 des dispositions comme la mention de produits \u00abdont la vente est r\u00e9glement\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9sentes\u00bb (art. 2.00 par. b), celle de \u00abl\u2019heure de fermeture\u00bb (art. 3.04 par. c).\nEn outre d\u2019invoquer l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret, Steinberg\u2019s a pr\u00e9tendu que celui-ci avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre en vigueur depuis le 1er juin 1967. La disposition relative \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e est dans les termes suivants (art. 8.00):\nLe d\u00e9cret entre en vigueur \u00e0 compter du premier (1er) juin mil neuf cent soixante-cinq (1965) et le demeure jusqu\u2019au premier (1er) juin mil neuf cent soixante-six (1966).\nIl se renouvelle automatiquement pour une (1) ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins que Tune des parties contractantes ne donne \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie un avis \u00e9crit \u00e0 ce contraire, dans un d\u00e9lai d\u2019au plus quatre-vingt-dix (90) jours et d\u2019au moins trente (30) jours avant le 1er juin de chaque ann\u00e9e. Un tel avis doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre adress\u00e9 au Ministre du Travail.\nL\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que ce second alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9voit un seul renouvellement. Il faut admettre que la clause n\u2019est pas un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9daction et que c\u2019est bien ce que le d\u00e9but du second alin\u00e9a laisse entendre. Mais d\u2019une autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, une telle interpr\u00e9tation vient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la fin de la phrase qui fait mention, non pas du 1er juin 1966, mais du 1er juin de chaque ann\u00e9e. On prive le mot \u00abchaque\u00bb de toute signification en disant qu\u2019un seul renouvellement est pr\u00e9vu. Comme il est de r\u00e8gle d\u2019\u00e9viter une telle cons\u00e9quence, il faut pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019on a voulu un renouvellement chaque ann\u00e9e pour une ann\u00e9e et non pas un seul renouvellement.\nLes associations des employ\u00e9s de Steinberg\u2019s ont produit une intervention en Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour demander le rejet de l\u2019injonction et une d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret. Cette intervention a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel. Les associations ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour la permission d\u2019interjeter appel du jugement et, avec notre permission, se sont fait entendre comme appelantes. En outre de certains moyens d\u00e9j\u00e0 invoqu\u00e9s par Steinberg\u2019s, elles ont soutenu que le d\u00e9cret \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Les dispositions auxquelles elles se sont attaqu\u00e9es de ce chef sont le paragraphe (c) de l\u2019art. 7.03 \u00abaugmentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des salaires r\u00e9els\u00bb et l\u2019article 7.04. Le premier de ces textes exclut de l\u2019augmentation de $2.50 par semaine ceux dont le salaire \u00e9quivaut au taux pr\u00e9vu au d\u00e9cret major\u00e9 de 20 pour cent. Quant au second il soustrait \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article relatif au salaire, les salari\u00e9s r\u00e9gis par une convention collective qui pr\u00e9voit des avantages au moins \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux du d\u00e9cret.\nPour disposer de cette pr\u00e9tention il ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire plus qu\u2019observer que rien dans la loi ne d\u00e9finit de quelle mani\u00e8re le salaire peut \u00eatre r\u00e9glement\u00e9. On pourrait indubitablement se contenter de fixer un taux de base, mais rien ne d\u00e9fend de proc\u00e9der par augmentation. Par ailleurs, si Ton choisit de proc\u00e9der par augmentation, on ne voit pas ce qui peut d\u00e9fendre de faire varier l\u2019augmentation suivant les classifications. L\u2019un des buts de la loi \u00e9tant d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la condition des travailleurs d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s, on ne voit pas pourquoi le d\u00e9cret ne pourrait pas renfermer des dispositions ayant pour objet d\u2019accorder des augmentations de salaire \u00e0 ceux-l\u00e0 seuls que l\u2019on juge d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s. La loi fait express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serve, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 13, du droit pour l\u2019employeur d\u2019accorder une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e ou des avantages plus \u00e9tendus que ceux fix\u00e9s par le d\u00e9cret. Si un employeur l\u2019a fait d\u2019avance par une convention collective, comme il semble que ce soit le cas en l\u2019occurrence, quelle ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 peut-il y avoir \u00e0 statuer que l\u2019augmentation de salaire accord\u00e9e \u00e0 ceux qui re\u00e7oivent des taux inf\u00e9rieurs ne s\u2019appliquera pas? C\u2019est donc \u00e0 bon droit que l\u2019intervention a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel. Les appels de Steinberg\u2019s et des associations d\u2019employ\u00e9s de Steinberg\u2019s doivent donc \u00eatre tous rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens car il va de soi que le bien-fond\u00e9 de la demande d\u2019injonction implique le rejet du bref de prohibition. Dans le cas de l\u2019appel de Steinberg\u2019s dans l\u2019instance en injonction, les d\u00e9pens devront comprendre ceux de la requ\u00eate pour suspension.\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante, Steinberg\u2019s Lt\u00e9e: Geoffrion & Prud\u2019Homme, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Comit\u00e9 Paritaire: Blain, Pich\u00e9, Bergeron, Godbout & Emery, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des Associations appelantes: Cutler, Lamer, Bellemare, Robert, Desaulniers, Proulx & Sylvestre, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec: Ahern, B\u00e9langer, de Brabant & Nuss, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1968] B.R. 97.\n[2] [1965] S.C.R. 798, 53 D.L.R.

Au mois d\u2019avril 1966, le demandeur, qui d\u00e9tenait un brevet de pilote dans la circonscription de pilotage de Qu\u00e9bec depuis 1948, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 dans la classe \u00abA\u00bb par le d\u00e9fendeur Maheux, le surintendant des pilotes de la circonscription. En juillet 1966, le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 reclassifi\u00e9 pilote \u00abB\u00bb sur l\u2019instance du d\u00e9fendeur Jones qui \u00e9tait surintendant du pilotage au Minist\u00e8re des Transports pour le motif que sa conduite, lors d\u2019une collision survenue en 1963, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligente bien qu\u2019aucune sanction ne lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le commissaire qui avait tenu l\u2019investigation.\nDans son action dirig\u00e9e contre Maheux et Jones et, par amendement subs\u00e9quent, contre le Ministre des Transports en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage du district, le demandeur a attaqu\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements en question. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a maintenu l\u2019action quant \u00e0 Maheux et Jones, a prononc\u00e9 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements et, alternativement, au cas o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de classes serait valide, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le demandeur avait droit d\u2019\u00eatre class\u00e9 pilote \u00abA\u00bb. Cependant l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Ministre. A l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel, cette Cour a accord\u00e9 au demandeur la permission de former un contre-appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du rejet de l\u2019action contre le Ministre, et le sous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, qui repr\u00e9sentait les appelants, a accept\u00e9 de compara\u00eetre pour le Ministre.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel et le contre-appel doivent \u00eatre accueillis.\nLes dispositions de la Loi sur la marine marchande du Canada ont pour effet de donner \u00e0 tout pilote brevet\u00e9 un droit acquis permanent. Cette loi ne permet pas \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage de modifier ce droit en \u00e9tablissant des classes de pilotes jouissant de droits in\u00e9gaux dans une circonscription de pilotage. Les r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablissant ces classes sont donc invalides.\nL\u2019action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements \u00e9tait de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019une question purement th\u00e9orique. Le demandeur subit dans l\u2019exercice de sa profession des restrictions importantes et pr\u00e9judiciables comme cons\u00e9quence directe des r\u00e8glements invalides qui lui sont appliqu\u00e9s.\nIl faut retrancher du jugement la conclusion relative au classement du pilote pour le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des classes serait valide. L\u2019opinion du juge sur cette question devait se trouver dans les motifs non dans le dispositif.\nL\u2019action ne pouvait \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que contre le Ministre des Transports. Une telle action doit \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre la personne investie du pouvoir dont il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9finir les limites. Ce pouvoir de faire des r\u00e8glements est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage qui, dans la circonscription de Qu\u00e9bec, est le Ministre des Transports, un \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb au sens du para. (c) de l\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier.\nL\u2019action ne pouvait \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre Jones. Rien ne d\u00e9montre de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante qu\u2019il ait des pouvoirs juridiques justifiant son assignation comme d\u00e9fendeur dans une telle action.\nQuant \u00e0 Maheux, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas charg\u00e9 du classement des pilotes, il para\u00eet douteux que l\u2019on puisse le consid\u00e9rer apte \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9.\nCrown\u2014Pilot\u2014Classification of pilots\u2014Power of Pilotage Authority to make by-laws\u2014Invalidity of by-laws establishing classes of pilots\u2014Action asking for a declaration of nullity\u2014Judgment, conclusion, opinion on secondary questions\u2014Jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court\u2014Action against Minister of Transport\u2014Officer\u2014Canada. Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29\u2014Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, s. 29(c).\nIn June 1960, the General By-laws of the Quebec Pilotage Authority were amended by order in Council so as to authorize the district pilotage authority to grade the pilots at the commencement of each season of navigation, to assign them to vessels of various categories according to their grade and to reclassify pilots who, in the opinion of the authority, are incompetent or unsuitable. In April 1966, the plaintiff who had been a licensed pilot in the Quebec pilotage district since 1948, was classified as a grade \u201cA\u201d pilot by the defendant Maheux, the district supervisor of pilots. In July 1966, the plaintiff was reclassified as a grade \u201cB\u201d pilot at the instance of the defendant Jones, the superintendent of pilotage in the Department of Transport, on the ground that his conduct in a 1963 collision had been negligent although he had not been penalized therefor by the investigation Commissioner.\nIn his action against Maheux and Jones and, by subsequent amendment, against the Minister of Transport in his capacity as the Pilotage Authority for the district, the plaintiff contested the validity of the by-laws in question. The Exchequer Court maintained the action as against Maheux and Jones, declared the by-laws invalid and, alternatively, on the assumption that the establishment of a system of classes was valid, declared that the plaintiff was entitled to be classified as a class \u201cA\u201d pilot. The action was dismissed as against the Minister. At the hearing of the appeal, this Court granted leave to the plaintiff to cross-appeal as to the dismissal of the action against the Minister, and the Deputy Attorney General, who was representing the appellants, agreed to represent the Minister.\nHeld: The appeal and the cross-appeal should be allowed.\nEvery licensed pilot acquires, by virtue of the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act, a permanent vested right. The statute does not authorize the pilotage authority to modify this right by setting-up classes of pilots having unequal rights in a pilotage district. The by-laws setting-up these classes are invalid.\nThe Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to hear the action asking for a declaration of nullity. This case does not deal with a theoretical question. Important and prejudicial restrictions in the exercise of his profession are inflicted upon the plaintiff as a direct consequence of the application of the invalid by-laws.\nThe alternative conclusion respecting the plaintiff\u2019s classification on the assumption that classes were validly established must be struck from the judgment. A judge\u2019s opinion on such a question should be expressed in his reasons only not in the formal judgment.\nThe declaratory action could only be instituted, in this case, against the Minister of Transport. Such an action must be instituted against the person who has the power the limits of which are to be defined. This power to make the by-laws is given to the Pilotage Authority who, in the pilotage district of Quebec, is the Minister of Transport, an \u201cofficer\u201d within the meaning of para. (c) of s. 29 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe action could not be instituted against Jones. There is nothing in this case to show properly that he had legal powers qualifying him as a defendant in such an action. As to Maheux, as he was not entrusted with the classifying of pilots, it seems doubtful that he could be considered as qualified to defend a declaratory action.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1].

Gamache est pilote dans la circonscription de pilotage de Qu\u00e9bec depuis le 9 juillet 1948, date du brevet qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par le Ministre des Transports du Canada agissant en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage de cette circonscription. Suivant le R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la circonscription \u00e9tabli par ce ministre le 30 janvier 1957, le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral r\u00e9gissant l\u2019affectation des pilotes \u00e9tait le suivant (art. 15, par. 2):\nLes pilotes sont normalement affect\u00e9s selon la pratique en vigueur pour la p\u00e9r\u00e9quation des voyages.\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, sous le titre \u00abService sp\u00e9cial\u00bb, on trouvait entre autres les dispositions suivantes:\n24 (1)\u2014Tout pilote qui y consent peut \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 au service sp\u00e9cial de toute ligne r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de navigation.\n* * *\n(3)\u2014Les pilotes du service sp\u00e9cial sont astreints au tour de r\u00f4le, d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le Surintendant.\nLe 2 juin 1960, par l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 1960-756, le Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil a approuv\u00e9 trois modifications de ce R\u00e8glement. La premi\u00e8re ajoute \u00e0 l\u2019article 15, apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 2, le suivant:\n(2a) Les pilotes sont affect\u00e9s aux navires de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\na) Pilotes de classe A, \u00e0 tout navire quelles qu\u2019en soient les dimensions; b) Pilotes de classe B, \u00e0 tout navire dont la jauge ne d\u00e9passe pas dix mille tonneaux;\nc) Pilotes de la classe C:\n(i) moins d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s l\u2019obtention du brevet de pilote, \u00e0 \u2018tout navire d\u2019une jauge d\u2019au plus deux mille tonneaux;\n(ii) pendant la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019obtention du brevet de pilote, \u00e0 tout navire d\u2019une jauge d\u2019au plus trois mille tonnneaux;\n(iii) pendant la troisi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019obtention du brevet de pilote, \u00e0 \u2018tout navire d\u2019une jauge d\u2019au plus quatre mille tonneaux.\nLa seconde remplace l\u2019article 24 par des dispositions dont l\u2019essentiel est comme suit:\n24(1)\u2014Tout pilote de la circonscription sera class\u00e9 par l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 pilote de l\u2019une des classes A, B ou C et, au d\u00e9but de chaque saison de navigation, l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 publiera une liste des pilotes sur laquelle sera indiqu\u00e9e la classe de chacun.\n* * *\n(5)\u2014Tout pilote de classe A qui, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9, est incomp\u00e9tent ou inapte peut \u00eatre reclass\u00e9 pilote de classe B par l\u2019Autorit\u00e9.\nLa derni\u00e8re modification ajoute au texte fixant les droits de pilotage ce qui suit:\n(11) Un droit suppl\u00e9mentaire de vingt-cinq dollars pour le pilotage\na) de tout navire d\u2019une jauge de plus de dix mille tonneaux; et\nb) de tout autre navire que l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 peut d\u00e9signer.\nDes changements sans importance dans ce litige ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 1961-425.\nIl est admis que lorsque les modifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9es, il y avait dans la circonscription 77 pilotes brevet\u00e9s; 10 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans la classe A et les autres, dans la classe B. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait de ceux-l\u00e0. Le 6 avril 1966, l\u2019appelant J.A. Maheux qui exer\u00e7ait les fonctions de surintendant des pilotes de la circonscription, adressa au secr\u00e9taire tr\u00e9sorier de la Corporation des pilotes du Bas-Saint-Laurent une lettre se lisant comme suit:\nNous d\u00e9sirons vous informer que les Pilotes Olivier Paquet et H.-E. Gamache ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s dans la classe \u00abA\u00bb, en attendant d\u2019autres d\u00e9veloppements.\nLe 27 avril, l\u2019appelant D.R. Jones qui est surintendant du pilotage au minist\u00e8re des Transports, demandait \u00e0 Maheux de lui faire conna\u00eetre \u00e0 quelle date l\u2019intim\u00e9 et un autre pilote avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s \u00abA\u00bb. Le renseignement lui fut aussit\u00f4t fourni en indiquant la date de la lettre ci-dessus. Le 5 mai, le capitaine Guy LaHaye, se d\u00e9crivant comme surintendant r\u00e9gional des pilotes, adressait de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Jones un m\u00e9moire dans lequel il recommandait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 f\u00fbt reclassifi\u00e9 \u00abB\u00bb \u00e0 cause de la collision entre le Tritonica et le Roonagh Head. Le dossier fait voir que cette collision survenue le 20 juillet 1963 a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00abinvestigation formelle\u00bb par le juge Smith et deux assesseurs. Le rapport du commissaire est au dossier. On y constate que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait pilote sur le Roonagh Head et a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent mais qu\u2019aucune sanction ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 568 de la Loi sur la marine marchande (ci\u2011apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e la \u00abLoi\u00bb).\nLe dossier fait voir que le 8 juillet 1966, Jones a adress\u00e9 au capitaine LaHaye un m\u00e9moire contenant ce qui suit:\nWe concur with your action in reclassifying Mr. H.E. Gamache as a grade B pilot, taking into account his action on the occasion of the Tritonica-Roonagh Head collision.\nLe 22 juillet, le capitaine LaHaye adresse \u00e0 Maheux une lettre o\u00f9 l\u2019on lit:\nL\u2019Autorit\u00e9 consid\u00e8re que M.H.E. Gamache soit reclassifi\u00e9 de la cat\u00e9gorie A \u00e0 B en raison de son comportement lors de la collision Tritonica-Roonagh Head.\nL\u00e0-dessus, le 25 juillet, Maheux adresse \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la lettre suivante:\nJe re\u00e7ois, ce jour, l\u2019instruction que le Minist\u00e8re a r\u00e9\u00e9tudi\u00e9 la liste que j\u2019ai fait parvenir en regard des classes de pilotes.\nOn m\u2019informe que le Minist\u00e8re n\u2019approuve pas votre statut de pilote classe \u00abA\u00bb et que vous \u00eates, \u00e0 partir d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, class\u00e9 dans la classe de pilote \u00abB\u00bb.\nA partir de ce moment-l\u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 pilote de classe \u00abB\u00bb et par cons\u00e9quent affect\u00e9 exclusivement au pilotage de navires de dix mille tonnes ou moins.\nPar son action en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier l\u2019intim\u00e9 demandait en premier lieu qu\u2019il f\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait droit d\u2019\u00eatre class\u00e9 pilote \u00abA\u00bb \u00e0 compter du 6 avril 1966 et qu\u2019au besoin un bref de mandamus soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin. Par amendement il a ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour que les arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil 1960-756 et 1961-425 soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s invalides pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir. Par un autre amendement, celui qui \u00e9tait alors Ministre des Transports a \u00e9t\u00e9 joint comme d\u00e9fendeur en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019Autorit\u00e9 de pilotage du district. L\u2019admission de faits vers\u00e9e au dossier constate que la personne ainsi assign\u00e9e \u00e9tait bien le ministre des Transports et l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 de pilotage au temps dont il s\u2019agit.\nPar le jugement qui nous est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 en appel, la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier[2] a tout d\u2019abord prononc\u00e9 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du paragraphe 2a de l\u2019article 15 et des paragraphes 1 et 5 de l\u2019article 24 du R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la circonscription de pilotage de Qu\u00e9bec comme ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par les arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil 1960-756 et 1961-425.\nAu fond, cette premi\u00e8re conclusion est inattaquable. Le pouvoir de faire des r\u00e8glements attribu\u00e9 aux autorit\u00e9s de pilotage par l\u2019article 329 de la Loi est bien loin d\u2019\u00eatre illimit\u00e9. On a m\u00eame pris la peine en le leur attribuant de faire une r\u00e9serve expresse des dispositions de la partie de la Loi o\u00f9 il se trouve ainsi que de celles de toute loi en vigueur dans la circonscription.\nLorsque l\u2019on examine les textes auxquels le l\u00e9gislateur a ainsi voulu que tout r\u00e8glement f\u00fbt subordonn\u00e9, on y trouve des articles qui ont pour effet de donner \u00e0 tout pilote brevet\u00e9 un droit acquis permanent. En effet l\u2019article 333 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que tout pilote qui a re\u00e7u un brevet \u00abpeut le garder en vertu et sous r\u00e9serve des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente Partie\u00bb et ajoute qu\u2019il \u00abest pendant qu\u2019il le garde un pilote brevet\u00e9\u2026 de la circonscription \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019\u00e9tend son brevet\u00bb. Dire qu\u2019il est pilote brevet\u00e9 signifie qu\u2019il jouit en commun avec les autres pilotes brevet\u00e9s du droit exclusif de piloter des navires dans la circonscription. En effet, sauf dans certaines circonstances tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciales, c\u2019est une infraction que de piloter un navire sans \u00eatre pilote brevet\u00e9 (art. 354 et 356). De plus, en vertu de l\u2019article 345, le paiement des droits de pilotage est obligatoire sauf les exceptions pr\u00e9vues aux articles suivants. Ensuite, il faut signaler que la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment aux articles 336 \u00e0 339 la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du brevet, l\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite et le droit de renouvellement \u00e0 payer annuellement. Aux articles 368 \u00e0 372 on trouve des dispositions relatives aux infractions et peines et, dans certains cas, il est pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019advenant d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage peut suspendre ou annuler le brevet du pilote. Enfin, comme on Ta d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, au cas de sinistre, l\u2019article 568 permet \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019annuler ou suspendre un brevet de pilote si au moins un des assesseurs se rallie \u00e0 cette conclusion, mais il y a droit d\u2019appel de cette d\u00e9cision (art. 576, par. 3).\nOn voit qu\u2019indubitablement un brevet de pilote donne naissance \u00e0 des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la loi et qui, au regard d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation nouvelle, devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des droits acquis de telle sorte que le Parlement lui-m\u00eame ne serait pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 y porter atteinte \u00e0 moins que l\u2019intention de le faire soit clairement exprim\u00e9e. Suivant un principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation bien connu, toute nouvelle l\u00e9gislation devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e si possible de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 respecter ces droits acquis. Le m\u00eame principe doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions qui permettent de faire des r\u00e8glements. De m\u00eame que l\u2019on ne doit pas pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019une loi nouvelle est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 porter atteinte \u00e0 ces droits, on ne doit pas pr\u00e9sumer que le Parlement a entendu autoriser l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage \u00e0 le faire. D\u2019ailleurs, le Parlement a pris la peine de le dire express\u00e9ment.\nPeut-on trouver un texte ayant clairement pour effet d\u2019autoriser l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage \u00e0 faire un tel r\u00e8glement? Le seul texte que l\u2019on ait invoqu\u00e9 devant nous c\u2019est cette partie du paragraphe f) de l\u2019article 329 de la Loi qui permet d\u2019\u00ab\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8glements concernant la gouverne des pilotes\u2026\u00bb; en anglais: \u00abmake regulations for the government of pilots\u00bb. Dans l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre langue, ce texte ne vise que la conduite des pilotes. Littr\u00e9 d\u00e9finit \u00abgouverne\u00bb: \u00abce qui doit servir de r\u00e8gle de conduite dans une affaire\u00bb. \u00abGovernment\u00bb a plus d\u2019un sens mais dans le contexte il est clair qu\u2019il est pris dans celui que le Shorter Oxford English Dictionary indique en second lieu: \u00abthe manner in which one\u2019s action is governed\u00bb.\nOn nous a signal\u00e9 que le paragraphe n) (remplac\u00e9 par l\u2019article 12 de la loi de 1956, 4-5 Eliz. II, ch. 34) attribue \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage le pouvoir suivant: \u00ablimiter la p\u00e9riode de validit\u00e9 de tout brevet accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un pilote\u00bb. Cela ne signifie point que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 peut r\u00e9duire \u00e0 volont\u00e9 la dur\u00e9e de validit\u00e9 des brevets d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9s. Le texte interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme il se doit \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9somption contre toute atteinte aux droits acquis permet seulement un r\u00e8glement en vertu duquel des brevets pour un temps limit\u00e9 seront \u00e0 l\u2019avenir d\u00e9livr\u00e9s au lieu du brevet permanent pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Il faudrait un texte explicite pour permettre de r\u00e9duire la dur\u00e9e des brevets en vigueur. La d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. La Compagnie de Publication La Presse, Lt\u00e9e[3] n\u2019implique pas une n\u00e9gation du principe de la non-r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9. Ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 c\u2019est que, vu la nature du droit octroy\u00e9 par un permis de poste priv\u00e9 de radiodiffusion, le pouvoir attribu\u00e9 au Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil de modifier l\u2019honoraire exigible peut valablement \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e en cours. Le juge Abbott dit \u00e0 la page 77:\nIn view of the nature of the right held by a person licensed to operate a private commercial broadcasting station, I am of opinion that the Governor in Council can validly increase or decrease the fees payable by such a licensee at any time during the currency of the licence.\nIl n\u2019y a aucune analogie entre les deux situations. Ici nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence de droits acquis depuis longtemps consacr\u00e9s par l\u00e9gislation et auxquels il ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 atteinte que d\u2019une fa\u00e7on \u00e9galement pr\u00e9vue. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Loi, le commissaire faisant enqu\u00eate sur un sinistre maritime ne peut suspendre ou r\u00e9voquer un brevet de pilote qu\u2019\u00e0 des conditions prescrites et il y a appel de cette d\u00e9cision. Par le r\u00e8glement contest\u00e9 le pilote serait expos\u00e9 \u00e0 voir son classement modifi\u00e9 par d\u00e9cision administrative sans formalit\u00e9, sans recours et les cons\u00e9quences de ce changement de classe pourraient \u00eatre presque aussi graves qu\u2019une r\u00e9vocation, car si l\u2019on peut faire des classes \u00e0 volont\u00e9, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019en faire une qui restreigne un pilote \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 insignifiante.\nIl faut donc dire que la Loi ne permet pas \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage de modifier les droits d\u00e9coulant du brevet de pilote en \u00e9tablissant des classes de pilotes jouissant de droits in\u00e9gaux dans une circonscription. Cette premi\u00e8re conclusion dispense \u00e9videmment d\u2019examiner les autres questions faisant l\u2019objet du litige car, si le r\u00e8glement \u00e9tablissant des classes est invalide, on ne peut pas rechercher dans quelle classe l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre plac\u00e9. Sous ce rapport le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9. En effet, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de deux dispositions du r\u00e8glement, le savant juge a accord\u00e9 une conclusion relative au classement du pilote pour le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des classes serait valide. M\u00eame s\u2019il est possible qu\u2019un jugement soit modifi\u00e9 en appel, la cour qui le rend doit le r\u00e9diger en forme d\u00e9finitive. Le demandeur peut bien pr\u00e9senter des conclusions alternatives mais le juge qui statue sur la demande doit choisir selon son opinion sur le droit et sur les faits et il ne peut pas admettre de conclusions contradictoires. Cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il doit s\u2019abstenir d\u2019exprimer son opinion sur des questions qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas rigoureusement n\u00e9cessaire de trancher. Au contraire, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u00e9sirable qu\u2019il le fasse car il est souvent tr\u00e8s commode pour une cour d\u2019appel d\u2019avoir l\u2019avis du juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur ces questions-l\u00e0. Ainsi, lorsqu\u2019une action en dommages a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prouv\u00e9e, la Cour d\u2019Appel qui en vient \u00e0 une conclusion contraire sur ce point-l\u00e0 a grand avantage \u00e0 trouver dans le dossier une estimation du pr\u00e9judice faite par le tribunal qui a recueilli la preuve. Cependant, cette estimation, tout comme une conclusion alternative, ne doit pas se trouver dans le dispositif du jugement.\nIl faut maintenant signaler que la demande en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout d\u2019abord dirig\u00e9e contre deux d\u00e9fendeurs, (les appelants) d\u00e9crits comme suit:\nD.-R. JONES, as Superintendent of Pilotage, pursuant to Part VI of the Canada Shipping Act, residing and domiciled at Ottawa, Province of Ontario,\nAND\nJ.-A. MAHEUX, as local Supervisor of Pilots for the Quebec Pilotage District, pursuant to Part VI of the Canada Shipping Act, residing and domiciled at Quebec, Province of Quebec.\nDu consentement des parties, on a ult\u00e9rieurement apport\u00e9 la modification suivante:\nJ.W. PICKERSGILL, in his capacity as Pilotage Authority pursuant to section 327 of the Canada Shipping Act (is) added as co-defendant. Dans les tr\u00e8s longues notes de jugement de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier (une cinquantaine de pages), on ne voit pas tr\u00e8s bien pour quel motif l\u2019action d\u00e9claratoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie contre les deux fonctionnaires et rejet\u00e9e sans frais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du ministre. En effet, apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 les motifs pour lesquels le r\u00e8glement est invalide, le juge passe imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la validit\u00e9 du d\u00e9classement de l\u2019appelant dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 le r\u00e8glement serait valide. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cela qu\u2019il en vient \u00e0 parler de la pr\u00e9tention que le ministre des Transports ne serait pas \u00abun fonctionnaire de la Couronne\u00bb (\u00aban officer of the Crown\u00bb) au sens du paragraphe (c) de l\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98. Ayant fait mention de la d\u00e9cision en ce sens du pr\u00e9sident dans Pouliot c. Le Ministre des Transports[4], il cite un long passage du jugement du juge Angers dans Gari\u00e9py c. Le Roi[5], o\u00f9 comme dans Harris H. Himmelman c. Le Roi[6], on dit qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage, le ministre est un fonctionnaire de la Couronne. Cependant, il exprime ensuite l\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas besoin de se prononcer sur cette question parce qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019en fait le ministre n\u2019a jamais lui-m\u00eame particip\u00e9 au classement ni au d\u00e9classement de l\u2019appelant. C\u2019est apparemment pour ce motif li\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion alternative et non \u00e0 la conclusion principale, que l\u2019action quant \u00e0 lui est rejet\u00e9e mais sans frais.\nAfin que la question principale qui est de grande importance puisse \u00eatre jug\u00e9e en tout \u00e9tat de cause, la Cour a, lors de l\u2019audition, accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la permission de former un contre\u2011appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du rejet de l\u2019action contre le ministre des Transports. L\u00e0-dessus, le sous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada qui repr\u00e9sentait les appelants \u00e0 l\u2019audition a accept\u00e9 de compara\u00eetre pour le ministre sur ce contre-appel. Il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas hors de propos de signaler qu\u2019il est conforme \u00e0 la tradition britannique que de collaborer ainsi \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faciliter la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un litige int\u00e9ressant le gouvernement. Dans Dyson v. Attorney General[7], Farwell L.J. dit \u00e0 la page 424:\nI will quote the Lord Chief Baron in Deare v. Attorney General (1 Y. & C. Ex. at p. 208): \u201cIt has been the practice, which I hope will never be discontinued, for the officers of the Crown to throw no difficulty in the way of proceedings for the purpose of bringing matters before a Court of justice when any real point of difficulty that requires judicial decision has occurred\u201d.\nIl faut donc voir maintenant si la d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement est de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier et, dans l\u2019affirmative, contre quelle personne elle peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e.\nC\u2019est dans l\u2019affaire Dyson que le principe de l\u2019action en d\u00e9claration de la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance gouvernementale a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9. Il est inutile de citer les arr\u00eats ult\u00e9rieurs car cette Cour l\u2019a admis plus d\u2019une fois, notamment dans L\u2019Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montr\u00e9al c. La Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de Qu\u00e9bec[8]. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on semble croire en certains milieux, l\u2019arr\u00eat subs\u00e9quent dans Saumur c. Le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec[9] n\u2019implique pas la n\u00e9gation de l\u2019existence de ce recours. En effet, le juge en chef au nom du tribunal a dit: (\u00e0 la page 259)\nCe qui importe de retenir dans la pr\u00e9sente cause c\u2019est que l\u2019action d\u00e9claratoire n\u2019existe pas, sauf en quelques cas isol\u00e9s. Il est donc impossible, dans le droit de Qu\u00e9bec, d\u2019instituer une action comme celle qui l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9, o\u00f9 l\u2019on demande au tribunal, sans qu\u2019il y ait de litige et sans qu\u2019aucun droit ne soit l\u00e9s\u00e9, de d\u00e9clarer inconstitutionnelle une loi de la L\u00e9gislature.\nJ\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 les mots \u00absauf en quelques cas isol\u00e9s\u00bb. Ils font voir que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur rendu dans un cas o\u00f9 il y avait litige et que ce que l\u2019on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la derni\u00e8re cause c\u2019est que l\u2019action ne peut pas \u00eatre accueillie quand la question est purement th\u00e9orique. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il est \u00e9vident que ce n\u2019est pas la situation: l\u2019intim\u00e9 subit dans l\u2019exercice de sa profession de pilote des restrictions importantes et pr\u00e9judiciables comme cons\u00e9quence directe du r\u00e8glement invalide qui lui est appliqu\u00e9.\nIl faut maintenant se demander contre qui cette action pouvait \u00eatre valablement dirig\u00e9e. Dans l\u2019affaire Dyson, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un rapport exig\u00e9 par les Commissioners of Inland Revenue. C\u2019est l\u2019Attorney-General qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 parce que depuis des si\u00e8cles en Angleterre, l\u2019usage veut que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de ainsi. Cozens-Hardy M.R. dit: (\u00e0 p. 415)\nIt has been settled for centuries that in the Court of Chancery the Attorney-General might in some cases be sued as a defendant as representing the Crown, and that in such a suit relief could be given against the Crown. Pawlett v. Attorney-General (Hardres\u2019 Rep. 465) is a very early authority on this point. Laragoity v. Attorney-General (2 Price, 172) is a case where this matter was a good deal discussed. In Deare v. Attorney-General (1 Y. & C. Ex. 197) the Attorney-General demurred to such a bill. Lord Abinger (Ibid. at p. 208) said: \u201cI apprehend that the Crown always appears by the Attorney-General in a Court of justice, especially in a Court of Equity, where the interest of the Crown is threatened. Therefore a practice has arisen of filing a bill against the Attorney-General, or of making him a party to a bill, where the interest of the Crown is concerned,\u201d and the demurrer was overruled.\nLorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019un r\u00e8glement fait par une autorit\u00e9 gouvernementale autre que le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame, on ne voit pas bien pourquoi l\u2019action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 ne pourrait \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre la personne investie du pouvoir dont il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9finir les limites. Dans Healey v. Minister of Health[10], Denning L.J. dit: (\u00e0 p. 237)\n\u2026the Queen\u2019s courts can grant declarations by which they pronounce on the validity or invalidity of the proceedings of statutory tribunals.\u201d\nIci il importe de noter que le pouvoir de faire les r\u00e8glements n\u2019est pas attribu\u00e9 au gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil mais bien \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage. Il est vrai que la Loi requiert l\u2019approbation du gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil mais il est bien \u00e9vident que cette approbation ne saurait valider un r\u00e8glement invalide pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir et celui-ci reste l\u2019acte de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 qui l\u2019a fait.\nL\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage pour la circonscription de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9tant le Ministre des Transports, il faut maintenant se demander si un ministre peut \u00eatre assign\u00e9 en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier en vertu du paragraphe (c) de l\u2019article 29 de la loi qui la r\u00e9git. Ce paragraphe se lit comme suit dans les deux versions:\nc) dans tous les cas o\u00f9 une demande est faite ou un recours est cherch\u00e9 contre un fonctionnaire de la Couronne pour une chose faite ou omise dans l\u2019accomplissement de ses devoirs comme tel; c) in all cases in which demand is made or relief sought against any officer of the Crown for anything done or omitted to be done in the performance of his duty as such officer.\nDans Pouliot c. Le Ministre des Transports[11], le pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, citant Belleau c. Le Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 Nationale et du Bien-\u00catre[12], a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un ministre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un fonctionnaire de la Couronne au sens de cette disposition disant que cette expression ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux fonctionnaires que l\u2019on d\u00e9signe habituellement en anglais comme \u00abcivil servants\u00bb.\nA ce sujet, il faut tout d\u2019abord faire observer que la disposition dont il s\u2019agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e en 1887 par l\u2019article 17 de la loi 50-51 Victoria, chapitre 16. Dans le texte primitif qui n\u2019a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune modification d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par le Parlement, l\u2019expression employ\u00e9e dans la version fran\u00e7aise est \u00abofficier de la Couronne\u00bb. C\u2019est dans la pr\u00e9paration des Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada 1927 que le mot \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9 au mot \u00abofficier\u00bb. Il est bien \u00e9vident que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par la Commission de revision uniquement dans l\u2019intention de corriger la loi sous le rapport du langage comme le permettait l\u2019article 3 de la Loi concernant les Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada (14-15 Geo. V, ch. 65) et il faut tenir compte de l\u2019article 8 de la m\u00eame loi d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel les Statuts Revis\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00ab\u00e0 titre de refonte\u00bb.\nAu surplus, il faut observer que le mot \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb n\u2019a pas n\u00e9cessairement le sens de \u00abcivil servant\u00bb. C\u2019est bien celui que pr\u00e9sentement l\u2019on donne ordinairement \u00e0 ce mot. N\u00e9anmoins, il est indubitable qu\u2019au sens premier de cette expression, les ministres sont des fonctionnaires car ils remplissent une fonction publique. On peut noter qu\u2019ils sont ainsi d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans une loi de la l\u00e9gislature du Qu\u00e9bec originairement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e quelques ann\u00e9es avant l\u2019article 29, savoir la Loi de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif (45 Victoria, c. 2, art. 2). A la m\u00eame \u00e9poque une autre loi du Qu\u00e9bec (48 Victoria, c. 6, art. 2) d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait que \u00able procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2026sont les officiers reconnus de la couronne et men- tionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 19 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile\u00bb. Cet article du code de 1867 dit:\n19. Personne ne peut plaider avec le nom d\u2019autrui, si ce n\u2019est le souverain par ses officiers reconnus\u2026\n19. No person can use the name of another to plead, except the crown through its recognized officers\u2026\nIl y a plus que cela. Dans le m\u00eame volume des statuts du Canada (50-51 Victoria) qui renferme la loi par laquelle l\u2019article 29 a \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e, on trouve au chapitre 14 ce qui suit:\n1. Le Gouverneur en conseil pourra nommer un fonctionnaire, qui sera appel\u00e9 \u00abLe Solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada\u00bb, et qui aidera au ministre de la Justice\u2026\n1. The Governor in Council may appoint an officer, who shall be called \u201cThe Solicitor General of Canada\u201d, and who shall assist the Minister of Justice\u2026\nLe solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada n\u2019est s\u00fbrement pas un \u00abcivil servant\u00bb et cependant on l\u2019appelle en fran\u00e7ais \u00abun fonctionnaire\u00bb, en anglais \u00aban officer\u00bb. Voil\u00e0 qui para\u00eet tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e9cisif. Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019au chapitre 16 le mot \u00abofficer\u00bb devrait avoir un sens diff\u00e9rent de celui qu\u2019il a au chapitre 14. On voit tr\u00e8s bien maintenant comment la Commission de revision de 1927 a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e \u00e0 substituer dans la version fran\u00e7aise du chapitre 16 le mot \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb au mot \u00abofficier\u00bb, \u00abdans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019uniformit\u00e9\u00bb selon que le lui prescrivait la loi r\u00e9gissant la refonte.\nCes textes ne sont pas les seuls o\u00f9 le mot \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb s\u2019applique aux ministres comme aux subalternes. Dans Sommers c. La Reine[13], cette Cour a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019un ministre d\u2019un gouvernement provincial est un \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb (\u00abofficial\u00bb) au sens de l\u2019article 158 (par. 1(e)) de l\u2019ancien Code criminel, comme au sens de la loi 46 Victoria, chapitre 32 o\u00f9 la version anglaise utilise le mot \u00abofficer\u00bb. On y a signal\u00e9 que les paragraphes l et m de l\u2019article 31 de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation (S.R.C. c. 158) impliquent qu\u2019un ministre de la Couronne est un fonctionnaire (\u00abofficer\u00bb) tout comme la Loi sur la transmission de la couronne (S.R.C. c. 65). On a \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 l\u2019emploi du mot \u00abofficial\u00bb appliqu\u00e9 aux ministres du gouvernement provincial dans le \u00abConstitution Act\u00bb de la Colombie-Britannique o\u00f9, depuis 1897, on l\u2019avait substitu\u00e9 au mot \u00abofficer\u00bb utilis\u00e9 dans le texte primitif de 1871. Il n\u2019a pas alors \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de se prononcer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier dans Belleau c. Le Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 Nationale et du Bien-\u00catre[14] et dans MacArthur c. Le Roi[15], on a seulement fait observer qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de cas o\u00f9 il avait paru possible de restreindre le sens du mot.\nEn effet, si Ton recherche au dictionnaire le sens de l\u2019expression \u00abofficer of the Crown\u00bb, il est impossible de ne pas y faire entrer les ministres. Ils sont essentiellement les \u00abgrands officiers de la Couronne\u00bb pour employer une expression que l\u2019on trouve dans Littr\u00e9. Dans le grand dictionnaire Oxford, on trouve comme deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00abofficer\u00bb:\n2. One who holds an office, post or place. a. One who holds a public, civil, or ecclesiastical office, a servant or minister of the king.\nDes nombreux exemples qui suivent cette d\u00e9finition, deux sont sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 retenir. Il y a tout d\u2019abord un passage d\u2019un ouvrage \u00e9crit vers 1430 par Sir John Fortescue, The governance of England:\nDe grete officers of de lande, as chaunceler, tresaurer, and prive seell.\nIl y a ensuite une phrase tir\u00e9e de Stubbs, Constitutional History (1874):\nThe great officers of the household\u2026 furnish the king with the first elements of a ministry of state.\nIl faut donc conclure que les ministres sont des \u00abfonctionnaires\u00bb (\u00abofficers\u00bb) au sens du paragraphe (c) de l\u2019article 29. Pr\u00e9cisons que cela ne veut pas dire que cette disposition permet l\u2019institution de toute esp\u00e8ce de poursuite contre eux car, pour qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oive son application, il faut que, par ailleurs, on ait droit d\u2019exercer un recours contre eux, et cette absence de recours justifie au fond la plupart d\u00e8s d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 l\u2019on a refus\u00e9 de les consid\u00e9rer vis\u00e9s par le paragraphe (c) de l\u2019article 29. Cette conclusion sur le sens de la disposition juridictionnelle dispense d\u2019examiner le bien-fond\u00e9 de la distinction entre les recours contre le ministre en tant que ministre et les recours contre lui en tant qu\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage.\nIl reste cependant \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si l\u2019action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement pouvait \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre Jones et Maheux. Le premier est d\u00e9crit comme \u00abSurintendant du pilotage\u00bb. C\u2019est une fonction dont il n\u2019est mention ni dans la partie VI de la Loi ni dans le r\u00e8glement de la circonscription. La preuve qui s\u2019y rapporte est tr\u00e8s peu satisfaisante car elle consiste uniquement en des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 certaines questions lors d\u2019un interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable. Quoique le dossier conjoint ne l\u2019indique pas, celui de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance fait voir que quelques-unes seulement de ces questions et r\u00e9ponses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en preuve lors de l\u2019audition devant le tribunal. Il suffit de dire que rien ne d\u00e9montre de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante que cette personne ait des pouvoirs juridiques qui justifient son assignation comme d\u00e9fendeur dans une action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement.\nPour ce qui est de l\u2019autre appelant, Maheux, la situation est un peu diff\u00e9rente car, \u00e0 titre de personne exer\u00e7ant les fonctions de Surintendant des pilotes de la circonscription, il est investi par le r\u00e8glement de pouvoirs importants. Ainsi, l\u2019article 3 lui attribue la direction des pilotes. Cependant, ce n\u2019est pas lui qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 du classement par le r\u00e8glement invalide. Il \u00e9tait seulement charg\u00e9 d\u2019y donner effet dans l\u2019affectation des pilotes. A l\u2019\u00e9gard du classement, sa fonction \u00e9tait donc subalterne et, cela \u00e9tant, il me para\u00eet douteux que l\u2019on puisse le consid\u00e9rer comme apte \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 quoique, par ailleurs, cette d\u00e9claration le concerne au plus haut point dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question car, comme Singleton L.J. l\u2019a dit dans Barnard v. National Dock Labour Board[16]:\nIt is a matter for the discretion of the court, and that discretion should be used sparingly. Comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance il me para\u00eet que, dans les circonstances, le demandeur doit recouvrer ses frais du d\u00e9fendeur contre lequel il r\u00e9ussit.\nSur le tout, il me para\u00eet qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel et le contre-appel aux fins suivantes:\n1\u00b0 Retrancher du jugement le paragraphe 2 relatif au classement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de la validit\u00e9 des dispositions du r\u00e8glement d\u00e9clar\u00e9es invalides par le paragraphe 1;\n2\u00b0 Supprimer l\u2019adjudication des frais contre les d\u00e9fendeurs Jones et Maheux;\n3\u00b0 Rejeter l\u2019action sans frais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9fendeurs Jones et Maheux;\n4\u00b0 Adjuger la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier contre le Ministre des Transports.\nPour ce qui est des d\u00e9pens en cette Cour, il me para\u00eet qu\u2019ils doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s en entier \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur l\u2019appel principal vu que le dispositif essentiel du jugement est confirm\u00e9, mais il n\u2019y a pas lieu de lui en accorder sur le contre-appel.\nAppel et contre-appel accueillis.\nProcureur des d\u00e9fendeurs, appelants: D.S.

Dans la proposition d\u2019assurance, le d\u00e9fendeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son permis de conduire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu au cours des trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures. Le 31 juillet 1961, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une contravention \u00e0 l\u2019art. 223 du Code criminel, son permis de conduire fut suspendu pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois. Le 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, sa police fut renouvel\u00e9e pour une autre ann\u00e9e. Au certificat de renouvellement, il \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 que \u00abl\u2019assur\u00e9 renouvelle et r\u00e9affirme au jour dudit renouvellement les d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e pour obtenir la police renouvel\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9sentes\u00bb. A la suite d\u2019un accident de la route survenu le 14 octobre 1961, le d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer des dommages aux demandeurs. Une saisie-arr\u00eat fut prise entre les mains de la compagnie intim\u00e9e qui fit une d\u00e9claration n\u00e9gative dans laquelle elle all\u00e9gua la nullit\u00e9 de la police et du renouvellement. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure statua que la saisie-arr\u00eat \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e et que la police et le certificat de renouvellement \u00e9taient en vigueur le jour de l\u2019accident. Ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel. Les demandeurs en appel\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: Les appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s, les Juges Hall et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents. Les Juges Fauteux, Martland et Judson: Le d\u00e9fendeur Fortin a induit en erreur la compagnie intim\u00e9e en acceptant le renouvellement de la police sans d\u00e9voiler que son permis de conduire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu. Ce renouvellement est nul et n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de lier la compagnie. Dans le contexte du certificat de renouvellement, la stipulation en question ne peut avoir de sens et de port\u00e9e que si elle op\u00e8re non pas en fonction d\u2019un contrat ou d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont le terme est expir\u00e9 mais en fonction d\u2019un contrat ou d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont le terme est renouvel\u00e9. Le d\u00e9fendeur a virtuellement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie que son permis de conduire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu au cours des trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures. Ceci \u00e9tait faux et \u00e9tait un fait mat\u00e9riel important et pertinent en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la nature et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue du risque. La preuve \u00e9tablit que la compagnie n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9mis le certificat de renouvellement si le d\u00e9fendeur lui avait d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 ce fait comme il y \u00e9tait tenu tant par la convention d\u2019assurance que par les dispositions de l\u2019article 2485 du Code civil. La compagnie ne doit pas subir les cons\u00e9quences de la n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9fendeur de lire la police qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e et le certificat de renouvellement qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9, et sa bonne ou mauvaise foi est sans importance vu les articles 2487 et 2488 du Code civil.\nLes juges Hall et Pigeon, dissidents: Textuellement et comme la compagnie intim\u00e9e l\u2019a r\u00e9dig\u00e9e, la stipulation dans le certificat de renouvellement \u00ables d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition\u00bb signifie ces d\u00e9clarations-l\u00e0 et pas autre chose. Il ne para\u00eet pas exact de dire que sans cela le texte n\u2019a pas de sens ni de port\u00e9e. De toute fa\u00e7on cela ne saurait constituer une raison de s\u2019\u00e9carter de ce qui para\u00eet clairement \u00eatre le sens litt\u00e9ral; \u00e0 plus forte raison quand c\u2019est l\u2019assureur qui invoque le texte du contrat qu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019un assureur, suivant l\u2019usage suivi en assurance-automobile mais non pas en assurance-incendie, consigne dans un formulaire les questions auxquelles il exige une r\u00e9ponse avant de d\u00e9livrer une police, il limite par le fait m\u00eame l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a l\u2019assur\u00e9 de lui d\u00e9clarer les faits pertinents. Le m\u00eame principe doit s\u2019appliquer au cas de renouvellement.\nL\u2019assurance n\u2019est pas invalid\u00e9e du fait que l\u2019assur\u00e9 n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 son assureur de la suspension de son permis de conduire. La d\u00e9finition des mots \u00abmodification du risque essentielle au contrat\u00bb que l\u2019on trouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 des conditions de la police, m\u00eame si elle n\u2019est pas limitative, n\u2019a pas moins le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019attirer uniquement l\u2019attention sur une cat\u00e9gorie de modifications, savoir celles qui ont trait au v\u00e9hicule lui-m\u00eame et non pas au conducteur. Il n\u2019y a rien dans la proposition sign\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9 qui soit de nature \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9clarer une suspension de permis survenant ult\u00e9rieurement. Il n\u2019y a rien non plus qui tende de quelque mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9truire l\u2019impression qui se d\u00e9gage du papillon imprim\u00e9 sur la police ainsi que des notes marginales, que l\u2019assur\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer la suspension de son permis.\nInsurance\u2014Automobile\u2014Renewal of policy\u2014Failure to declare that driver\u2019s permit had been temporarily suspended\u2014Whether material fact\u2014Whether cause of nullity of policy\u2014Civil Code, arts. 2485, 2487, 2488.\nThe respondent company issued a policy of automobile insurance to the defendant Fortin in August 1959. In his application for insurance, the defendant declared that his driver\u2019s permit had not been suspended during the previous three years. On July 31, 1961, he was convicted on a charge under s. 223 of the Criminal Code and his driver\u2019s permit was suspended for three months. On August 7, 1961, his policy was renewed for another year. The renewal certificate stipulated that the insured renewed and reaffirmed as of the day of the renewal the representations contained in the application which he signed to obtain the policy renewed by the present certificate. Following an accident on October 14, 1961, the plaintiffs were awarded damages against him. A writ of attachment was served on the respondent company which made a negative declaration in which it alleged the nullity of the policy and of the renewal. The Superior Court held that the attachment was well-founded and that the policy and the certificate of renewal were in force on the day of the accident. This judgment was reversed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Hall and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.: By accepting the renewal without revealing that his permit had been suspended, the defendant Fortin misled the respondent company. The renewal was null and did not bind the company. In the context of the certificate of renewal, the stipulation in question can only have a meaning and effect if it operates not with relation to a contract or an insurance policy the term of which has expired but with relation to a contract or insurance policy the term of which is renewed. The defendant has virtually represented to the company that his permit had not been suspended during the three previous years. This was false and was a material fact important and pertinent to the appreciation of the nature and extent of the risk. The evidence shows that the company would not have issued the certificate of renewal if the defendant had disclosed that fact as he was obliged to do as much by the contract of insurance as by the provisions of art. 2485 of the Civil Code. The company must not suffer the consequences of the defendant\u2019s failure to read the policy which he signed and the certificates of renewal which he accepted, and his good or bad faith is of no importance in view of arts. 2487 and 2488 of the Civil Code.\nPer Hall and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: Textually and as worded by the company, the stipulation in the certificate of renewal \u201cles d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition\u201d means these declarations and nothing else. This gives meaning and effect to the text. In any event, that interpretation could not constitute a reason to depart from the clear litteral meaning; all the more so when the insurer invokes the text of a contract which he drafted. When an insurer, as is customary in automobile insurance but not in fire insurance, formulates the questions and insists upon answers to them before issuing a policy, he limits by this very act the insured\u2019s obligation to declare the pertinent facts. The same principle must apply in the case of renewal.\nThe policy is not void for the reason that the insured did not disclose the suspension of his permit. Even if the definition of the words found in article 3 of the conditions \u201cmodification du risque essentielle au contrat\u201d is not restrictive, nevertheless it draws attention to only one category of modifications, namely those referring to the vehicle itself and not to the driver. In the application signed by the insured, there is nothing which is likely to inform the insured that he must disclose a suspension occurring subsequently. Furthermore, there is nothing susceptible to take away the impression arising from the rider printed on the policy as well as from the marginal notes, that the insured was not obliged to disclose the suspension of his permit.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Ouimet J.

La tierce-saisie, par son repr\u00e9sentant Antoine Berthiaume, fit une d\u00e9claration n\u00e9gative. Dans cette d\u00e9claration, elle invoque, en substance, certaines clauses de la proposition d\u2019assurance, de la police et du certificat de renouvellement et d\u00e9clare que, lors du renouvellement, Fortin ne lui a pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9, comme il y \u00e9tait tenu en vertu de la convention d\u2019assurance, le fait que son permis de conduire venait d\u2019\u00eatre suspendu. Elle pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un fait mat\u00e9riel important et pertinent en ce qui concerne l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation et l\u2019acceptation du risque par l\u2019assureur et qu\u2019en fait, elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9mis le certificat de renouvellement, ni renouvel\u00e9 la police si ce fait eut \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 sa connaissance. En cons\u00e9quence, ajoute-t-elle, elle avisa Fortin qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait nuls et non avenus ce certificat ainsi que le renouvellement et lui retourna, en m\u00eame temps, un ch\u00e8que vis\u00e9 \u00e0 son ordre au montant de $230.00 en remboursement de la prime. Enfin, la tierce-saisie conclut qu\u2019elle est bien fond\u00e9e \u00e0 demander que le certificat de renouvellement MFQ-200475, \u00e9mis le 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, et le contrat d\u2019assurance renouvel\u00e9 par ce certificat soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls et annul\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, ce qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9, d\u00e9clare-t-elle, dans sa d\u00e9fense sur l\u2019appel en garantie log\u00e9 contre elle par Fortin, dans l\u2019action prise par chacun des appelants.\nLes appelants ont contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie et demand\u00e9, particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9clarer que la police et ses renouvellements n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s. En r\u00e9ponse, la tierce-saisie lia contestation et conclut \u00e0 ce que sa d\u00e9claration soit maintenue et la contestation des appelants rejet\u00e9e.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure consid\u00e9ra, en substance, que les clauses d\u2019assurance invoqu\u00e9es par la tierce-saisie \u00e9taient ambigu\u00ebs, que le doute devait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9, que ce dernier \u00e9tait de bonne foi et que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sciemment qu\u2019il avait omis de d\u00e9clarer le fait de la suspension de son permis. Elle d\u00e9clara que la police et ses renouvellements n\u2019avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s et que la saisie-arr\u00eat \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e.\nCe jugement fut port\u00e9 en appel et cass\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du Banc de la Reine[2]. La majorit\u00e9, compos\u00e9e de M. le Juge en Chef et de MM. les Juges Pratte, Rivard et Salvas, jugea que Fortin avait induit en erreur sa compagnie d\u2019assurance en ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lant pas, lors du renouvellement, le fait de la suspension de son permis et que partant, le renouvellement de la police, \u00e9mis le 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, \u00e9tait nul et n\u2019avait pas eu pour effet de lier la Compagnie. Dissident, M. le Juge Montgomery fut d\u2019avis que si Fortin avait omis de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler ce fait, c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas cru n\u00e9cessaire de le faire vu qu\u2019il entendait s\u2019abstenir \u2014comme il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre abstenu\u2014de conduire pendant la p\u00e9riode de suspension et que, dans ces circonstances, on ne peut dire qu\u2019il a omis sciemment d\u2019informer la compagnie du fait de la suspension de son permis. La Cour d\u2019appel accueillit la d\u00e9claration de la tierce\u2011saisie et rejeta la contestation des appelants. De l\u00e0 le pourvoi de ceux-ci \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLe dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le ce qui suit. En ao\u00fbt 1959, l\u2019intim\u00e9, Atlas Assurance Company Ltd, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e la compagnie, accepta, en consid\u00e9ration du paiement d\u2019une prime sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e, des d\u00e9clarations contenues dans la proposition d\u2019assurance sign\u00e9e par Fortin et sous r\u00e9serve des limites, dispositions et conditions inscrites \u00e0 la police, d\u2019\u00e9mettre et \u00e9mit, en faveur de celui-ci, une police d\u2019assurance automobile o\u00f9 cette proposition est incorpor\u00e9e comme en faisant partie. Cette police, comme la proposition, porte la signature de Fortin. A l\u2019article 4.(A) de cette proposition, la question suivante est pos\u00e9e au proposant:\n4. (A) Est-ce que, au su du proposant, un permis, une licence, un certificat d\u2019enregistrement ou une autorisation analogue \u00e9mis \u00e0 son nom ou au nom d\u2019un membre de sa famille ou de sa maison, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation de quelque province, \u00e9tat ou pays sur les automobiles, a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 ou suspendu ou l\u2019est demeur\u00e9 au cours des trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proposition? Si oui, expliquer.\nA cette question, Fortin r\u00e9pondit \u00abnon\u00bb. A cette date, cette r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait exacte.\nCette police d\u2019assurance, couvrant la p\u00e9riode du 7 ao\u00fbt 1959 au 7 ao\u00fbt 1960, fut renouvel\u00e9e, au moyen de certificats de renouvellement livr\u00e9s \u00e0 Fortin et accept\u00e9s par lui, une premi\u00e8re fois le 7 ao\u00fbt 1960 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an, en vertu du certificat portant le no MQF-191821 et une deuxi\u00e8me fois, pour une autre ann\u00e9e, soit du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961 au 7 ao\u00fbt 1962, en vertu du certificat portant le no MQF-200475. Ce dernier certificat fut transmis \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 qui l\u2019accepta le 23 ao\u00fbt 1961 et paya la prime le 31 ao\u00fbt suivant.\nOr, quelques semaines \u00e0 peine avant cette acceptation, soit le 31 juillet 1961, Fortin avait plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 St-Jean, district d\u2019Iberville, \u00e0 l\u2019accusation d\u2019avoir, le 30 juillet 1961, dans ce district, conduit un v\u00e9hicule moteur sur un chemin public et d\u2019en avoir eu la garde et le contr\u00f4le alors que sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire \u00e9tait affaiblie par l\u2019effet de l\u2019alcool, le tout en contravention de l\u2019article 223 du Code criminel; pour cette offense, il fut condamn\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour \u00e0 payer une amende de $50 et son permis de conduire fut suspendu pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois. Fortin n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ces faits lors du renouvellement. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, il ne les a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident dont les appelants furent victimes le 14 octobre 1961. Non pas qu\u2019il les ait oubli\u00e9s, mais parce que, ainsi qu\u2019il appert de l\u2019extrait ci-apr\u00e8s de son t\u00e9moignage, il n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence de son d\u00e9faut d\u2019en informer la compagnie ou son repr\u00e9sentant.\nQ. Pourquoi ne l\u2019avez-vous pas averti?\nR. Je n\u2019ai pas vu la cons\u00e9quence de \u00e7a.\nLe renouvellement de la police, fait au moyen du certificat \u00e9mis le 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, et accept\u00e9 par Fortin le 23 ao\u00fbt 1961, constitue un nouveau contrat succ\u00e9dant au pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dont le terme \u00e9tait expir\u00e9. Ce renouvellement fut consenti sur la foi que les d\u00e9clarations et repr\u00e9sentations originales, faites dans et lors de la proposition d\u2019assurance,\u2014dont la d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e relative au permis de conduire,\u2014\u00e9taient encore exactes au moment de l\u2019acceptation du certificat de renouvellement et du paiement de la prime. Ce renouvellement fut aussi consenti sujet \u00e0 toutes les dispositions et conditions de la police initiale, non modifi\u00e9es par voie d\u2019avenant. Tout ceci appert au certificat du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961 o\u00f9 se trouvent, comme dans le certificat pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, les deux stipulations suivantes.\nLa premi\u00e8re:\nPar l\u2019acceptation du certificat de renouvellement, l\u2019Assur\u00e9 renouvelle et r\u00e9affirme au jour dudit renouvellement les d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e pour obtenir la police renouvel\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9sentes, sous r\u00e9serve de toute modification apport\u00e9e par voie d\u2019avenant.\nLa seconde:\nSous r\u00e9serve du pr\u00e9sent certificat, toutes les dispositions et conditions de la police restent pleinement en vigueur.\nEn Cour sup\u00e9rieure, on a jug\u00e9 que la premi\u00e8re stipulation \u00e9tait ambigu\u00eb et ce parce que, a\u2011t\u2011on dit, elle est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e tout comme si on avait stipul\u00e9 que par l\u2019acceptation du certificat, l\u2019assur\u00e9 confirme que ce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la proposition sign\u00e9e par lui pour obtenir la police originale \u00e9tait exact \u00e0 la date de cette proposition. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne vois pas que cette interpr\u00e9tation soit possible. Dans le contexte du certificat de renouvelle- ment, la stipulation ne peut avoir de sens et de port\u00e9e que si elle op\u00e8re non pas en fonction d\u2019un contrat ou d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont le terme est expir\u00e9 mais en fonction d\u2019un contrat ou d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont le terme est renouvel\u00e9. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, cette stipulation ne fait qu\u2019exprimer ce qu\u2019on a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu comme \u00e9tant implicite dans le cas de polices accident ou incendie, o\u00f9 l\u2019assureur peut d\u00e9cliner de renouveler la police originale \u00e0 l\u2019expiration du terme d\u2019icelle. Sun Insurance Office v. Roy[3]. Ainsi donc, en gardant le silence ou en omettant de d\u00e9clarer ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de d\u00e9clarer, lors de l\u2019acceptation du renouvellement du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, Fortin a virtuellement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e que son permis de conduire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu au cours des trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures. Ceci \u00e9tait faux.\nParmi les dispositions et conditions de la police qui, en vertu de la deuxi\u00e8me stipulation du certificat de renouvellement, demeuraient pleinement en vigueur, il y a lieu de retenir celles de l\u2019article 3. (1) et celles de l\u2019article 8.\nL\u2019article 3. (1) est en ces termes:\n3. (1) L\u2019Assur\u00e9 nomm\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans la police doit avertir promptement l\u2019Assureur ou son repr\u00e9sentant local, par \u00e9crit, de toute modification du risque essentielle au contrat qui vient \u00e0 sa connaissance.\nOn sait que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident dont les appelants furent victimes le 14 octobre 1961 que Fortin r\u00e9v\u00e9la \u00e0 l\u2019assureur le fait que son permis de conduire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu le 31 juillet 1961 pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois par suite d\u2019une contravention au Code criminel. Ce fait, tel qu\u2019il appert aux t\u00e9moignages d\u2019Antoine Berthiaume, ancien employ\u00e9 de la Compagnie intim\u00e9e, et d\u2019Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, expert d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9, et ainsi qu\u2019en a jug\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel, est un fait mat\u00e9riel important et pertinent en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue du risque. C\u2019est un fait qui peut emp\u00eacher l\u2019assureur de l\u2019assumer ou influer sur le taux de la prime. En fait, la preuve \u00e9tablit que la compagnie intim\u00e9e n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9mis le certificat de renouvellement ou renouvel\u00e9 la police si Fortin le lui eut d\u00e9nonc\u00e9, comme il y \u00e9tait tenu tant par la convention d\u2019assurance qui le liait \u00e0 l\u2019assureur que par les dispositions de l\u2019article 2485 C.C. L\u2019article 8 qui appara\u00eet en gros caract\u00e8res et \u00e0 l\u2019encre rouge, en anglais dans la proposition et en fran\u00e7ais dans la police d\u2019assurance, toutes deux sign\u00e9es par Fortin, est en ces termes:\nIf the Applicant falsely describes the property to be Insured to the prejudice of the Insurer or knowingly misrepresents or conceals or omits to communicate any circumstances required by this application to be made known to the Insurer, the Policy shall be void as to the property insured or risk undertaken in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission is made; or where the Insured violates a term or condition of the Policy or commits a fraud or makes a wilfully false statement with respect to a claim under the Policy, such claim by the Insured shall be invalid and the right of the Insured to recover indemnity shall be forfeited.\nSi le proposant d\u00e9crit faussement l\u2019objet de l\u2019assurance, au pr\u00e9judice de l\u2019Assureur ou sciemment d\u00e9nature, dissimule ou omet de communiquer quelque fait que la pr\u00e9sente proposition exige qu\u2019on fasse conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019Assureur, la police sera nulle quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet assur\u00e9 ou aux risques garantis auxquels se rapporte la fausse d\u00e9claration ou omission. De m\u00eame, lorsque l\u2019Assur\u00e9 viole une disposition ou condition de la police ou commet une fraude ou fait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment une fausse d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation soumise en vertu de la police, la r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019Assur\u00e9 sera sans valeur et l\u2019Assur\u00e9 perdra tout droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\nLes italiques sont de moi.\nLes dispositions de cet article re\u00e7oivent ici leur application. En tout respect pour l\u2019opinion contraire, je dois dire qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis, le mot sciemment dans le texte fran\u00e7ais et le mot knowingly dans le texte anglais, ont, dans le contexte de la proposition et de la police, le m\u00eame sens qui fut attribu\u00e9 au mot knowingly apparaissant dans une disposition statutaire substantiellement et presque mot \u00e0 mot identique, par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, alors compos\u00e9e du Juge en chef Robertson et de MM. les Juges Fisher et Kellock, dans Sleigh v. Stevenson[4] et par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-\u00c8cosse, alors compos\u00e9e du Juge en chef Ilsley et de MM. les Juges Doull, Parker et Currie, dans General Accident Co. of Canada v. Button[5]. Dans ces deux causes, on a jug\u00e9 que le mot knowingly \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9\n\u2026in the sense that the applicant has in his possession information that what is in fact stated in the application is untrue or does not disclose the truth.\nPour excuser l\u2019omission de Fortin, on a soumis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de bonne foi, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas lu la police d\u2019assurance et le certificat de renouvellement et que, lors du renouvellement, on ne lui avait pos\u00e9 aucune question et on ne lui avait pas cons\u00e9quemment demand\u00e9 si son permis de conduire \u00e9tait ou avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu. Comme le d\u00e9clare M. le juge Salvas, avec l\u2019accord de ses coll\u00e8gues formant la majorit\u00e9, la compagnie intim\u00e9e ne doit pas subir les cons\u00e9quences de la n\u00e9gligence de Fortin de lire la police qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e et les certificats de renouvellement qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9s, et sa bonne ou mauvaise foi est sans importance, la loi d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant en termes formels que les r\u00e9ticences par erreur ou de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 sur un fait de nature \u00e0 diminuer l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du risque sont des causes de nullit\u00e9 (2487 C.C.) et, dans ce cas, ont le m\u00eame effet que les r\u00e9ticences frauduleuses (2488 C.C.): elles entra\u00eenent la nullit\u00e9 du contrat. La compagnie intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d\u2019aviser Fortin qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait comme nuls et non avenus le certificat de renouvellement et le renouvellement du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961 et de lui transmettre en m\u00eame temps un ch\u00e8que vis\u00e9 \u00e0 son ordre en remboursement de la prime.\nD\u2019accord avec le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, je dirais que Fortin a induit en erreur sa compagnie d\u2019assurance en acceptant sans rien dire le renouvellement du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, que ce renouvellement \u00e9mis en sa faveur est nul et que partant, il n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de lier la compagnie intim\u00e9e.\nIl va de soi que sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s les recours des appelants, d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019obligation que la tierce-saisie intim\u00e9e a reconnu avoir, au paragraphe 13 de sa d\u00e9claration, en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019indemnisation des victimes d\u2019accidents d\u2019automobile, S.R.Q. 1964, c. 232.\nJe rejetterais les deux appels avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe jugement des Juges Hall et Pigeon fut rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON (dissident):\u2014A la suite d\u2019un grave accident de la route survenu le 14 octobre 1961 le d\u00e9fendeur, Marc Fortin, a \u00e9t\u00e9, le 2 avril 1964, condamn\u00e9 solidairement avec les h\u00e9ritiers de Fernand Cloutier \u00e0 payer au demandeur appelant Lorenzo Turgeon $26,992.19 et \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse Lucille Bolduc qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait alors comme curateur, $36,000, le tout avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens dans chaque cas.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Fortin le 7 ao\u00fbt 1959 une police d\u2019assurance automobile comportant une assurance-responsabilit\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $25,000 pour dommages r\u00e9sultant de blessures \u00e0 une seule personne et, sous r\u00e9serve de cette limite, de $50,000 pour de tels dommages \u00e0 plus d\u2019une personne dans un m\u00eame accident en outre de $5,000 pour dommages aux biens d\u2019autrui. Cette police valable pour un an avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e pour deux p\u00e9riodes semblables, le dernier certificat de renouvellement portant la date du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961.\nLe 29 mai 1962, les procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e adressaient \u00e0 Fortin une lettre se lisant comme suit:\nNous sommes les procureurs de Atlas Assurance Company Limited. Le ou vers le 7 ao\u00fbt 1959, notre cliente a \u00e9mis en votre faveur une police d\u2019assurances-automobile portant le no 1065257.\nLe 7 ao\u00fbt 1961, vous avez accept\u00e9 de notre cliente un certificat de renouvellement de cette police pour la p\u00e9riode du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961 au 7 ao\u00fbt 1962. Il est \u00e9crit dans ce certificat de renouvellement que par son acceptation l\u2019assur\u00e9 renouvelle et r\u00e9affirme les d\u00e9clarations contenues dans la proposition qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e pour obtenir la police renouvel\u00e9e. Or dans la proposition que vous avez sign\u00e9e pour obtenir votre police au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1959, vous aviez r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019article 4 que votre permis ou licence n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 ni suspendu au cours des trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 votre proposition.\nVos assureurs ont appris que lorsque vous avez accept\u00e9 leur certificat de renouvellement no MQF-200475 au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1961, votre permis de conduire ou licence \u00e9tait suspendu \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une plainte port\u00e9e contre vous. Ce fait \u00e9tait inconnu par vos assureurs lorsqu\u2019ils ont \u00e9mis leur certificat de renouvellement et vous n\u2019avez pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le porter \u00e0 leur attention.\nDans les circonstances Atlas Assurance Company Limited consid\u00e8re son certificat de renouvellement du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961 renouvelant la police no 1065257 nul et non avenu. Vous trouverez ci-attach\u00e9 un ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 \u00e0 votre ordre de Atlas Assurance Company Limited portant le no 72411, au montant de $230 en remboursement de votre prime.\nVous voudrez bien nous retourner la police et le certificat de renouvellement par prochain courrier.\nA la suite de cette lettre une action en garantie fut institu\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans chaque cause et cette action fut rencontr\u00e9e par un plaidoyer all\u00e9guant en substance les moyens invoqu\u00e9s dans la lettre du 29 mai 1962 et demandant qu\u2019il soit donn\u00e9 acte de l\u2019offre du remboursement de la prime par le ch\u00e8que transmis \u00e0 Fortin et que le contrat d\u2019assurance et le renouvellement soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls et non avenus \u00e0 partir du 7 ao\u00fbt 1961 et r\u00e9sili\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit. Alors que ces derni\u00e8res proc\u00e9dures \u00e9taient toujours en instance, les appelants se sont pourvus par saisie-arr\u00eat entre les mains de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci a produit dans chaque cause une d\u00e9claration o\u00f9, apr\u00e8s avoir relat\u00e9 sa lettre du 29 mai 1962 et les moyens qui y sont invoqu\u00e9s, elle termine comme suit:\n12. Dans les circonstances, la tierce-saisie est bien fond\u00e9e \u00e0 demander que le certificat de renouvellement num\u00e9ro MQF-200475 et le contrat d\u2019assurance renouvel\u00e9 par ledit certificat soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls et annul\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, ce qu\u2019elle a fait par son plaidoyer sur l\u2019action en garantie intent\u00e9e contre elle par le d\u00e9fendeur Marc Fortin dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier;\n13. Cependant la tierce-saisie reconna\u00eet son obligation en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi de l\u2019indemnisation des victimes d\u2019accidents d\u2019automobile jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant prescrit \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de cette Loi lors de l\u2019accident dont le demandeur fut victime, le ou vers le 14 octobre 1961, sujet \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019article 82 de ladite Loi;\n14. La tierce-saisie n\u2019a aucun revenu, effets mobiliers, rente ou somme d\u2019argent appartenant au d\u00e9fendeur Marc Fortin et elle ne doit rien audit d\u00e9fendeur;\nDans chaque cause une contestation fut produite en conclusion de laquelle le demandeur prie le tribunal de d\u00e9clarer que la police et le certificat de renouvellement \u00e9taient en vigueur lors de l\u2019accident, de valider la saisie-arr\u00eat et d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la tierce-saisie de d\u00e9poser au greffe:\nle plein montant pr\u00e9vu par ladite police en cas d\u2019accident o\u00f9 il y a plus d\u2019une victime soit la somme de $50,000 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis l\u2019assignation sur l\u2019action principale et les frais sur icelle; pour les dites sommes \u00eatre remises au demandeur en application sur le jugement intervenu en sa faveur.\nIl est \u00e9vident qu\u2019en r\u00e9digeant ces conclusions on a omis de tenir compte que puisqu\u2019il y avait en l\u2019occurrence deux personnes ayant subi des blessures et obtenu des condamnations distinctes pour les dommages en d\u00e9coulant, ce n\u2019est pas le maximum de $50,000 qu\u2019il fallait appliquer \u00e0 chacune mais bien celui de $25,000. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, on para\u00eet aussi avoir oubli\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement que la police pr\u00e9voit en outre du maximum de $50,000 pour la responsibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant des dommages \u00e0 la personne, un maximum de $5,000 pour la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant des dommages aux biens d\u2019autrui. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure fit droit aux conclusions telles que formul\u00e9es par deux jugements en date du 23 mars 1965. La Cour d\u2019appel[6], avec une dissidence, a cass\u00e9 ces jugements. Dans chaque cas les conclusions de l\u2019arr\u00eat sont les suivantes:\nACCUEILLE l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens, CASSE le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, MAINTIENT la d\u00e9claration de la tierce-saisie-appelante et REJETTE la contestation du demandeur-intim\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nOn semble avoir compl\u00e8tement oubli\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer que d\u2019apr\u00e8s une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, lorqu\u2019un contrat n\u2019est pas d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 absolue d\u2019ordre public, il demeure en vigueur tant qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas annul\u00e9. Le juge en chef Rinfret dit dans Consumers Cordage Co. Ltd. v. St. Gabriel Land[7].\nIf, however, the agreement, although not being against public order, was simply illegal on account of being made in perpetuity, then it might have been looked upon as merely voidable, remaining in existence until annulled by a judgment of a court of justice, and the appellant would have found itself in difficulty in view of the absence in its plea of any conclusions for annulment\u2026\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel dans un cas semblable \u00e0 celui-ci: Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company v. Lyonnais et Desjardins[8]. Le juge Pratte dit:\nQuant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure y a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement par plusieurs motifs, dont le principal est que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 l\u2019annulation du contrat en question. Ce motif est p\u00e9remptoire. Chacun sait, en effet, que les vices du consentement n\u2019ont pas pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher la formation du contrat, mais seulement de donner ouverture \u00e0 la demande en nullit\u00e9, par voie d\u2019action ou d\u2019exception. Or, l\u2019appelante n\u2019ayant pas conclu \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 du contrat, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019e\u00fbt pas pu la prononcer, m\u00eame si elle fut venue \u00e0 la conclusion que le consentement de l\u2019appelante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9.\nCela \u00e9tant, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019examiner le point de savoir si la d\u00e9claration que l\u2019appelante reproche \u00e0 son assur\u00e9e e\u00fbt pu entra\u00eener la nullit\u00e9 du contrat.\nUn arr\u00eat analogue a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le m\u00eame tribunal dans L\u00e9ger et al. c. La S\u00e9curit\u00e9[9]. On y rel\u00e8ve le consid\u00e9rant suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la cause de nullit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur de fausses repr\u00e9sentations r\u00e9sultant des faits requis lors de la proposition d\u2019assurance n\u2019est pas absolue, mais seulement relative, de sorte que celui qui entend se pr\u00e9valoir, de l\u2019annulabilit\u00e9 de la police doit express\u00e9ment conclure \u00e0 cet effet; que s\u2019il y a manquement \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle imp\u00e9rative, le contrat continue \u00e0 lier les parties et subsiste dans ses effets;\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, comme on l\u2019a vu, une demande de nullit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019action en garantie laquelle d\u00e9fense a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la contestation de la saisie-arr\u00eat, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e0 cette instance-l\u00e0 soumis de conclusions \u00e0 cette fin. La Cour d\u2019appel pouvait-elle consid\u00e9rer que la fa\u00e7on dont le litige a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 et poursuivi suffisait \u00e0 disposer de cet obstacle sans que la nullit\u00e9 soit prononc\u00e9e? Cette question n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par les parties ni d\u00e9battue \u00e0 l\u2019audition, je m\u2019abstiendrai de l\u2019approfondir vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en viens sur le fond. Le premier moyen retenu par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u00e9coule essentiellement de la phrase suivante ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le certificat de renouvellement:\nPar l\u2019acceptation du certificat de renouvellement, l\u2019Assur\u00e9 renouvelle et r\u00e9affirme au jour dudit renouvellement les d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e pour obtenir la police renouvel\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9sentes, sous r\u00e9serve de toute modification apport\u00e9e par voie d\u2019avenant.\nEn regard de ce texte on fait valoir que le d\u00e9claration renferme une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la question suivante:\nEst-ce que, au su du proposant, un permis, une licence, un certificat d\u2019enregistrement ou une autorisation analogue \u00e9mis \u00e0 son nom ou au nom d\u2019un membre de sa famille ou de sa maison, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation de quelque province, \u00e9tat ou pays sur les automobiles, a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 ou suspendu ou l\u2019est demeur\u00e9 au cours des trois ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proposition? Si oui, expliquer.\nOn dit que dans le contexte du certificat de renouvellement la stipulation ne peut avoir de sens et de port\u00e9e que si elle op\u00e8re non pas en fonction d\u2019un contrat ou d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont le terme est expir\u00e9 mais en fonction d\u2019un contrat ou d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont le terme est renouvel\u00e9. Je ne puis admettre ce raisonnement.\nCe qu\u2019il faut d\u2019abord se demander c\u2019est quel est le sens du texte comme il est \u00e9crit et comme peut le comprendre un homme d\u2019affaires ou un autre citoyen. En principe, il faut lire ce texte comme il est \u00e9crit. Or comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a r\u00e9dig\u00e9, il stipule que l\u2019assur\u00e9 \u00abrenouvelle et r\u00e9affirme au jour dudit renouvellement les d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition\u00bb. Il s\u2019agit donc des d\u00e9clarations que renferme la proposition, non pas de d\u00e9clarations analogues se rapportant \u00e0 une autre p\u00e9riode de temps. A mon avis, textuellement, \u00ables d\u00e9clarations que contient la proposition\u00bb signifie ces d\u00e9clarations-l\u00e0 et pas autre chose. Il faut s\u2019\u00e9carter du texte pour ne pas y voir identiquement la m\u00eame affirmation. D\u2019ailleurs l\u2019emploi du mot \u00abr\u00e9affirme\u00bb en outre du mot \u00abrenouvelle\u00bb emp\u00eache de donner \u00e0 celui-ci un sens autre que celui de r\u00e9it\u00e9rer.\nAvec toute la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence que je dois \u00e0 ceux qui pensent le contraire, il ne me para\u00eet pas exact de dire que sans cela le texte n\u2019a pas de sens ni de port\u00e9e. Tout d\u2019abord, ce n\u2019est s\u00fbrement pas un non-sens que de r\u00e9affirmer la d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure; cela peut \u00eatre d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 contestable mais ce n\u2019est certainement pas illogique: une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition inutile n\u2019est pas une absurdit\u00e9. Or, pour s\u2019\u00e9carter de ce qui est \u00e0 mon avis le sens litt\u00e9ral, c\u2019est une absurdit\u00e9 qu\u2019il faudrait trouver. On ne peut pas davantage d\u00e9montrer que cela n\u2019a pas de port\u00e9e car si la d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exacte, il ne serait s\u00fbrement pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat de pouvoir s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir pour d\u00e9montrer la nullit\u00e9 du renouvellement comme celle de la police originale. \u00c9videmment, cet int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u2019est pas celui que pr\u00e9sente une d\u00e9claration relative non pas aux trois ans qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent la police mais aux trois ans qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent le renouvellement. A mon avis, cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il est inexistant.\nDe toute fa\u00e7on, cela ne saurait constituer une raison de s\u2019\u00e9carter de ce qui me para\u00eet clairement \u00eatre le sens litt\u00e9ral. Dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un manufacturier de colle, cette Cour a refus\u00e9 de s\u2019\u00e9carter du sens litt\u00e9ral de l\u2019exclusion de toute responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un contrat par le motif qu\u2019autrement on ne pouvait imaginer dans quelle circonstance la protection de l\u2019assurance pouvait jouer: The Canadian Indemnity Co. v. Andrews & George Co. Ltd.[10] A plus forte raison, doit-il en \u00eatre ainsi quand c\u2019est l\u2019assureur qui invoque le texte du contrat qu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 puisque tout doute doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9 contre lui du fait qu\u2019il est l\u2019auteur du document.\nIl faut d\u2019ailleurs consid\u00e9rer que la stipulation dont il s\u2019agit ne se rapporte pas qu\u2019\u00e0 la seule d\u00e9claration ci-haut relat\u00e9e. Il y a entre autres la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question suivante:\nIndiquer \u00e0 quels usages l\u2019automobile doit servir principalement.\nIl est clair que la stipulation telle que formul\u00e9e dans le certificat de renouvellement s\u2019applique parfaitement \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration-l\u00e0 et a un plein sens et une pleine port\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Si l\u2019on a omis de la r\u00e9diger de fa\u00e7on telle qu\u2019elle ait autant d\u2019effet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019autres d\u00e9clarations, c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui doit en subir les cons\u00e9quences.\nL\u2019appelante soutient ensuite que la stipulation comme elle veut qu\u2019on l\u2019interpr\u00e8te ne fait qu\u2019exprimer ce qu\u2019on a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu comme implicite. Elle invoque l\u2019arr\u00eat de notre Cour dans Sun Insurance Office c. Roy[11]. Dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une assurance incendie et l\u2019on a dit que le renouvellement impliquait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de changement dans l\u2019usage de la chose assur\u00e9e. Cependant le motif essentiel par lequel on a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action c\u2019est que l\u2019on a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019assur\u00e9 avait manqu\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la clause du contrat invalidant la police au cas d\u2019un changement sans avis \u00e0 l\u2019assureur. A mon avis, lorsqu\u2019un assureur, suivant l\u2019usage suivi en assurance-automobile mais non en assurance-incendie, consigne dans un formulaire les questions auxquelles il exige une r\u00e9ponse avant de d\u00e9livrer une police, il limite par le fait m\u00eame l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a l\u2019assur\u00e9 de lui d\u00e9clarer les faits pertinents Le m\u00eame principe doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 au cas de renouvellement. L\u2019assureur ayant choisi d\u2019ins\u00e9rer une stipulation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, on doit s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle comporte. C\u2019est lui qui choisit d\u2019exp\u00e9dier le renouvellement par la poste sans demande, sans enqu\u00eate en sollicitant seulement la remise de la prime.\nIl faut maintenant examiner le second moyen de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui consiste essentiellement \u00e0 soutenir que l\u2019assurance est invalid\u00e9e du fait que l\u2019assur\u00e9 n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 son assureur de la suspension de son permis de conduire. A ce sujet, il est indispensable de consid\u00e9rer en entier l\u2019article 3 des conditions de la police lequel, y compris les notes marginales, se lit comme suit:\nMODIFICATION ESSENTIELLE DU RISQUE\n3. (1) L\u2019Assur\u00e9 nomm\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans la police doit avertir promptement l\u2019Assureur ou son repr\u00e9sentant local, par \u00e9crit, de toute modification du risque essentielle au contrat qui vient \u00e0 sa connaissance;\n(2) Sans restreindre la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les mots \u00abmodification du risque essentielle au contrat\u00bb comprennent:\nVente\n(a) tout changement de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable que l\u2019Assur\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 dans la police poss\u00e8de dans l\u2019automobile par vente, cession ou autrement, sauf si ce changement se produit par voie de succession, de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de proc\u00e9dures prises en vertu de la loi de faillite;\net dans les cas autres que les polices d\u2019assurance automobile de responsabilit\u00e9 civile et de frais m\u00e9dicaux:\nHypoth\u00e8que, cr\u00e9ance ou charge\n(b) toute hypoth\u00e8que, cr\u00e9ance ou charge dont l\u2019automobile devient grev\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la proposition d\u2019assurance;\nAutre assurance\n(c) toute autre assurance du m\u00eame int\u00e9r\u00eat, qu\u2019elle soit valide ou non, couvrant, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie, la perte ou le dommage assur\u00e9s par la police.\nIl faut bien noter que le texte ne vise pas toute modification du risque mais seulement une modification \u00abessentielle au contrat\u00bb. Quelles modifications sont \u00abessentielles\u00bb, on ne le dit pas. Cependant, la seule modification que le texte mentionne explicitement comme devant faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9claration imm\u00e9diate dans un cas semblable c\u2019est l\u2019ali\u00e9nation de l\u2019automobile. M\u00eame si cette d\u00e9finition n\u2019est pas limitative, elle n\u2019a pas moins le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019attirer uniquement l\u2019attention sur une seule cat\u00e9gorie de modifications, savoir celles qui ont trait au v\u00e9hicule lui-m\u00eame et non pas au conducteur. N\u2019est-ce pas suffisant pour que l\u2019on doive en d\u00e9duire que celles-l\u00e0 seules sont \u00abessentielles\u00bb? N\u2019oublions pas que si la police n\u2019assure que l\u2019automobile qui y est d\u00e9crite, par contre elle assure tout conducteur quel qu\u2019il soit.\nCe n\u2019est pas tout. Si l\u2019on regarde, comme un lecteur ordinaire non pas tant le texte en caract\u00e8res minuscules que ce qui attire l\u2019attention, les notes marginales en caract\u00e8res gras, on constate que sous le titre \u00abModification essentielle du risque\u00bb tout ce que l\u2019on signale c\u2019est \u00abVente\u00bb, \u00abHypoth\u00e8que, cr\u00e9ance ou charge\u00bb, et \u00abAutre assurance\u00bb. Comment veut-on que celui qui n\u2019est ni homme de loi, ni sp\u00e9cialiste en assurance soit en mesure de d\u00e9duire d\u2019un tel texte qu\u2019il a l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9clarer toute suspension de permis de conduire? Si l\u2019assureur entendait que l\u2019assur\u00e9 soit oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer tout fait de la nature de ceux qui font l\u2019objet de questions dans la proposition d\u2019assurance, il lui \u00e9tait loisible de le dire en termes non \u00e9quivoques. La condition comme elle est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ne comporte rien de tel.\nIl faut aussi consid\u00e9rer que, sur la premi\u00e8re page de la police au-dessus de la proposition sign\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9, il y a un papillon imprim\u00e9 en rouge en gros caract\u00e8res comme suit:\nIMPORTANT\nLa prime qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9e pour cette assurance est bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019entente que:\n(1) l\u2019automobile est principalement employ\u00e9e aux fins de plaisance; et.\n(2) qu\u2019il n\u2019y a dans la maison, aucun conducteur masculin de l\u2019automobile ni aucune personne engag\u00e9e comme chauffeur, qui ait moins de 25 ans.\nSi ces conditions ne s\u2019appliquent pas maintenant, ou cessent de s\u2019appliquer plus tard, veuillez en avertir votre agent imm\u00e9diatement.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et le juge dissident de la Cour du banc de la reine ont vu l\u00e0 quelque chose de nature \u00e0 mettre l\u2019assur\u00e9 sous l\u2019impression qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer la suspension de son permis. On fait valoir qu\u2019au bas de la proposition sign\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9 on a imprim\u00e9 en rouge et en gros caract\u00e8res le texte suivant:\nSi le proposant d\u00e9crit faussement l\u2019objet de l\u2019assurance, au pr\u00e9judice de l\u2019Assureur ou sciemment d\u00e9nature, dissimule ou omet de communiquer quelque fait que la pr\u00e9sente proposition exige qu\u2019on fasse conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019Assureur, la police sera nulle quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet assur\u00e9 ou aux risques garantis auxquels se rapporte la fausse d\u00e9claration ou omission. De m\u00eame, lorsque l\u2019Assur\u00e9 viole une disposition ou condition de la police ou commet une fraude ou fait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment une fausse d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation soumise en vertu de la police, la r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019Assur\u00e9 sera sans valeur et l\u2019Assur\u00e9 perdra tout droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019y a rien l\u00e0-dedans qui soit de nature \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9clarer une suspension de permis survenant ult\u00e9rieurement. Il n\u2019y a rien non plus qui tende de quelque mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9truire l\u2019impression qui se d\u00e9gage du papillon et des notes marginales.\nC\u2019est une infraction pour un commer\u00e7ant que de publier une annonce trompeuse ou d\u2019offrir de la marchandise dans un emballage de nature \u00e0 induire le consommateur en erreur sur la qualit\u00e9 du contenu. Comment peut-on logiquement en regard de ces principes, reconna\u00eetre en faveur d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation dont sa police ne permet pas \u00e0 l\u2019homme moyen de soup\u00e7onner l\u2019existence: personne ne nie que c\u2019est de bonne foi que Fortin a jur\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se croyait pas oblig\u00e9 d\u2019informer son assureur de la suspension de son permis.\nEn statuant sur l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019obligation impos\u00e9e aux assur\u00e9s de donner avis \u00e0 l\u2019assureur de toute modification du risque, il importe de tenir compte de la gravit\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences qui en d\u00e9coulent. L\u2019assureur est affranchi de ses obligations m\u00eame si, comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la perte n\u2019y est pas reli\u00e9e. Le moins qu\u2019on puisse exiger c\u2019est que l\u2019obligation de donner l\u2019avis soit clairement stipul\u00e9e dans le contrat d\u2019assurance et que l\u2019assur\u00e9 ne soit pas mis par l\u2019assureur sous l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle n\u2019existe pas.\nLe jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel implique que, sans que les conditions ordinaires de la police d\u2019assurance-automobile en vigueur au Qu\u00e9bec le disent de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente pour le public, tous les assur\u00e9s qui ont subi une suspension de permis de conduire cessent ipso facto d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s s\u2019ils n\u2019en ont pas pr\u00e9venu par \u00e9crit leur assureur, et il en est sans doute de m\u00eame pour tous ceux dont un membre de leur famille ou de leur maison a subi cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Je ne puis admettre une pareille cons\u00e9quence en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition suffisamment explicite pour \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement comprise et connue du public. Il me para\u00eet inadmissible que des cons\u00e9quences draconiennes d\u00e9coulent d\u2019un texte ambigu qui est l\u2019\u0153uvre des assureurs et que les assur\u00e9s doivent prendre comme il leur est offert.\nAu sujet de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019Appel d\u2019Ontario Sleigh c. Stevenson[12], il faut dire tout d\u2019abord qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une situation bien diff\u00e9rente. On \u00e9tait en pr\u00e9sence de r\u00e9ponses inexactes inscrites dans la proposition. On a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019assur\u00e9 devait en subir les cons\u00e9quences quoique ce f\u00fbt l\u2019agent auquel la situation exacte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e qui avait inscrit les r\u00e9ponses incorrectes. Cela ne saurait faire jurisprudence dans une cause du Qu\u00e9bec: nous avons tout r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 un arr\u00eat en sens contraire de la Cour d\u2019Appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans Compagnie \u00c9quitable d\u2019Assurance contre le feu c. Gagn\u00e9[13].\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-\u00c8cosse, General Accident Assurance Co. c. Button[14], l\u00e0 encore on se trouve en pr\u00e9sence de r\u00e9ponses inexactes \u00e0 des questions formul\u00e9es dans la proposition. L\u2019assur\u00e9, pour s\u2019en disculper, cherchait \u00e0 prendre pr\u00e9texte du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas lu le document que l\u2019agent avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s une autre proposition. Cela n\u2019est nullement notre cas.\nA mon avis, le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel dans chaque cause doit \u00eatre infirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Cependant, pour le motif indiqu\u00e9 au d\u00e9but, il me para\u00eet impossible de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne pourraient s\u2019entendre sur des conclusions conformes \u00e0 leurs droits, je permettrais aux appelants de demander une r\u00e9audition aux fins de les formuler.\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens, les Juges HALL et PIGEON \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur des demandeurs, appelants: R.

La compagnie P N avait un trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance avec la compagnie G L, visant 75 pour cent de la responsabilit\u00e9 totale, et un autre trait\u00e9 avec la compagnie L pour toute perte exc\u00e9dant $12,500. La demanderesse a pris une saisie-arr\u00eat en ex\u00e9cution de son jugement entre les mains de la compagnie G L et du repr\u00e9sentant de L. Les tiers-saisis firent une d\u00e9claration n\u00e9gative qui fut contest\u00e9e. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 la contestation de la d\u00e9claration des tiers-saisis. La demanderesse en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa compagnie G L n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un coassureur. La police d\u2019assurance d\u00e9livr\u00e9e \u00e0 C ne mentionne que la compagnie P N. Il est impossible de trouver dans les trait\u00e9s de r\u00e9assurance un texte pouvant \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une stipulation pour autrui, \u00e0 savoir en faveur des assur\u00e9s de la compagnie P.N. Comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re de C, la demanderesse ne peut pas se pr\u00e9valoir des dispositions de l\u2019art. 1031 du Code civil. Le dossier fait voir que le tribunal charg\u00e9 de surveiller la liquidation de la compagnie P N a sp\u00e9cifiquement autoris\u00e9 le liquidateur \u00e0 intervenir pour soutenir qu\u2019il lui appartenait de toucher tous les montants dus par les tiers-saisis.\nOn ne peut pas voir dans les trait\u00e9s de r\u00e9assurance un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le trait\u00e9 avec la compagnie L ne pr\u00e9voit pas de partage de profits. Quant \u00e0 la compagnie G L, le seul fait de participer dans les profits d\u2019une compagnie n\u2019entra\u00eene pas une pr\u00e9somption de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019intention \u00e9tait de faire une convention de r\u00e9assurance. La compagnie G L n\u2019entendait pas se rendre responsable de la totalit\u00e9 des obligations de la compagnie P N. De plus elle entendait se lier uniquement envers la compagnie avec laquelle elle traitait et non pas envers les assur\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re. La jurisprudence de la common law, dont les r\u00e8gles sur la formation du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 semblent identiques \u00e0 celles du droit qu\u00e9becois, para\u00eet fix\u00e9e dans le sens qu\u2019un trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance avec participation aux profits ne constitue pas un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Enfin, le trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance avec la compagnie G L n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e.\nInsurance\u2014Automobile\u2014Insurer bankrupt\u2014Seizure by garnishment against reinsurer\u2014Whether reinsurer a coinsurer\u2014Whether contract of reinsurance a stipulation for the benefit of third persons\u2014Whether contract of reinsurance a contract of partnership\u2014Civil Code, art. 1029, 1031, 1830, 1831, 2468.\nFollowing an automobile accident, the plaintiff obtained a judgment against C, the owner of the automobile who later declared bankruptcy, and whose insurer, the company P N, was ordered to be wound-up. The insurer P N had signed a contract of reinsurance with the company G L, covering 75 per cent of the total liability, and another contract with the company L for all losses in excess of $12,500. The plaintiff took a seizure by garnishment against G L and the agent of L. Both garnishees made a negative declaration which was contested. The Superior Court and the Court of Appeal dismissed the contestation of the garnishees\u2019 declaration. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe company G L was not a co-insurer. The insurance policy in favour of C mentions only the name of the company P N. It is not possible to find in the reinsurance contracts anything capable of being interpreted as a stipulation for the benefit of third persons, in this instance the insured of company P N. As a creditor of C, the plaintiff could not exercise the rights conferred by art. 1031 of the Civil Code. The record discloses that the liquidator of the company P N was specifically authorized by the Court having jurisdiction over the winding-up to put in a claim for any moneys owed by the garnishees.\nThe contracts of reinsurance in this case are not contracts of partnership. The contract with the company L does not provide for participation in the profits. As to the company G L, the mere fact of the participation in the profits of a company does not create a presumption of partnership. In the present case, the intention was to make a contract of reinsurance. The company G L had no intention of assuming all of the obligations of the company P N. Moreover, it intended to oblige itself only towards the company with which it was contracting and not towards the insured of the latter. It is settled by the jurisprudence of the Common Law, the rules of which respecting the formation of a contract of partnership appear to be identical with the rules in Quebec, that a contract of reinsurance with participation in the profits does not constitute a contract of partnership. Finally, the contract of reinsurance with the company G L did not create an undeclared partnership.

Le 8 novembre 1963, un jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre ce dernier \u00e0 la poursuite de son tuteur pour la somme de $14,652.67 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. Cyr se mit en faillite et Jean Marien fut nomm\u00e9 syndic. Il \u00e9tait assur\u00e9 de la compagnie d\u2019assurance La Protection Nationale mais celle-ci \u00e9tait devenue insolvable en 1958. Une ordonnance de mise en liquidation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue contre elle le 8 avril 1958 et le 22 juillet, Jean Marien avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 liquidateur d\u00e9finitif.\nLa Protection Nationale avait trois trait\u00e9s de r\u00e9assurance. Le premier avec la Great Lakes Reinsurance Company (Great Lakes), les deux autres avec les Lloyd\u2019s de Londres qui sont ici repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 Blakely. Le premier trait\u00e9 visait 75 pour cent de la responsabilit\u00e9 totale mais il \u00e9tait convenu que toutes pertes exc\u00e9dant $12,500 dans un m\u00eame accident seraient r\u00e9assur\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $287,500 et c\u2019est ce qui faisait l\u2019objet du premier trait\u00e9 avec les Lloyd\u2019s. L\u2019autre ne nous int\u00e9resse pas.\nNonobstant la faillite de Cyr et la mise en liquidation de la Protection Nationale, une saisie\u2011arr\u00eat fut requise en ex\u00e9cution du jugement entre les mains de Great Lakes et du repr\u00e9sentant autoris\u00e9 des Lloyd\u2019s. Les tiers-saisis firent une d\u00e9claration n\u00e9gative. Celle-ci ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e, le liquidateur intervint pour soutenir qu\u2019il lui appartenait de toucher, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la masse des cr\u00e9anciers, tous montants dont les tiers-saisis pouvaient \u00eatre redevables en vertu des trait\u00e9s de r\u00e9assurance.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 la contestation de la d\u00e9claration des tiers-saisis et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par un arr\u00eat unanime de la Cour d\u2019Appel[2].\nLe premier moyen de l\u2019appelante consiste \u00e0 soutenir que Great Lakes est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un coassureur et non pas un r\u00e9assureur. Dans son factum elle cite le passage suivant d\u2019un ouvrage am\u00e9ricain intitul\u00e9 \u00abReinsurance\u00bb par Kenneth R. Thompson (3e \u00e9d., p. 9):\nCoinsurance, as between insurers, approaches the practice of reinsurance. Several companies may issue a policy under a single name and each company under the policy is liable for a proportion of the loss. An agency may write the policy and the risk is then distributed automatically in several companies. The several insurers therefore take part by agreement in carrying the same risk.\nWhen one insurer obligates itself to a single insured, and then splits the risk among several insurers who are obligated only to the first insurer, we have a case of internal coinsurance.\nWhere several insurers, through a single contract, are obligated directly to one insured, but the contract does not obligate the insurers to each other, then there exists a case of external coinsurance.\nCe texte est purement descriptif. Il ne dit rien des cons\u00e9quences juridiques du cas qui nous int\u00e9resse et qui y est d\u00e9crit comme \u00abinternal coinsurance\u00bb.\nBeaucoup plus int\u00e9ressant est un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Cassation du 9 juilet 1943: Le Loyd\u2019s de Londres et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Toplis and Harding c. Ruffi\u00e9, Ragot et Piot (Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Assurances terrestres, T. 14, pp. 234-236). Pour en appr\u00e9cier la port\u00e9e, il faut savoir qu\u2019en France la Loi du 13 juillet 1930 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te \u00e0 l\u2019article 4 ce qui suit:\nDans tous les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019assureur se r\u00e9assure contre les risques qu\u2019il a assur\u00e9s, il reste seul responsable vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019assur\u00e9.\nLe pourvoi invoquant ce texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par le raisonnement suivant:\nAttendu que le pourvoi fait encore grief \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider que la police litigieuse ne pouvait pas, malgr\u00e9 sa qualification expresse, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un contrat de r\u00e9assurance, mais qu\u2019elle devait l\u2019\u00eatre comme un contrat comportant une stipulation pour autrui, conf\u00e9rant une action directe au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de cette stipulation pr\u00e9tendue et de condamner en cons\u00e9quence les Lloyd\u2019s de Londres \u00e0 payer directement \u00e0 Ruffi\u00e9, assur\u00e9 de la Compagnie La Bourgogne, le montant des condamnations prononc\u00e9es contre ce dernier au profit de la veuve Barthier en raison de responsabilit\u00e9 civile; alors qu\u2019il r\u00e9sulte des dispositions des articles 2 et 5 de la police litigieuse formellement invoqu\u00e9es dans les conclusions des demandeurs au pourvoi, auxquelles aucune r\u00e9ponse n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, que des sommes, dues en vertu de la dite police, devaient \u00eatre pay\u00e9es entre les mains de la Compagnie La Bourgogne et non pas entre celles de Ruffi\u00e9, ce qui exclut juridiquement une stipulation pour autrui au profit de ce dernier;\nMais attendu que l\u2019arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 rel\u00e8ve que la police Lloyd\u2019s fait siennes les clauses de la police qui lie La Bourgogne \u00e0 Ruffi\u00e9; qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9cise que la couverture des r\u00e9assurances sera engag\u00e9e en m\u00eame temps que celle de La Bourgogne; que les conditions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales de la police de La Bourgogne seront prises comme base en ce qui concerne le r\u00e9assur\u00e9 ou les personnes bless\u00e9es; qu\u2019elle donne comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal de la Seine et d\u00e9signe des mandataires pour suivre la proc\u00e9dure en France;\nAttendu que l\u2019arr\u00eat constate en fait que les Lloyd\u2019s se sont occup\u00e9s directement des r\u00e8glements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019accident du 23 septembre 1934, en assurant m\u00eame la d\u00e9fense de Ruffi\u00e9 et de son chauffeur devant la juridiction correctionnelle; que d\u00e8s lors la Cour d\u2019Appel a pu, par une interpr\u00e9tation de la police litigieuse qui n\u2019en d\u00e9nature pas les termes, lui reconna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re d\u2019une coassurance et d\u00e9cider qu\u2019une stipulation en faveur de Ruffi\u00e9 y \u00e9tait incluse sans qu\u2019on puisse lui reprocher de n\u2019avoir pas r\u00e9pondu aux arguments tir\u00e9s par les Lloyd\u2019s des articles 2 et 5 de la police dont, d\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019un implique en opposition \u00e0 la th\u00e8se du moyen une condamnation directement obtenue par la victime et l\u2019autre est ambigu;\nAjoutons maintenant que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel d\u2019Alger (Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Assurances terrestres, T. 10, 1939, pp. 253-8) fait voir qu\u2019alors que la police avait \u00e9t\u00e9 souscrite pour 2,000,000 de francs, la r\u00e9assurance en couvrait 1,900,000. Que doit-on dire de ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent?\nNotons tout d\u2019abord que l\u2019article 4 de la Loi de 1930 ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 destin\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier l\u2019\u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur du droit. Les travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, dont on tient compte en France, le d\u00e9montrent clairement. Le rapport de la Commission charg\u00e9e de pr\u00e9parer l\u2019avant-projet et celui de la Commission charg\u00e9e de l\u2019examiner disent tous deux au sujet de cet article:\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence s\u2019accordent \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que la r\u00e9assurance ne cr\u00e9e aucun lien de droit entre l\u2019assur\u00e9 et le r\u00e9assureur: l\u2019article 36 du d\u00e9cret du 8 mars 1922 \u00e9nonce d\u2019ailleurs formellement ce principe, que notre article se borne \u00e0 reproduire.\nOn lit dans \u00c9m\u00e9rigon (Trait\u00e9 des Assurances et des Contrats \u00e0 la grosse, T. 1, pp. 247-8, publi\u00e9 en 1782):\nLa R\u00e9assurance est absolument \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019Assur\u00e9 primitif, avec lequel le R\u00e9assureur ne contracte aucune sorte d\u2019obligation. La chose ne concerne en rien l\u2019Assur\u00e9 primitif, lequel n\u2019est point intervenu dans ce nouveau contrat.\nIl suit de ce principe, que l\u2019Assur\u00e9 primitif ne peut exercer ni action directe, ni privil\u00e8ge sur la R\u00e9assurance.\nLa Cour de Cassation a cependant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que, bien qu\u2019en principe le contrat de r\u00e9assurance soit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019assur\u00e9 un acte entre des tiers qui ne le concerne pas, cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il ne peut pas en \u00eatre diff\u00e9remment dans des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales. Autrement dit, le contrat de r\u00e9assurance est en principe l\u2019affaire de l\u2019assureur et du r\u00e9assureur exclusivement, cependant, il n\u2019est pas exclu qu\u2019un lien de droit puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tabli envers l\u2019assur\u00e9. Comment cela peut-il se produire? Comment celui que l\u2019on appelle r\u00e9assureur peut-il \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans la situation de coassureur? C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il faut rechercher.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident que la premi\u00e8re fa\u00e7on de constituer quelqu\u2019un coassureur c\u2019est de le rendre partie au contrat. Si la police d\u2019assurance d\u00e9livr\u00e9e \u00e0 Laurier Cyr au lieu de mentionner la Protection Nationale seule comme assureur avait \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 la Great Lakes, il y aurait clairement coassurance. Ce n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas notre cas. Il est clair que Laurier Cyr a contract\u00e9 avec la Protection Nationale seule. Rien ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019il ait entendu contracter avec la Great Lakes et on ne peut pas le pr\u00e9sumer.\nEn droit fran\u00e7ais une relation contractuelle avec un tiers peut \u00e9galement se former par l\u2019effet d\u2019une stipulation pour autrui: Code Napol\u00e9on, article 1121, texte identique \u00e0 l\u2019article 1029 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec:\n1121. On peut pareillement stipuler au profit d\u2019un tiers, lorsque telle est la condition d\u2019une stipulation que l\u2019on fait pour soi-m\u00eame ou d\u2019une donation que l\u2019on fait \u00e0 un autre. Celui qui a fait cette stipulation, ne peut plus la r\u00e9voquer, si le tiers a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 vouloir en profiter.\nC\u2019est en croyant pouvoir trouver une stipulation pour autrui dans le contrat de r\u00e9assurance intervenu avec les Lloyd\u2019s que la Cour d\u2019Appel d\u2019Alger a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de droit. Quant \u00e0 la Cour de Cassation, il lui a suffi de dire que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9naturer les termes du contrat que de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ainsi.\nPour donner raison \u00e0 l\u2019appelante par application de la th\u00e9orie de la stipulation pour autrui, il nous faudrait trouver dans les trait\u00e9s de r\u00e9assurance un texte que nous puissions interpr\u00e9ter comme une stipulation en faveur des assur\u00e9s. Cela nous est clairement impossible. On ne nous a rien signal\u00e9 qui puisse r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019intention de stipuler un avantage envers les assur\u00e9s de la Protection Nationale. Il faut donc dire qu\u2019il est impossible d\u2019appliquer dans la pr\u00e9sente cause les principes de droit \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour de Cassation dans l\u2019arr\u00eat ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9.\nLes avocats de l\u2019appelante nous ont \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019Appel du Missouri. La plus r\u00e9cente est O\u2019Hare v. Purcell[3]. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contrat de r\u00e9assurance par lequel la totalit\u00e9 des obligations d\u2019un assureur \u00e9tait c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre compagnie d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme r\u00e9assureur. Celle-ci ne s\u2019engageait pas, comme les tiers-saisis dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, \u00e0 faire des paiements \u00e0 l\u2019assureur primitif mais bien \u00e0 remplir toutes ses obligations envers ses assur\u00e9s. Il y avait donc clairement stipulation pour autrui et on a jug\u00e9 que la loi de cet \u00c9tat en faisait d\u00e9couler un lien de droit.\nThe law supplies the privity necessary for the insureds to maintain a direct action upon the contract of reinsurance. The bringing of suit is sufficient evidence of assent by the insureds to the Treaty.\nOn ne conclurait pas autrement dans le droit du Qu\u00e9bec suivant l\u2019article 1029 C.C. ainsi que cette Cour l\u2019a fait dans Hall\u00e9 c. Canadian Indemnity Co.[4], mais ce n\u2019est pas notre cas.\nOn nous a \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 un autre arr\u00eat de la m\u00eame Cour d\u2019Appel dans une affaire qui pr\u00e9sente beaucoup plus d\u2019analogie. Il s\u2019agit de Homan v. Employers Reinsurance Corporation[5]. Dans cette cause-l\u00e0, les victimes d\u2019un accident d\u2019autobus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admises \u00e0 recouvrer du r\u00e9assureur de l\u2019assureur de la compagnie propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019autobus une partie de leur indemnit\u00e9. Ce r\u00e9assureur s\u2019\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 par trait\u00e9 \u00e0 indemniser l\u2019assureur de toutes pertes exc\u00e9dant $5,000 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une seule personne et de toutes pertes exc\u00e9dant $10,000 dans un m\u00eame accident. Tout en admettant qu\u2019en principe le contrat de r\u00e9assurance ne fait pas na\u00eetre de lien de droit entre l\u2019assur\u00e9 et le r\u00e9assureur, on a conclu que la l\u00e9gislation particuli\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9tat avait pour effet non seulement de donner un recours direct \u00e0 la victime d\u2019accident contre l\u2019assureur de l\u2019auteur du dommage, mais aussi contre le r\u00e9assureur de ce dernier. La d\u00e9cision repose donc uniquement sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un texte de loi dont on ne trouvait pas l\u2019\u00e9quivalent dans la l\u00e9gislation du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019accident qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige est survenu. Il est inutile de rechercher si ce texte avait bien la port\u00e9e qu\u2019on lui a donn\u00e9e.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9es il faut donc dire que l\u2019appelante ne peut pas fonder un recours sur l\u2019article 1029 C.C.\nPourrait-elle, toutefois, se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019article 1031 C.C.:\n1031. Les cr\u00e9anciers peuvent exercer les droits et actions de leur d\u00e9biteur, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de ceux qui sont exclusivement attach\u00e9s \u00e0 sa personne, lorsque, \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9judice, il refuse ou n\u00e9glige de le faire.\nIl semble \u00e9vident que l\u2019ordonnance de liquidation fait obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019application de ce texte dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. C\u2019est au liquidateur qu\u2019il appartient d\u2019exercer les recours de la Protection Nationale contre les r\u00e9assureurs. Rien ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il n\u00e9glige de le faire. M\u00eame s\u2019il en \u00e9tait ainsi, un cr\u00e9ancier individuellement ne saurait se substituer \u00e0 lui de sa propre initiative. Il faudrait indubitablement qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9alablement autoris\u00e9 par le tribunal \u00e0 le faire. Inutile de rechercher si cela est possible sous la Loi de liquidation comme sous la Loi de faillite car le dossier fait voir que le tribunal charg\u00e9 de surveiller la liquidation, loin d\u2019autoriser un cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 exercer les recours du liquidateur envers les tiers-saisis, a autoris\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 intervenir pour s\u2019y opposer.\nIl ne reste donc, en derni\u00e8re analyse, qu\u2019un seul fondement possible du recours de l\u2019appelante contre les tiers-saisis ou l\u2019un d\u2019entre eux. Il consisterait \u00e0 voir dans les trait\u00e9s de r\u00e9assurance un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Cela para\u00eet clairement impossible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des trait\u00e9s avec les Lloyd\u2019s. En effet, il n\u2019y est pas pr\u00e9vu de partage de profits. Bien diff\u00e9rente est la situation de la Great Lakes. Le trait\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a conclu fait d\u2019elle en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le principal assureur. Elle supporte les trois-quarts des risques et re\u00e7oit les trois-quarts des primes sauf le pourcentage allou\u00e9 \u00e0 la Protection Nationale pour couvrir les frais d\u2019acquisition et d\u2019administration qui sont \u00e0 sa charge. De plus un partage de profits est stipul\u00e9. Enfin, les deux compagnies sont \u00e0 ce point associ\u00e9es dans les affaires trait\u00e9es au nom de la Protection Nationale que la r\u00e9assurance des pertes exc\u00e9dant $12,500 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue pour elles conjointement. Les deux trait\u00e9s d\u00e9crivent de la fa\u00e7on suivante la partie de premi\u00e8re part:\nNATIONAL PROTECTION ASSURANCE COMPANY, Magog, Quebec, Canada, together with its Quota Share Reinsurer (hereinafter collectively called the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nLa Protection Nationale a donc sign\u00e9 ces deux contrats de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que le ferait un associ\u00e9, savoir pour le compte des deux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Cela cependant ne suffit point \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 car si un mandat d\u00e9coule du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache qu\u2019il existe en son absence. Les copropri\u00e9taires d\u2019un immeuble peuvent, par exemple, confier un mandat d\u2019administration \u00e0 l\u2019un d\u2019eux sans que pour autant il en r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9cessairement une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 entre eux et non une simple indivision.\nContrairement au Code Napol\u00e9on, le Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec ne d\u00e9finit pas le contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les deux premiers articles de son titre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se lisent comme suit:\n1830. Il est de l\u2019essence du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice commun des associ\u00e9s et que chacun d\u2019eux y contribue en y apportant des biens, son cr\u00e9dit, son habilet\u00e9 ou son industrie.\n1831. La participation dans les profits d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00eene avec elle l\u2019obligation de partager dans les pertes.\nToute convention par laquelle l\u2019un des associ\u00e9s est exclu de la participation dans les profits est nulle.\nLa convention qui exempte quelqu\u2019un des associ\u00e9s de participer dans les pertes est nulle quant aux tiers seulement.\nCes textes obligent \u00e0 se demander si l\u2019on doit conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e8s que quelqu\u2019un apporte une contribution \u00e0 une entreprise en vue de participer dans les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices. Mignault, Droit civil canadien, t. 8 (pp. 184-5), dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nL\u2019article 1831 suppose n\u00e9cessairement une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 existante, car il parle de la participation dans les profits d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il faut donc qu\u2019il y ait convention expresse ou implicite de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Et alors celui qui participe aux profits de telle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut s\u2019exempter de contribuer au paiement des pertes qu\u2019elle a encourues. En dehors de convention de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019article 1831 ne s\u2019applique pas. Ainsi le commis qui engage ses services ou le bailleur de fonds qui pr\u00eate ses deniers moyennant une part dans les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d\u2019une entreprise commerciale, ne devient pas associ\u00e9, car ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre n\u2019a entendu contracter une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Naturellement, les tribunaux scruteront attentivement des conventions de ce genre afin de d\u00e9terminer si les parties n\u2019ont pas voulu cacher une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sous le couvert d\u2019un pr\u00eat ou d\u2019un louage de services. Mais s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019intention de former une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, on ne saurait en pr\u00e9sumer l\u2019existence.\nIl y a eu quelques h\u00e9sitations dans notre jurisprudence sur ces questions. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9nonc\u00e9, du moins implicitement, la v\u00e9ritable doctrine dans quelques arr\u00eats (Pratt v. Berger, 28 L.C.J., p. 192; Pr\u00e9fontaine v. Barrie, 13 Q.L.R., 312), la cour d\u2019appel, croyant \u00e0 tort que le conseil priv\u00e9 avait admis la doctrine contraire dans la cause de Singleton v. Knight (13 App. Cas., p. 788), a, dans deux causes (Davie v. Sylvestre, M.L.R., 6 Q.B., p. 143; McFarlane v. Fatt, M.L.R., 6 Q.B., p. 251), jug\u00e9 que le seul fait de participer dans les profits d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou d\u2019une op\u00e9ration commerciale entra\u00eene pr\u00e9somption de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle est cependant revenue sur cette erreur dans la cause de Reid v. McFarlane (R.J.Q., 2 B.R., p. 130), qui fixe d\u00e9finitivement la jurisprudence dans le sens que j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9.\nIl convient d\u2019ajouter que la jurisprudence du Qu\u00e9bec ne para\u00eet pas s\u2019\u00eatre modifi\u00e9e depuis l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ce texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit. Au contraire, on a express\u00e9ment r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec dans Bourboin c. Savard[6].\nSi l\u2019on applique ces principes au cas qui nous concerne il est impossible de trouver dans le trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance souscrit par la Great Lakes une convention de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En effet, tout d\u00e9montre que l\u2019intention \u00e9tait de faire une Convention de r\u00e9assurance et non pas une convention de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 car il est \u00e9vident que la Great Lakes n\u2019entendait pas se rendre responsable de la totalit\u00e9 des obligations de la Protection Nationale, mais uniquement de sa quote-part. Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle entendait se lier uniquement envers la compagnie avec laquelle elle traitait et non envers les assur\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re. En principe, il ne faut pas l\u2019oublier, le trait\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit la compensation entre la part de primes et la part de pertes. C\u2019est le solde seul qui fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une remise. (Article IV):\nThe Company shall furnish to the Reinsurer monthly accounts as soon as practicable after the close of each month in which the business was written. Such accounts shall be examined by the Reinsurer as early as possible and the balance due by either party shall be paid within 90 days after the close of the month for which the accounts have been rendered.\nIl est vrai qu\u2019ensuite on trouve la disposition suivante pour le cas d\u2019une perte exc\u00e9dant $1,000. (Article V, para. 3):\nThe amounts due from the Reinsurer shall be charged in the monthly account, unless the loss or aggregate of losses in one casualty is in excess of $1,000 in which event the Reinsurer will, upon demand, forthwith remit its proportion thereof.\nCette modalit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re de r\u00e8glement ne signifie pas que la nature du contrat est diff\u00e9rente lorsque la perte d\u00e9passe $1,000 et il faut rejeter l\u2019argument que l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend en tirer.\nOn trouve dans le rapport des codificateurs sur le titre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 la phrase suivante:\nCe chapitre se compose de neuf articles dont les quatre premiers contiennent des r\u00e8gles communes \u00e0 tous les syst\u00e8mes de droit commercial.\nEt sous les articles 1830 et 1831 sont cit\u00e9s, outre Pothier, Domat, Vinnius et les Institutes, les ouvrages suivants fond\u00e9s sur la Common Law: Partnership de Collyer, Partnership de Gow et Commentaries de Kent.\nIl ne semble donc pas hors de propos d\u2019examiner la jurisprudence fond\u00e9e sur les principes de la Common Law dont les r\u00e8gles sur la formation du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 semblent identiques \u00e0 celles du droit qu\u00e9becois. Cette jurisprudence para\u00eet fix\u00e9e par un arr\u00eat unanime de la Chambre des Lords dans le sens qu\u2019un trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance avec participation aux profits ne constitue pas un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9: English Insurance Co. v. National Benefit Assurance Co. Official Receiver[7]. Dans cette cause-l\u00e0 l\u2019appelante avait conclu avec la National Benefit Assurance Co. un trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance par lequel celle-ci acceptait une participation d\u2019un huiti\u00e8me dans tous risques d\u2019assurance maritime (\u00aba quota participation equal to a one-eighth share\u00bb). Les conditions du trait\u00e9 \u00e9taient essentiellement de m\u00eame nature que celles du contrat conclu par la Great Lakes, y compris une stipulation de partage de profits. La National Benefit Assurance Co. \u00e9tant en liquidation, on a jug\u00e9 que la English Insurance Co. ne pouvait \u00eatre admise \u00e0 produire une r\u00e9clamation pour ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb en vertu du trait\u00e9 parce que la r\u00e9assurance de chaque risque n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e par une police timbr\u00e9e, la loi du Royaume-Uni exigeant le timbre \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9. On a rejet\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention que le contrat \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et non pas une convention donnant naissance \u00e0 autant de contrats de r\u00e9assurance qu\u2019il y avait de risques distincts faisant l\u2019objet de la couverture, et cela quoique le trait\u00e9 e\u00fbt d\u00e9crit l\u2019op\u00e9ration comme une participation et non comme une r\u00e9assurance et le r\u00e9assureur comme un \u00abparticipant\u00bb (\u00abparticipator\u00bb). On a signal\u00e9 que, comme dans notre cas, toutes les polices \u00e9taient au nom de l\u2019assureur seul sans aucune allusion au r\u00e9assureur et que ce dernier n\u2019avait pas eu l\u2019intention de s\u2019en rendre responsable envers les assur\u00e9s.\nA l\u2019encontre de ce raisonnement on peut invoquer un bon nombre d\u2019arr\u00eats o\u00f9 une personne qui n\u2019avait pas eu l\u2019intention de contracter d\u2019obligations envers les tiers a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e associ\u00e9e parce que ses actes l\u2019avaient plac\u00e9e dans cette situation. Il y a, en particulier, une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de notre Cour: Ministre du Revenu National c. Sedgwick[8], o\u00f9 l\u2019on a confirm\u00e9 un jugement de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier[9] par lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 que des personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme \u00abpr\u00eateurs\u00bb qui avaient avanc\u00e9 \u00e0 un agent de change la somme requise pour acheter un \u00absi\u00e8ge\u00bb \u00e0 la Bourse et financer ses op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des associ\u00e9s bien que l\u2019on e\u00fbt express\u00e9ment stipul\u00e9 que l\u2019on n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il est \u00e9vident que ces soi-disant pr\u00eateurs n\u2019avaient aucunement l\u2019intention de se rendre responsables envers les tiers des dettes contract\u00e9es par l\u2019agent de change en son nom et non au leur. Cependant, l\u2019arr\u00eat qui les d\u00e9clare imposables comme associ\u00e9s implique qu\u2019ils se trouvaient oblig\u00e9s \u00e0 ce titre envers les tiers comme envers le fisc malgr\u00e9 leur intention d\u00e9clar\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9viter de telles obligations. A l\u00e0 r\u00e9flexion, je suis cependant venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre les, deux situations. Dans l\u2019affaire Sedgwick, le contrat avait comme cons\u00e9quence que les soi\u2011disant pr\u00eateurs \u00e9taient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 propri\u00e9taires du commerce. Au contraire, dans la cause de la English Insurance comme dans celle-ci, le r\u00e9assureur n\u2019avait aucun droit au portefeuille r\u00e9assur\u00e9. Le commerce restait le sien. Tout comme la Protection Nationale, elle faisait affaires pour son compte et non pour le compte du r\u00e9assureur. Il me para\u00eet qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9cider que le trait\u00e9 de r\u00e9assurance avec la Great Lakes n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, appelante: Lacoste, Savoie, Laniel & Joncas, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des tiers-saisis, intim\u00e9s: Foster, Watt, Leggat, Colby, Rioux & Malcolm, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenant Marien, intim\u00e9: Gagnon, Beaulieu, Jurisic, Carisse, Szemenyei & Di Clementi, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1967] B.R. 717.\n[2] [1967] B.R. 717.\n[3] (1960), 329 S.W. 2d 614.\n[4] [1937] R.C.S. 368, 4 I.L.R. 259, [1937] 3 D.L.R. 320.\n[5] (1940), 136 S.W. 2d 289.\n[6] (1926), 40 B.R. 68.\n[7] [1929] A.C. 114, [1928] All E.R. 441.\n[8] [1964] R.C.S. 177, [1963] C.T.C. 571, 63 D.T.C. 1378, 42 D.L.R.

En 1955, les auteurs de la demanderesse ont achet\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs risques et p\u00e9rils tous les droits que la d\u00e9fenderesse poss\u00e9dait sur ces terrains pour y faire, avec l\u2019approbation de la d\u00e9fenderesse, la culture des champignons. En 1960, la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a fait droit \u00e0 la demande de la Couronne qui avait demand\u00e9 l\u2019annulation de la cession pour d\u00e9faut d\u2019en satisfaire les conditions. La demanderesse a poursuivi la d\u00e9fenderesse pour obtenir l\u2019annulation de la vente de 1955 en all\u00e9guant fraude et les dommages lui r\u00e9sultant de son \u00e9viction. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action et son jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel. La demanderesse en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nC\u2019est avec raison que les deux Cours inf\u00e9rieures ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de fraude et de mauvaise foi. La d\u00e9fenderesse a vendu aux auteurs de la demanderesse non pas les immeubles d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019acte de vente mais tous les droits que la d\u00e9fenderesse poss\u00e9dait alors dans ces immeubles, et la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie aux risques et p\u00e9rils des acqu\u00e9reurs. Les parties ont exclu toute forme de garantie, l\u00e9gale aussi bien que conditionnelle. Au regard du contrat auquel les auteurs de la demanderesse ont donn\u00e9 leur accord, la demanderesse ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 se plaindre de l\u2019\u00e9viction et la d\u00e9fenderesse ne lui doit rien.\nIl n\u2019y a pas lieu de s\u2019arr\u00eater \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention que lors de la vente la demanderesse n\u2019avait aucune connaissance des conditions restrictives contenues \u00e0 l\u2019acte de cession. L\u2019acheteur qui a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils est trait\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 1510 du Code civil sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec celui qui connaissait le danger d\u2019\u00e9viction.\nLa pr\u00e9tention, bas\u00e9e sur les dispositions de l\u2019art. 1509 du Code, que l\u2019\u00e9viction fut caus\u00e9e par les faits personnels de la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut pas \u00eatre soutenue. L\u2019\u00e9viction dans le cas pr\u00e9sent ne r\u00e9sulte pas d\u2019un droit exerc\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse, mais d\u2019un droit exerc\u00e9 par la Couronne et que celle-ci s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte de cession.\nLa vente de 1955 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une convention nulle ab initio comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019objet, de cause et de consid\u00e9ration pour le motif qu\u2019au moment de la vente la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019avait aucun droit vu l\u2019utilisation des terrains pour des fins autres que comme parc public. La d\u00e9fenderesse avait des droits sur les terrains. La pr\u00e9tention que le vendeur, qui a vendu ses droits \u00e0 un acheteur qui les a achet\u00e9s \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils, a fait une convention d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019objet, de cause et de consid\u00e9ration, parce qu\u2019il arrive subs\u00e9quemment que les droits qu\u2019il croyait avoir sont judiciairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls ou annul\u00e9s, d\u00e9pouille de tout sens, port\u00e9e et effet la stipulation que l\u2019acheteur a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils et permet \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur de prendre contre le vendeur les recours que la stipulation a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour objet d\u2019\u00e9carter.\nSale\u2014Lands conditionally ceded by the Crown\u2014Sale by transferee of his rights at the risk of the purchaser\u2014Violation of the condition\u2014Annulment of the grant\u2014Purchaser has no recourse\u2014Civil Code, art. 1507, 1509, 1510.\nIn 1949, the Crown in the right of Canada ceded to the defendant certain lands in the city of L\u00e9vis on condition, inter alia, that these lands would be used only as a public park failing which they would revert to the Crown. In 1955, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors purchased at their risks all the rights that the defendant had in the lands with the intention, as approved by the defendant, of cultivating and selling mushrooms. In 1960, the Exchequer Court maintained an action taken by the Crown to annul the grant for failure to abide by the conditions. The plaintiff instituted an action to set aside the sale of 1955 for fraud and claimed damages arising from the eviction. The Superior Court dismissed the action and its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe two lower Courts rightly dismissed the allegation of fraud.\nThe defendant sold to the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors not the immoveables designated in the deed of sale but all the rights it had in these immoveables, and the sale was made at the risks of the buyers. The parties excluded all form of warranty, legal as well as conventional. Considering the contract to which the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors gave their consent, the plaintiff cannot complain of the eviction and the defendant has no obligation towards the plaintiff.\nWhether the plaintiff had knowledge at the time of the sale of the restrictive covenants was immaterial. The purchaser who purchases at his own risk is considered by art. 1510 of the Civil Code on the same footing as the purchaser who knew the danger of eviction.\nThe contention, based on art. 1509 of the Code, that the eviction resulted from the personal acts of the defendant is untenable. The eviction in the present case was not the result of a right exercised or created by the defendant, but was the result of a right exercised by the Crown and which it had reserved to itself in the deed of cession.\nThe sale of 1955 was not a contract null ab initio as having no object, cause and consideration on the ground that the defendant had no rights in the lands at the time of the sale in view of the use which was made of the lands. The defendant city had rights in these lands. The contention that the vendor, who sells his rights to a buyer who buys them at his own risk, made a contract without object, cause and consideration, because subsequently the rights which he thought he had were judicially declared null or annulled, deprives the stipulation that the buyer bought at his own risk from all meaning and effect and allows the buyer to have against the seller the very recourses which the stipulation was intended to take away.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of Dorion C.J.

La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 cette action avec d\u00e9pens. Son jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour d\u2019appel1. La compagnie se pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9cision. Voici les faits conduisant \u00e0 ce litige. Le 20 juillet 1949, le Gouvernement du Canada octroyait et c\u00e9dait, par lettres patentes, \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis, pour une consid\u00e9ration nominale de un dollar, certains terrains situ\u00e9s \u00e0 L\u00e9vis, connus ou d\u00e9sign\u00e9s sous le nom de Fort n\u00b0 2 et sur lesquels se trouvent \u00e9rig\u00e9es de vieilles fortifications. Ces lettres patentes furent \u00e9mises aux conditions suivantes:\na) que la concessionnaire pr\u00e9serve et entretienne en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9paration les vieilles fortifications situ\u00e9es sur lesdits terrains et que les terrains susdits servent uniquement comme parc public;\nb) que si les terrains susmentionn\u00e9s sont employ\u00e9s \u00e0 toute autre fin que celle d\u2019un parc public ou si les vieilles fortifications ne sont pas pr\u00e9serv\u00e9es et entretenues en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9paration, le titre desdits terrains reviendra \u00e0 Nous.\nCet acte de concession fut publi\u00e9 par enregistrement aux Bureaux du Secr\u00e9tariat d\u2019\u00c9tat le 31 ao\u00fbt 1949 et \u00e0 celui de la Division d\u2019enregistrement de L\u00e9vis le 19 octobre 1949.\nLe 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953, la Cit\u00e9 loua sept des vo\u00fbtes de pierre souterraines du Fort, pour une p\u00e9riode de dix ans, \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en nom collectif int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 la production et vente de champignons de couche et faisant affaires sous le nom de L\u00e9vis Mushroom Reg\u2019d. Au bail intervenu entre les parties, on trouve les stipulations suivantes:\n1. Que les dites vo\u00fbtes devront servir uniquement pour la production et la vente de champignons de couche \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi le pr\u00e9sent bail sera nul de plein droit;\n6.

Que la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 utilise le plus possible de la main d\u2019\u0153uvre de L\u00e9vis;\nLe 12 juillet 1955, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 L\u00e9vis Mushroom Reg\u2019d vendit son entreprise au prix de $50,000 \u00e0 Ludger Audet et Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Labont\u00e9 et renon\u00e7a \u00e0 son bail. Le m\u00eame jour, la Cit\u00e9 vendit, pour une consid\u00e9ration nominale de $1,000 \u00e0 Audet et Labont\u00e9, qui les achet\u00e8rent \u00e0 leurs risques et p\u00e9rils, tous ses droits sur les lieux originairement lou\u00e9s \u00e0 L\u00e9vis Mushroom Reg\u2019d et la plupart des autres vo\u00fbtes et une grande partie des terrains. L\u2019acte de vente, sign\u00e9 devant le notaire Pierre Lemieux, alors greffier de la Cit\u00e9, comporte, entre autres, les conditions ci\u2011apr\u00e8s:\nLe toit du Fort No. 2 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 incendi\u00e9 devra, soit \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 ou soit \u00eatre enlev\u00e9 pour poser de la pelouse ou de l\u2019asphalte, et le travail devra \u00eatre fait dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui suit la signature des pr\u00e9sentes. Advenant que les acqu\u00e9reurs n\u2019op\u00e8rent plus, aux lieux vendus, le commerce pour la production et la vente de champignons, les lieux vendus retourneront de plein droit \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis, sans que la Cit\u00e9 soit tenue de payer quoi que ce soit;\nLes lieux vendus ne pourront \u00eatre vendus ou transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 quiconque sans la permission de la Cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis, \u00e0 moins que les ventes ou les transferts soient faits (sic) pour la continuation de la production et la vente des champignons, auxquels cas la vente ou le transfert sera permis, mais les acqu\u00e9reurs ou leurs repr\u00e9sentants futurs seront soumis \u00e0 toutes et chacune des clauses du pr\u00e9sent contrat.\nCe contrat fut enregistr\u00e9 au Bureau d\u2019enregistrement de la Division de L\u00e9vis le 19 juillet 1955.\nLe 2 septembre 1955, Audet acheta les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Labont\u00e9 et devint, en cons\u00e9quence, le seul propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019entreprise qu\u2019il revendit lui-m\u00eame en juin 1956, pour $9,500 pay\u00e9s en actions, \u00e0 la compagnie appelante qu\u2019il avait organis\u00e9e. Par la suite, Audet continua, comme avant, \u00e0 conduire l\u2019entreprise.\nD\u00e8s le 23 juillet 1955, la validit\u00e9 de la vente intervenue entre la Cit\u00e9 et l\u2019appelante fut mise en question dans une lettre de protestation que le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 d\u2019urbanisme de la Cit\u00e9 adressa au Maire. L\u2019affaire fit manchette dans un journal hebdomadaire de la r\u00e9gion. C\u2019est alors que les autorit\u00e9s municipales qui avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 autoriser cette vente, ainsi que le notaire Lemieux qui n\u2019avait pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le titre de la Cit\u00e9 et s\u2019\u00e9tait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019index aux immeubles, et que Audet lui-m\u00eame auraient appris que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 par la Couronne \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 \u00e9tait assujetti \u00e0 certaines restrictions.\nEn pr\u00e9sence de cette situation, la Cit\u00e9 informa imm\u00e9diatement les autorit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales du fait de cette vente et les pria de renoncer aux conditions restrictives de la concession. Celles-ci r\u00e9pondirent le 31 ao\u00fbt 1955, qu\u2019elles ne pouvaient se rendre \u00e0 cette demande. Ce n\u2019est toutefois que plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s, soit le 30 mars 1960, qu\u2019invoquant ces conditions restrictives, elles log\u00e8rent en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier une information dirig\u00e9e contre la Cit\u00e9, l\u2019appelante et ses auteurs pour faire constater le d\u00e9faut de la Cit\u00e9 de satisfaire \u00e0 ces conditions, et demander l\u2019annulation de la concession, la r\u00e9trocession du Fort et des terrains et, si n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019expulsion par justice. Ces proc\u00e9dures ne furent pas contest\u00e9es et, par jugement rendu le 18 octobre 1960, la Cour fit droit \u00e0 la demande de la Couronne.\nBien que l\u2019appelante n\u2019ait abandonn\u00e9 ses op\u00e9rations qu\u2019au d\u00e9but de 1960, elle avait institu\u00e9 contre la Cit\u00e9 l\u2019action qui nous concerne, \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 1958. Dans cette action, elle pr\u00e9tend principalement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de fraude et de mauvaise foi de la part de la Cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis et demande l\u2019annulation de la vente du 12 juillet 1955 et les dommages lui r\u00e9sultant de son \u00e9viction. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019appel furent unanimes \u00e0 rejeter, comme mal fond\u00e9e, cette all\u00e9gation de fraude et de mauvaise foi. Rien au dossier ne justifie, \u00e0 mon avis, de faire exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de non-intervention, suivie en cette Cour, dans les cas o\u00f9, sur une question de fait, il y a accord de vues entre la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019appel. Je trouve d\u2019ailleurs bien fond\u00e9e l\u2019opinion des deux Cours voulant que l\u2019acte de vente du 15 juillet 1955 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti de bonne foi, suivant l\u2019acceptation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de ce terme. Ainsi donc, c\u2019est dans cette optique que doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es les stipulations auxquelles les parties ont donn\u00e9 leur accord, ainsi que les propositions soumises par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nLe contrat est, ainsi que la preuve r\u00e9tablit, conforme au mod\u00e8le de contrat g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suivi par la Cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis. Il ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re pas au titre de la venderesse. Il sp\u00e9cifie clairement ce qui fait l\u2019objet de la vente, ainsi que les conditions auxquelles les parties y ont consenti. L\u2019on y voit que ce que la Cit\u00e9 a vendu aux auteurs de l\u2019appelante et ce que ces derniers ont accept\u00e9 d\u2019acheter, ce ne sont pas les immeubles d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019acte, mais tous les droits que la Cit\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait alors dans ces immeubles. Cela appara\u00eet au premier paragraphe du contrat.\nLA CIT\u00c9 DE L\u00c9VIS vend aux dits Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Labont\u00e9 et Ludger Audet, ce acceptant tous les droits qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de dans les immeubles suivants, savoir:\u2014(suit la d\u00e9signation).\nIl appert, de plus, aux derniers paragraphes de la convention que la Cit\u00e9, d\u2019une part, n\u2019a entendu prendre aucune responsabilit\u00e9 et que les acheteurs, d\u2019autre part, ont achet\u00e9 les droits de la Cit\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs risques et p\u00e9rils: De plus la dite vente est faite sujette \u00e0 toutes autres charges pouvant affecter lesdites parties de lot, et sans aucune responsabilit\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9, les acqu\u00e9reurs d\u00e9clarant bien conna\u00eetre les lieux pr\u00e9sentement vendus et n\u2019en point d\u00e9sirer plus ample d\u00e9signation.\nLa pr\u00e9sente vente est consentie aux risques et p\u00e9rils des acqu\u00e9reurs.\nCes stipulations sont claires, non ambigu\u00ebs et ne requi\u00e8rent aucune interpr\u00e9tation. Elles expriment la commune intention et font la loi des parties. Ainsi donc et tel qu\u2019elles en avaient le droit et la libert\u00e9 (1507 C.C.), celles-ci ont exclu toute forme de garantie, la garantie l\u00e9gale aussi bien que la garantie conventionnelle. En droit, leurs stipulations \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 une stipulation de non-garantie ou rendent celle-ci superflue; le vendeur demeure quand m\u00eame oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 garantir l\u2019acheteur de l\u2019\u00e9viction de la chose vendue en raison de son fait personnel (1509 C.C.), et si telle n\u2019est pas la cause de l\u2019\u00e9viction et que l\u2019acheteur connaissait, lors de la vente, le danger de l\u2019\u00e9viction ou qu\u2019il a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils, le vendeur n\u2019est m\u00eame pas tenu \u00e0 la restitution du prix de la chose vendue (1510 C.C.). Dans ce cas, il ne doit rien \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur. C\u2019est que ce dernier a fait un contrat al\u00e9atoire et le prix de la chose vendue a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence. Ce qu\u2019il a acquis, c\u2019est moins la chose elle-m\u00eame que la pr\u00e9tention plus ou moins certaine du vendeur, c\u2019est la chance de devenir propri\u00e9taire incommutable.

Villeneuve[2].\nEn fait, et bien que cette port\u00e9e juridique du contrat n\u2019en puisse \u00eatre alt\u00e9r\u00e9e, il n\u2019est pas sans \u00e0-propos de constater au dossier qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir appris en ao\u00fbt 1955 que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par la Couronne \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 de restrictions, Audet n\u2019en continue pas moins les op\u00e9rations; il poursuit les travaux de r\u00e9parations du toit incendi\u00e9 le 23 avril 1955; en septembre 1955, il informe la Cit\u00e9 d\u2019un programme d\u2019expansion; en octobre suivant, il d\u00e9cide de faire des constructions nouvelles; en novembre 1957, il reconstruit les installations qu\u2019un nouvel incendie vient de d\u00e9truire sur une longueur de 200 pieds; enfin, il n\u2019abandonne les op\u00e9rations qu\u2019en janvier 1960. Ces faits, nonobstant certaines attitudes qu\u2019il prend de temps \u00e0 autre, soi-disant pour ne pas compromettre ou pour r\u00e9server ses droits ou ceux de l\u2019appelante, permettent, \u00e0 mon avis, de penser qu\u2019on a persist\u00e9, pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Couronne d\u00e9cide de prendre action, \u00e0 courir la chance que les difficult\u00e9s soient favorablement solutionn\u00e9es. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit et au regard du contrat auquel les auteurs de l\u2019appelante ont donn\u00e9 leur accord, je suis, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et de ceux de la Cour d\u2019appel, clairement d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 se plaindre de l\u2019\u00e9viction et que la Cit\u00e9 ne lui doit rien.\nA l\u2019encontre du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelante soumet, en premier lieu, qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait, au moment de la vente, aucune connaissance, actuelle ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, des conditions restrictives du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 par la Couronne. En pr\u00e9sence des faits, des stipulations au contrat et de leur port\u00e9e juridique, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y ait lieu de s\u2019arr\u00eater \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la question. Il importe peu, \u00e0 mon avis, que cette pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelante soit fond\u00e9e ou non. L\u2019article 1510 C.C. distingue, en fait, et traite sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, en droit, le cas de celui qui a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils et le cas de l\u2019acheteur qui, lors de la vente, connaissait le danger d\u2019\u00e9viction. La connaissance du danger d\u2019\u00e9viction n\u2019est pas le seul fait qui donne ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019application des dispositions de cet article.\nL\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend ensuite que son \u00e9viction fut caus\u00e9e par les faits personnels de la Cit\u00e9, soit par le bail que celle-ci a consenti le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1953 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 L\u00e9vis Mushroom Reg\u2019d, et la vente qu\u2019elle a consentie le 15 juillet 1955 \u00e0 Audet et Labont\u00e9, les auteurs de l\u2019appelante. Elle invoque les dispositions de l\u2019article 1509 C.C. Cet article prescrit que le vendeur demeure toujours oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 la garantie de ces faits qui lui sont personnels et que toute convention contraire est nulle. La raison de cette nullit\u00e9 appara\u00eet, particuli\u00e8rement, au passage suivant de Beaudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 19, n\u00b0 403, p. 410:\nLe vendeur ne peut donc, par aucune stipulation, s\u2019affranchir de la garantie \u00e0 raison des faits qui lui sont personnels. Ainsi le vendeur r\u00e9pondrait, nonobstant toute stipulation contraire, de l\u2019\u00e9viction r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une ali\u00e9nation par lui consentie ant\u00e9rieurement ou post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la vente et qui serait opposable \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 transcrite la premi\u00e8re. A ce sujet, la garantie est de l\u2019essence de la vente. Le l\u00e9gislateur a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la stipulation par laquelle le vendeur chercherait \u00e0 se soustraire \u00e0 la garantie de l\u2019\u00e9viction r\u00e9sultant de son fait personnel \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 la stipulation qu\u2019il ne serait pas responsable de son dol; or illud nulla pactione effici potest ne dolus praestetur\u2026\nComme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, ce que la Cit\u00e9 a vendu aux auteurs de l\u2019appelante et ce que ceux-ci ont accept\u00e9 d\u2019acheter \u00e0 leurs risques et p\u00e9rils, ce ne sont pas les immeubles dont l\u2019appelante fut \u00e9vinc\u00e9e, mais ce sont les droits que la Cit\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait dans ces immeubles. Ces droits, la Cit\u00e9 les a livr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Le sens propre qu\u2019il faut donner aux mots fait personnel dans ces dispositions du Code, est ainsi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au Juris-Classeur civil, art. 1627-1529, p. 8, n\u00b0 51:\nPar les mots \u00abfait personnel\u00bb, on doit entendre l\u2019effet d\u2019un droit exerc\u00e9 par le vendeur lui-m\u00eame ou une personne au profit de laquelle il l\u2019a cr\u00e9\u00e9\u2026\nL\u2019\u00e9viction, dont se plaint l\u2019appelante, ne r\u00e9sulte pas d\u2019un droit exerc\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Cit\u00e9, mais d\u2019un droit exerc\u00e9 par la Couronne et que celle-ci s\u2019est constitu\u00e9 ou r\u00e9serv\u00e9 en conditionnant l\u2019acte de concession \u00e0 des restrictions aff\u00e9rentes au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9, par lettres patentes, \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis.\nL\u2019appelante soumet enfin, comme derni\u00e8re proposition, que la vente du 12 juillet 1955 est une convention nulle ab initio, parce que d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019objet, de cause et de consid\u00e9ration. Cette proposition a comme pr\u00e9misse la pr\u00e9tention, qu\u2019au moment de la vente, la Cit\u00e9 n\u2019avait aucun droit quelconque sur ces terrains, vu leur utilisation \u00e0 des fins autres que comme parc public et vu la pr\u00e9sence, aux lettres patentes, de la clause de r\u00e9version du titre \u00e0 la Couronne. A mon avis, cette pr\u00e9tention ne peut \u00eatre accueillie. La Cit\u00e9 avait des droits. Elle \u00e9tait alors en possession paisible des terrains; elle pouvait soutenir, avec succ\u00e8s, une action possessoire contre les tiers qui auraient voulu les occuper sans son consentement et la Couronne,\u2014qui avait la facult\u00e9 mais non l\u2019obligation de reprendre son titre et qui laissa d\u2019ailleurs passer plusieurs ann\u00e9es sans s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir,\u2014ne pouvait, \u00e0 moins d\u2019obtenir et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle obtienne un jugement annulant ou d\u00e9clarant nuls les droits de la Cit\u00e9, s\u2019emparer de ces terrains ou en disposer sans l\u2019acquiescement de celle-ci. La pr\u00e9tention que le vendeur, qui a vendu ses droits \u00e0 un acheteur qui les a achet\u00e9s \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils, a fait une convention d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019objet, de cause et de consid\u00e9ration, parce qu\u2019il arrive subs\u00e9quemment que les droits qu\u2019il croyait avoir sont judiciairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls ou annul\u00e9s, d\u00e9pouille de tout sens, port\u00e9e et effet la stipulation que l\u2019acheteur a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils et permet \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur de prendre contre le vendeur les recours que la stipulation a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour objet d\u2019\u00e9carter.\nPour ces raisons, et apr\u00e8s avoir attentivement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 tous les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante, \u00e0 l\u2019audition et dans son factum, je dois conclure, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et de tous les Juges de la Cour d\u2019appel, au mal fond\u00e9 de l\u2019action institu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante contre la Cit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e.\nJe rejetterais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, appelante: Martineau, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu, Tetley & Phelan, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e: Germain, Pigeon, Thibaudeau & Lesage, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1966] B.R. 918.\n[2] [1957] B.R. 281."
