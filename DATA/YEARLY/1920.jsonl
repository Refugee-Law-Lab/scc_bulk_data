Co.\u2014Tariff of rates\u2014Agreement with City\u2014Britannia extension\u2014Separate rates\u2014Powers of Board.\nIn establishing a tariff of rates for carriage of passengers on the cars of the Ottawa Electric Ry. Co. the Board of Railway Commissioners should consider the portion of the line from Holland Avenue to Britannia separately from the rest and fix the rates therefor without regard to the conditions of carriage on the remainder of the system.\nHeld, per Duff, Brodeur and Mignault JJ., Davies C.J. contra, that under its agreement with the City of Ottawa, made in 1893, establishing five cents as the maximum of fares for the carriage of passengers within the city limits, the right of the company to charge any rate up to that maximum was not, prior to the enactment of sec. 325 (5) of the Railway Act of 1919, subject to the control of the Board.\nPer Anglin J. The power conferred on the company by earlier provincial legislation to fix its rates of fare was continued by the Dominion Acts of 1892 and 1894 and thus became as to the City of Ottawa of 1893 the subject of \" a Special Act\" which, under sec. 3 of the Railway Act of 1906 overrides the general jurisdiction of the Railway Board over fares and tolls.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by leave of the Board on questions of law.\nThe following questions were submitted by the Board for the opinion of the Court. \u201c(1) Whether upon the proper construction of the agreements with the City of Ottawa and the Village of Hintonburg the statutes relating to the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. and the relevant provisions of the Railway Acts, the Board was right in disallowing the tariff of the Company filed providing for payment of additional fare for carriage upon the extension from Holland Avenue notwithstanding that the Board has found as a fact that the Company did not require additional revenue.\n\u201c(2) Also whether upon the proper construction of the said agreements and statutes for the purpose of computing the toll to be charged to passengers upon the said extension the point of commencement of the said extension should be considered to be at Holland Avenue or at the former westerly limit of the Village of Hintonburg now the city of Ottawa.\n\u201c(3) Has the Board the right to treat the Company's operations as a whole and continue the existing tariff; or must the Board permit the filing of tariffs on a mileage basis covering services on the Britannia line without reference to the larger part of the system covered by municipal agreements.\"\nBy virtue of an agreement with the City of Ottawa the company could not exact a higher rate than five cents for carrying passengers within the city limits but they asked the Board to sanction a higher rate for the part of the line running to Britannia. This the Board refused to do on the ground that as the system as a whole was profitable additional revenue was not required.\nThe court heard counsel on these questions and ordered a re-argument on three others, namely: \u201c(1) Has the Board of Railway Commissioners authority to reduce the company's charge for passenger services within the City of Ottawa below the fare of 5 cents now charged for any such service?\n\u201c(2) If the first question is answered in the negative, has the Board power to require the company to provide a service partly within and partly beyond the limits of the City of Ottawa for a charge not exceeding 5 cents?\n\u201c(3) In passing upon the questions raised upon this appeal, is the court in any respect governed by section 325 of the Railway Act of 1919?\"\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nDenison K.C., and Wentworth Greene, for the Township of Nepean.\nJ. E. Caldwell, for the Village of Westboro. F. B. Proctor, for the City of Ottawa.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This is an appeal from the order or judgment of the Board of Railway Commissioners rejecting an application of the appellant company for leave to charge a higher rate than the existing one upon that portion of their railway known as the Britannia section or extension.\nAll the facts necessary for our decision on the questions of law referred to us are stated very fully in the reasons of the Chief Commissioner, Sir Henry Drayton, with which the rest of the Board concurred. Three questions are asked by them for us to answer. They are as follows:\u2014\n(1) Whether upon the proper construction of the agreements with the City of Ottawa and the Village of Hintonburg the statutes relating to the Ottawa Electric Railway Company and the relevant provisions of the Railway Acts, the Board was right in disallowing the tariff of the company filed providing for payment of additional fare for carriage upon the extension from Holland Avenue, notwithstanding that the Board has found as a fact that the company did not require additional revenue.\n(2) Also, whether upon the proper construction of the said agreements and statutes for the purpose of computing the toll to be charged to passengers upon the said extension the point of commencement of the said extension should be considered to be at Holland Avenue or at the former westerly limit of the Village of Hintonburg now the City of Ottawa.\n(3) Has the Board the right to treat the company's operations as a whole and continue the existing tariff; or must the Board permit the filing of tariffs on a mileage basis covering services on the Britannia line without reference to the larger part of the system covered by Municipal agreements.\nIt appears clear to me that when exercising its statutory powers in fixing the rates which a company may charge, the decision of the Board is final and we have no right to interfere or express any opinion upon it unless it clearly appears either (1) that the Board in exercising its judgment has refused to consider facts which it ought to have considered or (2) has considered facts which it should not have considered, or (3) has admittedly proceeded on a view of facts rightly taken into consideration which is erroneous at law.\nIn the case before us the Board determined that it should not consider the' Britannia extension as a separate entity but should consider it as an extension of the main city line and form its conclusions on the rate question with reference to the operations of the whole line.\nIf the Railway Commissioners were obliged, as was contended by Mr. Chrysler, to consider this extension as a separate entity, they found that the present rates which the company sought permission to raise were not fair and reasonable, and would, therefore, in such case presumably have permitted some raise to be made. If, on the other hand, they had to consider the application to raise the rates in the Britannia section with reference to the operations of the entire line and as a mere extension of it as they determined it was, then their decision is one with which we have no right to interfere or express any opinion upon.\nI am of opinion that in so deciding they acted within their legal rights and that this court has no jurisdiction to interfere.\nThe question, therefore, to determine is whether or not the Britannia extension was to be considered as part of the company's main line or as a separate entity. That, I take it, is a legal question and one which the Board rightly determined. The application to Parliament for the power and privilege of constructing the extension was made by the company on the express ground that it was an extension merely of their city lines, and in the statutes passed it was so recited and enacted. I cannot in the face of the express words of the statute, construe it as a separate entity. It is true that the main charter of the company limits the fares which they charge on their city lines to the then existing city limits and that such limitation does not embrace the Britannia section which was outside of those limits. But that by no means disposes of the question whether the Board had the right to disallow the application to be allowed to charge on the Britannia extension higher rates than those now existing; that is a question which, the Board having taken into its consideration all the facts it was obliged to consider and not having considered any facts which it has no right to consider, was in its absolute discretion and judgment. Mr. Chrysler pressed upon us the admitted fact that the Britannia extension was, in part, constructed upon the company's own private property and not upon the streets or roads. It does not appear to me that this fact makes any difference in determining the question of an increase of the rates whether the extension was to be treated and considered as a separate entity or not. The Board determined not to consider it such and, I think, was right in so doing. But when it has so decided after considering everything it was bound to consider, this court has no right to interfere with its conclusions.\nIn reaching the conclusions I have stated and disallowing this appeal I do not wish to be understood as affirming or agreeing with the statement of the Chief Commissioner of the Railway Board in delivering the reasons of the Board for making the order disallowing the proposed new tariff, to the effect that the Board had no authority to reduce the company's charge for passenger services within the City of Ottawa below the five cents now charged for such service. As I understand the language of the Chief Commissioner, he holds that even if the rate of five cents was held by the Board to be an unfair and unreasonable one the Board was powerless to reduce it because the Dominion Parliament has confirmed the agreement between the company and the Corporation of the City of Ottawa which provided that rate as a maximum one. The question is simply as to the meaning of the agreement so confirmed. That agreement, it seems to me, merely establishes five cents as a maximum rate which the company in no case or under no circumstances can exceed. The Board itself with all its statutory powers could not in the face of this express prohibition agreement, allow a higher tariff rate than five cents. But I respectfully submit in exercising its statutory powers and determining whether the rate of five cents, or even a lower rate than that, was or was not a \"fair and reasonable rate,\" the action of the Board is unfettered by the prohibition against charging more.\nThe question is not, of course, directly before us on this reference, but I am anxious not to be considered as agreeing with the conclusions of the Chief Commissioner on the point, concurred in as they were by the other members of the Board, and as such a conclusion was necessarily an important factor in deciding whether in disallowing the proposed new tariff the operations of the railway as a whole had a right to be considered by them.\nAt the second argument of this reference before us the question whether this court was in any respect governed by section 325 of the Railway Act of 1919 was debated.\nIn the view I take of the jurisdiction and powers of the Railway Board over the Ottawa Electric Railway Company being ample to justify their order, and also to fix the fares it may or may not charge, I do not deem it necessary to 'invoke the aid of the legislation of 1919. The previous legislation was quite sufficient, in my opinion, to give the Board jurisdiction and to justify its order now under appeal. If that legislation of 1919 was applicable I do not see how any question as to .the validity of the Board's action could arise.\nIn the year 1894, the then two independent street railways in Ottawa were united, and the agreement made between them was ratified by Parliament as also the agreement between the united companies and the City of Ottawa by 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 86.\nSection 7 of that Act is as follows: The lines of street railway constructed by the said companies, or either of them, are hereby declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada, and the said \"The Ottawa Electric Railway Company\" is hereby declared to be a body corporate subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nFrom and after the passage of that legislation the new appellant the Ottawa Electric Railway Company, became, in the words of the statute, a body corporate subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada and its works were declared to be for the general advantage of Canada. The Company, therefore, had all the benefit of the general railway legislation of the Dominion then or thereafter passed and became subject in all respects to the same.\nIn 1906, such a general Act was passed, the 314th section of which is as follows:-\n314. The company or the directors of the company, by by-law, or any officer of the company thereunto authorized by by-law of the company or directors, may from time to time prepare and issue tariffs of the tolls to be charged, as hereinafter provided, for all traffic carried by the company upon the railway, or in vessels, and may specify the persons to whom, the place where, and the manner in which, such tolls shall be paid.\n2. Such tolls may be either for the whole or for any particular portions of the railway.\n3. All such by-laws shall be submitted to and approved by the Board.\n4. The Board may approve such by-laws in whole or in part, or may change, alter or vary any of the provisions therein.\n5. No tolls shall be charged by the company until a by-law authorizing the preparation and issue of tariffs of such tolls has been approved by the Board, nor shall the company charge, levy or collect any money for any service as common carrier, except under the provisions of this Act.\nThen section 323, enacts as follows in its first part:-\n323. The Board may disallow any tariff or any portion thereof which it considers to be unjust or unreasonable, or contrary to any of the provisions of this Act, and may require the company, within a prescribed time, to substitute a tariff satisfactory to the Board in lieu thereof, or may prescribe other tolls in lieu of the tolls so disallowed\nUnder this legislation the Board, in my opinion, has full and ample powers to control the rates of the company on its main lines and its extensions, and, finding that the company had a revenue of at least 15 per cent from its works as a whole, was acting within its rights when it rejected the company's application for leave to charge a higher rate than the existing one upon the Britannia section or extension of their lines of railway.\nI am unable to appreciate the argument. that the powers granted to the companies by the provincial legislature to make by-laws regulating the rates which might be charged for the carriage of passengers became vested in the united companies under the name of the Ottawa Electric Railway by the Act of the Parliament of Canada which declared the work to be for the general advantage of Canada, and that the General Railway Act did not take away or impair those rights or powers. It seems to me that the contention is fully met by section 6 of the Railway Act of 1906, which reads as follows:-\n6. Where any railway, the construction or operation of which is authorized by Special Act passed by the legislature of any province, is declared, by any Act of the Parliament of Canada, to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, this Act shall apply to such railway, and to the company constructing or operating the same, to the exclusion of such of the provisions of the said, Special Act, as are inconsistent with this Act, and in lieu of any general railway Act of the province.\nUnder any construction of these various Acts the power to control and disallow any proposed tariff of rates as being \" unjust and unreasonable \" remained in the Railway Board under section 323 of the Railway Act and applied to the tariff of rates now under review.\nThe power of the common law courts over rates charged by a common carrier were practically transferred by section 323 of the Railway Act above quoted to the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nI would therefore, answer the first question, under the circumstances I have stated above, in the affirmative construing the phrase \"right in disallowing the tariff \" in question as meaning \" within its right.\" Whether the decision was right or wrong is not for me to pass on; I merely say the Board was within its right in deciding as it did.\nMy answer to the first part of the third question is in the affirmative, and, to the latter part, in the negative.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014There existed in Ottawa in the early part of 1894, two street railways, respectively owned by separate corporate companies whose early history and relations with the City of Ottawa concern, or at all events should concern, us very little for the purpose of determining the questions raised by this appeal.\nSuffice it to say that in said year there were agreements entered into between the said companies whereby the assets of the one were to be sold to the other and between both and the City of Ottawa, presented to the Parliament of the Dominion with a petition to confirm same and vest the properties which had been theretofore and were then held by either in the appellant.\nParliament, by 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 86, sec. 1, ratified the said agreement between the said companies, and by section 2, the said agreement between them and the City of Ottawa.\nThen by section 3 of said Act, it enacted as follows:-\n3. The franchises, powers and privileges heretofore or hereby granted to or conferred upon the said companies, or either of them and which are hereby authorized to be transferred to the said united company, shall be exercised and enjoyed by the said united company, subject to the terms, provisos and conditions contained in the said agreement with the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.\nSection 6 provided as follows:-\nThe name of the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company is hereby changed from 'The Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company' to 'The Ottawa Electric Railway Company', but such change in name shall not in any way impair, alter or affect the rights or liabilities of the company, nor in any wise effect any suit or proceeding now pending or judgment existing eitherby or in favour of, or against the said company, which, notwithstanding such change in the name of the company, may be prosecuted or continued, completed and enforced as if this Act had not been passed.\nAnd section 7 of the same Act declared as follows:-\n7. The lines of street railway constructed by the said companies, or either of them, are hereby declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada, and the said 'The Ottawa Electric Railway Company' is hereby declared to be a body corporate subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThat legislation. beyond doubt constituted the appellant and the said lines of railway, in the language just quoted, \" works for the general advantage of Canada\" and subjected the appellant as the new corporate owner of same and said works to the future railway legislation of the Dominion, unless when expressly exempted therefrom.\nThe Dominion Parliament by the Railway Act of 1906, section 5, provided as follows:-\n5. This Act shall, subject as herein provided, apply to all persons, companies and railways, other than Government railways, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. The said Railway Act, 1906, provides, by section 314, as follows:-\n314. The company or the directors of the company, by by-law, or any officer of the company thereunto authorized by by-law of the company or directors, may from time to time prepare and issue tariffs of the tolls to be charged, as hereinafter provided, for all traffic carried by the company upon the railway, or in vessels, and may specify the persons to whom, the place where, and the manner in which, such tolls shall be paid.\n2. Such tolls may be either for the whole or for any particular portions of the railway.\n3. All such by-laws shall be submitted to and approved by the Board.\n4. The Board may approve such by-laws in whole or in part, or may change, alter or vary any of the provisions therein.\n5. No tolls shall be charged by the company until a by-law authorizing the preparation and issue of tariffs of such tolls has been approved by the Board, nor shall the company charge, levy or collect any money for any service as a common carrier except under the provisions of the Act.\nSection 323 of said Act reads in first part as follows :-\n323. The Board may disallow any tariff or any portion thereof which it considers to be unjust or unreasonable, or contrary to any of the provisions of this Act, and may require the company, within a prescribed time, to substitute a tariff satisfactory to the Board in lieu thereof, or may prescribe other tolls in lieu of the tolls so disallowed.\nThe foregoing outlines of so much of the legal history of appellant as can be made relevant to any of the questions herein submitted, when taken in connection with said section 323 of said Act, contains all the law to which we should have regard in answering same.\nIndeed I hold that the lastly quoted part of section 323 contains all that is relevant in this particular case, for the Board finds that the appellant has a revenue of at least 15% from its works, as a whole. That renders it impossible to say, as matter of law, that the ruling is \"unjust and unreasonable\" and hence in any way such a violation of said section 323 as to furnish any ground of complaint on the appellant's behalf.\nIf it is not possible to hold that in law there has been something unjust or unreasonable done by the Board in reaching its judgment, or in the application of any of the statutes to which I have referred, then it hardly seems possible that there can be any question of law proper for this court, to be called upon to decide.\nI may briefly state some e other facts which it is said give rise to the doubt of the correctness in law of the conclusion reached by the Board.\nIt seems that the appellant's railway extends from a point some short distance east of Ottawa to Britannia-on-the-Bay to the west of said city, with numerous divergent parts and branches running over many of the city streets.\nAs inevitably happens in every large business enterprise, there are some parts of this railway which do not pay as well as, others; and indeed are a burden, according to the absurd view that the feeders to serve the system are entirely useless and that all the persons passing over same would in any event pass over the other central part and pay a fare.\nThe part of the said railway extending from Ottawa to Britannia-on-the-Bay was authorized by Parliament, by the statute of 1899, ch. 82, expressly enacting that the company might as an extension to its then existent railway, construct and operate, etc., such a branch.\nAn agreement referred to in the questions I am about to quote had been entered into between the appellant and the Village of Hintonburgh specially providing for its franchise in that part of its line. That agreement has expired, and can hardly be said as matter of law to have anything to do with the questions raised, especially when the maximum limit of basis fixed thereby is adhered to by appellant.\nThe Board, however, for some reason not very apparent in so plain a case, has submitted the following alleged questions of law on which appellant bases this appeal, and asks to find out what has been done by the Board is in law unwarranted:\u2014\n(1) Whether upon the proper construction of the agreements with the City of Ottawa and the Village of Hintonburgh, the statutes relating to the Ottawa Electric Railway Company and the relevant provisions of the Railway Acts, the Board was right in disallowing the tariff of the company filed providing for payment of additional fares for carriage upon the extension from Holland Avenue, notwithstanding that the Board has found as a fact that the company did not require additional revenue.\n(2) Also, whether upon the proper construction of the said agreements and statutes for the purpose of computing the toll to be charged to passengers upon the said extension the point of commencement of the said extension should be considered to be at Holland Avenue or at the former westerly limit of the Village of Hintonburgh now the City of Ottawa.\n(3) Has the Board the right to treat the Company's operations as a whole and continue the existing tariff; or must the Board permit the filing of tariffs on a mileage basis covering services on the Britannia line without reference to the larger part of the system covered by Municipal agreements.\nI am unable to understand the argument that in law there is such an imperative legal distinction, between the part of the company's line beyond Holland Avenue, and those other parts of same, which must of necessity become effective and so operate as an imperative mandate in relation to the defining or fixing of rates that there must be different rates east of that line from those west thereof, which conflicts with conclusions reached by the Board. The mathematical distinction I can grasp but that we have to deal with must be one so founded in law as to affect this case.\nTo urge that a separate and distinct line of treatment thereof in regard to the question of fares for passage over it because it was authorized and built at a different time from some other part, seems to me, with great respect, a very idle argument. And it does not seem to me to be improved by a reference to the question of whether the power of expropriation existed before or was first enforced by a particular clause in the legislative history of the appellant.\nThe same sort of argument would lead to holding as matter of law that the Hintonburgh part of the line must be treated as a thing separate from the rest of the lines in fixing fares, and so on throughout the system.\nI can understand the question of the delimitation of rates as evidenced by agreements between appellant and municipal bodies being a matter of fact which probably the Board of Railway Commissioners should examine in reaching a determination as to any tariff of tolls. When the Board has done so and examined all else in the way of facts bearing upon the questions raised by the proposed imposition of a tariff, I fail to see how any question of law arises. It is not for us to pass upon the question of whether or not the proper construction of the agreements and the relevant provisions of the Railway Acts, as a matter of law, lead to the allowance or disallowance of the proposed tariff when we find that the Board, even assuming as well founded appellant's contention relative to the construction of said agreements and statements, has found as fact that the company did not require additional revenue and hence it was neither just nor reasonable to impose further rates.\nI could understand the question of law being put as to whether or nor the rates of fares named in such , agreements and legislative validation thereof must be held to have been thereby in law imperatively and definitely determined for all time. But when we find the Board and counsel for appellant have assumed that to be law (which I much doubt but pass no opinion upon) and acted upon such assumption, there seems nothing but mere questions of fact involved in what remains for consideration.\nThere is much to be said for the true legal aspect of the whole matter involved having been reduced, by the Parliamentary legislation above recited, to a mere question of what would be in the opinion of the Board be a just and reasonable tariff, regardless of the agreements in question, and especially so when we find. they seem in this regard to have merely arrived at a maximum tariff.\nEvidently this part of the agreement though for even that and many other purposes validated by the preceding legislation, may held to have been over- ridden by the later legislation constituting the Board and assigning it such powers as it has, constituting it absolute master of the whole question of rates or tolls, provided always as a test of the due discharge of such duties as entailed thereby that it has duly considered all that is involved as fact in such like agreements.\nLet us assume that there had, instead of a highly profitable investment such as appellant's has turned out, resulted an enterprise that could not be made productive of a fair profit without discarding the limitation in these agreements; could it be said that the Board under the legislation conferring such an absolute power long after the agreements had come into existence, would be powerless to grant any relief?\nThe questions as presented and the argument thereon do not permit me to feel at liberty to answer definitely this question.\nI, therefore, merely submit it as an illustration of what might have been a possible solution of much that is involved in what has been considered, and suggesting a reason why the questions submitted cannot be answered in a more helpful way than I am compelled to.\nHolding the view I have expressed as to the first question, it seems self-evident that the answer to the second question is not involved in the disposition of the question before the Board and hence needs no answer.\nAs to the third question I cannot conceive of any rule of law that would prevent the Board from considering the company's operations as a whole, and if it saw fit to disallow the proposed tariff, or any portion thereof which it is considered to be unjust, or unreasonable, or contrary to the provisions of the Railway Act, it was entirely within its province. So far as the doing so can be said to raise any question of law, I have no hesitation in answering affirmatively.\nAs to the second branch of the third question, raising the point of whether or not the Board must permit the fixing of tariffs on a mileage basis. I may point out that the appellant's factum distinctly disavows desiring to raise such a question and insists that\nthere was no question before the Board as to whether the tolls should be based upon mileage, or upon a flat rate. That seems to eliminate as far as this appellant is concerned in this appeal, the only other possible question of law raised by the third question for our decision.\nIt is only as a basis of appeal by way of which an appellant may seek to get relief that we can consider any such question. However willing we should be to aid the Board we cannot properly so interfere unless incidentally to the determination of something in respect of which an appellant seeks relief.\nWith great respect I submit the questions submitted (save the first part of the third question) do not raise or distinctly state any definite question of law actually relevant to the matters in issue between those concerned, upon which a ruling is desired, and can be properly made.\nThe first part of the third question should be answered in the affirmative.\nI think, therefore, following our view expressed in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Regina Board of Trade[1] the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAfter I had written the foregoing the majority of the court decided to direct a re-argument (which has been had) upon certain stated questions. In deference, however, to suggestions made in that argument, which was not directed on the grounds upon which I proceeded and hence has not changed my opinion, I may be permitted to point out that the declaration, contained in the above quoted section 7 of the Dominion Act, 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 86, that, so long ago as 1894, the works of the appellant were thereby declared to be for the general advantage of Canada; and hence by such declaration withdrawn, by virtue of Item No. 10 of section 92 of the British North America Act, from any control of, or incidental to, their operation either by virtue of any legislation of Old Canada or the legislation of the Province of Ontario.\nSuch, I think, must be held to be the result of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Toronto v. The Bell Telephone Co.[2]. Unfortunately that case was not referred to in either argument herein.\nBy the express language of the above quoted section 7, as well as the necessities of the situation created by the other provisions of the said Act a new corporate entity, composed of two such previously existent, is created and that is declared to be subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe result of the said legislation, viewed in light of said decision, seems to have been to give predeterminate effect to the Act of Parliament wherever conflict arises between the respective enactments.\nWe are not left to depend alone upon such reasoning for this conclusion was adopted by the enactment of section 6 of the Railway Act of 1906, which reads as follows:\n6. Where any railway, the construction or operation of which is authorized by a special Act passed by the legislature of any province, is declared, by any Act of the Parliament of Canada, to be a work of the general advantage of Canada, this Act shall apply to such railway, and to the company constructing or operating the same, to the exclusion of such of the provisions of the said Special Act as are inconsistent with this Act, and in lieu of any general railway Act of the province.\nHence beyond peradventure all the subsequent undertakings of the new creation such as the new branch, declared by the later Act authorizing it, to be an extension, and that extension which is now in question, must be governed in every respect by the Dominion Railway Act, and not by any legislation of the Ontario legislature either as to fares or otherwise.\nThis evidently was the view held by the appellant itself otherwise it never should have troubled the Board of Railway Commissioners by filing with it a proposed new tariff of fares.\nThe point made by Mr. Denison of counsel for one of the respondents, that at common law the common carrier was as between him and any one of the public, not entitled to charge any fare beyond what was just and reasonable, was well taken.\nBesides those cases he referred to I find the case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore Si Ohio Rd. Co.[3] which proceeds upon a distinct holding of such a view as the basis upon which the legislation there in question proceeded. See also Harris v. Packwood[4].\nOur Railway Act in making a statutory provision for the determination of what rates are chargeable, also proceeds upon the same basis of what is just and reasonable.\nI therefore repeat that I can see nothing else to test the jurisdiction of the Board so long as it has not gone beyond its statutory authority and has not failed to consider all relevant facts.\nDUFF J.\u2014The questions submitted should, in my opinion, be disposed of as follows:\u2014\nThe first question: This question is not answered since it involves questions of fact within the exclusive competence of the Board of Railway Commissioners. So far as it involves a question of law it is covered by the answer given to the first part of the third question.\nThe second question: At Holland Avenue.\nThe third question: First member. No. Second member: Yes; though not necessarily on a mileage basis.\nMy reasons for these conclusions can be stated briefly. They are based upon two propositions which appear to me clearly established.\nFirst: I concur fully with the opinion of the Chairman of the Board as to the effect of the statute of 1894. By force of that statute and the scheduled agreements the rights and obligations of. the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. in relation to the fares chargeable in respect of the services provided for or contemplated by the agreement between the Street Railway Companies and the City\u2014services which may with sufficient accuracy be referred to as City services\u2014were to be governed by the agreement itself; and consequently the Ottawa Electric Company did not on the passing of the Railway Act of 1903 (see s. 3) become in respect of such fares subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners touching the matter of the regulation of rates.\nSecond. As regards the Britannia extension on the other hand, authorized by the Act of 1899, I can find nothing in that statute excluding this line from this jurisdiction of the Board and I think that on the passing of the Railway Act of 1903 the provisions of that enactment on the subject of the regulation of rates became applicable to it.\nThe first of these propositions seems to involve this consequence: The fares exigible under the statute and agreement of 1894 must be taken to be a just remuneration, neither too much nor too little, for the city services; and it seems to follow that in determining what is a just and reasonable remuneration for the services performed on the Britannia lines the proceeds derived from the city services must be left out of account. That is to say that in determining what is just and reasonable in respect of the Britannia lines, you must start with the hypothesis that everything paid in respect of city services has been fully earned by the performance of those services.\nThe point may be illustrated by a reference to one example of the manner in which the existing tariff operates. Under that tariff the company is entitled to charge a maximum fare of five cents for transport from the corner of Laurier Avenue and Charlotte Street to Britannia, a charge which the company, by the Act and agreement of 1894 is nevertheless entitled to make for that part of the service which is performed within the city. In other words, under existing conditions, so long as the Britannia line is kept in operation and this service is maintained, the company is obliged to give, for a fare of five cents, the city service (for which by law it is entitled to receive a fare of five cents) plus the service from Holland Avenue to Britannia; and that appears to be the necessary consequence of treating the operations of the company as a whole and maintaining the existing tariff.\nI think it is not permissible to do this because thereby full effect is denied to the legal rights of the company under the statute and agreements of 1894.\nI must mention that in answering these questions we are governed by the law as it stood before the enactment of the Railway Act of 1919. ANGLIN J.\u2014This case comes before us by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners granted under s.s. 3 of s. 56 of the Railway Act, R.S.C., c. 37, as enacted by 9 & 10 Ed. VII., c. 50, s. 1. The Board is thereby empowered to grant a right of appeal.\nupon any question which in the opinion of the Board is a question of law.\nIt may therefore be that this court should not decline to pass upon any question leave for the submission of which as a question of law has been given by the Board, however difficult or even impossible it may be to find in it such a question. On the other hand if a question formulated by the Board is susceptible of more than one interpretation, inasmuch as it must be assumed that the Board did not intend to ask the opinion of the court on anything other than a question of law, the court should put upon it any construction at all admissible that presents such a question. If on no possible interpretation can a question of law be found it would seem reasonable to assume that there had been some mistake in the-drafting of the-question in respect of which leave has been given, and on that assumption the Board might be asked to reconsider it and, if possible, to state it in a form which would- present an issue of law. I should have been disposed to adopt this course in regard to the first question .in the present case were it not for the fact that I incline to the view that it was probably intended by it to cover substantially the same ground as is covered by the first member of the third question, and in the latter may be found a question of law. It would not seem to be practicable to answer the first question submitted on this appeal without reviewing the discretion of the Board exercised upon considerations which are in no sense matters of law. It is beyond the function which s. 56 (3) of the Railway Act contemplated should be exercised by this Court to determine\nwhether * * * the Board was (or was not) right in disallowing the tariff of the Company filed providing for payment of additional fare for carriage upon the extension from Holland Avenue.\nShould there be no legal obstacle to the adoption of the course decided upon by the Board, there may be error in the determination of some matter of fact or in the exercise of the wide discretion entrusted to it by the statute, neither of which can be made the subject of an appeal to this court. I find it difficult to conceive of any case in which the court may properly be asked whether any action taken by the Board is or is not \"right,\" unless where the law peremptorily requires that some particular course should be taken in regard to the subject matter of the question.\nThe facts out of which the questions submitted arise appear in the order of the Board granting leave to appeal. Mr. Chrysler contends that the finding of the learned Chief Commissioner, that the company has a statutory right, not subject to the control of the Board, created by the confirmation of its agreement of 1893 with the City of Ottawa by the Dominion Act of 1894 (c. 86), to charge any rate of fare fixed by it, not exceeding five cents, for the carriage of each adult passenger within the then limits of the City of Ottawa, constitutes such a legal requirement and compels the allowance by the Board of some additional rate for carriage on the Britannia extension, admittedly beyond those limits, and precludes that tribunal from taking into account in fixing such rate the company's profits on the operation of so much of its system as is covered by the agreement. If the Chief Commissioner's finding is right, or must be assumed to be so on this appeal, I am, with respect, of the opinion that the learned counsel's conclusions would seem necessarily to follow. Otherwise the company would be obliged to expend in the operation of an extension found to be unprofitable (par. \"r\") income derived from other portions of its system to which, ex hypo-thesi, it has an absolute statutory right: To put it otherwise\u2014having by statute a right to be paid five cents for carrying a passenger, who embarks in Ottawa, to the former city limits, it would be compelled to carry him gratis beyond those limits\u2014and for an additional three miles should he desire to travel to the Britannia terminus. The same result would ensue in the case of a passenger boarding one of the company's cars at some point on the extension to be carried to a place within the City of Ottawa as it stood in 1893. The only traffic on the Britannia extension for which the company would receive any remuneration would be that having both its point of origin and its point of destination on the extension itself. If it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Board directly to control the company's tolls within the limits of the Ottawa of 1893, it cannot, in my opinion, do so indirectly by refusing to the company reasonable remuneration for the traffic on the Britannia extension, considered by itself.\nMr. Chrysler argued that the Board has not submitted to the court the question whether the company has or has not the statutory right which the Chief Commissioner has found it enjoys with regard to the rates of fare within the city of Ottawa as it stood in 1893-4, and that that matter is therefore not subject to review here. It is quite true that the question is not formulated in explicit terms. But the first member of the third question submitted\nhas the Board the right to treat the company's operations as a whole and continue the existing tariff?\ntreating the word \"right\" used in it as meaning power or jurisdiction\u2014necessarily involves it. I find nothing else in the statutes and agreements referred to in the first question, and recited in the statement of facts embodied in the order of the Board, that could possibly exclude that right. They include the statute and agreement on which the Chief Commissioner bases his finding that a statutory right to a five cent fare for each adult passenger carried within the limits of the Ottawa of 1893, over which the Board has no power of regulation or control, is vested in the company. We cannot in answering the first member of the third question propounded ignore this feature of the case before us which appears to me to be so vital that it is virtually the turning point in its determination and presents, if not the sole, at least the most obvious and most important question of law to be found in the entire submission. Somewhat paradoxically upon this question the appellant company upholds the finding of the Chief Commissioner while the respondents maintain that it is wrong.\nAlthough, the reasons presently to be stated, of the opinion that the company has a right not subject to the control of the Board to fix a rate of fare not exceeding five cents for each adult passenger, except as provided by clause 49 of the agreement of 1893, carried by it within the then limits of Ottawa, with respect, I fail to find in the confirmation by the statute of 1894 of clause 46 of the agreement of 1893 sufficient ground for that conclusion. On the contrary, if the company's right rested on that contract and statute alone, while it could not claim any fare exceeding five cents (except for the traffic specially provided for by clause 47) for the carriage of a passenger within the limits of the Ottawa of 1893, its right to demand fares up to that figure would, in my opinion, be subject to the control of the Board. Clause 46 is purely restrictive in its terms. Had the company intended to stipulate for a right to charge any fare fixed by it not exceeding five cents, it is scarcely concevable that that right would not have been expressed in positive terms such as are found in clause 47 dealing with the special rates of fare between 12 o'clock midnight and 5.30 a.m. Moreover, the fact that its right to collect and fix fares within: the Ottawa of 1893 existed independently of and antecedently to the contract of that year and the statute of 1894, as I shall now endeavour to demonstrate, renders it wholly unnecessary to import by implication into clause 46 of that contract the positive provision which the contracting parties would seem to have deliberately omitted from it.\nThe Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company was incorporated by the Parliament of the late Province of Canada in 1866 and by section 8 of that statute (c. 106) its directors were empowered to make by-laws touching (inter alfa).\nthe fares to be received for passengers and freight transported over the railway or any part thereof.\nThe franchise conferred was to construct and to operate by animal power a street railway on certain specified streets and others to be agreed upon in the City of Ottawa and adjoining municipalities. The work being purely local and provincial passed, at Confederation, under the control of the legislature of Ontario. That body in 1868 amended the company's charter (c. 45) by declaring applicable to it certain sections of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1859 (c. 66), inter alia those with respect to \"Powers,\" and expressly excluding the application of other clauses of the same Act, inter alia sections 118 and 151 relating one to the reduction of tolls by the legislature and the other to the approval of tariffs by the Governor-in-Council. Under the heading \"Powers\" it was by section 9 of the Consolidated Railway Act provided that\nthe company shall have power and authority * * * tenthly * * * to regulate * * * the tolls and compensation to be paid and to receive such tolls and compensation.\nS.s. 1 of s. 31 of ch. 170 of R.S.O. 1887 (The Ontario Railway Act) applied to the Ottawa City Passenger\nRailway Company, but s. ss. 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the same section did not. R.S.O. 1887, c. 2, s. 10.\nNo other change in the statutes affecting the company was made prior to 1892. It would therefore appear that at that time under the provincial statutes governing it one of the \"powers\" of the company was to regulate its tolls\u2014a power which it would probably exercise through directors' by-laws passed under sec. 8 of the Act of 1866\u2014without control by the legislature or by the Governor-in-Council under sections 118 or 151 of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1859, or the corresponding sections of c. 170 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1887. The Ontario Street Railway Act of 1883 (46 Vict., c. 16) (R.S.O 1887, c. 171) by its 24th section provided that\nnothing in this Act contained shall apply to or affect any street railway company existing or incorporated before the lst of February, 1883. In 1892 the company desiring to extend its line across the Union Bridge and into the City of Hull sought and obtained from the Dominion Parliament an Act (c. 53) empowering it to do so, (s. 1) declaring it to be a work for the general advantage of Canada (s. 6) conferring on it the additional right to use motive power other than animal power, except steam (sec. 3), making applicable to the new lines of which the construction was thereby authorized the Acts of 1866 and 1868 and \"the powers thereby conferred,\" and providing that the \"operation\" of the railway \"by any new or additional powers conferred by this Act,\" should be subject to the provincial law in relation to street railways (s. 6).\n\"Operation\" in this statute in my opinion does not include the fixing or regulation of fares. It refers to the working of the railway-how the cars should be run\u2014control of the tracks, motive power and equipment. Bedford Bowling Green Stone Co. v. Oman[5]; Minneapolis Street Railway Co. v. City of Minneapolis[6]. A reference to the clauses of the Dominion Railway Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 37) included in the fasciculus headed \"Operation\" will serve to indicate the purview of that term as understood by the Parliament of Canada.\nBy sec. 13 of the Act of 1892 it was provided that\nnothing in this Act shall in any way impair any of the powers which the company has at the passing of this Act.\nOrdinarily I should incline to think that the word \"powers\" in such a section would not include the right to fix rates. But that right was conferred by the Act of 1868 as a \"power and authority;\" and by the Act of 1868 it was confirmed as one of the \"powers\" under sec. 9 of the Consolidated statute of 1859 incorporated with the Act of 1868. Furthermore, in the Dominion Act of 1892, while secs. 92 and 93-98 of the general Railway Act (51 V., c. 29) are expressly made applicable to the company, there is no reference either to sec. 223 empowering the company to fix tolls or to secs. 11 (k) and 227 and 228 providing for the control of tolls by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council and the Governor-in-Council respectively. The proper conclusion from these circumstances appears to me to be that the \"power\" of fixing and regulating its rates of fare free from the control of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, which the company possessed under the provincial legislation affecting it, was continued unimpaired by the operation of secs. 6 and 13 of the statute of 1892, notwithstanding the declaration thereby made that the company's undertaking was a work for the general advantage of Canada, and that that right thus became the subject of a \"Special Act\" excluding the application of inconsistent provisions of the general Railway Act (51 V., ch. 29, ss. 3 and 6), if they would otherwise have been applicable to it as a street railway.\nSuch was the position of the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company in regard to the imposition and control of tolls at the time of the agreement of 1893 and the statute of 1894 confirming it, so much canvassed at bar. The Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company, then absorbed by and amalgamated with the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company, had been incorporated in 1890 and was subject to the Ontario Street Railway Act (R.S.O. 1887, c. 171). But the only statutory provision affecting its tolls was that contained in s. 9 of that Act, limiting the maximum fare to be charged by it to five cents for any distance not exceeding three miles and one cent for each additional mile. It seems very clear to me, therefore, that the sole office of the first member of clause 46 of the agreement of 1893\u2014\nno higher fare than five cents shall be charged for the conveyance of one passenger from one point to another on the said line and branches thereof within the present city limits.\nwas so to limit the company's right to fix its rates of fare conferred by the provincial Acts of 1866 and 1868 and confirmed by the Dominion Act of 1892, and not otherwise subjected to statutory control or restriction, that thereafter the ordinary fare for the carriage of an adult passenger within the then city limits should not exceed five cents,\u2014a concession which the company no doubt made in consideration of countervailing benefits and advantages obtained by it under the agreement. That, in my opinion, is the entire scope and purpose of the part of clause 46 now under consideration and it therefore becomes quite unnecessary to consider the effect of its confirmation by the statute as creating a statutory right in favour of the company.\nThe Act of 1894 continues the existence of the \"Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company\" under the name of the \"Ottawa Electric Railway Company\" (s. 6) and sanctions its absorption of the Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company (s. 1), declaring that the lines of street railway of both companies are works for the general advantage of Canada and that the Ottawa Electric Railway Company is subject to the authority of the Parliament of Canada (s. 7). But any effect which these latter provisions might otherwise have had under sec. 6 of the Railway Act of 1903 c. 58; (R.S.C. 1906, c. 37, s. 6) is excluded by secs. 3 and 11, to which, as well as to sec. 13 of the Act of 1892, the provisions of sec. 3 of the Railway Act of 1903 would seem to apply. Secs. 3 and 11 of the Act of 1894 are as follows:\u2014\n(3) The franchises, powers and privileges heretofore or hereby granted to or conferred upon the said companies, or either of them, and which are hereby authorized to be transferred to the said united company, shall be exercised and enjoyed by the said united company, subject to the terms, provisos and conditions contained in the said agreement with the corporation of the City of Ottawa.\n(11) Nothing in this act Shall in any respect impair any of the powers which the said Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company shall have immediately prior to the date appointed for this Act to take effect.\nUnder these provisions the power or privilege of the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company to fix and regulate its rates of fare conferred by the legislation of 1866 and 1868 and confirmed by the statute of 1892 are again preserved for the benefit of the continuing corporation, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company. As provisions made by the Parliament of Canada inconsistent with the jurisdiction over tariffs and tolls then possessed by the Governor-in-Council and the Railway Committee of the Privy Council and now vested in the Board of Railway Commissioners by the Railway Act, they override the latter (s. 3 of c. 37, R.S.C., 1906). There is no reference to the general Railway Act in the statute of 1894.\nThe construction of the Britannia branch by the Ottawa Electric Railway Company was authorized by a Dominion statute of 1899 (c. 82) \"as an extension of its present railway.\" Neither the agreement of 1893 between the City of Ottawa and the appellant company, nor the (now expired) agreement of the company with the Village of Hintonburgh applies proprio vigore to this extension. The former is explicitly confined in its operation to the City of Ottawa of 1893; the latter to lines of railway constructed on streets of the village. No part of the Britannia extension is within the Ottawa of 1893 and the short portion of it within the former village of Hintonburgh is constructed not on streets but on a private right of way. The fact that the company was authorized by the statute of 1899 to construct the line from Holland Avenue west to Britannia-on-the-Bay \"as an extension of its present railway\" does not bring that extension within the terms of agreements explicitly confined in their operation the one to territory within which no part of it is constructed and the other to property over which it does not pass; nor does it, in my opinion, as a matter of law preclude the sanction by the Board of a tariff of fares for that extension distinct from that in force for the rest of the company's system.\nSec. 3 of the Act of 1899 reads as follows:\nSections 90-172, both inclusive, of the Railway Act and such of the other sections as are applicable, shall apply to the company with respect to the said extension.\nIt is common ground that as to 'the Britannia branch the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners over tariffs and tolls conferred by the general Railway Act is unfettered. But I cannot find in the mere description of this branch as an \"extension\" anything entitling the Board in the exercise of that jurisdiction to disregard the effect of any rights which the company may have to fix and regulate tolls on its lines within the limits of the City of Ottawa of 1893 independently of the Board's supervision and control. If, in order to treat the company's operations as a whole and continue the existing tariff,\nthe Board must disregard such a right of the company, either directly or indirectly, in my opinion it may not do so. It follows that the Board should\npermit the filing of tariffs * * * covering service on the Britannia line without reference to the larger part of the system covered by the municipal agreements * * *\nthough not necessarily on a mileage basis.\nOn the proper construction of the relevant agreements and statutes I am of the opinion that the Britannia extension commences at Holland Avenue since from that point westerly the company's tracks are laid on a private right of way and not on public streets and it is \"from some point on its present railway\" (of which the terminus was then at Holland Avenue) that the company was by the Act of 1899 authorized to construct and operate its line to Britannia-on-the-Bay.\nWhile it would seem to follow from what I have said that it is not possible to hold as a matter of law that the order of the Board disallowing the tariff in question was not \"right\" and the respondents may therefore be entitled to ask the court to decline to answer the first question in the affirmative, in view of the facts and finding in paragraph \"r\" of the order allowing the appeal the company is entitled to such fares and on such basis as the Board may deem reasonable and just in respect of traffic on its Britannia branch irrespective and independently of the rates of fare prevailing on the rest of its system. As the learned Chief Commissioner said in delivering the opinion of the Board in this case:\nUnder the Railway Act the same company may have different rates on different parts of its system where traffic and operating conditions and construction costs are dissimilar, for example, railway tolls are justifiably higher in a mountainous district where cuttings and grades are heavy and as a result the cost of construction and operation is greater than in other districts. Again the tolls may be greater where traffic density and diversity differ.\nRates on a branch or lateral line may be justified, although higher than those of a main line, with greater traffic and although owned by the same company.\nThe fact that a flat rate of fare prevails throughout the rest of the, company's system does not as a matter of law in my opinion preclude the authorization of an additional fare, either on a mileage or \"measured\" basis or as a flat rate, on the Britannia extension.\nI would, for the foregoing reasons, without answering the first question, answer the second question: \"At Holland Avenue;\" and to the first member of the third question my answer would be: \"No;\" and to the second member thereof: \"Yes, \u2022though not necessarily on a mileage basis.\"\nIn reaching these conclusions, I have entirely put out of consideration s.s. 5 of sec. 325 of the Railway Act of 1919. That provision is not retroactive. The statute was passed on 7th July, 1919; the decision of the Board was pronounced on 25th of February, 1919; and leave for this appeal was granted on 14th of April, 1919. The answers to the questions before us, therefore, in nowise depend on s.s. 5 of sec. 325 and I refrain from expressing' any opinion whatever either upon its construction or upon the scope of its application.\nOn the whole the appeal succeeds and the appellants should have their costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The appellant company operates within the city limits of Ottawa a street railway proper, and beyond city limits it runs a suburban railway called the Britannia line. This suburban railway is constructed upon a private right of way and passes through the territories of the respondents, the township of Nepean and the village of Westboro.\nThe rates within the City of Ottawa are fixed by a contract which was confirmed by Parliament.\nThe Railway Company has filed before the Railway Board a tariff asking for larger fares than those charged heretofore on the Britannia line and the municipalities interested including the City of Ottawa have applied for the disallowance of the proposed tariff and it was disallowed on the 25th February, 1919. The Ottawa Electric Company dissatisfied with the order of the Board, obtained on the 14th of April, 1919, leave from the Board to appeal to this Court upon the following questions:-\n1. Whether upon the proper construction of the agreement with the City of Ottawa and the Village of Hintonburgh, the Statutes relating to the Ottawa Electric Railway Company, and the relevant provisions of the Railway Acts, the Board was right in disallowing the tariff of the company filed providing for payment of additional fare for carriage upon the extension from Holland Avenue notwithstanding that the Board has found as a fact that the Company did not require additional revenue.\n2 Also whether upon the proper construction of the said agreements and statutes for the purposes of computing the toll to be charged to passengers upon the said extension the point of commencement of the said extension should be considered to be at Holland Avenue or at the former westerly limit of the Village of Hintonburgh now the City of Ottawa.\n3. Has the Board the right to treat the company's operations as a whole and continue the existing tariff; or must the Board permit the filing of tariffs on a mileage basis covering services on the Britannia line without reference to the larger part of the system covered by municipal agreements?\nThese questions arise out of certain facts which the Board stated in their order granting leave.\nThe Board has found as a fact that the operation of the Britannia line, considered by itself, is not remunerative, but that the operation of the lines of the railway as a whole, including those within the City of Ottawa, are returning to the company adequate profits. The Board has found also that within the city limits on the street railway proper it could not reduce nor increase the rates because they have been the subject of an agreement with the city which has been approved and confirmed by Parliament (1894, ch. 86, s: 2) and that the Board's jurisdiction is bound by this special Act.\nThough the Railway Commissioners thought they could not change, alter or reduce the city rates, they decided, however, that the profits made by the company under its contract should be utilized to cover the deficit incurred in the operation of the Britannia extension and they ordered the company to operate at a loss its suburban line. This decision does not seem to me satisfactory. If the contract with the city has the effect asserted by the Board it is then binding to all intents and purposes and this part of the system should have been left alone and the profits or losses made in connection with it should not have been considered in the determination of the rates to be paid on some other part of the system. In other words the company's operations should not have been treated as a whole.\nWhen the company was incorporated in 1866 by the legislature of the Province of Canada (ch. 106) it was declared by sec. 8 that the directors would have the power to make by-laws touching\nthe fares to be received for passengers and freight transported over the railway or any part thereof.\nWe find also another provision in this statute of 1866 giving the right to the `company to lay their tracks on certain streets. These two provisions give more extensive powers than those which would be granted today, for Parliament would not give the power to a railway company to lay tracks on a particular street without the consent of the municipality, and as far as the rates are concerned Parliament would not to-day give a railway company the right to fix its rates without the control of the Railway Board. But in 1866 the street railways were new ventures which were treated most liberally by our legislators.\nThe appellant company had then the power under its charter to fix its rates without being bound to submit them to the Government and it could lay its tracks upon certain streets within the City of Ottawa.\nThe line of railway being a provincial line fell after Confederation under the legislative control of the Province of Ontario. But in 1892 the company being desirous to connect its railway with a line situate in another province, its undertaking was declared by the Federal Parliament under the provisions of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act to be a work for the general advantage of Canada (1892, ch. 53).\nIn 1893 the Railway Company made a contract with the City of Ottawa in which it was stipulated that it could run its cars upon some other streets than those mentioned in the Act of Incorporation of 1866 and the railway company agreed by clause 46 that\nno higher fare than five cents shall be charged for the conveyance of one passenger from one point to another on the said lines and branches thereof within the present city limits. * * *\nand that it could amalgamate with an electric street railway company then in existence under its present name. This contract was ratified and confirmed by the Canadian Parliament in 1894 and by the Special Act then passed it was declared that\nthe franchises, powers and privileges heretofore or hereby granted to or conferred upon the * * * company shall be exercised and enjoyed.\nunder its new company name (1894, s. 3. ch. 86) and by sec. 11 of the Act it was also declared that\nnothing in this Act shall in any respect impair any of the powers which the said * * * company shall have immediately prior to the date appointed for this Act to take effect.\nThis Act came into effect on the first of June, 1894. What is the effect of this legislation of 1894?\nFirst, it ratifies and confirms the agreement with the City of Ottawa by which a flat rate not exceeding five cents should be charged for the conveyance of a passenger in the day-time. It becomes a binding contract for the city, for the company and also for the public by which this fare of five cents would be considered a reasonable rate. This provision forms part of the special Act of the Railway Company.\nAt the same time Parliament in declaring that the powers possessed by the railway company would not be impaired, but on the contrary these powers would continue to be exercised and enjoyed by the company, confirms and ratifies the power that the company possessed by its Act of Incorporation of 1866 to fix its rates subject, of course, to the new rates fixed in its agreement with the city.\nIt seems to me that as a result of this legislation of 1894, the company was the only authority that could deal with the rates within the city of Ottawa provided it should not charge more than five cents. The general provisions of the Railway Act giving the Board the power to deal with the rates would certainly not affect the lines of the appellant company within the city limits since sec. 3 of ch. 37 of the R.S.C. declares that the Railway Act should be construed as incorporated with the special Act and where the provisions of the Railway Act and of the special Act relate to the same subject matter, the provisions of the special Act will override those of the general Act.\nThe Parliament of Canada having by the special Act of the appellant company dealt specifically with the tolls within the City of Ottawa, the subject matter of these tolls could not be considered by the Board of Railway Commissioners, whether they are profitable or not.\nIn 1899 the Parliament of Canada authorized the appellant company to build a suburban line outside of the city limits on private rights of way as an extension of its street railway. It was provided by this new Act that certain sections of the Railway Act were applicable\nand such of the other sections as are applicable, shall apply to the company with respect to the said extension.\nIt may be claimed that under the provisions of the Act of 1894 the tolls to be charged on the suburban or extension line shall be under the control of the Railway Company itself but the question of jurisdiction of the Board in that regard has not been raised, and both parties agree that the Board has jurisdiction to fix the rates on the suburban railway. But it is claimed on the part of the appellant that these rates on the extension line should be determined without regard to the profits or losses made on the city lines because the latter are not under the control of the Board.\nI fully concur with this view of the appellant. The special Act of 1894 fixed the rates for the city limits and these rates cannot be disturbed by the Board since they form part of an Act which overrides the general powers of the Board under the Railway Act. The Board having come to the conclusion that the rate on the Britannia line was not remunerative it was its duty to grant to the appellant company a remunerative rate on this part of the line and it should not have taken into consideration the profits made on some other part of the line which did not come under its jurisdiction.\nThe first question which is submitted to us involves questions of fact, which, of course, have to be dealt with exclusively by the Board. We have no authority to decide whether the rates asked for by the company are fair and just. So far, however, as this question No. 1 involves a question of law, it is covered by the answer I give below to the first part of the third question.\nWe are asked by the second question submitted to us to state whether the tolls to be charged on the extension line should be computed from Holland Avenue where the extension begins.\nIf the extension line was built on the streets with the consent of the city, special tolls could be charged only from the city limits, but the extension line is not built on the streets but on a private right of way. Then I would declare in answer to the second question that the point of commencement of the extension line should be considered for toll purposes to be at Holland Avenue. I would answer in the negative the first part of the third question and in the affirmative the second part of it. As a result of these answers the appellant's contentions are generally sustained.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an appeal by leave on three questions of law from the decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada disallowing a tariff of tolls filed by the appellant. The only point involved is as to the extension of the appellant's line from Holland Avenue in the former Village of Hinton-burgh, now a part of the City of Ottawa, to Britannia-on-the-Bay in the. Township of Nepean, but to answer the questions submitted it is necessary to consider the statutes and contracts under which the appellant carries on its operations.\nAll the facts found by the Board are stated in the order granting leave to appeal, as well as in the opinions given by the learned Chief Commissioner, and it will be sufficient to give briefly my reasons for the answers which I make to the questions submitted.\nThe appellant now stands in the place of two Ottawa street railway companies, the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company, incorporated in 1866, by an Act of the Province of Canada (29 & 30 Vict., ch. 106), and the Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company, incorporated in 1891 by letters patent of the Province of Ontario. These two companies amalgamated in 1894, forming what was termed the united company under the name of the Ottawa Electric Railway Company. Previously to the amalgamation, in 1892, an Act was passed by the Dominion Parliament (55 & 56 Vict., c. 53) declaring the undertaking of the Ottawa City Passenger Company to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, conserving its charter powers and authorizing it to extend its lines to the City of Hull, in the Province of Quebec. After the amalgamation an Act was passed by the Dominion Parliament, in 1894 (57 & 58 Victoria, ch. 86), ratifying the amalgamation, and confirming the contract entered into between the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa City , Passenger Railway Company and the Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company and the appellant was declared a body corporate subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. It is under this contract and this statute that the appellant carries on its operations in so far as the City of Ottawa, as it then was, is concerned.\nIt may be added that, in 1895, the appellant entered into a contract with the then village of Hintonburgh, adjoining Ottawa on the west, for the extension of its lines, under which the appellant extended its railway as far as Holland Avenue 'in- the said village. This contract has now expired.\nIn 1899, by the Dominion statute, 62 & 63 Vict., ch. 82, sec. 1, it was enacted that the appellant\nmay, as an extension of its present railway, construct and operate by means of electricity or other motive power, except steam, a double or single track, iron or steel railway, with the necessary side tracks, switches and turn-outs for the passage of cars, carriages and other vehicles adapted to the same, from some point on its present railway in the municipalities of Hintonburgh or Nepean in the County of Carleton, to some point at or near Bells Corners in the Township of Nepean.\nThe railway referred to in this enactment as the present railway of the appellant did not extend further west than Holland Avenue in the Village of Hinton-burgh and the extension from that point to Britannia-on-the-Bay, which I understand is to the east of Bells Corners, was constructed, not on a street or road, but on a private right of way acquired by the appellant.\nThe statute of 1899 declared that sections 90 to 172, both inclusive, of the Railway Act (then that of 1888) and such of the other sections of the said Act as are applicable shall apply to the appellant with respect to the said extension.\nThe appeal having been argued on November 17, 1919, this court, on December 22, 1919, ordered a re-argument on the following questions:\n(1) Has the Board of Railway Commissioners authority to reduce the Company's charge for passenger services within the City of Ottawa below the fare of 5 cents now charged for any such service?\n(2) If the first question is answered in the negative, has the Board power to require the Company to provide a service partly within and partly beyond the limits of the City of Ottawa for a charge not exceeding 5 cents?\n(3) In passing upon the questions raised upon this appeal, is the Court in any respect governed by section 325 of the Railway Act of 1919?\nThe re-argument took place on February 3 and 4, 1920, and was of a very exhaustive character.\nThe principal question discussed was as to the effect of clause 46 of the contract with the city of Ottawa which reads as follows:\nNo higher fare than five cents shall be charged for the conveyance of one passenger from one point to another on the said line and branches thereof within the present city limits, and for children under ten years of age no higher fare than three cents shall be charged, except between the hours of twelve o'clock midnight and five-thirty a.m.\nThe question was also discussed whether the Board of Railway Commissioners could reduce the maximum rate of five cents for passengers provided for the city of Ottawa.\nIt is argued that clause 46 is purely negative, that it in no way determines any toll or fare which the company may charge, that its objects was not to empower the company to exact tolls, the power to do so being conferred on the directors by the statute of 1866, but merely to restrict the exercise of this power, so that in any event the company could not demand more in the day time than five cents per adult passenger, and that in so far as the fixing of tolls and the control of the Board is concerned, the whole matter was left where it was before the contract, so that the directors can by by-law regulate the tolls to be charged, subject to the control of the Board, these tolls however not to exceed the maximum stipulated in clause 46 of the contract.\nI cannot so construe the contract. It is true that clause 46 is negative in form, such negative form being usual in agreements of this kind, and it is also true that the directors derive their power to regulate tolls from the charter the company obtained from the legislature. But the whole object, or at least the main object, of the contract was to oblige the company to operate a street railway in the City of Ottawa, the city receiving from the company an annual payment based on the mileage of the latter's lines, and for this service the company was to be remunerated by tolls charged for the carriage of passengers. So the fixing of a maximum fare by the contract necessarily implies that the company may charge any fare, provided it does not exceed the maximum, and within these limits, and during the life of the contract, the city cannot contend that the fare charged is not just and reasonable. This contract was ratified and confirmed by Parliament, the latter thus recognizing that the fixing of fares has been treated as a matter of agreement between the city and the company, and unquestionably the contract binds both the city as representing the public interested in the railway service and the company for the term of its duration, with the consequence that the power of interference of the Railway Board\u2014which can be exercised only on the ground that the tolls charged are unfair and unreasonable\u2014is excluded by the recognition by the city and by Parliament that up to the maximum stipulated by clauses 46 and following of the contract, any tolls charged by the company while the contract is in force are fair and reasonable.\nI am therefore of opinion that, properly construed, clause 46 of the contract authorizes the appellant to charge five cents per passenger during the hours mentioned, or any lower rate; and also, inasmuch as the contract was ratified and confirmed by Parliament and the ratification and confirmation was accompanied by the declaration (sec. 3) that the franchises, powers and privileges conferred on the original companies should be exercised and enjoyed by the appellant, subject to the terms, provisos and conditions contained in the agreement with Ottawa, my opinion is that the Board of Railway Commissioners cannot for the services contemplated in this agreement, reduce, no more than it can increase, the maximum rate provided by the contract. In coming to this conclusion, I also rely on section 3 of the Railway Act (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37) the statute of 1894 being a special Act overriding the provisions of the Railway Act in so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act.\nThis disposes of question 1, submitted by the court for re-argument, which question should be answered in the negative. I may add that this is also the opinion expressed by the learned Chief Commissioner.\nMr. Dennison argued however that the statute of 1894 is a private Act, which cannot prevail over a public Act like the Railway Act. This argument is answered by section 13 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 1) as well as by section 3 of the Railway Act, for surely the statute of 1894 is a special Act within the meaning of that section.\nQuestion 1 being answered in the negative, question 2 requires a reply, and I am of opinion that this reply must also be in the negative. In so far as service outside Ottawa is concerned, it cannot be considered as covered by the charge made for the City of Ottawa under the contract and statute - of 1894. By the City of Ottawa I mean the territory described in the contract.\nQuestion 3, in so far as this appeal is concerned, should be answered in the negative. This section was enacted subsequently to the order of the Board, but the power it confers on the Board, should the question. now come before it, possibly renders the discussion of this appeal of somewhat an academic interest. I may add that I do not wish to be understood as placing a construction on section 325 of the Railway Act of 1919.\nI now come to the questions submitted by the Board which are the subject of this appeal. And here I must note the following findings of fact of the Board in paragraphs (r) and (s) of the order allowing the appeal:\n(r) The Board has found, as a fact, that the operation of the Britannia extension considered by itself is not remunerative, and that if the operation of this line can be so considered it is clear that the company is entitled to an increased remuneration for the service it performs thereon.\n(s) The Board has also found that the operation of the lines of this railway as a whole including those within the City of Ottawa have returned or are returning to the company adequate profits. The company contends that inasmuch as the receipts from the lines within the City of Ottawa are the result of the operations of the company under a schedule of rates limited by the agreement with the city and confirmed by the Act of Parliament such favourable result is not a valid reason under the Railway Act for disallowing a tariff which will give the company power to collect additional fares upon the Britannia extension.\nI may add that the contracts with Ottawa and Hintonburg in nowise apply to the Britannia extension, which is governed by the statute of 1899. The respondents, however, contend that the contract with Hintonburg applied to the extension from Holland Avenue up to the Western limits of the former village, a distance of some 1900 feet. I think this contention cannot be sustained, because the contract with Hintonburg refers to a railway to be built on the streets of the village, and this extension was built, not on any street, but on the private right of way of the appellant from Holland Avenue to the West, and because the statute of 1899, which governs the extension, gives authority to the appellant to construct the said extension, from some point on the then present railway of the appellant in the village of Hintonburg and the most westerly point of the said railway was at Holland Avenue. The extension was constructed under the authority given by this statute.\nI cannot doubt, moreover, in special reference to paragraph (r) of the order granting leave to appeal, that the Board can consider by itself the operation of the Britannia extension from Holland Avenue to Britannia-on-the-Bay. The answers I would give to the questions submitted are contained in the formal judgment of the court, and in my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: F.

Act, the succession duty imposed being \"direct taxation within the province.\"\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench reversed. APPEAL From a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of Lemieux C. J. at the trial[1] and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLanctot K.C., Geoffrion K.C., and St Laurent K.C., for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C., and Gravel K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The questions raised in this appeal are no doubt most important ones relating, as they do, to the power of the several provinces of Canada to levy succession and legacy duties on personal or movable property locally or actually situate outside of the province but owned at the time of his death by one domiciled in the province.\nIn the present case the property on which or the transmission of which it was sought to recover the duties consisted of intangible property, namely shares in companies whose head offices were outside of the province of Quebec.\nThe Superior Court, acting upon and applying the well known rule mobilia sequuntur personam, gave judgment for the plaintiff es-qualit\u00e9 for the amount of the duties levied and payable under the statute.\nThis judgment was reversed on appeal by the Court of King's Bench in a majority judgment of that court which held that\nthe powers of the provincial legislature are not plenary but limited to \"direct taxation within the province\"; (British North America Act, section 92, s.s. 2); and that any attempt to levy a tax on property locally situate outside the province is not taxation within the province and is beyond the competence of the provincial legislature; that the taxation of transmissions within the province of property locally situate outside the province is an attempt to do indirectly that which the Legislature is forbidden to do directly and is in effect taxation of property within the province; and that the property and shares in question in this case are locally situate and have a situs outside the province.\nI agree with that part of this judgment which declares the powers of the provincial legislature not to be plenary but to be limited to \"direct taxation within the province.\" And I further agree that the taxation of \"transmissions within the province\" of property locally situate outside is an attempt to do indirectly that which the legislature cannot do directly, but I differ from the conclusion reached by the court that the property and shares in question in this case are locally situate and have a situs outside of the province and so beyond the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature in levying succession duties. The judgment now in appeal ignores the application of the rule making the domicile of the deceased owner, in questions arising out of succession and legacy duties, the test of the situs of the property and shares in question and adopts that which allots the situs to the location of the head office of the respective companies and so carries this intangible property outside of the province of Quebec.\nIn an appeal case from the province of Nova Scotia, recently decided in this court, Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia,[2] this court held that to determine the situs of personal property liable to succession duties on the death of the owner the rule to be applied is that expressed in the maxim nobilia sequuntur personam.\nThat judgment was the subject of much consideration and all the authorities bearing upon the question there in issue were carefully studied.\nI may say that owing to the grave and great importance of the question I have deemed it right in this appeal again to re-read all these authorities with the result that I am more firmly convinced than ever that, in construing the powers of \"direct taxation within the Province\" granted to provincial legislatures by our Constitutional Act, so far as the levying of succession and legacy duties are concerned, the true rule is that which existed alike in Great Britain as in the province of Quebec at the time such Act was passed, namely, that the domicile of the deceased owner of the property, and not its actual location at his death, determined which province could impose succession and legacy duties upon it. That rule is not applicable in the construct on of statutes levying probate, and estate duties or other taxes, but is confined to succession and legacy duties. The whole question was thoroughly thrashed out and determined in the House of Lords, in the appeal case of Winans v. Attorney General,[3] where the rules respecting succession and legacy duties and estate and probate duties are clearly laid down and the reasons for the application of the mobilia rule to the two classes of duties, succession and legacy, are given and for its non-application to estate and probate duties. I was greatly tempted to embody in these reasons of mine some extracts from the judgments of the noble lords who decided that case. They were unanimous in their reasons for the judgment they delivered in determining that so far as succession and legacy duties were concerned the domicile of the deceased owner, and not the local situation of the property, must be taken as the controlling factor. As Lord Atkinson said at page 32:\nIn each case (namely legacy or succession duty) the same principle brings constructively the property within or carries it without the reach of the taxing statutes of this realm according as the domicile of its deceased owner is without or within the realm,\nand, as he says on the same page,\nwide as is the language of the statute imposing them.\nIf that was the true rule applicable to ordinary imperial legislation, why should it not be applied to our constitutional Act? To my mind there is greater reason in so applying it to such a statute as ours creating a confederation of then existing and of future provinces in one dominion and delimiting their powers of legislation, than to ordinary statutes. The grounds upon which the rule of the domicile was first introduced are stated to be based upon convenience and international law. To my mind, such grounds afford the strongest reasons for construing our constitutional Act in accordance with the rule of the domicile so long and universally adopted.\nI venture in conclusion to reproduce a paragraph from my reasons for judgment in the case of Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia[4], above cited.\nThe broad ground on which that judgment rests is that the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam embodies the principle applicable to the succession of property of a domiciled decedent of any province of Canada for succession and legacy duties, as distinct from probate or estate duties; that in regard to those special succession and legacy duties the domicile of the decedent and not the physical or actual suits of the property must prevail; that this was the law in England decided in a series of cases before the \"British North America Act\" was passed and that the power of taxation within the province granted to the provinces in subsec. 2 of sec. 92 of that Act must be construed in accordance with the English law as it then was decided to be; that accordingly each province has the power of levying succession and legacy duties only upon the personal property passed by a domiciled decedent of the province, which either is locally situate therein physically or by virtue of the maxim \"mobilia sequuntur personam\" is drawn into such province by reason of the domicile; that while the Imperial Legislature itself or a colony possessing plenary powers of taxation could at any time overrule the principle embodied in the maxim (see Harding v. Commissioner of Stamps for Queensland),[5] the several provinces of Canada being limited in their powers cannot do so or by any enactment of their own enlarge or extend the powers of taxation granted to them by section 92 of the \"British North America Act;\" that any other construction of these powers of taxation would create endless, if not insuperable difficulties and would subject the same property to possible double liability to succession duty taxation, one in the province where the domiciled decedent owned the property and the other in which it was locally situated at his death. The result of my holding would be that the domicile of the decedent would be the test in Canada of the right to levy succession duties upon his personal property wherever it might be locally or physically situate and that such taxation could only be levied by the province of the domicile.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would allow this appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the Superior Court.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether or not 4 Geo. V., ch. 10, is, as regards the taxation imposed thereby, ultra vires of the Quebec legislature.\nThe first part of the section in question reads as follows:\nAll transmissions within the province, owing to the death of a person domiciled therein, of movable property locally situate outside the province at the time of such death, shall be liable to the following taxes calculated upon the value of the property so transmitted, after deducting debts and charges hereinafter mentioned.\nThis, contrary to the express language used, it is urged must be read as a taxation of property outside the province. I cannot so read it by any of the ordinary rules of interpretation and construction.\nIt is the transmission \"within the province\" by force of the laws enacted by the legislature of the province, in virtue of its exclusive jurisdiction under the British North America Act, sec. 92, over (item 13), \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province,\" which clearly is dealt with, and not something else constituted by the theories of interpreters as a basis for their interpretation of this section.\nThe legislature, which is given thus the power to destroy, if it see fit, can surely take a toll upon that which its creative power confers.\nIt has not gone so far as to attempt to destroy the supposed right of successions but has, on the contrary, conferred that right by virtue of its laws and imposes as a condition of the assertion of such right the tax measured by a scale set forth.\nWe are so accustomed to assuming, which is not the legal fact, that the property left by a deceased person becomes, as a matter of course, that of some survivor named in a will, or statute of distributions, or other law of succession, that we forget that both will and succession of another sort are but the creation of the legislative powers over property and civil rights.\nThe right to tax the transmission is, in the last analysis, but the right to define to whom the property of a person domiciled in a country shall pass at the death of him so domiciled.\nSuch an exercise of the power of taxation is as direct as anything can well be, and is certainly as direct as that imposed by the licensing of a brewer in Ontario to carry on his business, which was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Brewers & Malsters Association for Ontario v. The Attorney General for Ontario.[6]\nIt was argued therein that the licensing power was indirect and therefore ultra vires.\nIt has never been argued since, until recently, that the taxation of the exercise of any supposed right within a province was something so impalpable, indeed such a mere \"abstract concept\", that such taxation was unthinkable and hence impossible.\nIf that is a complete answer then I submit the imposition of a licensing tax as a preliminary condition to the carrying on of a business, or use of an automobile, for example, would seem to be thus left without any basis to rest upon.\nIf that sort of argument must prevail and be given effect to, then, of course, there can be nothing in the basis which I have suggested above for taxing transmission.\nI hope it will not be necessary in order to demonstrate the existence of the, fundamental basis of such a tax to repeal all laws of succession and begin anew.\nWe are asked to follow what has been properly designated by Mr. Justice Pelletier in the Court of King's Bench as only an obiter dictum in the case of Cotton v. The King.[7]\nThe judgment in that case proceeded upon the construction of the Act there in question, being by its terms confined to property within the province, \"and upon that ground alone it was held that the appeal must be allowed.\nThen their Lordships proceeded to deal with another ground which, with great deference I submit, was not necessary or necessarily relevant to the decision of the case.\nThe fact that at least the members of the majority in this court had each written judgments resting partly or wholly on the right and power to tax a transmission of property by force of the laws of the province, apparently received no consideration.\nFor my part, I had with tiresome, probably too tiresome, reiteration presented that view of the case in many ways in The King v. Cotton.[8]\nI, therefore, must refrain from enlarging upon it here, and refer the curious, (if any, in that regard), thereto and to the case of the Standard Trust Company v. The Treasurer of Manitoba,[9] wherein I presented the same views; I therein pointed out that if people could get property situated outside the province which had been that of a deceased person who had been domiciled at death in the province, without asking recognition of some provincial authority, or relying upon provincial law, then they might escape the tax. The case of Woodruff v. The Attorney General of Ontario[10] illustrates how it may be done by transactions inter vivos.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Cotton case,[11], above referred to, at page 195, contains the following paragraph.\nTo determine whether such a duty comes within the definition of direct taxation it is not only justifiable but obligatory to test it by examining ordinary cases which must arise under such legislation. Take, for instance, the case of movables such as bonds or shares in New York bequeathed to some person not domiciled in the province. There is no accepted principle in international law to the effect that nations should recognize or enforce the fiscal laws of foreign countries, and there is no doubt that in such a case the legatee would, on duly proving the execution of the will, obtain the possession and ownership of securities after satisfying the demands, if any, of the fiscal laws of New York relating thereto. How, then, would the Provincial Government obtain the payment of the succession duty? It could only be from someone who was not intended himself to bear the burden but to be recouped by someone else. Such an impost appears to their Lordships plainly to lie outside the definition of direct taxation accepted by this Board in previous cases.\nThis seems to suggest the possibility of the production of the will and proof of its execution before the court in New York entitling the legatee to get possession and ownership of the securities there.\nBut, with great respect, I submit that neither was there in that case, nor is there in the present case, any evidence demonstrating as a practical possibility, such a course as outlined.\nI am not prepared to say that, if it were proven that there was no other property than in the foreign state and that the laws of that state were of the unusual character which would permit such a proceeding in respect of the will of a testator domiciled in Canada, or other country outside of that state, such a mode of proceeding would be impossible.\nIf, however, as happens almost universally, the executor, in order to enable him to get possession of the goods, which were the property of his testator (and he can only get possession thereof by means of the law of that testator's domicile at death) is thereby under the necessity of applying to some authority created by a provincial legislature to give the necessary recognition of the right as defined by that law; or that law giving the right is so conditionally framed as to give rise to, any right only upon due compliance with the taxing terms imposed; then he is surely bound to submit to the terms thereby imposed, and pay such tax as required as the price of such recognition. I hold that is very direct taxation.\nThe scale of its distribution is but another term of the conditions which the state conferring the right or assenting to the necessary recognition of it sees fit to impose, and, like many other subsidiary things such as involved in the due and convenient means of the execution of the business in hand, has nothing to do with determining the question of the constitutional right to impose such a tax. There is nothing save the question of that right involved herein\nI may say that probably the fair construction to be put upon that above quoted is that it was not intended to assert, as matter of law, all that it seems at first blush to imply, but merely as an illustration of what is to be understood as direct taxation within the Act.\nAssuming that to be all intended then, for the reasons I have already assigned, it does not fit this case or meet the argument I present which induces me to hold that the tax in question is most direct taxation, and much more clearly so than was the tax imposed in question in the case of the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe.[12]\nI do not understand that the judgment in the latter case, or in any other (unless in the above-mentioned Cotton Case)[13] in which reference has been made to the definitions by John Stuart Mill of direct and indirect taxation, maintains them as a final determination of what must imperatively guide us in relation to any question arising from the taxing power conferred by the British North America Act upon the provincial legislatures. To impose such a test as obligatory and conclusive in all cases would, I submit, be productive of much mischief. Indeed the judgment in the said case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[14] expressly renounces at pages 581 and 582 any such test as obligatory.\nThe very able group of men who framed the British North America Act certainly had presented to their minds the actual case of customs dues, most frequently spoken of in those days as indirect taxation which then, apart from the others, such as revenues from wild lands, was the chief source of revenue on which the government of old Canada depended for carrying on.\nIn the scheme of government which they were concerned in framing, it was intended that all (except that in the special provisions of a temporary nature provided for in sections in ch. 8, under caption of Revenues, etc.) derivable from customs, should go to the dominion and be incidental to the regulation of trade and commerce, and that none of the provinces should be permitted to interfere therewith.\nTo render the chief indirect mode of taxation of the day an impossible source of revenue by way of taxation by any province, section 121 of the Act was enacted.\nIn contradistinction to that chief revenue derived from the customs dues, universally recognized as indirect taxation, the term \"direct taxation\" no doubt seemed appropriate for use in the section of the British North America Act in question herein, especially to designate other available taxation which, when thus confined within the province must of necessity be what in popular language would be presumed to be direct taxation. That the framers of the Act designed, except in that sense, to impose therein upon the provinces an obligatory observance of the doctrine enunciated by any philosophic writer on economic questions, however eminent, I most respectfully deny.\nTo hold otherwise would be to assume, for example, that a tax upon land which on close examination is generally an indirect tax according to the definition quoted, though in the popular sense it is taken to be a most direct tax, and is imposed in some of our provinces.\nYet, according to Mill's definition, it would, I submit, if imposed here by clear headed men, be one of an indirect character, for assuredly in this country, under the conditions existent therein, such a tax would fall within the meaning of the definition of indirect taxation which he gives as follows:\nA direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs.\nDespite my high regard for the author's work I doubt if the definition, resting upon intention and desire, is a very happy one. Some of the masters imposing a land tax might deem it direct and the clear headed see its beauty in its indirect character, though not always so.\nI need not elaborate, or show how (whether expected or not) the possessor of land so taxed would inevitably succeed in reaping a return of taxes so imposed from those renting from him, or how in the case of business properties the tax would become further distributable.\nSocial conditions in countries where the possession of land adds so much to the importance of the possessor that he may be averse to refrain from exacting the indemnity against such a tax and hence the definition, so far as relates to direct taxation, may be applicable to some lands; but here where land is held chiefly for what there is or is supposed to be in it, as a monetary investment, the result of imposing such a tax is certainly expected, by those possessing clear heads, to become so operative as to make a tax on land felt by him who as tenant occupies it for business purposes and thus impel him to distribute the burden over those buying his merchandise or manufactured goods.\nI am not to be taken as assuming that, instantly such a mode of taxation may be adopted, the then possessor of land could in every instance be able to collect reimbursement of the tax from someone else, but ultimately such would be the manifest result in almost every case.\nIn those cases where the terms of the lease, as not infrequently happens, provide that the tenant pay all taxes the tax in the case of business properties would be almost instantly distributable in the way I suggest.\nEven in the imposition of such an indirect tax as customs dues there are many instances as in its operation in the case of him importing for his own use where it becomes as direct as any tax can be and is not invariably distributable.\nAgain the taxation of land by municipalities had been and still is their chief source of revenue.\nAnother source of their revenue, especially in Ontario, then Upper Canada, was the taxation of commodities which is classed by political economists as indirect taxation. And so it continued for thirty-four years after the British North America Act had been enacted and then was changed as to form into the business tax.\nAs illustrative of the mode of thought, on the subject of taxation, prevalent in old Canada, at the time when the constitution of a joint authority for the general purposes of its government, coupled with a separate legislature for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, was first mooted, and there arose an agitation therefor which culminated some eight years later in the wider scheme presented by the British North America Act we may profitably turn to Upper Canada's Assessment Acts.\nThe Consolidated Assessment Act of Upper Canada (passed in A.D. 1859) in section 8 reads as follows:\n8.\u2014All municipal, local or direct taxes or rates, shall, when no other express provision has been made in this respect, be levied equally upon the whole ratable property, real and personal, of the Municipality or other locality according to the assessed value of such property, and not upon any one or more kinds of property in particular or in different proportions.\nThe substance thereof was taken from an Act passed six years earlier and the exact language used was adopted in section 8 of another new assessment Act passed in the year 1866.\nThe phrase \"local or direct taxes or rates\" evidently had no relation to theories of writers such as Mill on political economy, for each of these several Acts provided for the imposition of taxes on commodities which according to such theories would be indirect taxation.\nI present its use as a fair sample of the Canadian mode of thought in relation to the question of what must have been intended by the words \"direct taxation within the province\" as used in the item No. 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act, now to be applied herein.\nQuite true that basis of taxation to which I refer was only used for purposes of municipal revenue and not for those provincial revenues now in question. Yet its adoption when expressly designated as \"direct tax\" suggests how little the framers of this Act, knowing of and having regard to the possibilities of the future possible variation in such municipal assessment Acts by the legislatures they were calling into being, had regard to mere economic theories in using the term \"direct taxation within the province,\" for the master spirits among them had taken part in enacting these municipal assessment Acts.\nIs it conceivable that it was intended to give to the creations, prospectively in the power of provincial legislatures, as all municipal institutions were to be and to become liable to be in fact increased by them in importance, and taxing power, and assigned wider powers of taxation than each of such legislatures was being assigned for its own purposes? Or, is there to be applied the still more absurd alternative, that thenceforward all taxation, which political economists of the time deemed to be indirect, were to be eliminated from municipal taxation?\nI hold neither of these alternatives should be adopted as expressive of the intention of those using in the British North America Act the term \"direct taxation\" to limit the operation of the power so conferred, to the meaning of the word \"direct\" within the lines laid down by any political economist.\nThis is not the place for an essay on the subject.\nI merely desire to point out how dangerous it is to question the authority to tax land as a source of provincial revenue, and how thoroughly illusory must be the dependance, solely upon some of the best of philosophic theories in political economy, as the only or even chief means of interpreting the language used by very able and practical statesmen in framing this division of the powers of government.\nAnd let us never forget that the home parliament in that enactment was but trying to correctly appreciate and execute the purposes dictated by the then mode of Canadian thought, and that the expressions therein ought to be interpreted as far as possible in accord therewith.\nNo Canadian who lived through those strenuous times is likely ever to discard that point of view unless and until by due constitutional methods another has been substituted therefor.\nI admit that whilst rejecting such guiding lines in the sense of their being obligatory and finally determinative of any such question as raised herein, they may well be casually as it were, considered as an element proper for consideration along with other possible features, in the way which has been done in some of the cases in which they have been used or incidentally referred to.\nTo sum up: The purpose of the provision now in question was to assign to each province the direct use \"within the province\" of the taxing power, just as fully as possessed by any other autonomous state, in relation to all those subjects or subject matters assigned exclusively to the several provincial legislatures; saving the use of those taxing powers which were being assigned either expressly or by clear implication, exclusively to the Dominion Parliament. That parliament had, subject thereto, for any of its purposes, specifically assigned to it any mode or system of taxation.\nThe legislature of the province of Quebec is exercising or asserting the right to exercise just such powers as other states have, so far as relevant to the particular subject matters in question, assigned to its exclusive jurisdiction.\nWhether or not the power is justly asserted in some cases is not for us herein to determine or perhaps even to pass upon, for we cannot remedy the possible evil of double, or possibly double, taxation. Yet I may be permitted to suggest that an examination of the doctrine of private international law, by which the domicile of the deceased has been made the basis of so much, as grouped in the judgment of Lord Chancellor Westbury in Enohin v. Wylie,[15] it might and possibly may for the purpose of avoiding such an undesirable result, determine the line to be observed.\nSovereign states may be doing the very same thing. If this assertion of power on their part is unjust, the remedy is to be sought by other means than a denial of jurisdiction to our provinces, which would only help to perpetuate the evil by handing over to foreign states alone the determination of a just or unjust basis for settling such questions.\nI feel that I may profitably add a few words relative to Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia,[16] which seems, I respectfully submit, to have led to some confusion of thought herein.\nI may be permitted to point out that in some of the provincial legislation which has come before this court in the attempts to deal with the problem of succession duties, the legislature has failed to use such appropriate and comprehensive language as lies in the meaning of the words \"transmission within the province.\"\nHence in trying to get at their meaning resort has had to be had to the appropriate legal maxims and decisions and other statutes to see if when applied to the words used they can be held to comprehend such transmission as taxable by another name.\nIn like manner, by reason of probate not being always needed in Quebec, the illustrations drawn from decisions relative to the imposition of a probate duty, may not be so apt when applied to a Quebec case as in those arising elsewhere. Yet as perhaps the earliest and most apt illustration of what might be meant by taxation within a country and made the basis of a direct tax, decisions resting upon a probate duty are serviceable. The relative amount of the tax imposed does not affect the principles upon which it rests or the right to impose it.\nThe mere name seems to some persons to signify everything and hence whilst recognizing a probate tax as valid, they refuse to so recognize a tax resting upon same basis when called a succession or death duty tax.\nAs an instrument of government the British North America Act requires not only attention to the genesis of the frame thereof, and the growth of the law which it recognizes as existent, but also the application of a wider vision and more comprehensive and accurate grasp of what is thereby dealt with than is evident in such distinctions.\nIs it necessary to call this tax on transmission a probate duty in order to render it effective? And, to make it clear that it is a direct tax, for provincial revenue purposes, is it necessary to take all that which probate or other like courts deal with under the direct supervision of provincial government? I think not. Let us grasp the realities even though presented in the garb of what seem to the court below to be a mere \"abstract concept\" for the authority endowed with the taxing power is apt and entitled to be fertile in resources for the mode of its exercise.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal raises a question which in this court was supposed to be represented by the appeal in Cotton's Case[17]. The discussion was, in that case, without practical effect because it was held in the Privy Council that it all proceeded upon an erroneous hypothesis respecting the scope and meaning of the statute under consideration.\nThe question concerns the authority of the province when professing to exercise the legislative power conferred by section 92, paragraph 2, of the British North America Act, the power., that is to say, to\nmake laws in relation * * * direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes;\nand is whether by virtue of this authority the province can exact death duties payable in respect of the transmission of personal property upon the death of a person domiciled in the province, notwithstanding the fact that such personal property has a situs outside the boundaries of the province.\nIn Cotton's Case17 I gave my reasons for thinking that this question ought to be answered in the affirmative. I still think that those reasons afford adequate ground for that conclusion and I shall, of course, not repeat them now. But there are one or two points I should like to emphasize. One of these is the fact that by a practice almost uniform in common law jurisdictions\u2014a practice embodied in the law of Quebec by statute in 1866\u2014the law of the situs takes (as regards movables) its rules of succession from the law of the domicile; that this practice had for a long time been in force at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, and further that the existence of this practice is and has been generally held to be a sufficient ground for considering that the legislative authority of the domicile is acting within its proper sphere in levying duties upon the beneficial surplus of all movables, wherever situate, comprised in the succession.\nStrictly, of course, where the situs is outside the territory of the domicile, the law of the domicile has no operation within the territory of the situs and the beneficiary who acquires an interest in, e.g., a tangible chattel having such a situs acquires nothing directly through the law of the domicile; but it would not be difficult to furnish a list of authorities to show that lawyers as well as legislators have persistently refused to treat these matters from this point of view exclusively.\nEmphasis is sometimes laid upon the fact that the benefit is a benefit derived from the law of the domicile, see, e.g., Wallace v. Attorney General,[18] per Lord Cranworth. In other cases mobilia sequuntur personam and the ascription of a notional situs to the movable succession at the place of the domicile is treated as the ground of jurisdiction, as by Lord Herschell in Colquhoun v. Brooks[19].\nAnd the sum of the matter is admirably stated by Mr. Justice Homes in Bullen v. Wisconsin[20]. The power to tax is not limited in the same way as the power to affect the transfer of property. If this fund had passed by intestate succession it would be recognized that by the traditions of our law the property is regarded as a universitas the succession to which is incident to the succession to the persona of the deceased. As the States where the property is situated if governed by the common law, generally recognize the law of the domicile as determining the succession, it may be said that, in a practical sense at least, the law of the domicile is needed to establish the inheritance. Therefore the inheritance may be taxed at the place of domicile.\nThese principles have been considered to be validly applied in the fiscal legislation of a colony. Harding v. Queensland[21]; Re Tyson[22]; and there can be no doubt, I take it, that prior to confederation the old province of Canada or the province of Nova Scotia could have enacted such legislation validly.\nIn In re Tyson22 Griffith C.J., said at p. 37:\nIt was contended that such legislation was beyond the province of a colonial legislature. The powers of the legislature of this colony, at any rate, have only one fetter. That is to say, their legislation only extends within their boundaries; but as international law treats the personal property of persons who die domiciled in Queensland as being in Queensland, it is no transgression of that rule to pass an Act providing that duty shall be payable upon it. In another sense there is, of course, another fetter on the legislative powers of the colony, and that is that the colony may not make a law which is directly contrary to a law of the United Kingdom extending to Queensland. Beyond these two I do not know that there is any limit at all, and we have to enforce the laws as we find them.\nWhen this practice is considered and the words \"taxation within the province\" are read in the light of it, they must, I think, be held to be comprehensive enough to authorize the enactment of such legislation.\nThere is a broader ground upon which it might be forcibly contended that such enactments when passed by a Canadian province can be sustained. I think the words \"within the province\" are capable of being read as merely declaratory of the principle that legislation of a provincial legislature enacted under the power conferred is operative only within the territorial limits of the province. The words \"within the province\" it may be observed, are not to be found in the Quebec Resolutions; and these Resolutions may properly be looked at for the purpose of construing ambiguous expressions in the British North America Act; Eastman Co. v. Comptroller General[23].\nThe language of the paragraph in the Quebec Resolutions upon which the second paragraph of section 92 is founded assuredly affords no indication that the provinces who agreed to the resolutions had any intention of restricting the existing power of direct taxation or of accepting a grant of power of direct taxation more restricted than the existing power; the reservation of the right to levy certain export duties appears to have been a concession to one of the provinces which was eventually abandoned.\nSome support for this interpretation might perhaps be found in the Bonanza case.[24]. Their Lordships appear in that case to have held in effect that the office of the words \"with provincial objects\" in No. 11 of section 92 is not to delimit a class of companies (companies with provincial objects) for the incorporation of which the provinces are empowered to legislate; but that these words were inserted for the purpose of making it clear that companies incorporated in the execution of this power\u2014while within the province they enjoy such powers and rights as they possess by virtue of provincial legislation\u2014can acquire and enjoy powers and rights beyond the province only by force of extra-provincial recognition or grant; in other words, the phrase \"for provincial objects\" merely denotes that in legislating upon the subject \"incorporation of companies\" the province legislates for the province alone. See pp. 578, 583-4.\nIn this view subject to the condition implied in the words \"direct taxation\" and subject to any exemptions established by the Act the legislative power of the province in respect of taxation would only be limited by virtue of the principle that it is a power to make laws on that subject for the province and would not be less ample than the power possessed by the provinces before the Union.\nThe other question requiring from me a single observation concerns the topic of \"direct\" and \"indirect\" taxation. I think Lord Moulton's reasoning does not apply to the provisions of the statute as they now stand. The notary, executor, etc., is only responsible in his representative capacity and then only to the extent of the property of the defaulting beneficiary in his hands against which judgment can be executed. He is treated as custodian and compelled to deliver up the keys.\nIn In re Muir Estate[25] I stated too broadly as I now conceive it, the effect of the judgment in Cotton's Case[26] although the statute then discussed was within the principle of Cotton's case26 since the executor or administrator was made personally responsible in the first instance for the payment of the duty to the extent of the assets of the estate coming into his hands.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014Amongst other assets the estate of the late Honourable John Sharpies, who died domiciled in the province of Quebec, in July, 1913, comprised shares in various companies (most of them foreign) whose head offices were not in that province, of which the aggregate value was $213,039.75. The defendant Margaret Alleyn-Sharples is the universal legatee in ownership. The plaintiff, as collector of provincial revenue, sues to recover succession duties in respect of this property.\nArt. 1387 (b) of the R.S.Q., as enacted by 4 Geo. V., c. 10, reads as follows:\n1387 (b). All transmissions within the province, owing to the death of a person domiciled therein, of movable property locally situate outside the province at the time of such death, shall be liable to the following taxes calculated upon the value of the property so transmitted, after deducting debts and charges as hereinafter mentioned.\nIn the French text for the phrase \"locally situate\" we find the single word \"situ\u00e9s.\" The only possible question of construction arises on these words. If they do not exclude property having no physical situs, the intention to impose taxation on, or in respect of, the property in question is indisputable.\nIn Cotton v. The King,[27] the phrase \"locally situate\" is applied to such property (pp. 186 and 188). For convenience I refer to my discussion of it in the same case.[28] In the case of tangible property it no doubt means \"physically situate;\" in the case of intangible property I regard it as intended to denote the attribute of locality which such property possesses according to some recognized rule of law, such as those applied in Lovitt's case[29] and in Smith v. Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia[30] respectively.\nOf the assets in question 14 shares of the capital stock of the Northern Crown Bank, valued at $1,190, and 1,227 shares of the capital stock of the Union Bank of Canada, valued at $169,326, would, according to the opinion of the majority of this Court in the Smith Case[31] (Davies C.J., Idington and Brodeur JJ; the Chief Justice, however, acceding to this view only if \"the domicile of the decedent is (not) the determining factor\") have their situs at the place in the province of Quebec where the same were registered and transferable, which would render them subject to taxation under Art. 1375 of the R.S.Q., as enacted by 4 Geo. V., c. 9, unless excluded from its operation by the restrictive description \"actually situate\"\u2014r\u00e9ellement situ\u00e9\"\u2014of Art. 1376 of the R.S.Q.\nThe situs of the rest of the property in question, however, is admittedly foreign, unless the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam should be deemed to give it a situs in Quebec for purposes of succession duty taxation. Indeed the plaintiff makes no claim that any of the property in question falls within Art. 1375 R.S.Q. On the contrary, it is common ground that, if taxable at all, it is under Art. 1387 (b) R.S.Q., and as\nmovable property locally situate outside the province.\nWe are therefore once more confronted with the question whether the imposition of succession duties in respect of such property is within provincial legislative jurisdiction\u2014is \"direct taxation within the province.\"\nIn the present Quebec statutes some features found by the Judicial Committee in the former legislation and held in the Cotton Case[32] to render it obnoxious as imposing indirect taxation have been carefully eliminated, or, to speak perhaps with greater precision, their existence has been expressly negatived. (Arts. 1387 (g) and 1380 R.S.Q.) For the present the views enunciated by their Lordships as to the indirectness of the taxation imposed by the former legislation must be loyally accepted; but, may I say with deference, it will not occasion surprise in this country if, whenever it may again become necessary to delimit the federal and provincial legislative jurisdiction in this field, some of them, based on what, with respect, seems to have been a misconception of the provisions of the Quebec statutes, may be dealt with by their Lordships, somewhat in the same way as they dealt in Cotton's Case[33] with the reasoning of Lord Collins in Woodruff v. Attorney General for Ontario.[34] The taxation here in question is in my opinion direct. When not paid by the beneficiary intended ultimately to bear it, the tax is payable only out of property to which he is intitled in the hands of the executor, trustee or administrator. It falls within Mill's classic definition, the applicability of which to the phrase \"direct taxation\" in s. 92 of the British North America Act their. Lordships have said \"is no longer open to discussion.\" P. 193.\nI adhere to the opinion that the words \"within the province\" in s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act were intended to be restrictive of the right of taxation of each provincial legislature so as to prevent its trenching on the like exclusive right of the legislature of any sister province or upon the domain of a foreign state, just as the word \"direct\" was designed to preserve intact for the Dominion Parliament the field of indirect taxation. One purpose of the restriction imposed by the words \"within the province\" was, in my opinion, to preclude identical taxation of the same subject in two or more provinces; and this limitation of legislative power cannot be frustrated by any attempt to change the situs of property by declaratory legislation, or to disguise the nature of the taxation really imposed by giving to it a name not properly descriptive of it, or by a disclaimer of an intention to exceed statutory powers.\nPersonally I remain of the opinion which prevailed in Woodruff's Case,[35] that imposing the tax on the transmission of movables \"situate outside the province\"\u2014\"on the devolution or succession,\" as Finlay A.G., there put it arguendo,\ninvolves the very thing which the legislature has forbidden to the province\u2014taxation of property not within the province (p. 513),\nthat the real incidence of the tax rather than the form given it must be considered in determining whether it is or is not taxation within the province and that s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act should be taken to authorize taxation\nonly where the real subject of the tax\u2014whether person, business or property\u2014is within the province.\n\u2014and I cannot add anything to the statement which I made in the Cotton Case[36] of the arguments that seem to me to warrant those views.\nIn the recent case of Smith v. Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia[37] without explicitly saying so I deferred to what I conceived to be the condemnation of them implied in the Judicial Committee's comment in Cotton's Case[38] on the Woodruff Case35 and in the fact that the judgment of their Lordships proceeded on the ground of indirect taxation, rather than on the foreign situs of the property which was most strongly pressed by the appellants. I had perhaps failed in the Standard Trusts Co. v. Treasurer of Manitoba[39] to give to this virtual overruling of Woodruff's Case[40] so far as it affected successions the full weight to which further consideration led me to think it entitled. Thus accepting what I conceived to be the opinion of the Judicial Committee that provincial legislation imposing succession duties on foreign movables of a domiciled decedent was not ultra vires, I endeavoured in Smith's Case[41] to state what, from my point of view, were the most plausible arguments in support of the applicability of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam in justification of such legislation.\nIn the present case the transmission itself admittedly took place under and by virtue of Quebec law and in that sense \"within the province.\" If the transmission may be regarded as the subject thereof, the taxation would clearly be within provincial legislative jurisdiction. There is no doubt a body of authority, much of it conveniently collected in a recent American publication cited by the appellant, Gleason & Otis on \"Inheritance Taxation,\" in favour of that view. But, unless Lambe v. Manuel,[42] may be so considered (I think it cannot) no English authority has been cited for it.\nBut whether the tax now in question should be regarded as imposed on the transmission itself or on the property on the occasion of its transmission, it is unquestionably a succession duty in the strict sense of that term as understood in England. This Court has so recently held in Smith v. Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia,[43] that it is competent for a provincial legislature to impose such duties on the movables of a domiciled decedent situate outside the province that further examination of that question here seems futile\u2014if, indeed, it is not entirely precluded. Following that decision therefore, I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and would restore the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal by the collector of provincial revenue for the district of Quebec, in the province of Quebec, from the Judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side), which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court (Lemieux C.J.)[44] and dismissed the action which the appellant had taken against the respondents in recovery of $14,828.46, for succession duties and interest alleged to be due on shares of the aggregate value of $213,039.75 in a large number of companies whose head offices are outside the province of Quebec. The respondent, Mrs. Sharpies, is sued as well personally as in her quality of testamentary executrix of the late Honourable John Sharpies, in his lifetime of the city of Quebec, and the other respondents are sued as executors of the said Honourable John Sharpies, and the prayer is that Mrs. Sharpies, personally, be condemned to pay the said sum, and that the judgment be declared executory against all the respondents, in their quality of executors, on the property or moneys in their possession belonging to the beneficiaries of the succession of the late Mr. Sharpies. The Superior Court,[45] applying the rule mobilia sequuntur personam gave judgment to the plaintiff, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of King's Bench for the following grounds, the Chief Justice and Carroll J. dissenting:\nConsidering that the powers of the provincial legislature are not plenary but limited to \"direct taxation within the province\" (British North America Act, section 92, s.s. 2), and that any attempt to levy a tax on property locally situate outside the province is not \"taxation within the province\" and is beyond the competence of the provincial legislature.\nConsidering that the taxation of transmissions within the province of property locally situate outside the province is an attempt to do indirectly that which the legislature is forbidden to do directly and is in effect taxation of property not within the province.\nConsidering that the property and shares in question in this case are locally situate and have a situs outside the province.\nConsidering that there is error in the judgment appealed from, to wit, the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in and for the District of Quebec herein rendered on the twenty-second day of November, 1918, maintaining the action of the Respondent es-qualit\u00e9:\nThe Court doth maintain the appeal, doth reverse the said judgment appealed from, and now giving the judgment which the Superior Court ought to have pronounced, doth declare the statute 4 Geo. V., ch. 10, upon which the present action is founded, to have been and to be ultra vires of the Quebec legislature and doth dismiss the action of the respondent es-qualit\u00e9 with costs in the Superior Court and costs of the appeal against the respondent es-qualit\u00e9 in favour of the Appellants.\nThe legislation in question is contained in three statutes passed in 1914 by, the Quebec legislature, being chapters 9, 10 and 11 of 4 Geo. V.\nChapter 9 imposes succession duty on property movable and immovable, the ownership, usufruct or enjoyment whereof is transmitted owing to death, and it defines \"property\" as including\nall property, movable or immovable actually situate (in the French version, \"r\u00e9ellement situ\u00e9\") within the province, and all debts which were owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or are payable by reason of his death, and which are either payable in the province, or are due by a debtor domiciled therein; the whole whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province.\nChapter 10 imposes succession duty upon\nall transmissions within the province, owing to the death of a person domiciled therein, of movable property locally situate outside the province (in the French version \"biens meubles situ\u00e9s en dehors de la province\") at the time of such death.\nIt also states that\nall debts owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or which are payable by reason of his death, and which at the time of such death were payable outside the province, are included in the movable property taxable in virtue of this section.\nChapter 11 is a declaratory statute, the object of which is to declare that these taxes are direct taxes within the meaning of section 92 of the British North America Act. I do not think that this statute need be further considered, for if these taxes are really indirect taxes, the express declaration that they are direct would not change their nature.\nTaking now the scheme of taxation adopted by the Quebec legislature as a whole, it taxes:\u2014\n1. All property, movable and immovable actually situate (\"tout bien mobilier ou immobilier r\u00e9ellement situ\u00e9\") within the province, the ownership, usufruct or enjoyment whereof is transmitted owing to death, and all debts which were owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or are payable by reason of his death, and which are either payable in the province, or are due by a debtor domiciled therein, the whole whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province (chapter 9);\n2. All transmissions within the province, owing to the death of a person domiciled therein, of movable property locally situate outside the province at the time of such death, including all debts owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or which are payable by reason of his death, and which at the time of such death were payable outside the province (chapter 10).\nIt is of course obvious that the rule mobilia sequuntur personam\u2014which is laid down as a general rule subject to certain exceptions by Article 6 of the Quebec Civil Code\u2014may be excluded by the use of apt and clear words in a statute for the purpose (per Lord Robson in Rex v. Lovitt[46]. I cannot help thinking that this has been done by these two statutes, the first of which taxes property, movable and immovable, actually situate within the province, and the second imposes the tax on the transmission within the province of movable property locally situate outside the province. In other words, the actual or local situation of movable property, rather than its situation by virtue of the rule mobilia sequuntur personam, is considered for the purpose of succession duties. This would suffice to distinguish this case from Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer for Nova Scotia.[47]\nThe Court of King's Bench holds that the province cannot tax property situate outside the province, and that to tax the transmission within the province of property locally situate outside is an attempt to do indirectly that which the legislature is forbidden to do directly and in effect is taxation of property not within the province.\nThis reasoning involves a major and a minor proposition. The major proposition, that the province cannot tax property outside the province, is in my opinion self evident. The minor proposition that the province cannot tax the transmission within the province, by succession, of property locally situate outside, and that such taxation is equivalent to taxing the property itself, appears to me very questionable. The transmission is not something that cannot be distinguished from the property transmitted. It is a right, derived under the law of the province, to succeed to property left by a testator or an intestate, and the province which grants this right can require the payment of a tax as a condition of its grant, such tax being a tax imposed not on the property itself but on the right to succeed to it.\nI may add that the taxing of the transmission, as distinguished from a tax imposed upon the property transmitted, has been the outstanding feature of all the Quebec Succession Duty statutes since 1902, chapter 9 of the statutes of 1914 being the first statute to tax the property transmitted, while in chapter 10 we find the familiar form of a tax imposed upon the transmission. The Quebec civil code moreover distinguishes between the transmission and the property transmitted, the term succession being supplied to either (Art. 596 C.C.) and there is no doubt in my mind that they are entirely distinguishable.\nThe only other observation I desire to make on this branch of the case is that the Quebec statutes differ essentially from the Manitoba Succession Duty law, considered by this court in Standard Trust Co. v. Treasurer of the Province of Manitoba.[48] This Manitoba statute (4 & 6 Ed. VII, ch. 45, sec. 4) expressly renders subject to succession duty movable property locally situate outside the province when the owner was domiciled in the province at the time of his death. Had the Quebec statute done the same, I would have had very grave doubts as to its validity.\nThe only other question discussed at the argument\u2014but on this point the formal judgment of the Court of King's Bench expresses no opinion, although it is referred to in the opinions of the learned judges\u2014is whether this tax is an indirect one and therefore beyond the powers of the legislature.\nTheir Lordships of the Privy Council in Cotton v. the King,[49] so held with regard to the Quebec Succession Duty Act in force before the enactment of the statutes of 1914, and if these statutes do not differ essentially from the former Act, the question of their validity must be answered in conformity with the judgment of the Judicial Committee. The test of an indirect tax, derived from the definition of John Stuart Mill, was also authoritatively adopted by their Lordships and is whether the tax in question\nis demanded from one person in the expectation that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another; such as the excise or customs.\nAfter a careful examination of the Quebec statutes enacted in 1914, my opinion is that the only person personally liable to pay the succession duty imposed upon a legacy is the person in whose favour such legacy is made. The executor when called on to pay such tax\u2014and he can be required to pay it only when he is in possession of the property bequeathed, or, in other terms, a judgment rendered against the executor can be executed against such property only\u2014is sued merely in his representative capacity, and in no case can it be truly said that the succession duty is demanded from the executor in the expectation that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another, that is to say at the expense of the legatee. As I construe these statutes, the executor can never be required, representatively or otherwise, to pay succession duty on the transmission of property or money which has never come into his possession. The tax is personally due by the beneficiaries, not collectively but distributively, that is to say each beneficiary is personally liable for the tax due in respect of the property bequeathed to him and for no more. It may well be, in the case of a special bequest of property locally situate outside the province, when made to a person not domiciled in Quebec, that the government may be unable to collect the tax, for the beneficiary possibly may obtain possession from the local courts, without reference to any Quebec authority, and no judgment can be enforced against the executor except on the property bequeathed. The other beneficiaries are liable for the tax imposed on their shares only, and the executor is never held except when in possession of the property. All this shows that the present law so differs from the former statute as to render it impossible to come to the conclusion that the tax is an indirect one, and therefore I am respectfully of the opinion that the decision in Cotton v. The King[50] is clearly distinguishable.\nWith the evil of double taxation a court of law has no powers of interference. It is a matter for the consideration of the legislatures themselves, which may so exercise their powers of concurrent taxation as to render this country an unattractive one for foreign investors. But of course the remedy is in their hands and not in ours.\nIn my opinion, for the reasons I have stated, the appeals should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of King's Bench set aside and the judgment of the Superior Court restored, with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis S.

Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014English decisions should not be cited as authorities in cases from the Province of Quebec which do not depend upon doctrines derived from English law.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (18 Ex. C.R. 461) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAppeal from the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the petition of right of the appellant.\nThe appellant sold hay to one McDonnell and sued him for the recovery of the purchase price. During the trial, McDonnell declared that he had bought the hay on behalf of the Imperial Government. The appellant obtained judgment against McDonnell. Later on the appellant discovered sufficient facts to establish that McDonnell had bought the hay as agent of the Crown on behalf of the Dominion of Canada. The appellant then filed a petition of right against the Crown before the Exchequer Court of Canada, which was dismissed.\nE. F. Surveyer K.C. and L. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellant.\nF. J. Laverty K.C. and O. Gagnon for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014I agree with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Audette in the Exchequer Court; and all the more so that instead of adopting, for the first time, a novel rule to be peculiar to Quebec we should, so far as we can, when applying relevant law which in its substance is identical with that of the other provinces wherein the law is founded on and is English law, aim at a degree of uniformity in its administration instead of deciding in a way that will tend to produce confusion and unjustifiable expense.\nFor obvious reasons I feel we should not only abstain from invading, but conform to, the settled jurisprudence of Quebec.\nIn this case there is no settled jurisprudence of Quebec in regard to the question raised by this appeal.\nAnd, so far as the principles applicable thereto are concerned, the rule adopted in English decisions is in accord with reason and justice, as well as that practical business sense which always tends to minimize the operation of the purely litigious spirit.\nMoreover there appears in the statement of defence a pretty clear statement from which I infer that the transactions in question were, if at all, entered into by the Dominion of Canada, as the agent of the Imperial Government, which would constitute the respondent itself as mere agent. The allegation I admit might have been made more complete in that regard.\nAre we entitled to so decide in such a way the legal novelty submitted, that hereafter it may be said this court has laid down as law, that no matter how numerous the principals or chain of agents concerned in bringing about a contract, a litigious third party may select one after another of such agents and principals and sue to judgment unless and until one or other of numerous judgments so recovered has been satisfied, and that with costs? I submit we should not run any such risks but accept that jurisprudence, even if not absolutely binding, which manifestly in principle violates nothing in law or justice.\nFor the foregoing reasons and those assigned by the learned judge appealed from, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The sole legal question raised by the defence in this action which might properly be disposed of before the trial, under R. 126 of the Exchequer Court, is whether under the Civil Code of Quebec the mere recovery in the courts of that province of judgment on a contract against an agent, who had entered into it in his own name, debars the plaintiff's right of recovery against the principal. Following Priestly v. Fernie,[2] and Kendall v. Hamilton,[3] Mr. Justice Audette has held that it does. With deference, in applying these authorities the learned judge would seem to have attributed to the Quebec judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the agent, McDonnell, consequences dependent in English law upon views held with regard to the nature of the liability of the principal and the agent in such cases and the effect of a judgment upon the contract sued upon which do not obtain in the Quebec system of jurisprudence. The reasons for his acceptance of these English decisions as authority on this question of the civil law of Quebec appear in the following paragraph of his judgment:\nI was, at the argument, referred to no jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec upon the subject in question, and after research I have been unable to find any. In the absence of the same I take it, as. Arts. 1716 and 1727 are different from the Code Napoleon and are borrowed from both Pothier and the English law, that general principles of the English law governing such doctrine should also be adopted in questions flowing from such doctrines and which are a sequence from the same, as Strong J. seems to have found in the case above mentioned.\nIn the case in this court to which the learned judge alludes V. Hudon Cotton Co. v. Canada Shipping Co.[4] Mr. Justice Strong alone expressed the view\u2014already taken by the majority in the court of King's Bench, Dorion C.J. and Ramsay J. dissenting[5], that the liability of the principal, even where he is undisclosed and the agent contracts in his own name, created by Art. 1727 C.C., and put beyond controversy by the concluding clause of Art. 1716 C.C., imports a correlative or reciprocal right on his part to sue upon the contract as recognized in English commercial law. Fournier J. (p. 405) and Henry J. (p. 414) were of the contrary opinion. Fournier J. (p. 409) notes, as did Dorion C. J. at page 362, that while Pothier explicitly asserts the right of action of the third party against the principal, \"he gives none to the principal against the third party\". \"Obligations\", Nos. 82, 447 and 448; \"Mandat\", No. 88. The other three members of this court (Ritchie C. J., Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.), dismissed the appeal on what they deemed an admission of liability in the proceedings, expressing no views on the point dealt with by Mr. Justice Strong.\nBut, with respect, I find nothing in that learned judge's opinion to sustain the sweeping inference drawn by Mr. Justice Audette in the passage I have quoted. On the contrary, alluding to Pothier as the source of the doctrine embodied in Arts. 1727 and 1716 of the Quebec Civil Code, he merely notes, en passant, that in the particular matter with which he is dealing\u2014the principal's right to enforce the contract, which in his opinion should \"by an extensive construction\" be held to be involved\u2014the law of Quebec, as he views it, corresponds with English rather than with modern French law. In the latter notwithstanding that the language of Art. 1998 C.N. seems quite as comprehensive as that of Art. 1727 C.C., a contract made by an agent in his own name imposes no direct liability on his principal (28 Laurent No. 62). The commissioners themselves in much the same way signalize the fact that Pothier's view upon the liability of the principal coincides with English, Scotch and American law. 6th Rep. 312. To each comment\u2014that of Strong J. and that of the commissioners\u2014the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius would not seem inapplicable.\nIn English law the liability of the principal and the agent in a case such as that at bar is alternative. The contract being one and entire creates but a single debt (though not a single cause of action as in the case of a joint liability since, in addition to the facts constituting the cause of action against the agent, his authority from the principal must be proved as part of the cause of action against the latter, Cooke v. Gill,[6] on which but one of the two may be held liable as principal. Yet the agent, having contracted in his own name, is bound as a principal; and the undisclosed principal is likewise bound because the agent in fact acted by his authority. But both cannot be liable as principals simultaneously and jointly. Imposing the status of principal on the former involves according that of agent to the latter. The agent as such is not liable. Correlatively, treating the latter as principal involves a rejection of his agency, and by implication a relinquishment of any claim against the real principal. Either may be pursued; not both.\nThe conclusive operation of a judgment against the agent to debar the recourse against the principal, though often referred to\u2014and with high authority\u2014as the consequence of an irrevocable election of remedies (1 Hals L. of E. No. 445; 7 Ibid. No. 937; Morel Bros. & Co. v. Westmoreland,)[7] depends rather upon the doctrine of English law that the single debt arising out of the contract has been merged in the judgment\u2014transit in rem judicatam\u2014as Lord Cairns points out in Kendall v. Hamilton,[8], and Vaughan-Williams L. J., in Hammond v. Schofield,[9] See too, Sullivan v. Sullivan,[10] and 13 Hals. L. of E. No. 470 in fine. Although the application of the doctrine of election is easily defensible where, as here, the principal is known as such to the plain- tiff before he takes his judgment against the agent, it is not so where that knowledge is lacking; and yet the judgment is then equally conclusive in its effect. Kendall v. Hamilton[11]. A man can scarcely be held to have elected between two remedies of the existence of one of which he is in fact ignorant and is not presumed in law to be cognizant. The fact that, if the judgment against the agent is subsequently set aside as the result of an adjudication that it was erroneously pronounced (Partington v. Hawthorn),[12] the alternative right to sue the principal revives (although the same result apparently does not ensue if the judgment be vacated merely by consent, Hammond v. Schofield,[13] per Wills, J.; Cross & Co. v. Matthews,[14] I Hals. L. of E. p. 209, note p.) presents another difficulty, since a valid election between remedies once made is irreversible. Scarfe v. Jardine,[15]. On the other hand, while, at first blush, such a decision as that of the Court of Appeal in French v. Howie,[16] where a judgment for part of the plaintiff's claim entered against the agent on admissions, under a special rule of a court allowing that to be done without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed with the action to recover the balance of his claim, was held to debar a suit against the principal, is perhaps more easily upheld under the doctrine of election than under that of merger, it is equally maintainable on the principle that there can be but one judgment for a single and entire debt, to which the entry of a judgment for part of a claim permitted by the rule of court is merely a special exception statutory in its nature. But the conclusive character of a judgment against one of the two parties alternatively liable for a single debt, which likewise extends to the case of joint liability as understood in English law (King v. Hoare,[17] approved in Kendall v. Hamilton,[18]) is not found in a judgment against one of two debtors who are liable severally, or jointly and severally, since here there are two debts and the judgment on one is no bar to an action on the other, Lechmere v. Fletcher,[19] Isaacs & Son v. Salbstein,[20]. Nothing but satisfaction or release will extinguish a debt which has not passed into judgment.\nNow under the Quebec Civil Code the principal and the agent who has contracted in his own name seem to be severally liable as an English lawyer understands that phrase ; and the merger implied in the maxim transit in rein judicatam, as understood in English law, has no application in the legal system of that province.\nArts. 1727 and 1716 C.C. read as follows:\u2014\n1727.\u2014The mandator is bound in favour of third persons for all the acts of his mandatory, done in execution and within the powers of the mandate, except in the case provided for in Art. 1738 of this title, and the cases wherein by agreement or the usage of trade the latter alone is bound.\n1716.\u2014A mandatory who acts in his own name is liable to the third party with whom he contracts, without prejudice to the rights of the latter against the mandator also.\nI agree with Mr. Surveyer's contention that the concluding word, \"also\", of Art. 1716 C.C. is more consistent with the idea of a dual recourse successive or simultaneous, than with a single optional recourse. The purpose seems to be to create cumulative obligations for the fulfilment of a single contract, which can be discharged only by satisfaction, release or the expiry of a period of limitation.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Art, 1108 C.C. found under the heading \"Debtors jointly and severally obliged\", which reads as follows:\u2014\nLegal proceedings taken against one of the co-debtors do not prevent the creditor from taking similar proceedings against the others.\nBut the undisclosed principal and his agent would seem not to be joint and several debtors within the group of Articles 1103-1120 C.C. They satisfy the definition contained in Art. 1103 C.C. The fact that they are \"obliged differently\" does not exclude them. The difficulty presented by the inconsistency of the obligation of indemnification legally inherent in their relationship (Art. 1720 C.C.) with Arts. 1117-8 C.C. appears to be met by Art. 1120 C.C. But the obligation to the creditor is not strictly a joint obligation. That of the agent arises directly ex contractu. That of the principal is imposed on him by law as a consequence of his mandate to the agent. Hence Pothier's designation of it as \"accessorial\". I therefore doubt the direct applicability of Art. 1108 C.C.; but of that of the principle which it embodies\u2014quite unnecessarily, says Langelier (Vol. IV, p. 33)\u2014I have no doubt.\nThe commissioners in referring to Art. 1727 C.C. (6th Rep. p. 12) expressly state that that article is based on Pothier's statement of the mandator's liability where the agent has contracted in his own name and without disclosing the relationship and reject Troplong's view to the contrary, adding that (in this respect) \"English, Scotch and American Law coincides\" with Pothier's view. See top p. 87 of the text, s. II Art. 23. In dealing with Art. 1716 C.C., at p. 10 of the same report, the commissioners note that it has no counter part in the Code Napoleon and \"that the group of which it is a member declare (s) useful rules of undoubted authority in our law\"\u2014\"contiennent des r\u00e9gies utiles qui ne souffrent aucune difficult\u00e9 dans notre droit\" (sec. II.) At. p. 85, s. II Art. 14, the authorities on which the article is based are cited as follows:\u2014\nPothier, Mandat. No. 88; Paley, Prin. & Agent, Nos. 371, 372; Storey, Agency, 266, 163, 269; Troplong, Mandat, Nos. 522 et seq., contra, as to last clause.\nPaley is cited for the first clause of the article as is also Story, par. 163 and Troplong. The passage from Pothier, however, and par. 266 and the concluding words of par. 269 of Story bear on the question immediately under consideration and leave little room for doubt that the liability intended to be created was a several liability of both the principal and the agent as co-debtors (each being \"obliged to the same thing in such manner that each of them singly may be compelled to the performance of the whole obligation and that the performance by one discharges the other towards the creditor\", (Art. 1103 C.C.) and to that extent having the characteristics of the joint and several liability of the civil code but neither the alternative nor the joint liability of the English law.\nPothier (Mandat, No. 88) is in the following terms:\nQuoique ce soit pour l'affaire qui fait l'objet du mandat, et en se renfermant dans les bornes du mandat, que le mandataire a fait quelques contrats avec des tiers: lorsque c'est en son propre nom qu'il a contract\u00e9, et non pas en sa seule qualit\u00e9 de mandataire d'un tel, procureur ou fond\u00e9 de procuration d'un tel, c'est, en ce cas, le mandataire qui s'oblige envers ceux avec lesquels il a contract\u00e9; c'est lui se rend leur d\u00e9biteur principal. Mais il oblige conjointement avec lui son mandant pour l'affaire duquel il parait que le contrat se fait; le mandant en ce cas, est cens\u00e9 acc\u00e9der \u00e0 toutes les obligations que le mandataire contracte pour son affaire; et de cette obligation accessoire du mandant nait une obligation qu'on appelle utilis institoria, qu'ont contre le mandant ceux avec lesquels le mandataire a contract\u00e9 pour l'affaire du mandant.\nAnd Story (On Agency No. 266):\nIn the next place, a person contracting as agent will be personally responsible, where, at the time of making the contract, he does not disclose the fact of his agency; but he treats with the other party as being himself the principal; for, in such a case, it follows irresistibly, that credit is given to him on account of the contract. Thus, if a factor or broker, or other agent, buy goods in his own name for his principal, he will be responsible to the seller therefor in every case where his agency is not disclosed. But we are not therefore to infer that the principal may not also, when he is afterwards discovered, be liable for the payment of the price of the same goods; for, in many cases of this sort, as we shall hereafter abundantly see, the principal and the agent may both be severally liable upon the same contract.\nThe concluding sentence of par. 269 of Story on Agency reads as follows:\u2014\nBut it by no means is to be taken as a natural or necessary conclusion, that, because the agent is personally bound, therefore the principal is exonerated; for we shall presently see that both may in many cases be equally bound, if not in form, at least in substance, by the contract, so that a suit may be brought by or against either of them.\nThe same author in Par. 270 says:\u2014\nWhere the agent contracts in his own name he adds his own personal responsibility to that of him who has employed him.\nIn par. 163 he had referred to Pothier's view that the obligation incurred by the principal is accessorial, citing \"Obligations,\" Nos. 447-9, where the sense in which that learned writer uses the phrase \"obligation accessoire\" is fully explained.\nStory, as will have been noted, speaks of the obligation as several while Pothier describes the two debtors as liable \"conjointement\"; and much was made of Pothier's use of this latter word in argument here, counsel for the respondent maintaining that it imports joint liability as known in English law. But under the civil law an obligation is \"conjointe\" whenever there is plurality either of creditors or of debtors; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Obligations, No. 1107. Ordinarily it entails a division of the right or of the liability, so that in the one case each creditor may recover an equal share of the debt, but no more, from the common debtor and in the other each debtor is liable for an equal share of the debt, but no more, to the common creditor. (26 Dem. 105, 110, 112). There are as many distinct credits or debts as there are creditors or debtors. This is obviously not the sense in which the word \"conjointement\" is used by Pothier.\nBut it also clearly excludes the alternative liability of the English law, since it is the antithesis of \"disjunctive\" liability, Baudry-Lacantinerie, No. 1107 (n), which is most rare in modern civil law, 26 Dem. 112. In Pothier's text it merely signifies simultaneous liability upon the same obligation (26 Dem. 107), each debtor being liable for the whole. But how? Jointly or severally? \"Severally\" says Story, using the word as an English lawyer, in par. 266 above quoted, cited by the commissioners.\nThe passage quoted from par. 269 in which he speaks of the creditor's right to bring suit \"against\" either of them serves to make it clear that the joint liability of the English law was not contemplated. Story may in this latter passage have intended to indicate the liability to be alternative as it is understood in English law; but, if he did, the fact that the commissioners explicitly state that Art. 1727 C.C., which imposes the liability on the mandator, is based on the doctrine taught by Pothier makes it probable that Story was not so understood by them. Pothier's conjoint accessorial liability of the principal is not a disjunctive alternative liability. His comparison of it with the liability of a surety while indicating the distinctions between the two, makes this reasonably clear. The principal and the surety are several debtors. An unsatisfied judgment against the principal does not preclude a judgment against the surety. (Arts. 1956 and 1958 C.C.). Art. 1716 C.C. read in the light of the commissioners' report and the texts they cite was, it seems reasonably clear, intended to assert neither the joint nor the alternative liability of the English law, but a several liability of the principal and the agent subject to the latter's right, and the former's obligation, of indemnification. (Art. 1720 C.C).\nIn Vol. 5 of Langelier's Cours de Droit Civil, at p. 304, we read under Art. 1716:\u2014\nLorsque le mandataire a contract\u00e9 en son propre nom, ceux avec qui il a contract\u00e9 ont le droit de le tenir responsable personnellement, mais peuvent-ils aussi s'en prendre au mandant? Notre article r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative. Les tiers peuvent-ils alors poursuivre et le mandant et le mandataire? L'affirmative ne me para\u00eet pas douteuse. D'abord il n'y a pas de doute que les tiers peuvent poursuivre le mandataire, puisque notre article le dit en toutes lettres. Et comme ce m\u00eame article leur r\u00e9serve leur recours contre le mandant, cela veut dire qu'ils peuvent poursuivre les deux et pour le tout.\nIn Huot v. Dufresne,[21] the judgment of the Court of Review contains this \"consid\u00e9rant\":\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que celui qui contracte avec un mandataire qui agit personnellement a recours contre ce mandataire, mais que, s'il d\u00e9couvre ensuite que ce mandataire agissait pour un autre, il a aussi recours contre ce tiers pour qui ce mandataire agissait, et ce, sous les dispositions du dit article 1716 du Code Civil.\nIn Wilson v. Benjamin,[22] in the judgment of the Superior Court we read:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que le mandataire qui agit en son propre nom est responsable envers les tiers avec qui il contracte, sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits de ces derniers contre le mandant qui est responsable envers eux pour tous les actes de son mandataire faits dans l'ex\u00e9cution et les limites du mandat, except\u00e9 dans le cas de l'article 1738 du Code Civil et dans le cas o\u00f9, par la convention, ou les usages du commerce le mandataire est seul responsable.\nWe have not been referred to and I have not found any other decisions in Quebec in which the nature of the liability of the principal and agent in such a case as this has been considered. Those referred to by Mr. Justice Audette bear very remotely on the question under consideration. On the other hand, though not dealing with the precise question before us, the authorities now cited seem to indicate that the liability is several and the remedies cumulative, and that the recovery of a judgment against the agent will not, so long as it remains unsatisfied, affect the creditor's right to pursue the principal. Apart from authority the terms of Art. 1716 C.C. seem plainly to imply these consequences.\nThe idea of the merger of the debt under a contract in a judgment obtained upon it is foreign to the Quebec system of Jurisprudence. Rocheleau v. Bessette,[23] Turner v. Mulligan[24]. As Mr. Justice Hall says, in delivering the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in the former case:\nAs the consensus of both minds was necessary to create the contract, so both must consent before its nature can be changed, although the creditor may be free, within the limitation of the law to exercise his own choice of remedies, and the jurisdiction in which he will enforce them. The judgment which he may obtain from a particular tribunal does not create the debt, but only declares its existence and orders its payment. That it has not extinguished the debt is apparent from the fact that the creditor may renounce it by notice only to the debtor, and without the latter's consent, and thereupon the original debt may be sued upon anew, either in the same or any other jurisdiction. Clearly this could not be the case if the judgment had effected novation and the original debt had been thereby extinguished. It is true that a judgment produces many of the effects of a new obligation * * * but these are only in recognition and qualification and extension of the original and still existing debt, and not in substitution and extinguishment of it. See too Langelier, Vo. 4, p. 33.\nWhile the Quebec law recognizes the maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro e\u00e2dem caus\u00e2 in so far as it will not, speaking generally, permit a defendant against whom a plaintiff holds a judgment to be again sued by him for the same cause while that judgment subsists, by Art. 548, C.C.P. it is expressly provided that\na party may on giving notice to the opposite party renounce either a part only or the whole of any judgment rendered in his favour, and have such renunciation recorded by the prothonotary; and in the latter case the cause is placed in the same state as it was in before the judgment. 20 Laurent, Nos. 136 et seq.\nIt is therefore abundantly clear that in Quebec there is no merger of the debt in the judgment such as takes place under English law.\nThe maxim, una via electa non datur regressus ad alteram, has but a restricted application in French law, (8 Huc. No. 328; 17 Laurent, No. 139; 13 Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Nos. 916-7-8; but see Arts. 1541-2 C.C.) and the renunciation of a right or a remedy is de droit \u00e9troit. \"Il faut pour cela que les faits d'ou on l'induit le supposent necessairement.\"\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that English decisions holding that a judgment against the agent who has contracted in his own name debars recovery against the principal are not in point and that the defence denying the right of the plaintiff to proceed against the defendant as mandator under Art. 1727 C.C. expressly preserved by Art. 1716 C.C., is not good in law. This case affords an excellent illustration of the danger of treating English decisions as authorities in Quebec cases which do not depend upon doctrines derived from the English law.\nThe learned judge further expressed the view that the defendant was probably not liable under Art. 1736 C.C. That defence is not raised in the plea of the Attorney General and would therefore seem not to have been open for determination under Rule 126. But, if it were, I should incline to the view that His Majesty the King cannot in any part of the British Dominions properly be regarded as resident in another country, and that the Crown in right of the Dominion, which is sued in this section, is resident in all parts of Canada.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the 12th February, 1919, with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans cette cause est de savoir si celui qui a obtenu jugement contre un madataire a le droit de pursuivre aussi le mandant.\nCeci nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 examiner la port\u00e9e des articles 1716 et 1717 du Code Civil.\nL'article 1727, sous la rubrique Des obligations du mandant envers les tiers, est dans les termes suivants:\nLe mandant est responsable envers les tiers pour tous les actes de son mandataire faits dans l'ex\u00e9cution et les limites du mandat; except\u00e9 dans le cas de l'article 1738, et dans les cas o\u00f9, par la convention ou les usages du commerce, le mandataire est seul responsable.\nLe mandant est aussi responsable des actes qui exc\u00e8dent les limites du mandat, lorsqu'il les a ratifi\u00e9s express\u00e9ment ou tacitement.\nEn confiant la gestion de ses biens \u00e0 un agent, une personne devient par l\u00e0 m\u00eame responsable des actes de ce repr\u00e9sentant; et ce dernier peut se d\u00e9charger de toute responsabilit\u00e9 s'il fait conna\u00eetre son mandat aux tiers avec qui il contracte. Cependant si pour des raisons particuli\u00e8res le mandataire ne d\u00e9clare pas qu'il repr\u00e9sente une autre personne, alors, dit l'article 1716, il est responsable envers les tiers avec qui il contracte et ce sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits de ces derniers contre le mandant.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, le mandataire McDonnell n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos, lorsqu'il a achet\u00e9 des marchandises de l'appelant, de lui faire conna\u00eetre qu'il repr\u00e9sentait la Couronne; et alors, en vertu de l'article 1716, il ne peut pas y avoir de doute quant \u00e0 sa responsabilit\u00e9 envers Desrosiers; et ce dernier \u00e9tait justifiable de prendre une action contre McDonnell et de le faire condamner \u00e0 payer le foin qu'il lui avait vendu et livr\u00e9.\nMais lors de l'audition de la cause, McDonnell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il n'agissait pas alors pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel; mais qu'il \u00e9tait simplement le mandataire de la Couronne. Jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu cependant contre lui; et je suppose que Desrosiers n'ayant pas pu obtenir de lui paiement de ce jugement pr\u00e9sente maintenant une p\u00e9tition de droit r\u00e9clamant de la Couronne le montant du foin qu'il avait vendu \u00e0 McDonnell.\nLa cour inf\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'action devait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e parce que Desrosiers, ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poursuivre et de prendre jugement contre McDonnell, il n'avait pas le droit de poursuivre plus tard le mandant, c'est-\u00e0-dire la Couronne, s'appuyant en cela sur les d\u00e9cisions rendues en Angleterre dans les causes de Priestly v. Fernie[25] et de Kendall v. Hamilton.[26] Elle s'est bas\u00e9e \u00e9galement sur l'opinion isol\u00e9e du juge Strong dans la cause de Hudon v. Canada Shipping Co.[27]\nDans le cas actuel, je suis d'opinion que les d\u00e9cisions rendues en Angleterre ne peuvent pas s'appliquer et ce pour deux raisons; premi\u00e8rement, parce que le code a des dispositions formelles sur la mati\u00e8re; et, en second lieu, parce que le droit d'election qui existe en Angleterre ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 dans Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que c'est absolument contraire aux principes fondamentaux du code civil.\nL'article 1727 du code civil d\u00e9clare formellement que le mandant est responsable envers les tiers pour les actes de son mandataire faits dans les limites de son mandat. L'article ne distingue pas entre le cas o\u00f9 le mandataire a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 sa qualit\u00e9 d'agent ou non. Le mandant doit ex\u00e9cuter les obligations que son mandataire a contract\u00e9es, que ce dernier f\u00fbt connu du tiers comme repr\u00e9sentant du mandant ou non. La loi ne fait pas de distinction et dans tous les cas le mandant est responsable envers le tiers pour tous les actes de son mandataire. Cet article est confirm\u00e9 par l'article 1716 C.C. qui dit que si le mandataire agit en son propre nom, s'il ne d\u00e9nonce pas sa qualit\u00e9, alors il est aussi responsable lui-m\u00eame envers les tiers, et ce sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits que ces derniers peuvent avoir contre le mandant.\nCes deux articles, suivant moi, se compl\u00e8tent. Nous avons donc l\u00e0 pour ces tiers deux d\u00e9biteurs, le mandant et le mandataire; le mandant parce qu'il est d'ordinaire responsable des actes de son mandataire, et le mandataire parce qu\u2019il n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de d\u00e9noncer sa qualit\u00e9 d'agent. L'intim\u00e9 dans son factum nous dit que les codificateurs d\u00e9clarent en termes formels\nthat they refuse to adopt the doctrine of the Roman and civil law and prefer that laid down by the English, Scotch and American law, with whom Pothier coincides.\nJe ne sais pas ou l\u2019on a pris cette d\u00e9claration des commissaires qu'ils avaient refus\u00e9 d'adopter la r\u00e8gle du droit civil. Il est bien vrai que les commissaires ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9, en combattant l'opinion de Troplong, que cette opinion de Troplong \u00e9tait en harmonie avec la doctrine du droit romain; et ils ajoutent:\nMais elle est en opposition directe avec l'opinion de Pothier qui est d'accord avec les lois anglaise, \u00e9cossaise et am\u00e9ricaine. L'article soumis est bas\u00e9 sur l'expos\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle de Pothier et comprend tous les actes du mandataire soit qu'il ait agi en son propre nom ou en celui du mandant.\nIl n'est nullement question dans ce rapport des commissaires qu'ils avaient refus\u00e9 d'adopter les principes de la loi civile; au contraire, ils prennent le texte de leur code en reproduisant la doctrine du droit civil telle qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9e par Pothier. Ils ne disent pas, comme le pr\u00e9tendent les savants avocats dans leur factum, qu'ils pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent adopter la loi anglaise, avec laquelle Pothier coincide; mais ils adoptent au contraire la r\u00e8gle de Pothier qui est d'accord avec les lois anglaises.\nHe dois ajouter que Pothier n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul sous l'ancien droit qui ait exprim\u00e9 cette opinion, mais on la trouve \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9e dans Domat, livre 1er. tit. 15, sec. 2, n\u00b0 1.\nC'\u00e9tait donc la r\u00e8gle du droit civil qui \u00e9tait reconnue dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec quand le code a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9; et d'ailleurs les codificateurs n'ont pas donn\u00e9 cette r\u00e8gle comme \u00e9tant de droit nouveau mais comme \u00e9tant la loi qui r\u00e9gissait alors le contrat du mandat.\nMaintant quelle est la r\u00e8gle de Pothier? Nous la trouvons dans son trait\u00e9 sur le mandat, au n\u00b0 88, dans les termes suivants:\nQuoique ce soit pour l'affaire qui fait l'objet du mandant, et en se renfermant dans les bornes du mandat, que le mandataire a fait quelque, contrats avec des tiers; lorsque c'est en son propre nom qu'il a contract\u00e9, et non pas en sa seule qualit\u00e9 de mandataire d'un tel, procureur ou fond\u00e9 de procuration d'un tel, c'est en ce cas,, le mandataire qui s'oblige envers ceux avec lesquels il a contract\u00e9; c'est lui qui se rend leur d\u00e9biteur principal. Mais il oblige conjointement avec lui son mandant, pour l'affaire duquel il para\u00eet que le contrat se fait: le mandant, en ce cas, est cens\u00e9 acc\u00e9der \u00e0 toutes les obligations que le mandataire contracte pour son affaire; et de cette obligation accessoire du mansdant na\u00eet une obligation qu'on appelle utilia inatitutoria, qu'ont contre le mandant ceux avec lesquels le mandataire a contract\u00e9 pour l'affaire du mandant.\nAu n\u00b0 449, obligations, il discute longuement et clairement cette question et \u00e9nonce l\u00e0 le principe de la mani\u00e8re qui suit:\nPour qu'il y ait lieu \u00e0 cette obligation accessoire du commettant il faut que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 ait contract\u00e9 en son propre nom, quoique pour les affaires du commettant; mais lorsqu'il contracte dans la qualit\u00e9 de facteur ou de fond\u00e9 de procuration de son commettant, ce n'est pas lui qui contracte, c'est son commettant qui contracte par son minist\u00e8re (n\u00b0 74): le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, en ce cas, ne s'oblige pas; c'est le commettant seul qui, par le minist\u00e8re de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 contracte une obligation principale.\nLorsque le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 contracte en son nom, pour qu'il oblige son commettant, il faut que le contrat concerne les affaires auxquelles il est pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, et que ce pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 n'ait pas exc\u00e9d\u00e9 les bornes de sa commission. * * *\n\"Les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s obligent leurs commettants tant que leur commission dure; et elle est toujours cens\u00e9e durer jursqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9s, et que la r\u00e9vocation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 connue du public.\nComme on le voit, il \u00e9nonce le principe que le mandataire qui contracte en son propre nom s'oblige comme d\u00e9biteur principal mais qu'il oblige en meme temps son commettant comme d\u00e9biteur accessoire, vu que ce dernier est cens\u00e9, en lui donnant son mandat, avoir consenti par avance \u00e0 tous les engagements qu'il contracterait et s'en est tenu responsable. Maintenant, que l'on traite ces obligations conjointes du mandant et du mandataire comme obligations accessoire et principale ou qu'on les appelle obligations conjointes sous l'\u00e9conomie de notre loi, quelle est la nature du droit d'action que poss\u00e8de le tiers Est-il oblig\u00e9, comme dans le droit anglais, de faire un choix, de poursuivre soit Fun ou l'autre, ou bien s'il a le droit de poursuivre les deux\nLes obligations conjointes donnent au cr\u00e9ancier le droit de poursuivre l'un et l'autre des d\u00e9biteurs. L'article 1108 C.C. le d\u00e9clare formellement:\nLes poursuites faites contre l\u2019un des co-d\u00e9biteurs n'emp\u00eache pas d'en exercer de pareilles contre les autres.\nJe retrouve \u00e9galement le m\u00eame principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Pothier.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que les d\u00e9cisions rendues en Angleterre invoqu\u00e9es par le jugement a quo n'ont pas d'application dans notre droit et que Desrosiers avait le droit de poursuivre non seulement McDonnell mais son mandant.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour inf\u00e9rieure.\nMignault J.\u2014Dans ses notes de jugement, l'honorable juge de la cour d'Echiquier (M. le juge Audette) s'est exprim\u00e9 comme suit:\nI was, at the argument, referred to no jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec upon the subject in question, and after research I have been unable to find any. In the absence of the same, I take it that as Art. 1726 and 1727 are different from the Code Napoleon and are borrowed from both Pothier and the English law, that general principles of the English law governing such doctrine should also be adopted in questions flowing from such doctrine and which are a sequence from the same, as Strong J. seems to have found in the case above mentioned. Avec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible, qu'il me soit permis de dire que je ne partage pas l'opinion du savant juge. Si les articles 1716 et 1717 du code civil \u00e9taient emprunt\u00e9s \u00e0 la fois de Pothier et du droit anglais, ce ne serait pas une raison de dire que les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du droit anglais doivent \u00eatre adopt\u00e9s pour r\u00e9soudre les questions auxquelles ces articles donnent lieu. Je ferais plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9valoir la doctrine de Pothier et de l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, d'autant plus que les codificateurs ne disent pas que ces articles sone emprunt\u00e9s au droit anglais, mais, au sujet de l'article 1727 C.C., ils font remarquer que cet article est bas\u00e9 sur l'expos\u00e9 de la doctrine de Pothier, laquelle, ajoutent-ils, est d'accord avec les lois anglaise, \u00e9cossaise et am\u00e9ricaine. Il me semble respectueusement qu'il est temps de r\u00e9agir contre l'habitude de recourir, dans les causes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents du droit commun anglais, pour le motif que le code civil contiendrait une r\u00e8gle qui serait d'accord avec un principe du droit anglais. Sur bien des points, et surtout en mati\u00e8re de mandat, le code civil et le common law contiennent des r\u00e8gles semblables. Cependant le droit civil constitue un syst\u00e8me complet par lui-m\u00eame et doit s'interpr\u00e9ter d'apres ses propres r\u00e8gles. Si pour cause d'identit\u00e9 de principes juridiques on peut recourir au droit anglais pour interpr\u00e9ter le droit civil fran\u00e7ais, on pourrait avec autant de raison citer les monuments de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise pour mettre en lumi\u00e8re les r\u00e8gles du droit anglais. Chaque syst\u00e8me, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, est complet par lui-m\u00eame, et sauf le cas o\u00f9 un syst\u00e8me prend dans l'autre un principe qui lui \u00e9tait auparavant \u00e9tranger, on n'a pas besoin d'en sortir pour chercher la r\u00e8gle qu'il convient d'appliquer aux esp\u00e8ces bien diverses qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans la pratique journali\u00e8re. L'esp\u00e8ce que nous devons juger est int\u00e9ressante. L'appelant avait vendu du foin \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 McDonnell. Ayant purusuivi ce dernier en recouvrement du prix, McDonnell d\u00e9clara \u00e0 l'enquet\u00ea qu'il avait achet\u00e9 le foin pour le gouvernement imp\u00e9rial. L'appelant ne se d\u00e9sista pas de son action, mais obtint jugement contre McDonnell. Il all\u00e8ge qu'apr\u00e8s le jugement il put retracer certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tendant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les relations de McDonnell avec la Couronne. Il pr\u00e9senta alors une p\u00e9tition de droit devant la cour d'\u00e9chiquier, et la Couronne objecta qu'ayant fait option d'exercer son recours jusqu'\u00e0 jugement contre le mandataire, l'appelant ne pouvait maintenant pourusuivre la Couronne. Cette objection a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue et la p\u00e9tition de droit de l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. D\u00e0 l\u00e8 le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nIl s'agit des articles 1716 et 1727 du code civil, qui ne se trouvent pas au code Napol\u00e9on et qui se lisent comme suit:\n1716. Le mandataire qui a agi en son propre nom est responsable envers les tiers avec qui il contracte, sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits de ces derniers contre le mandant.\n1727. Le mandant est responsable envers les tiers pour tous les actes de son mandataire faits dans l'ex\u00e9cution et les limites du mandat; except\u00e9 dans le cas de l'article 1738, et dans le cas o\u00f9, par la convention ou les usages du commerce, le mandataire en est seul responsable.\nLe mandant est aussi responsable des actes qui exc\u00e8dent les limites du mandat, lorsqu'il les a ratifi\u00e9s express\u00e9ment ou tacitement.\nComme je l'ai fait remarquer, les codificateurs disent que l'article 1727 C.C. qui compl\u00e8te l'article 1716 C.C. est bas\u00e9 sur la doctrine de Pothier. Ils citent aussi, sous l'article 1716 C.C., Story, on Agency, n\u00b0. 266. Recourons donc \u00e0 ces deux auteurs, car ils fournissent le meilleur commentaire de ces deux articles et indiquent quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\nPothier dit, dans son trait\u00e9 du Mandat, n\u00b0 88: Quoique ce soit pour l'affaire qui fait l'objet du mandat, et en se renfermant dans les bornes du mandat, que le mandataire a fait quelques contrats avec des tiers; lorsque c'est en son propre nom qu'il a contract\u00e9, et non pas en sa seule qualit\u00e9 de mandataire d'un tel, procureur ou fond\u00e9 de procuration d'un tel, c'est, en ce cas, le mandataire qui s'oblige envers ceux avec qui il a contract\u00e9; c'est lui qui se rend leur d\u00e9biteur principal. Mais il oblige conjointement avec lui son mandant, pour l'affaire duquel il para\u00eet que le contrat se fait; le mandant en ce cas, est cens\u00e9 acc\u00e9der \u00e0 toutes les obligations que le mandataire contracte pour son affaire; et de cette obligation accessoire du mandant, na\u00eet une obligation qu'on appelle utilis institoria, qu'ont contre le mandant ceux avec lesquels le mandataire a contract\u00e9 pour l'affaire du mandant.\nEt Story, Agency, n\u00b0 266, dit:\nIn the next place, a person contracting as agent will be personally responsible, where, at the time of making the contract, he does not disclose the fact of his agency; but he treats with the other party as being himself the principal; for, in such a case, it follows irresistibly that credit is given to him on account of the contract. Thus, if a factor or broker, or other agent, buy goods in his own name for his principal, he will be responsible to the seller therefor in every case where his agency is disclosed. But we are not therefore to infer, that the principal may not also, when he is afterwards discovered, be liable for the payment of the price of the same goods; for, in many cases of this sort, as we shall hereafter abundantly see, the principal and agent may both be severally liable upon the same contract.\nIl en est autrement dans le droit anglais, et l\u00e0 on d\u00e9cide que celui qui a trait\u00e9 avec un mandataire contractant en son propre nom sans d\u00e9voiler le nom de son mandant, peut poursuivre l\u2019un ou l'autre, mais non pas les deux, et que s'il prend un jugement contre le mandataire, il ne puet ensuite exercer un recours contre le mandant: Priestly v. Fernie.[28] C'est sur l'autorit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision que l'honorable juge Audette a renvoy\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de droit de l'appelant.\nLe raisonnement de Lord Bramwell dans cette cause et de Lord Cairns dans Kendall v. Hamilton,[29] est certainement tr\u00e8s fort, et j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accepter comme raison \u00e9crite si apr\u00e8s mure reflection, je n'tais arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le texte meme des articles 1716 et 1727 C.C., interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des passages de Pothier et de Story que j'ai cit\u00e9s, ne permet pas d'accueillir la solution que le droit anglais adopte.\nAinsi l'article 1716 dit que le mandataire qui agit en son propre nom est responsable envers les tiers avec qui il contracte, \"sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits de ces derniers contre le mandat\". Donc le recours du tiers contre le mandataire ne pr\u00e9judicie pas \u00e0 son recours contre le mandant. Et Pothier et Story indiquent clairement que l'un et l'autre sont d\u00e9biteurs envers le tiers qui, dans ces circonstances, a trait\u00e9 avec le mandataire.\nL'article 1727 C.C. contient une expression qui demande \u00e0 entre bien entendue. Il rend le mandant responsable envers les tiers pour tous les actes de son mandataire faits dans l'ex\u00e9cution et les limites du mandat,\nexcept\u00e9 dans les cas de l'article 1738 (le cas du facteur qui a son commettant dans un autre pays), et dans les cas o\u00f9 par la convention * * * le mandataire est seul responsable.\nEn effet, il va sans dire que la convention peut rendre le mandataire seul responsable \u00e0 l'exclusion du mandant, mais dans les cas ordinaires ou le mandataire contracte en son propre nom, pas plus que dans l'esp\u00e8ce' cette stipulation expresse ne se trouve pas au contrat.\nFeu Sir Francois Langelier, dans son Cours ee droit civil, tome 5, p. 304, enseigne que dans le cas de l'article 1716 C.C., le tiers peut poursuivre le mandant et le mandataire. Il dit:\nLorsque le mandataire a contract\u00e9 en son propre nom, ceux avec qui il a contract\u00e9 ont droit de le tenir responsable personnellement, mais peuvent-ils aussi s'en prendre au mandant? Notre article r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative. Les tiers peuvent-ils alors poursuivre et le mandant et le mandataire? L'affirmative ne me para\u00eet pas douteuse. D'abord il n'y a pas de doute que les tiers peuvent poursuivre le mandataire, puisque notre article le dit en toutes lettres. Et comme ce m\u00eame article leur r\u00e9serve leur recours contre le mandant cela veut dire qu'ils peuvent poursuivre les deux, et pour le tout.\nL'appelant cite aussi une d\u00e9cision de la cour de revision dans une cause de Huot v. Dufresne,[30] ou se trouve le motif suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que celui qui contracte avec un mandataire qui agit personnellement, a recours contre ce mandataire, mais que, s'il d\u00e9couvre ensuite que ce mandataire agissait pour un autre, il a aussi recours contre ce tiers, pour qui ce mandataire agissait, et ce, sous les dispositions dudit article 1716 du Code Civil.\nIl y a, dans le droit anglais, une raison de d\u00e9cider qui manque dans le droit civil, car celui qui poursuit l\u2019un des deux d\u00e9biteurs conjoints et obtient un jugement contre lui ne peut ensuite poursuivre l'autre d\u00e9biteur. Rien de tel n'existe dans le droit civil.\nPour ces raisons je crois que c'est \u00e0 tort que la p\u00e9tition de droit de l'appellant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. J'infirmerais donc le jugement dont est appel avec d\u00e9pens, et je renverrais la cause \u00e0 la cour d'\u00e9chiquier pour y etre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur p\u00e9tition de droit de l'appelant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Letourneau, Beaulieu, Marff & Mercier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rainville & Gagnon.\n[1] 18 Ex.

V., c. 19, s. 3.\nThe respondent's chauffeur, while using his master's automobile for purposes of his own in violation of instructions and driving the car at excessive speed, killed the appellant's son. The negligence of the chauffeur was admitted; there was no evidence of want of care on the respondent's part in engaging him and some evidence was adduced that the master had exercised reasonable supervision.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the master was not liable, as, at the time of the accident, the chauffeur was not \"in the performance of the work for which he was employed\". (Art. 1054 C.C).\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014English decisions can be of value in Quebec cases involving questions of civil law only when it has been first ascertained that in the law of England and that of Quebec the principles upon which the particular subject matter is dealt with are the same and are given the like scope in their application, and even then not as binding authorities but rather as rationes scriptae.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 28 K.B. 388) affirmed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review, to which the case had been submitted by the trial judge, sitting with a jury, and dismissing the appellant's, plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCallaghan for the appellant.\nRobertson K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014My appreciation of the facts presented in evidence herein leads me to the conclusion that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury, if our decision in the case of Halparin v. Bulling[2], is to be followed as good law. The misdirection accounts for the inconsistencies that exist in some of the answers to the questions submitted.\nThe Court of King's Bench in accord with the interpretation which it has adopted of these findings has seen its way to their reconciliation, as it were, and in doing so apparently suggests there has, arising from such misdirection, been only a misapprehension of the verdict.\nI am not prepared to deny either their right or duty to do so in this particular case and say they have erred. A new trial would be the only alternative and under a proper direction that would seem to be a hopeless expedient as far as plaintiff's ultimate success would be concerned.\nWith great respect, I cannot agree with the law as laid down by the Court of Review, and do agree in the main with the opinions of the judges in the Court of King's Bench in favour of allowing the appeal there and dismissing the action.\nI therefore think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts out of which this action arises appear in the report of it in the Court of King's Bench,[3] and in the opinions of my brothers Brodeur and Mignault, which I have had the advantage of reading. While they differ in their conclusions both my learned brothers hold the view that the question of law which is presented, viz., the scope of the restriction upon the responsibility of masters for injuries caused by their servants implied in the words of Art. 1054 C.C. \"in the performance of the work for which they are employed.\"\u2014\"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s\"\u2014must be determined not upon the authority of cases decided in English courts dealing with the question when a servant or workman will be deemed to have acted \"in the course of his employment\" but in the light of civil law authorities which deal with them and with the corresponding words of the C.N. Art. 1384 \"dans les fonctions, etc.\". English decisions can be of value in Quebec cases involving questions of civil law only when it has been first ascertained that in the law of England and that of Quebec the principles upon which the particular subject matter is dealt with are the same and are given the like scope in their application, and even then not as binding authorities but rather as rationes scriptae: and it is only on that footing and for purposes of comparison that I shall refer to them. I therefore cannot accede to the view that his case is concluded against the appellant by our recent decision in Halparin v. Bulling[4].\nIt must not be forgotten however that modern French authorities hold much the same position.\nThough entitled to the highest respect and valuable as illustrations they are not binding authority in Quebec. McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[5].\nBut the articles of the Quebec civil code dealing with offences and quasi-offences (1053-1056) having been based on the Code Napoleon (Rap. des cod. Vol. 1 p. 16) in considering their purview and determining their interpretation, French authorities dealing with the corresponding articles of that Code\u2014at all events those ante-dating the enactment of the Quebec civil code, and especially those cited by the codifiers as the foundation on which they worked\u2014must undoubtedly be given great weight. Yet in dealing even with these authorities it must be borne in mind that they\nare useful only in so far as they explain what may be ambiguous or doubtful in the Canadian Code; they cannot control its plain letter or express provisions. Herse v. Dufaux[6].\nI do not find in the verbal differences between the French version of Art. 1054 C.C. (dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions) and Art, 1384 C.N. (dans les fonctions) support for the view that it was intended that the scope of the master's responsibility in such a case as that now before us should be more restricted under the former than it is under the latter. Pothier in dealing with this subject uses the phrase \"dans l'exercice des fonctions\" (Obligations, No. 121) and that is the meaning ascribed to the somewhat elliptical words of the C.N. (dans les fonctions) by all the authors who discuss it. The phrases \"l'exercice des fonctions\" and \"l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\" in themselves express very much the same idea. It may be however that the English version which in this instance appears to have been the original text (Preface to McCord's Civil Code 1 ed. p. ix) under which the authorities are cited by the codifiers (1st Rep. p. 61) and which is at least of equal authority with the French text, by its terms \"in the performance of the work for which they are employed\" unequivocally indicates a restriction of the master's responsibility to injuries resulting from acts done by his servant \"in the course of his employment\"\u2014(\"au cours de l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions\" 3 Langelier p. 479, \"dans le cours de ses fonctions\" S. 1861.1. 439) as that limitation is understood and applied in English law.\nThe codifiers in their report (1st Rep. p. 16) allude to the departures in Arts. 1053-1056 C.C. from the text of the French code stating\nthat the wording has been changed to obviate certain objections raised to the latter,\nbut we are not informed what these objections were and I find nothing in the works of our commentators which throws light on this important point.\nWe are met at the threshold of this case by the fifth finding of the jury that the chauffeur Lauzon at the time of the accident was\nperforming work for which he was engaged by the defendant,\nalthough, in answer to the 7th question, they also found that he was in possession of the motor vehicle without the knowledge and consent of the defendant and in disobedience of the defendant's order.\nIn the view of the scope and effect of the last paragraph of Art. 1054 C.C. taken by the Court of Review and by my brother Brodeur, there would probably be no difficulty in maintaining the fifth finding; Lauzon was engaged by the defendant as chauffeur and was undoubtedly driving his master's car. But it is scarcely reconcilable with the interpretation given to that paragraph by the Court of King's Bench and by my brother Mignault; \"joy-riding\" was not work for which he was employed.\nThe 7th finding is supported by a body of testimony of which the weight and reliability is above suspicion. Lauzon's whole evidence, on the other hand, is most unsatisfactory. The 6th and 7th findings of the jury would seem to imply the view that he told a fairy tale\u2014that he was not testing the automobile at all, but simply \"joy-riding.\" The only corroboration of his story relates to its later stages and comes from the witness Leblanc, one of the companions of his \"joyride,\" whose testimony appears to be even less trustworthy than that of Lauzon himself. In cross-examination he is involved in a series of contradictions.\nThe majority of the judges in the Court of King's Bench disbelieved Lauzon's story where it is in conflict with that of the witnesses Gauthier and Desenfants, who say that he brought the defendant's automobile into the Laurier garage about 9.15 o'clock on the evening in question. Falsus in uno falsus in omnibus. They regarded his story as so highly improbable that they found little difficulty in discrediting it.\nAfter carefully reading all the evidence, although a verdict can be considered as against the weight of evidence only if it is such as a jury viewing the whole of the evidence could not reasonably find (Art. 501 C.C.P.), I am not prepared to say that the learned appellate judges below were not well advised in rejecting Lauzon's account of the evening's occurrences and taking the view that he returned with the defendant's automobile to the garage as directed by the defendant's son, that he subsequently took it out again in violation of his master's orders and purely for his own purposes and that he was engaged in so using it when he killed the plaintiff's son: or, assuming the law of Quebec to be as stated by the majority of the Court of King's Bench, that they erred in setting aside or ignoring the 5th finding of the jury and directing the entry of a judgment under Art. 508 (3) C.C.P. different from that rendered by the Court of Review on the reserved case. I cannot but think that the jury was led to make its 5th finding by the concluding direction of the learned trial judge, in reply to the question of a juror, quoted by Cross and Carroll JJ.:\nLe jur\u00e9; si le jury est d'avis que Lauzon avait pris la voiture sans permission du d\u00e9fendeur, d'apr\u00e8s vous, dans ce cas-l\u00e0, il ne remplissait pas les fonctions pour lesquelles il \u00e9tait engag\u00e9. Est-ce que je dois comprendre que c'est cela que vous dites?\nLe juge: Le chauffeur, malgr\u00e9 qu'il n'ait pas le consentement de son patron et agisse contrairement \u00e0 ses instructions, peut encore \u00eatre dans l'exerciae de ses fonctions.\nMtre Duranleau: Le jur\u00e9, dans sa question au juge, a pos\u00e9 le cas suivant: le chauffeur, apr\u00e8s avoir conduit la machine au garage, la reprend, sans permission et contrairement aux instructions de son patron, pour faire une course pour ses fins personelles; le patron est-il responsable?\nLe juge: Si une personne p\u00e9n\u00eatre dans un endroit ferm\u00e9 o\u00f9 une auto est gard\u00e9e, et, sans autorit\u00e9 de la part du propri\u00e9taire et hors sa connaissance, s'en empare, ou bien si elle s'empare de la machine lorsqu'elle est sous la garde d'une tierce personne et cause des dommages, dans l'usage de cette machine, le propri\u00e9taire dans ce cas n'est pas responsable des dommages; mais si l'automobile est encore sous le contr\u00f4le du chauffeur et qu'il s'en sert pour ses fins personnelles contrairement aux instructions de son patron, il abuse de ses fonctions, mais je suis d'opinion que dans ce cas le propri\u00e9taire est responsable.\nThere can be little doubt that that direction was understood by the jury as implying a statement of the law such as is involved in the following illustration given by Acting Chief. Justice Archibald in delivering the judgment of the Court of Review.\nWhere an owner of a car leaves his chauffeur in possession and in a position to use the car as he may deem fit, the result would be different because the owner of the car is responsible for the conduct of the man whom he is supposed to know. Take for example as an illustration that the owner has a private garage, and he instructs his chauffeur that his car is to be within the garage and the door locked by ten o'clock each evening but the owner leaves the chauffeur in possession of the key; the chauffeur, taking advantage of that, opens the garage, takes the car out, and damages result. The owner might easily have demanded of his chauffeur that he should deposit the key with him at night. I think there is no question that the owner would be responsible in such a case.\nWith great respect, I venture to agree with Mr. Justice Cross that this is \"plainly a mistake.\"\nI have outlined the view of the facts bearing on the vital question on which the Court of King's Bench proceeded. To complete the statement of what seems to be material, however, I should add that upon the evidence it was part of Lauzon's duty to have placed the defendant's automobile in its proper position on the second floor of the garage when he brought it in, and that until he had done so it could scarcely be said that it had passed from his custody into that of the proprietor of the garage. When the automobile was in the garage from about 9.15 until 9.40 on the evening in question it remained on the ground floor. In view of these latter circumstances it is perhaps not of great moment, except as affecting his credibility, whether Lauzon actually brought the car into the garage or not, or whether he started on his promenade d'agr\u00e9ment (joy-ride) from the garage or from a point distant some 200 yards from it. In either case he certainly set out \"on a frolic of his own\" in the sense of that term as used by Baron Parke in Joel v. Morrison[7], and adopted by Jervis C.J. in Mitchell v. Crass-wetter[8], or as put by Cockburn C.J. in Storey v. Ashton[9] he\nstarted on an entirely new and independent journey which had nothing at all to do with his employment.\nOn the other hand it is equally clear that according to the opinion of the Cour de Cassation in Picon c. Peltier[10], Lauzon having been ordered to take the automobile to the garage\ns'acquittait donc bien d'un acte de son service encore qu'il n'ex\u00e9cut\u00e2t pas cet ordre strictement, puisqu'au lieu de ramener de suite la il s'en servait pour faire une promenade. (Note)\nAs put in the text of the Arr\u00eat,\nCarri\u00e8re, plac\u00e9 sous l'autorit\u00e9 de Picon, ne conduisait l'automobile que parce que ce dernier la lui avait confi\u00e9e pour accomplir un service command\u00e9; qu'il appartenait d'ailleurs \u00e0 Picon de surveiller l'ex\u00e9cution de son ordre.\nThe French court extends the doctrine of the English deviation cases such as Venables y. Smith[11]; (see also Williams v. Koehler & Co.,[12]; and Chicago Consolidated Bottling Co. v. McGinnis[13]); and treats as merely an abuse of the employment what would in England be regarded as something clearly outside its course, there having been, to quote from the syllabus of the latter American case, a turning away from the master's service and an entering upon an affair which is the affair of the servant only.\nIn the direction of Erskine, J., in Sleath v. Wilson[14], disapproved in Story v. Ashton[15], views somewhat similar to those which prevailed in Picon c. Peltier are expressed. On the other hand the arguments which prevailed before the Cour de Cassation were unsuccessfully urged on the Court of Common Pleas by Sergeant Shee for the plaintiff in Mitchell v. Crassweller[16]. The case at bar is indistinguishable from the French case. Storey v. Ashton14 and Mitchell v. Crasweller16, on the one hand, and Picon c. Peltier, on the other, illustrate the distinct cleavage between the views of the limit on the master's responsibility for misconduct of his servant in England and France. It is interesting to compare the recent case of Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi Cab Co.[17].\nResponsibility for damage caused by a thing which he has under his care (Art 1054 C.C. par. 1) arises only when the occurrence is due to the thing itself, not when it is ascribable to the conduct of the person by whom it is put in motion, controlled or directed, D. 1918, 2. 7; D. 1912, 2.255. See too, D. 1907, 2.17.\nThe finding of negligence against Lauzon is unchallenged and unchallengeable. It is equally clear that there is no evidence of any want of care on the defendant's part in engaging him such as might render him liable under Art. 1053 C.C.; and, in so far as the sixth finding of the jury imputes absence of reasonable supervision to the defendant, it is likewise without support in the evidence. On the contrary he has, in my opinion, discharged any burden of proof which the Quebec statute, 3 Geo. V., c. 19, may have cast upon him in this regard by shewing that his supervision of Lauzon was all that could reasonably be expected in the absence of any ground to suspect him of misconduct. I agree with the comments upon that finding made by Cross and Pelletier JJ. and my brother Mignault. Failure by the defendant to exercise due supervision over his chauffeur was in no sense the proximate cause of the plaintiff's son being killed. No supervision that could reasonably be exacted would have prevented Lauzon joy-riding on the night in question. On the other hand to a claim under the concluding paragraph of Art. 1054 C.C., the most vigilant supervision would not avail as a defence except perhaps in regard to the burden of proof on the actual facts. Sec. 3 of 3 Geo. V., c. 19, which replaced Art. 1406 of the R.S.Q., affords the plaintiff no assistance.\nThe head note in Woo Chong Kee v. Fortier[18], cited by the respondent is misleading. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Greenshields, at p. 361, 3 Geo. V., c. 19, s. 3, was not in force at the date of the accident there in question. As soon as it appeared that the defendant owned the automobile driven by Lauzon the amended statute put upon him the onus of proving either that the accident was not attributable to any fault of Lauzon or facts sufficient to establish that Lauzon was not engaged at the time in the performance of work for which he was employed. But see Boyle v. Ferguson[19], on the latter point. The real difficulty with which we are confronted is to determine whether, on the facts as above stated, Lauzon was, as a matter of law, engaged \"in\" the performance of the work for which he was employed.\"\u2014\"au cours de l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions\"\u2014when he killed the plaintiff's son.\nIn view of the verbal differences between the Quebec code and the C. N. already adverted to, Quebec authority on the question under consideration would be of exceptional value. Unfortunately there is a dearth of it. The particular aspect of the master's responsibility presented by the case at bar does not seem to have directly engaged the attention of the Quebec Courts in any reported case brought to our notice, and the commentators do not discuss it. But such passing allusions as we do find seem to indicate a tendency to interpret the restrictive words of the Quebec code as the equivalent of the phrase \"in the course of their employment as servants\" as used in such English cases as Story v. Ashton[20], rather than in the sense given to the words \"dans les fonctions, etc.\" of the C.N. by the Cour de Cassation in Picon v. Peltier[21].\nThus in Turcotte v. Ryan[22], the liability of the master, Desjardins, was upheld by Fitzpatrick C.J., delivering the judgment of this court, on the view that the plaintiff had been injured by his co-defendant Turcotte while the latter was in Desjardins' service and \"during the course of his employment\", and by Lavergne J., speaking for the majority in the Court of King's Bench\npuisque c'est dans l'exercice de ses devoirs comme employ\u00e9 de Desjardins que Turcotte a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de cet accident. And in Trudel v. Hossack[23], the immunity of the master from liability under Art. 1054, C.C. was rested by W\u00fcrtele J., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, not on the fact that the servant Frenette was not engaged as a driver or even that he had taken his master's horse out surreptitiously, but on the ground that he \"was not in the performance of any work for his master.\"\nIn the authorities cited by the codifiers (1st Rep. p. 61) we find little to throw light on this question. Thus Pothier merely says that masters are not responsible for\nd\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits (of their servants) qu'ils commettent hors de leurs fonctions; (Obligations, No. 121).\nIn Mass\u00e9 et Verg\u00e9, sur Zachariae, No. 628, we are told that:\nEn principe, la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et des commettants, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du dommage cause par les domestiques ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, n'est pas limit\u00e9e au cas o\u00f9 les actes dommageables rentraient dans les termes du mandat ou de la fonction; pour que le ma\u00eetre ou le commettant soient responsables, il suffit que les actes dommageables du domestique ou du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 se rattachent \u00e0 l'objet de leur mandat, et qu'ils aient eu lieu \u00e0 l'occasion de son ex\u00e9cution. Orl\u00e9ans, 21 d\u00e9c. 1834, S. V. 55, 2, 661; Cass. 13 d\u00e9c. 1856, S. V. 57, 1. 442, et Paris 8 oct. 1856, S.V. 57, 2, 445.\nToullier says:\nC'est commander une action que d'y employer un domestique ou de charger tout autre pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la faire pour soi. L'action devenant alors le fait du ma\u00eetre ou des commettants, il en doit r\u00e9pondre comme de son propre fait.\nI have read all the French authorities cited in the judgments below, by my learned colleagues from Quebec, and in the factums, and a great number of others. There is no doubt that the tendency in recent years of the French courts and the text writers has been to hold the master answerable for any wrong committed by his servant while in his employment, unless the act complained of be wholly foreign to his functions as servant. They hold the master liable if the servant's act be in any way connected with his employment. Sainctelette in his work \"Responsabilit\u00e9 des Propri\u00e9taires d'Automobiles\", p. 223 thus sums the matter up:\nNous avons jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent suppos\u00e9 que le domestique ou le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 dont il s'agissait \u00e9tait un m\u00e9canicien, un chauffeur, c'est-\u00e0-dire une personne dont les fonctions habituelles consistent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 s'occuper de l'entretien et de la conduite de 1'automobile; c'est ce qui nous a permis de dire que lorsque ce pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 se sert de l'automobile \u00e0 l'insu de son ma\u00eetre ou contre sa d\u00e9fense, il commet un abus des fonctions, mais non pas un acte qui y soit totalement \u00e9tranger.\nAnd the modern authorities which the learned writer cites certainly go far to bear out his conclusion.\nI have already referred to Picon c. Peltier[24]. In Paterson c. Bibien[25] a chauffeur who, contrary to orders, had taken his master's automobile out for his own purposes by his negligence in driving caused injury to one Bibien, a comrade whom he had taken for a drive. The Cour de Cassation, reversing the Cour d'Appel, held the owner not responsible\u2014but solely on the ground that Bibien knew that the chauffeur was driving for his own purposes and not on account of his master and had entrusted himself to the care of the chauffeur personally and individually and not in his capacity as the servant of Paterson. The court treats the case as one of \"l'exercice abusif du mandat,\" and expressly states that the court below was well advised in refusing to relieve the master on that ground. In the foot note, however, the editor of the report says: Faudrait-il donner la m\u00eame solution si le dommage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers compl\u00e8tement \u00e9tranger au pr\u00e9pos\u00e9? Par exemple, en se plaant dans les hypoth\u00e7ses de lapr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, faudrait-il d\u00e9charger le ma\u00eetre de toute responsabilit\u00e9 si l'accident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par le conducteur de l'automobile, non pas \u00e0 un camarade qu'il emmenait en promenade, mais \u00e0 un passant qu'il aurait renverse? La question parait plus d\u00e9licate et cependant il semble que\u2014d'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence\u2014la solution doit \u00eatre la m\u00eame dans les deux hypoth\u00e8ses.\nReferring to the same case the reporter in his foot note to Picon c. Peltier[26] says:\nDans ce cas en effet on ne pouvait consid\u00e9rer que le m\u00e9canicien accomplisait un acte de son service.\nIn the report of this case in the Gazette du Palais[27], the reporter in his foot note cites as in point the case of Daubert c. Salles[28], where it was held that:\nLe ma\u00eetre n'est pas responsable de l'usage nuisible fait par son domestique d'une chose qui lui appartient, alors que, d'une part, le ma\u00eetre n'a commis aucune faute en laissant cette chose \u00e0 la disposition du domestique, et que, d'autre part, le domestique, en faisant usage de cette chose, n'a point accompli un acte de ses fonctions.\nA mistress had directed her servant to take some wine from her table and throw it away because she found it unfit to drink. The servant took it to the kitchen and there gave some of it to a visitor to drink. The wine was poisoned and killed the visitor. In an action by his widow against the mistress the latter was held not liable on the ground that the servant had acted outside the scope of her functions as such, and the decision was upheld by the Cour de Cassation. Although the case would seem to have been one of pure accident, actionable fault on the part of the servant appears to have been assumed. The fact that the wine of which she made use belonged to her mistress and was entrusted to her to be thrown out and was therefore in her lawful custody as servant, the purposes for which it was given her not having yet been accomplished, did not suffice to render the mistress liable. As the court puts it:\nCe n'est pas par suite et dans le cours de ses fonctions de domesticit\u00e9 que la servante a fait boire le vin empoisonn\u00e9. (Compare 1 Rolle Abr. 95, s. 3.)\nLaurent in commenting on this case says:\nOn ne dira pas qu'une invitation est un service auquel le ma\u00eetre emploie ses domestiques.\nNeither is joy-riding work for which a chauffeur is engaged. The principle underlying the decision of this case very closely approaches, if indeed it is not precisely that upon which the respondent would maintain the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in the case at bar. What connection was there between \"the work, for which (Lauzon was) employed\" (la fonction \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9) and what he was doing when he killed the plaintiff's son except the fact that it was his master's automobile that he was using for his own purposes, having taken advantage of its being in his custody to do so?\nIt is interesting to compare with these cases the decision in The Coup\u00e9 Co. v. Maddick[29], where the defendant having hired a; carriage and horses from the plaintiff, his coachman, instead of taking them, as was his duty, to the stables, drove for his own purposes in another direction and in so doing negligently injured the horses and carriage The master was held liable, but for breach of contract as bailee. In Sanderson v. Collins[30], however, while the decision in Coup\u00e9 Co. v. Maddick29 was regarded as not maintainable on the ground above stated (compare Arts. 1767, 1769, 1200, 1150, 1071 and 1072 C.C.), it was suggested by Collins, M.R., with some doubt (p. 632), that it might perhaps be upheld on the ground that the act done was within the scope of the coachman's authority since\nhe was entrusted with the carriage and horses for the purpose of driving them.\nIn Sanderson v. Collins[31] the master was held not liable, however, for an injury negligently done to a borrowed carriage by his coachman who had taken it out for his own purposes without his master's knowledge because in doing so the coachman had not been acting in the course of his employment.\nIn Irwin v. Waterloo Taxi-Cab Co.[32], a driver for the defendant company, by order of the general manager, whom he was bound to obey, drove him in a cab which the manager had no right so to use, upon his private business and in so doing negligently injured the plaintiff. The driver was held to have been acting in the course of his employment and the plaintiff therefore recovered against the company. This case might not have been so decided in England 50 or 60 years ago. Both Vaughan Williams L. J. and Fletcher-Moulton L. J. dwell on the fact of the driver's belief that he was discharging his duty; he knew nothing of the limitation on the manager's right to use the company's cars. Compare an arr\u00eat cited by Demolombe, Vol. 31, No. 617, where the court gave some weight to the fact that the servant could not have supposed he was acting dans ses fonctions. A contrary view appears to have prevailed in Clark v. Buckmobile Co.[33]. In a case which Sainctelette cites at p. 219 from the work of Imbrecq \"L'automobile devant la Justice\" (which is not in the Supreme Court Library) a master was held responsible where, having sent his chauffeur to drive a friend from Paris to Rouen, the chauffeur after reaching Rouen killed two persons while using the automobile in joy-riding with some companions. The court, however, laid some stress on the facts that the return journey from Rouen to Paris would have taken at least two days and that the accident happened on the second day of the stay at Rouen, wherefore the chauffeur should be regarded as having been still \"dans l'exercice de ses fonctions.\"\nSome French authors state the master's responsibility in very broad terms. The passages from Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde (Obligations No. 2911) quoted by my brother Mignault, and from Dalloz (1874. 2. 52) quoted by my brother Brodeur, are examples. Larombi\u00e8re tells us that:\nLe ma\u00eetre cesse d'\u00eatre responsable, quand le fait n'a aucun rapport avec les fonctions du domestique et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis en dehors de son service. Art. 1384, No 12.\nThe same author (Art. 1384 C.N. par. 10, in fine) says:\nIl suffit qu'il (le fait) s'y (aux fonctions) rattache directement par des circonstances de temps, de lieu et de service pour que la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre soit engag\u00e9e; et cette responsabilit\u00e9 a lieu dans tous les cas semblables.\nOther writers are inclined to give a wider scope to the restrictive condition imposed by the code and to treat as \"en dehors des fonctions\" acts which the former would regard as merely \"l'exercice abusif des fonctions.\"\nDemolombe in discussing Art. 1384 of the C.N. (Vol. 31 No. 617) cites with approval a decision of the \"Tribunal Civil de la Seine\" in which the important statement is made that the responsibilities imposed by this article on masters and employers \"sont de droit \u00e9troit.\" See also S. 1875. 2.36. The learned author also says:\nToujours faut-il que le fait ou l'acte quelconque du domestique ou du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 rentre dans la nature des fonctions auxquelles il est employ\u00e9 et qu'il l'ait commis comme tel, en sa qualit\u00e9 de domestique ou de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nOn this statement of the law the vital question in the present case would appear to be: Was Lauzon at the moment of the accident in control of the car in the capacity of servant to the defendant.\nLaurent (Vol. XX, No. 582) says:\nL'article exige une condition pour que les commettants soient responsables du fait de leurs pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, c'est que le dommage ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employ\u00e9s. De l\u00e0 suit que si le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 en dehors de ces fonctions, les commettants cessent d'\u00eatre responsables. Cette condition est une cons\u00e9quence du motif sur lequel la responsablit\u00e9 des commettants est fond\u00e9e. Ils choisissent un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 pour remplir certaines fonctions; c'est en accomplissant ce service que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 cause un dommage par un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit; la loi pr\u00e9sume que le dommage est caus\u00e9 par la faute du commettant, parce qu'il a fait choix d'un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 malhabile, inprudent ou m\u00e9chant. La pr\u00e9somption de faute et, par suite, la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant supposent donc que c'est dans le service que le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9. Si le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a caus\u00e9 le dommage en dehors de son service, la raison de la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant cesse, on ne peut pas lui reprocher d'avoir fait un mauvais choix, car le dommage caus\u00e9 n'a rien de commun avec le service pour lequel le commettant a choisi le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 et d\u00e8s qu'il n'y a plus de pr\u00e9somption de faute, la responsibilit\u00e9 de l'article 1384 n'a plus de raison d'\u00eatre.\nUn seul et m\u00eame fait peut donc engager la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant ou ne pas l'engager suivant qu'il est commis dans le service ou en dehors du service.\nA writer in the Revue Trimestrielle, 1917, at pp. 134-5 says:\nLe pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 rend le patron responsable s'il fait un acte m\u00eame abusif ou d\u00e9lictueux dans le sens de la fonction. Mais lorsque le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 va contre sa fonction, le patron n'est plus responsable. Laurent (Vol. XX No. 586) cites with approval the following passage from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Paris (D. 1852,2. 240):\nUne seule condition existe \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants, c'est que le dommage ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employ\u00e9s, ce qui doit s'entendre surtout des abus commis dans l'accomplissement de ces fonctions, quasi-d\u00e9lits, d\u00e9lits ou crimes m\u00eame. Pourvu que le fait dommageable se rattache \u00e0 la fonction, qu'il n'en soit qu'une extension abusive, la condition de la loi existe et la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres est encourue.\nBut since the only limit on the responsibility of the master is that implied in the condition that the damage must arise in the performance of the work for which the servant is employed (Toullier Vol. XI No. 282) he is at all events entitled to insist that this condition of a responsibility admittedly severe shall be really fulfilled. Fuzier-Hermann, Rep. vbo. Responsabilit\u00e9 Civil, No. 718; S. 1904, 2. 298.\nM. Wahl in an article in Revue Trimestrielle, 1908, at p. 14, says that the ground of the decision in Picon c. Peltier[34] was that at the moment of the accident the master \"n'avait pas abdiqu\u00e9 son devoir de surveillance.\" The learned writer had, however, stated his own view in these terms:\nMais l'article 1384, cesse d'\u00eatre applicable lorsque le conducteur en se servant de l'automobile agissait \u00e0 l'insu de son patron et en son nom personnel. Dans ce cas le patron n'est pas tenu des cons\u00e9quences de l'accident qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher et qui n'est pas arriv\u00e9 dans l'exercice des fonctions du conducteur.\nBut the authority cited for this proposition is Paterson c. Bibien[35] above referred to.\nThe value of the French decisions as authorities is much weakened by the prevalent view that whether a servant is or is not acting \"dans les fonctions\" is regarded as a pure question of fact to be conclusively determined by the \"juges du fond.\" Thus we read in Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, No. 2195.\nLes auteurs ne sauraient poser de r\u00e8gie ni formuler des pr\u00e9somptions dont le l\u00e9gislateur ne parle pas. Il s'agit d'une pure question de fait; elle est donc abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des juges du fond.\nThe same view is expressed by Laurent, Vol. XX, No.585.\nC'est une question de fait; il faut en laisser la d\u00e9cision au juge, sans vouloir le lier par des pr\u00e9somptions que la loi ignore.\nSee also S. 1904, 2. 298, note (4-5); Garsonnet Trait\u00e9 de Procedure, XL, Vol. 1, p. 162; Labori Rep. Vbo. Resp. Civ. No. 174.\nWith respect, the question is one of mixed law and fact\u2014a question of fact only within certain limits. Addison on Torts (8th ed.) p. 122. What work was the servant employed to perform, what was he actually doing, and for whose benefit or on whose account was he acting, are no doubt, questions of fact. But, these facts being ascertained\u2014and their ascertainment usually presents comparatively little difficulty\u2014whether what the servant actually did was \"in the performance of the work for which he was employed\" depends entirely upon the proper interpretation of these latter words; and that is a question of law.\nToute la difficult\u00e9 est de pr\u00e9ciser le sens qu'il convient de donner \u00e0 ce membre de phrase. S. 1892. 1. 569. Notes (1 & 2).\nIf there be no conflict in the evidence the question whether a servant whose wrongful act caused injury to a stranger was acting within the scope of his employment, is for the court; but, if there be conflict, then the question is for the jury. Barmore v. Vicksburg, etc. Ry. Co.[36]. But whether the act causing injury is so connected with the course of the employment as to engage the responsibility of the master or is such a departure from it as relieves him, must as a question of degree be determined by a jury properly instructed by a judge who correctly directs himself. Clark and Lindsell on Torts (Can. ed. p. 76). See, however, Joseph Rand v. Craig[37].\nIt may be of some assistance in determining how far English cases may be helpful as affording rationes scriptae to compare the views taken by the French and English courts of some comparatively elementary phases of the subject under consideration though not directly bearing upon the point immediately before us.\nThe basis on which the liability of the master rests is substantially the same in both countries. Although Demolombe's view was that it depends solely on the master's faculty of choice of his servant (Vol. XXXI, Nos. 610-611), nearly all the other authors base it as well on the master's right of control by orders and instructions; and this double basis of responsibility is now well established in the French courts.\nSi, en effet, l'article 1384 soumet les commettants \u00e0 l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre du fait de leurs pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, ce n'est pas seulement parce qu'ils les ont choisis, c'est encore parce qu'ils ont le droit de leur donner des ordres et des instructions sur la mani\u00e8re de remplir les fonctions auxquelles ils les emploient. Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1384, No. 11.\nS. 1887. 1. 456, and note. See, too, S. 1893, 1. 217. note (3); Sourdat, t. 2. No. 887; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde (Oblig.) No. 2912; Turcotte v. Ryan[38], per Lacoste C.J. Since the decision in Limpus v. The London General Omnibus Co.[39] as pointed out by Fletcher-Moulton L.J. in Smith v. Martin and Kingston-upon-Hull Corporation[40]:\nThe real question is whether it was an act done in the course of the (servant's) employment and not whether it was within the scope of the authority given to her.\nThe question is not one of authority: Smith v. North Metropolitan Tramways Co.[41].\nBlackstone indicated the same test in his commentaries (Lewis 1 ed. Vol. 1, p. 4321), when he said:\nIf the servant by his negligence does any damage to a stranger, the master shall answer for his neglect; but the damage must be done while he is actually employed in his master's service, otherwise the servant shall answer for his own misbehaviour.\nIn Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[42], Lord Macnaghten says:\nThe expressions \"acting within his authority,\" \"acting in the course of his employment,\" and the expression \"acting within the scope of his agency\" (which Story uses) as applied to an agent, speaking broadly, mean one and the same thing. What is meant by those expressions is not easy to define with exactitude. To the circumstances of a particular case one may be more appropriate than the other. Whichever is used it must be construed liberally, and probably, as Sir Montague Smith observed, the explanation given by Willes J. is the best that can be given.\nBlackstone (Lewis ed.) Vol. 1, p. 430, states the principle in these terms:\nAs for those things which a servant may do on behalf of his master, they seem all to proceed upon this principle, that the master is answerable for the act of his servant, if done by his command, either expressly given or implied; nam qui facit per alium facit per se.\nSee, too, Wood, Master & Servant, No. 279.\nBut if delegation of authority is to be taken as the basis of the master's liability, by liberality of construction, implied authority must be made to cover all acts in the course of the employment.. Wood, Master & Servant, No. 280.\nThe House of Lords, by its decision in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[43], dispelled the notion that it is also essential that the servant should be acting \"for his master's benefit.\" Joseph Rand v. Craig,[44]. Appropriate as these words are in some cases, \"in a general statement of the law they are out of place,\" says Lord Macnaghten. His Lordship proceeds to point out that in the very case in which Willes J. had used the phrase \"for his master's benefit,\" Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank[45], that eminent judge also said:\nIn all the cases it may be said as here, that the master had not authorized the act. It is true he has not authorized the particular act, but he has put the agent in his place to do that class of acts and he must be answerable for the manner in which that agent has conducted himself in doing the business which it was the act of his master to place him in.\nThe master's faculty of choice is here plainly indicated as a basis of liability, as it was in the classic passage from the judgment of the same distinguished judge in Bayley v. Manchester Rly. Co.[46], subject to the qualification that what was done by the servant, however wrongful, was done not from any\ncaprice of the servant but in the course of his employment. Wood, Master & Servant, No. 288.\nAs put in Marion v. Chicago Railway Co.[47].\nThe mere purpose of the employee to serve his employer has not a tendency to bring the act within the scope of his employment. Compare D. 1860.1.49. In Quarman v. Burnett[48] Baron Parke put the liability of the master for the consequences of the servant's negligence on the ground that it was\nhe who has selected him as his servant from the knowledge of or belief in his skill and care, and who could remove him for misconduct, and whose orders he was bound to receive and obey.\nSee, too, Smith on Master & Servant (5 ed.), p. 284, Addison on Torts (8 ed.) pp. 122 and 129, Duncan v. Findlater[49] per Lord Brougham.\nIn France and England, therefore, the applicability of the maxim respondeat superior in these cases would appear to rest on identical grounds. It arises out of the legal relation between the master and the servant.\nThe master is liable in both countries alike, notwithstanding that he was unable to prevent the particular act which caused the injury (31 Demolombe, No. 611; 20 Laurent, No. 584; 4 Aubry et Rau, No. 447; Fuzier-Hermann, Vbo. Resp. Civ. No. 480; Marcad\u00e9, Art. 1384, No. 3; S. 1885.1.21; Smith on Master and Servant (5 ed.), p. 284; Pollock on Torts (10 ed.), pp. 88-9); because he selected the servant (Fromageot \"De la Faute,\" pp. 145, 150) and although the act was done in direct violation of his orders as to the manner in which the work should be performed\u2014(31 Demolombe, 612; Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9 (4 ed.) t. 2, No. 888; Bayley v. Manchester, etc.[50]. \"If the servant is acting within the scope of his employment, however much he may have abused his authority, however improperly and blunderingly he may have acted, the defendants are liable\"; per Black- burn J.[51]; Limpus v. Gen. Omnibus Co.[52]; Whitehead v. Reader[53]; Whatman v. Pearson)[54]; and is an illegal or even criminal act. S. 1873.2.42; S. 1851, 2. 359; Dyer v. Munday[55]. But there is no liability in either country where the illegal or criminal act is done wantonly for some purpose of the servant himself and not in the discharge of his duties; S. 1885, 1. 21; 20 Laurent No. 582, 2nd paragraph.\nLa condition rigoureusement impos\u00e9e par la loi pour qu'il y ait responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres est que le fait dommageable se soit produit dans les fonctions auxquelles leurs domestiques \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s. S. 1875, 2. 26. Limpus v. General Omnibus Co.52; Cheshire v. Bailey[56]; Croft v. Allison[57]; Joseph Rand v. Craig[58].\nIn France the owner of a public conveyance was held civilly liable for a criminal assault committed by his driver on a girl of 13 sent in his carriage from a railway station to a convent (D. 1873. 3, 7). This decision appears to have been rested on breach of a contract to conduct the girl directly to the convent as well as on the ground that the act of the servant was \"dans l'exercice de ses fonctions.\" The owner of an apartment was likewise held responsible where his concierge had aided in the seduction of a young girl by receiving letters for her and introducing young men into her room (S. 57. 2.445). Larombi\u00e8re, however, condemns this latter arr\u00eat (Art. 1314, No. 9) as does also Demolombe (Vol. 31, N. 618). In England the master would probably have been held not liable in both these cases on the ground that the wrongful acts were committed \"exclusively for the servant's private ends.\" Pollock (10 ed.), p. 99; Richards v. West Middlesex Water Works Co.[59]. But it would be otherwise if the act, though actually forbidden, were done in the master's interest. Mousell Brothers, Ltd., v. London & North Western Rly. Co.[60]. Compare S.73.2.42, where a railway company was held liable for its servant's act in smuggling tobacco for his own purposes,\nalors que ce d\u00e9lit n'a eu lieu et n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible qu'\u00e0 l'occasion de ses fonctions et de sa qualit\u00e9.\nThe master is likewise liable in both countries if the particular act causing damage, though not actually one for which the servant was engaged, is connected with (se rattache aux fonctions) and was committed while the servant is occupied in performing (\u00e0 l'occasion de) work for which he was employed. Mass\u00e9 et Verg\u00e9 sur Zachariae, par. 628 (2); 20 Laurent, No. 583; Fuzier-Hermann, Rep. vbo. Resp. Civ. No. 669. But curious differences have developed in the application of this ground of liability. A fire caused by the carelessness of a workman in throwing a lighted match on the floor while smoking at his work, has been held in France to render the master liable on the ground that smoking while working in a place where he was surrounded by inflammable material was \"une grave imprudence\" and the damage was caused \"dans les fonctions.\" S. 1847. 2. 283; See also S. 1896. 1.91. In England under the like circumstances the master was held not liable (Williams v. Jones[61], by the majority of the Court of Exchequer (Erle C. J. Keating and Smith JJ.) on the ground that the lighting of the pipe was not in any way connected with the work for which the servant was employed. Mr. Justice Keating suggests that the firing of squibs or matches indulged in as \u00e0 pastime during working hours would not be more clearly unconnected with the employment. But Blackburn J., dissenting, viewed the case as one of negligence in the course of the employment imputable in law to the master and entailing liability upon him. Mellor J., also dissenting, viewed it as negligence in the use of the shed where the workman was engaged, which had been loaned by the plaintiff to the defendant. The view taken by the majority however, prevailed in Woodman v. Joiner[62].\nAgain in France it has been held that the servant's act which causes injury must arise directly out of his employment and the master was held not liable where one workman mischievously flashed the sun's rays from a mirror in the eyes of another, who in his annoyance broke the mirror, whereupon the former threw some of the pieces of broken glass at him and thus destroyed his right eye. Inadequate supervision was the basis of the claim; but the court held that the workman's act which had caused the damage\nne se rattache point en lui-m\u00eame au service dont il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9, n'avait aucun rapport avec le service qui lui \u00e9tait assign\u00e9. S. 1904, 2, 908.\nOn the other hand in England it has been held that where a clerk using a lavatory intended for employees failed to turn off a tap after washing his hands upon quitting work and thus caused a flood, the master was liable because although washing his hands may not have been within the scope of the clerk's employment it was incident thereto. Ruddiman v. Smith[63]. In an earlier case where a clerk had caused similar damage in using a lavatory which he was not permitted to use, the master was held not responsible; Stevens v. Woodward[64]. But Grove J. expressed the opinion that if a housemaid, whose duty it was to attend the lavatory and wipe out the basin, but who was expressly forbidden to use it, had done so and left the tap open,\nher act of using the basin and omitting to turn off the water would be so incidental to her employment that the master would be liable.\nIn France the fact that in order to commit the act causing injury the servant was obliged to enter a chamber to which his duties did not take him and to open a movable not belonging to him has likewise been held to preclude the master's responsibility; S. 1894. 2.16. An act of the kind sanctioned but done beyond the limits of the property upon which the servant was authorized to perform such acts has been held in both countries not to entail liability on the master: Bolingbroke v. Swindon Local Board[65]; S. 1873.2.8.\nI confess my inability to appreciate what substantial ground of distinction relevant to the course of the employment or \"l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\" exists between the case where the master loans his conveyance to his servant to use for his own purposes and that in which the servant, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by his custody of or access to it, surreptitiously appropriates it. Indeed there would almost seem to be more reason for holding the master liable in the former class of cases than in the latter, since he was privy to the servant's use of his property. Yet in Narcisse c. Boisin[66] it was held that: L'accident caus\u00e9 par l'imprudence d'un domestique pendant qu'il conduisait la voiture et le cheval de son ma\u00eetre, n'engage pas la responsabilit\u00e9 de celui-ci, si la voiture et le cheval \u00e9taient conduits, non par ses ordres ou dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat, mais pour le compte du domestique lui-m\u00eame, auquel ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9s pour son usage personnel.\nTo the same effect is the decision in Cormack v. Digby[67], although the servant who had borrowed his master's horse and carriage for the day voluntarily brought home some meat from town for the master. Compare Rayner v. Mitchell.[68]. But in Patten v. Rea[69], where the horse and rig were being used in the master's business, the fact that the servant was at the same time going on private business of his own did not avail to relieve the master from liability. In Boyle v. Ferguson[70], where the master was Held answerable, the servant had general authority to use his master's motor-cars for his own pleasure as well as for the master's business and a jury was allowed to infer user for the latter purpose.\nOn the other hand Sainctelette, at p. 219 of his treatise, cites the case of a workman employed in a garage who fraudulently took out an automobile at night to amuse his friends and while so doing killed a policeman. The master was held liable.\nThe identity of the ground of liability of the master for damages caused by fault of his servant in the French and the English law and the similarity of the principles on which this branch of the law is administered in the two countries point to the conclusion that, notwithstanding some differences in the views prevalent in each as to the degree of connection with the work assigned which is requisite and as to when an entry on an enterprise of the servant's own will be deemed a mere deviation from the strict execution of duty and when it will amount to such an interruption of the course of employment as to put the servant en dehors de ses fonctions and the master's responsibility in abeyance, in seeking the true interpretation of the provision of the Quebec code under discussion one may not improperly take into consideration, in a case such as that before us, the reasoning on which the English courts have dealt with analogous cases. After careful comparison of all the authorities available the only reasonable conclusion seems to me to be that the limitation of the master's responsibility which it was intended to impose by the words \"dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employ\u00e9s\" was intended to be substantially the same as that which English courts understand to be imposed by the restriction which they formulate in the phrase \"in the course of the employment.\"\nThe Cour de Cassation formerly held that a domestic servant in the house of his master should be conclusively reputed to be acting in the course of his employment (dans ses fonctions): S. 1860. 1.1013. But it has since abandoned this doctrine, which created a legal presumption of responsibility entirely outside the text of the code, and has recognized that the master cannot be held responsible for a wrongful act committed in his house by his servant when not \"dans l'exercice de ses fonctions\"; S. 1885, 1.21. In a more recent decision it has been held that domestic servants in the house of their master are prima facie reputed to be acting \"dans l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles ils sont exploy\u00e9s\"; D. 1893, 2.296. Compare Boyle v. Ferguson[71]; Stewart v. Baruch[72]. It would almost seem as if the same court, impelled no doubt by the motive which has prompted legislation in Quebec and elsewhere subjecting owners of automobiles to special burdens greater than the common law would impose, has been disposed to hold the owner of an automobile liable for any use made of it by his chauffeur taking advantage of the control which his duties give him, however foreign to the work for which he is actually employed and however contrary to orders which in an English court would be regarded as limiting the sphere of the employment. It is possible, although unlikely, that there may be a reaction in regard to this particular application of Art. 1384 C.N., and that the French Courts may ultimately reach the conclusion that the imputation of responsibility to the master in a case such as. Picon c. Peltier[73] is \"en dehors de toute texte\" and involves legislative rather than judicial action. But it must be conceded that if the text of the Quebec code were identical with that of the Code Napol\u00e9on and we were bound in interpreting it to treat modern decisions of the Cour de Cassation as binding us in cases arising under the civil code, as we do judgments of the Privy Council and House of Lords in cases from the other provinces, we would probably find ourselves compelled to allow this appeal.\nWe find not a little support, however, in French authors and jurisprudence for what seems to me the more reasonable view taken by the English courts in regard to the particular phase of the master's responsibility under consideration, as illustrated in such cases as Story v. Ashton[74], and Rayner v. Mitchell[75]. (See also McCarthy v. Timmins,[76]; Cavanagh v. Dinsmore,[77]. Thus it is not disputed that the responsibility imposed by Art. 1054 C.C. is \"de droit \u00e9troit\" and that the condition attached to it must actually exist in the case of the master:\nDans certaines de ses applications (says Planiol referring to the master's responsibility for acts of his servant Vol. 2. No. 911), cette responsabilit\u00e9 est v\u00e9ritablement inique; c'est l'exag\u00e9ration d'une id\u00e9e admise \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re par Pothier et fond\u00e9e sur un \u00e9tat social disparu.\nAs Demolombe puts it the act for which the master may be held must be committed by the servant \"comme tel en sa qualit\u00e9.\" It must either be committed in discharging, or be directly connected with, the work for which he is employed, S. 1904, 2, 298. The master is not responsible when the servant \"va contre sa fonction.\" Rev. Trim. 1917, 135\u2014where the servant \"en se servant de l'automobile agissait \u00e0 l'insu de son patron et en son nom personnel.\" M. Wahl Rev. Trim. 1908, p. 14.\nPour que l'accident peut engager la responsabilit\u00e9 (du ma\u00eetre), il faudrait que le cheval et la voiture eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 conduits par ses ordres ou dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat. S. 1869. 2, 43.\nNotwithstanding the comparatively recent decision in Picon c. Peltier[78] and what has been stated in some of the other recent French cases, I am not satisfied that it is even yet conclusively settled in France that when a chauffeur, who takes advantage of the fact that he has the custody of his master's automobile to start out with it without his master's knowledge and contrary to his orders \"on a frolic of his own,\" while so using it by his fault injures a third person, the master is responsible for the damage. In English law he certainly is not. The case at bar must be determined in the last analysis, however, upon the interpretation of the provision of Art. 1054, of the Civil Code of Quebec, which admittedly states the condition of the defendant's responsibility. I find no ambiguity or uncertainty in the phrases \"in the performance of the work for which they are employed\" and \"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ils sont employ\u00e9s,\" when they are read together, as they must be. As applicable to this case both alike exclude the defendant's liability. Lauzon was acting neither \"dans l'exercice de ses fonctions\" nor \"\u00e0 l'occasion de cet exercice\" but \"en dehors de ses fonctions\"\u2014\"en dehors de son service\"\u2014during his joy-ride on the night in question. So far as they may be considered, English authorities uphold this conclusion and French modern authorities, even were we bound by them, although on the whole adverse, are not uniform in forbidding it. I rest my conclusion, however, upon my opinion that according to its \"plain letter and express provision\" Art. 1054 C.C. excludes the defendant's liability and that recourse to authority should therefore be unnecessary, Herse v. Dufaux[79].\nI would dismiss the plaintiff's appeal.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente une int\u00e9ressante question concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 de la faute d'autrui. Il s'agit de savoir si un propri\u00e9taire d'automobile est responsable d'un accident caus\u00e9 par son chauffeur qui, ayant re\u00e7u l'ordre de reconduire la voiture au garage, s'en est servi pour faire une promenade d'agr\u00e9ment au cours de laquelle cet accident est survenu. Le jury a \u00e9t\u00e9 favorable \u00e0 la demande. La cour de r\u00e9vision a maintenu le verdict du jury et a condamn\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile. La cour d'appel[80] a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement en se basant principalement sur la cause de Halperin v. Bulling[81], d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame au sujet d'un accident survenu dans des circonstances \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s semblables et o\u00f9 nous avons jug\u00e9 que, suivant la d\u00e9cision rendue en Angleterre dans la cause de Storey v. Ashton,[82], le propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile n'\u00e9tait pas responsable.\nJ'ai dit dans cette cause de Halparin v. Bulling81 que je me consid\u00e9rais li\u00e9 par la jurisprudence anglaise, vu que cette cause provenait du Manitoba, mais que notre d\u00e9cision ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans Qu\u00e9bec, vu que la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre en droit civil repose sur des principes diff\u00e9rents.\nIl s'est soulev\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause quelques difficult\u00e9s sur l'interpr\u00e9tation du verdict du jury et sur la question de savoir si le chauffeur \u00e9tait \"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9\". Mais en prenant la version la plus favorable au d\u00e9fendeur intim\u00e9 Latreille, c'est-\u00e0-dire celle donn\u00e9e par la cour d'appel,80 je consid\u00e8re qu'il a engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9. Voici ce que dit la cour d'appel80 pour arriver \u00e0 sa conclusion que le chauffeur Lauzon n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'exercice de ses fonctions:\u2014\nIt is proved.\u2026that the said Lauzon on the night in question had driven the motor car to different places in the city in violation of his employer's orders, at one of which places he took supper and was afterwards in the act of giving three of his personal friends a ride in the car when about midnight he drove the car against respondent's son and killed him. Il est admis de tous que le nomm\u00e9 Lauzon \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi du d\u00e9fendeur comme chauffeur de son automobile et qu'il d\u00e9sob\u00e9issait aux ordres de son patron quand il a fait la course au cours de laquelle l'accident est survenu.\nCes faits prouv\u00e9s et admis, il reste \u00e0 savoir s'ils constituent en droit un cas de responsabilit\u00e9 pour le propri\u00e9taire. C'est la question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nJe consid\u00e8re que la cour d'appel a fait erreur en s'autorisant d'une d\u00e9cision anglaise pour juger la pr\u00e9sente cause. Les textes du droit civil et de la jurisprudence anglaise peuvent para\u00eetre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue avoir beaucoup de similitude. Mais il est toujours dangereux d'aller chercher dans le droit anglais des autorit\u00e9s ou des d\u00e9cisions qui se seront inspir\u00e9es d'un syst\u00e8me propre \u00e0 ce corps de loi mais qui seraient absolument \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux principes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suivis dans le droit civil. Voici, nous dit-on, deux textes de loi indentiques. Le ma\u00eetre est responsable des actes de son serviteur \"in the performance of the work\", dit l'article 1054 du code civil. Les auteurs dans le droit anglais disent \"in the course of his employment in his master's service\" (Smith, Master & Servant, 6th Ed. p. 263) et la jurisprudence anglaise dans la cause classique de Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank[83], jug\u00e9e en 1867, se sert de l'expression \"in the course of the service and for the master's benefit\". On pr\u00e9tend que les termes sont identiques et qu'alors la cour d'appel a bien jug\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente cause en appliquant notre d\u00e9cision de Halparin v. Bulling[84].\nSi les termes sont identiques, si la loi est la m\u00eame dans les deux pays, comment s'expliquer alors cette diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable dans l'application des m\u00eames textes au sujet du compagnon de travail (fellow servant). En Angleterre et dans les provinces anglaises, on ne donne pas de recours contre le patron quand un employ\u00e9 est bless\u00e9 par son compagnon de travail; et cependant ce compagnon de travail est bien dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, \"in the course of his employment and in his master's service\". Smith, op. cit. p. 263.\nLa cause de Priestly v. Fowler[85] \u00e9nonce cette jurisprudence qui est encore suivie en Angleterre et dans les provinces anglaises du Canada o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de droit statutaire. Celui qui oserait invoquer une telle jurisprudence sous notre droit civil serait bien mal venu \u00e0 ce faire, car elle est enti\u00e8rement oppos\u00e9e aux principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la responsabilit\u00e9. Aubry 9 Rau, 4\u00e8me. \u00e9d., vol. 4, p. 760.\nCependant les textes sont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les m\u00eames termes. Alors pourquoi cette diff\u00e9rence dans les deux pays? C'est que la th\u00e9orie de la responsibilit\u00e9 de la faute d'autrui repose en Angleterre et dans Qu\u00e9bec sur des principes bien diff\u00e9rents. En Angleterre une personne est responsable de sa propre faute, mais ce n'est qu'\u00e0 une p\u00e9riode assez r\u00e9cente (1867) que l'on a donn\u00e9, dans des termes que Pollock consid\u00e8re classiques, les cas o\u00f9 le patron est responsable des actes de son employ\u00e9. On ne s'est pas d\u00e9parti dans le droit commun de la doctrine du \"common employment\" \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Priestly v. Fowler85.\nLa responsablit\u00e9 du patron pour la faute de son employ\u00e9 n'est appliqu\u00e9e qu'avec r\u00e9ticence et circonspection, l'on dirait presqu'\u00e0 regret. Il a fallu l'intervention du Parlement, sur la pression des organisations ouvri\u00e8res, sous forme d'\"Employers Liability Act\" et de \"Workman's Compensation Act\" pour \u00e9tendre la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre. Mais l\u00e0 o\u00f9 ces actes n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s et quand il ne s'agit pas d'ouvriers industriels, on est encore r\u00e9gi par les vieux principes de la doctrine du \"common employment\" ou \"fellow servant\", principes qui r\u00e9pugnent \u00e0 notre id\u00e9e de la responsabilit\u00e9 sous le droit civil.\nMaintenant sur quoi cette jurisprudence anglaise est-elle bas\u00e9e? Pollock on Torts, 8\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 77, discute cette question et dit :\nNo reason for the rule, at any rate, no satisfactory one, is commonly given in our books.\nSi nous consultons, au contraire, la doctrine du droit civil sur la mati\u00e8re, nous voyons l\u00e0 quelle est la raison de la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre pour les actes de son serviteur. Elle repose sur le principe que le ma\u00eetre ne doit employer que de bons serviteurs,\nPothier, dans son Trait\u00e9 \"Des obligations,\" No. 121, dit que la responsibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie\npour rendre les ma\u00eetres attentifs \u00e0 ne se servir que de bons domestiques.\nNous retrouvons le m\u00eame principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Demolombe, vol. 31, No. 610, Colmet de Santerre, vol. 5, No. 36, et dans Laurent, vol. 20, No. 582.\nLes auteurs du Code Napol\u00e9on ont consacr\u00e9 cette doctrine. Ils sont m\u00eame plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des ma\u00eetres qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du p\u00e8re de famille. Ce dernier, sous l'empire du Code Napol\u00e9on et sous notre code (Art. 1054 C.C.) peut \u00e9viter d'\u00eatre tenu responsable des fautes de son enfant en prouvant qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. Nous trouvons dans Locre, Vol. 6, p. 280, les raisons pour lesquelles les auteurs de Code Napol\u00e9on frappaient plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement le ma\u00eetre que le p\u00e8re dans le cas de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la faute d'autrui.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre existe en France et dans Qu\u00e9bec, m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 le serviteur a agi de son propre mouvement, sans ordres ni instructions de son ma\u00eetre.\nAubry & Rau, vol. 4, 4\u00e8me \u00e9d., p. 759; Touillier, vol. 11, p. 284; Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1384.\nCette responsabilit\u00e9 existe \u00e9galement dans le cas o\u00f9 le serviteur a abus\u00e9 de ses fonctions. C'est la pr\u00e9sente cause. Demolombe, vol. 31, N\u00b0 614; Laurent, vol. 20, N\u00b0 506; Revue Trimestrielle, 1917, p. 134.\nComme dit Demolombe, qui a \u00e9crit toujours avec la plus grande mod\u00e9ration, la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre ne cesse que dans le cas o\u00f9\nle fait qui a produit le dommage n'a pas de rapport avec les fonctions auxquelles il (le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9) \u00e9tait employ\u00e9\nou, comme dit Dalloz, 1874, 2, 52,\ndans le cas o\u00f9 la faute ne se rattache pas aux fonctions d'une mani\u00e8re quelconque par des circonstances de temps, de lieu et de service.\nQuelles \u00e9taient les fonctions de l'employ\u00e9 Latreille? C'\u00e9tait d'\u00eatre chauffeur de son automobile. Il en avait la conduite et le contr\u00f4le. Il est vrai qu'il avait, le soir en question, d\u00e9sob\u00e9i \u00e0 ses ordres; mais cette d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance n'enlevait pas la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre. Pourquoi? Parce que ce serviteur \u00e9tait un mauvais serviteur; et alors, comme disent Pothier et les autres auteurs, le ma\u00eetre a eu tort d'engager un mauvais serviteur et de lui confi\u00e9r une machine dont son serviteur pouvait se servir pour ses propres fins. Des d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues en France sur des cas analogues. Je citerai entr'autres celle rapport\u00e9e dans Dalloz, 1908, 1, 351, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par la Cour de Cassation dans la cause de Picon v. Peltier. Le jug\u00e9 est comme suit :\u2014\nLes ma\u00eetres ou commettants sont responsables non seulement du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l'exercice normal ou r\u00e9gulier des fonctions auxquelles ceux-ci sont employ\u00e9s, mais encore du dommage r\u00e9sultant de Tabus de ces fonctions. (C. Civ. 1384.)\nAinsi le propri\u00e9taire d'une voiture automobile est civilement responsable d'un accident caus\u00e9 par le fait du m\u00e9canicien pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 par lui \u00e0 la conduite de cette voiture, dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 ce m\u00e9canicien, ayant re\u00e7u de son ma\u00eetre l'ordre de reconduire la voiture au garage, s'en est servi pour faire une promenade d'agr\u00e9ment au retour de laquelle l'accident est arriv\u00e9.\nLe note publi\u00e9e sous cette d\u00e9cision n'est pas sign\u00e9e; mais elle est fort int\u00e9ressante. Les citations qui y sont faites d\u00e9montrent que cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence et \u00e0 la doctrine.\nSainctelette, qui est un auteur recherch\u00e9, a \u00e9crit tout un trait\u00e9 sur la \"Responsabilit\u00e9 des propri\u00e9taires d'automobiles.\" Voici ce qu'il dit aux num\u00e9ros 188 et 189 de cet ouvrage:\u2014\nAinsi, je donne l'ordre \u00e0 mon chauffeur de m'attendre \u00e0 la porte d'une maison o\u00f9 je viens d'entrer; en d\u00e9pit de mes instructions il profite de mon absence momentan\u00e9e pour faire avec ma voiture une course personnelle ou un tour de promenade. Ou bien supposons que je charge mon m\u00e9canicien de conduire dans ma voiture un de mes amis \u00e0 une ville voisine, et que je lui recommande de revenir aussit\u00f4t; mon chauffeur, une fois la course faite, s'attarde dans cette ville, y m\u00e8ne joyeuse vie, prom\u00e8ne ses amis dans mon automobile et finit par causer un accident. Ou bien encore je suppose que, devant m'absenter de chez moi pour faire un voyage, je d\u00e9fends \u00e0 mon chauffeur de sortir avec l'automobile durant mon absence; \u00e0 peine suis-je parti qu'il viole la d\u00e9fense que je lui ai faite. Enfin, supposons qu'\u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e, n'ayant plus besoin de la voiture, j'enjoigne \u00e0 mon m\u00e9canicien de la reconduire au garage; il en profite pour faire une promenade d'agr\u00e9ment au cours de laquelle il cause un accident. Suis-je, dans ces diff\u00e9rents cas, responsable du fait de mon m\u00e9canicien? Autrement dit, a-t-il agi dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, ou bien, au contraire, l'accident s'est-il produit en dehors de ses fonctions? Notons bien que le chauffeur n'avait pas re\u00e7u mandat de se servir de la voiture et que s'il l'a fait, c'est \u00e0 l'insu de son ma\u00eetre, et parfois au m\u00e9pris d'une d\u00e9fense formelle. Peut-on dire, dans ces conditions, que la faute commise par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, en dehors de tout travail command\u00e9 et m\u00eame en violation d'instructions re\u00e7ues est r\u00e9put\u00e9 se rattacher aux fonctions au point d'engager la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant?\n189.\u2014La jurisprudence pose un principe que les ma\u00eetres ou commettants sont responsables, non seulement du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l'exercice normal et r\u00e9gulier de leurs fonctions, mais encore de celui qui r\u00e9sulte de l'abus de ces fonctions.\nLe dommage qui ne se rattache aux fonctions que par un abus qui en est fait engage la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant. Il s'en suit que ce dernier est responsable lorsque le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a agi non seulement sans autorisation, mais encore au m\u00e9pris d'une d\u00e9fense formelle qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Dans ces cas la responsibilit\u00e9 civile du commettant d\u00e9coule, en droit, de cette id\u00e9e qu'il a mal choisi son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 ou qu'il n'a pas suffisamment veill\u00e9 \u00e0 la bonne ex\u00e9cution de son ordre ou au respect de la d\u00e9fense qu'il a faite.\nIl me semble qu'il vaut bien mieux pour nos cours dans Qu\u00e9bec suivre ces opinions que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans une jurisprudence o\u00f9 \u00e0 regret on semble reconna\u00eetre aux victimes du serviteur quelques droits contre son ma\u00eetre, et o\u00f9 Ton d\u00e9clare encore que le ma\u00eetre ne saurait \u00eatre responsable de la faute du compagnon de travail qui l'aurait bless\u00e9.\nMais, on dit, l'article 1054, C.C. n'est pas absolument dans les m\u00eames termes que l'article correspondant du Code Napol\u00e9on. Il n'y a pas de diff\u00e9rence en tant que le sujet qui nous occupe est concern\u00e9. On dit dans le Code Napol\u00e9on que les ma\u00eetres sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employ\u00e9s. Notre article dit \"dans l'\u00e9x\u00e9cution des fonctions.\"\nJe ne vois pas dans ces termes une diff\u00e9rence qui puisse influer sur le litige actuel. Le serviteur dans notre cas est chauffeur d'automobile. C'est l\u00e0 sa fonction et c'est dans l'exercice de cette fonction qu'il a caus\u00e9 l'accident. Les auteurs en France d'ailleurs en discutant le sujet se servent presque toujours de l'expression \"dans l'exercice des fonctions.\"\nVoyez Demolombe, au vol. 31, No. 614, qui, en donnant la premi\u00e8re condition sous laquelle on peut r\u00e9clamer dit\nIl faut, 1\u00b0 que le fait soit l'un de ceux dans lesquels consiste l'exercice m\u00eame de la fonction \u00e0 laquelle il (le serviteur) est employ\u00e9.\nOn a discut\u00e9 en France la question de savoir si un dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion des fonctions pouvait engager la responsabilit\u00e9. Mourlon est d'avis que non. Laurent, Beaudry-Lacantinerie et Aubry & Rau sont d'une opinion contraire.\nMais l'accident qui nous occupe n'a pas eu lieu \u00e0 l'occasion, comme dans le cas souvent cit\u00e9 du cocher qui par malice frappe quelqu'un avec son fouet, mais je suis d'opinion que Lauzon a commis sa faute dans l'exercice de ses fonctions comme chauffeur d'automobile.\nNos codificateurs se sont inspir\u00e9s du Code Napol\u00e9on pour r\u00e9diger notre article 1054, comme ils le disent dans leur rapport dont voici le texte:\u2014\nLes articles du chaptire III des d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits correspondent aux articles du code fran\u00e7ais, sauf quelques changements dans les termes pour obvier aux objections soulev\u00e9es contre eux.\nOn r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9videmment au mot \"pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s\" qui se trouve au Code Napol\u00e9on et que l'on a remplac\u00e9 dans notre code par le mot \"ouvriers\".\nPour toutes ces raisons, je crois que la Cour d'Appel[86] a err\u00e9 en basant son jugement sur une d\u00e9cision rendue sous le droit anglais et sous un syst\u00e8me qui n'a pas pour le ma\u00eetre la m\u00eame s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que le code civil. Il s'agit dans notre cas de bien se p\u00e9n\u00e9trer de l'esprit de la loi, de ses motifs et de son but. On les trouve dans le caract\u00e8re et l'opinion de ses r\u00e9dacteurs et dans les esprits de ses jurisconsultes. Nous avions tout cela dans Pothier, dans le Code Napol\u00e9on, dans les commentateurs, dans le rapport de nos codificateurs, et dans notre code m\u00eame, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 avant que la jurisprudence anglaise avec ses termes plus ou moins certains et d\u00e9finis ait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le cas o\u00f9 le serviteur pourrait engager la responsabilit\u00e9 de son ma\u00eetre. Nous savons dans le droit francais sur quoi repose la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre; et Pollock nous enseigne, au contraire que dans la jurisprudence anglaise\nno reason for the rule, at any rate no satisfactory one, is commonly given..\nN'est-il pas plus rationel, dans ces circonstances, de suivre la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise telle qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour de Cassation en 1908? Je remarque avec une certaine appr\u00e9hension la tendance qui existe de juger les causes de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents anglais. Les remarques que je viens de faire dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et l'esprit de la loi dans les deux syst\u00e8mes nous d\u00e9montrent combien il est dangereux de sortir d'un syst\u00e8me pour aller chercher dans un autre des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents qui reposent parfois sur des principes assez faiblement reconnus et parfois oppos\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 que le texte put para\u00eetre \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identique.\nPour ma part, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re baser ma d\u00e9cision sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation, parcequ'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sous une loi que nos codificateurs d\u00e9clarent eux-m\u00eames avoir adopt\u00e9e.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens et le jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision r\u00e9tabli. Mignault J.\u2014Il y a dans cette cause une question int\u00e9ressante quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du dernier alin\u00e9a de l'article 1054 du code civil qui se lit comme suit:\nLes ma\u00eetres et commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers, dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nL'alin\u00e9a 3 de l'article 1384 du Code Napol\u00e9on dit:\nLes ma\u00eetres et commettants (sont responsables) du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employ\u00e9s.\nOn enseigne en France que les dispositions qui rendent une personne responsable du fait d'un autre \u00e9tant fond\u00e9es sur une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale de faute, doivent par cela m\u00eame recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation stricte. Beaudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, No. 2938.\nIl y a quelques diff\u00e9rences d'expressions entre notre article et la disposition correspondante du code fran\u00e7ais. Ainsi le mot \"ouvriers\" n'a pas, dans le langage ordinaire, un sens aussi \u00e9tendu que l'expression \"pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s.\" Ajoutons qu'alors que l'article 1384 C.N. dit \"dans les fonctions\", &c., notre article emploie une expression un peu moins g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en disant \"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\" &c., sens que la version anglaise rend encore plus pr\u00e9cis en disant: \"in the performance of the work for which they are employed\".\nJe viens de signaler les diff\u00e9rences d'expressions entre le dernier alin\u00e9a de notre article 1054 et l'alin\u00e9a 3 de l'article 1384 du code civil fran\u00e7ais. Il importe maintenant de d\u00e9terminer si notre article doit recevoir la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation que l'article 1384. En d'autres termes, pouvons-nous, avec notre texte, accueillir ici les solutions de la doctrine et de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aises fond\u00e9es sur le texte du Code Napol\u00e9on? Ces solutions peuvent se r\u00e9sumer bri\u00e8vement. Ainsi MM. Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, (Obligations, t. 4 N\u00b0 2914), disent:\u2014\nMais ces expressions \"dans les fonctions auxquelles ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s\" ne signifient pas que les faits \u00e0 raison desquels les ma\u00eetres et commettants peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s civilement responsables doivent constituer l'exercice m\u00eame des fonctions des domestiques ou des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. La condition exig\u00e9e par la loi se rencontre lorsque les faits dommageables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis soit dans l'exercice de ces fonctions soit m\u00eame \u00e0 l'occasion de cet exercice, et alors m\u00eame que le dommage r\u00e9sulte d'un abus des dites fonctions.\nEt au num\u00e9ro 2911, les m\u00eames auteurs enseignent que\nLe ma\u00eetre ou le commettant serait responsable m\u00eame du fait dommageable que le domestique ou le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aurait commis non seulement \u00e0 son insu et sans son ordre, mais aussi malgr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9fense la plus formelle. Le motif de la loi conduit \u00e0 cette solution, car la circonstance que nous supposons maintenant ne fait point dispara\u00eetre la faute dont le ma\u00eetre ou le commettant s'est rendu coupable en choisissant mal son domestique ou son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nAinsi, en France, la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre est engag\u00e9e dans la plupart des cas o\u00f9 la faute de son domestique ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 cause un tort \u00e0 autrui, et le ma\u00eetre n'\u00e9chappe \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 que lorsqu'il appert que le fait incrimin\u00e9 est enti\u00e8rement \u00e9tranger aux fonctions du domestique ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nEtant donn\u00e9 que l'interpr\u00e9tation stricte s'impose en cette mati\u00e8re, je ne puis me convaincre que le texte de notre article nous autorise \u00e0 accueillir toutes les solutions que je viens d'indiquer. Ainsi, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le ma\u00eetre et le commettant sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s, ou, pour citer la version anglaise de l'article 1054, C.C., in the performance of the work for which they are employed. Ceci me para\u00eet clairement exclure la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre pour un fait accompli par le domestique ou ouvrier \u00e0 l'occasion seulement de ses fonctions, si on ne peut dire que ce fait s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. Il peut souvent \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si le fait dommageable est accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions ou seulement \u00e0 leur occasion, mais s'il appert r\u00e9ellement que ce fait n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du domestique ou ouvrier, nous nous trouvons en dehors de notre texte. L'abus des fonctions, si le fait incrimin\u00e9 s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ces fonctions, entre au contraire dans ce texte et entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre. Il va sans dire que le ma\u00eetre ou commettant ne peut, comme les autres personnes mentionn\u00e9es en l'article 1054 C.C., repousser la responsablit\u00e9 en faisant voir qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. Dans la r\u00e9daction du dernier alin\u00e9a de l'article 1054 C.C. les codificateurs me paraissent s'\u00eatre inspir\u00e9s de la doctrine de Pothier (\u00e9dition Bugnet) \"Obligations,\" No. 121, qui dit:\u2014\nOn rend aussi les ma\u00eetres responsables du tort caus\u00e9 par les d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits de leurs serviteurs ou ouvriers qu'ils emploient \u00e0 quelque service. Ils le sont m\u00eame dans le cas auquel il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en leur pouvoir d'emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit, lorsque les d\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits sont commis par les dits serviteurs ou ouvriers dans l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles ils sont employ\u00e9s par leurs ma\u00eetres, quoique en l'absence de leurs ma\u00eetres, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour rendre les ma\u00eetres attentifs \u00e0 ne se servir que de bons domestiques.\nA l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits qu'ils commettent hors de leurs fonctions, les ma\u00eetres n'en sont point responsables.\nOn me permettra de faire encore une observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce que plusieurs des honorables juges de la cour d'appel me paraissent avoir assimil\u00e9 notre droit, quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants, au droit anglais sous l'empire duquel on d\u00e9cide que le ma\u00eetre est responsable du fait dommageable accompli par son serviteur \"in the course of his employment\", expression qui, dans leur opinion, rend la m\u00eame id\u00e9e que \"dans l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s\" ou, pour citer encore la version anglaise de l'article 1054 C.C. \"in the performance of the work for which they are employed\". Et ayant constat\u00e9, \u00e0 leur avis, une identit\u00e9 de signification, les savants magistrats ont cit\u00e9 quelques d\u00e9cisions anglaises, et notamment l'arr\u00eat rendu par cette cour dans la cause de Halparin v. Bulling[87] qui venait de la province du Manitoba.\nIl est quelquefois dangereux de sortir d'un syst\u00e8me juridique pour chercher des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents dans un autre syst\u00e8me, pour le motif que les deux syst\u00e8mes contiennent des r\u00e8gles semblables, sauf bien entendu le cas o\u00f9 un syst\u00e8me emprunte \u00e0 l'autre une r\u00e8gle qui lui \u00e9tait auparavant \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Alors m\u00eame que la r\u00e8gle est semblable dans les deux, il est possible qu'elle n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue ou interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re dans chacun d'eux, et, comme l'interpr\u00e9tation juridique\u2014je parle bien entendu de celle qui nous oblige\u2014fait r\u00e9ellement partie de la loi qu'elle interpr\u00e8te, il peut tr\u00e8s bien arriver que les deux r\u00e8gles, malgr\u00e9 une apparente similitude, ne soient pas du tout identiques.\nJe ne fonderai donc pas les conclusions que je crois devoir adopter en cette cause sur aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent tir\u00e9 du droit anglais, pas m\u00eame sur la cause de Halparin v. Bulling87, mais je me baserai uniquement sur le texte de l'article 1054 C.C. La revue tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te que mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin, fait de la jurisprudence tant fran\u00e7aise qu'anglaise d\u00e9montre combien il vaut mieux s'en tenir au texte de notre article, texte qui ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucun \u00e9quivoque, que de chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9gager une r\u00e8gle ou un principe d'une infinit\u00e9 d'arr\u00eats d'esp\u00e8ce. Il me semble d'ailleurs bien inutile de chercher cette r\u00e8gle, puisque nous l'avons en des termes tr\u00e8s clairs dans notre code civil, et si la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise et les opinions d'auteurs qu'invoque mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Brodeur, vont au del\u00e0 de cette r\u00e8gle, c'est la r\u00e8gle elle-m\u00eame, et non cette jurisprudence et ces opinions, que nous devons suivre et appliquer.\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis d'opinion que Lauzon n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 quand il a tu\u00e9 Elliott. La r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 la question 5 est une r\u00e9ponse que le jury ne pouvait raisonnablement donner en examinant toute la preuve (art. 501 C.P.C.). Le t\u00e9moignage de Lauzon porte le cachet de l'invraisemblance et m\u00eame de l'absurdit\u00e9, et malgr\u00e9 ma r\u00e9pugnance \u00e0 intervenir dans une mati\u00e8re de ce genre, je suis forc\u00e9 de dire qu'aucun jury ne pouvait dans l'esp\u00e8ce raisonnablement arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que Lauzon, lors de l'accident,\nwas performing work for which he was engaged by the defendant.\nIl ne s'agit pas ici d'un cas d'abus, par le serviteur, des fonctions que son ma\u00eetre lui a confi\u00e9es, mais d'un acte accompli enti\u00e8rement en dehors de ces fonctions, et pendant qu'avec des copains semblables \u00e0 lui, il se donnait le luxe d'un \"joy-ride\" \u00e0 une vitesse effr\u00e9n\u00e9e \u00e0 travers les rues de Montr\u00e9al. Pour cela, il a sorti l'automobile de son ma\u00eetre du garage o\u00f9 il l'avait entr\u00e9e, et son pr\u00e9texte que, quand il a tu\u00e9 Elliott, il essayait, \"testait\", la machine, est une histoire absurde et invraisemblable que le jury ne pouvait raisonnablement croire.\nJe n'ai pas perdu de vue la disposition de l'article 1406 des statuts revis\u00e9s, 1909, tel qu'amend\u00e9 par la loi 3 Geo. V. ch. 19, sect. 3. Avant cet amendement l'article 1406 rendait le propri\u00e9taire d'un v\u00e9hicule-moteur responsable de tous accidents ou dommages caus\u00e9s par son v\u00e9hicule-moteur dans un chemin public ou place publique. On a sans doute trouv\u00e9 trop rigoureux cet article qui cr\u00e9ait une responsabilit\u00e9 absolue \u00e0 la charge du propri\u00e9taire, m\u00eame dans le cas d'un pur accident, et l'amendement impose au propri\u00e9taire ou conducteur le fardeau de la preuve que la perte ou le dommage n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du propri\u00e9taire ou du conducteur. Cette loi ne modifie pas \u00e0 mon avis le droit commun quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de sa propre faute (art. 1053 C.C.) ou de la faute d'autrui (art. 1054 C.C.) mais elle oblige le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 prouver qu'il n'est pas dans les conditions d'o\u00f9 d\u00e9coulerait d'apr\u00e8s le droit commun, sa responsabilit\u00e9 pour le fait dommageable.\nIl est vrai que le jury, quand on lui pose la question 6 :\nWas the said accident due to the fault and negligence or want of care of the defendant or his driver? If so, in what did the said fault or negligence consist?\nr\u00e9pond (je cite cette r\u00e9ponse textuellement):\nAs no evidence was produced to the contrary, we find that the defendant was negligent in omitting to satisfy himself from time to time as to whether the chauffeur or driver had car out against orders; but particularly throw blame on the driver for his want of competence in the way of driving, as in his evidence he said that something was wrong with the car, and in spite of that driving on St. Lawrence Boulevard at excessive rate of speed, not stopping behind stationary street car and pass same on left hand side, all contrary to the vehicle laws of the Province of Quebec. Mais puisqu'il s'agit de savoir si le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait personnellement en faute, il convient de dire que la faute que le jury reproche au d\u00e9fendeur, c'est de ne pas s'\u00eatre enquis de temps \u00e0 autre si le chauffeur avait sorti son automobile contre ses instructions, ce n'est pas d'avoir employ\u00e9 un chauffeur incomp\u00e9tent, et le jury ne trouve le d\u00e9fendeur coupable de cette faute que parce qu'aucune preuve au contraire n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Or la preuve constate que le d\u00e9fendeur a pris des renseignements au sujet de son chauffeur avant et apr\u00e8s l'avoir engag\u00e9 et qu'il a donn\u00e9 des instructions au propri\u00e9taire du garage de ne pas laisser sortir l'automobile apr\u00e8s dix heures du soir. Il n'y a rien au dossier, pas plus que dans les r\u00e9ponses du jury, qui fasse voir que le d\u00e9fendeur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable d'une faute ayant un rapport quelconque avec l'accident, et en supposant m\u00eame que la preuve constaterait que le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas surveill\u00e9 son chauffeur\u2014et elle ne le constate pas\u2014rien n'aurait justifi\u00e9 le jury \u00e0 dire que la surveillance la plus compl\u00e8te aurait emp\u00each\u00e9 Lauzon de faire sa tourn\u00e9e folle le soir de l'accident.\nJe suis donc d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Laflamme, Mitchell & Callaghan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Busteed & Robertson.\n[1] Q.R. 28 K.B. 388.\n[2] 50 Can.

Page, (1920) 60 S.C.R. 181\nDate: 1920-02-03\nNapoleon Gauvreau (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nCharles Neil Page (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1919: November 12, 13; 1920: February 3.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nHighways\u2014Dedication\u2014User\u2014Prescription\u2014\"Chemin de tol\u00e9rance\"\u2014Municipal road\u2014Constitutional law\u2014\"Municipal and Road Act of Lower Canada,\" (C.) 1856, 18 Vict., c. 100, s. 41, s. s. 8 and 9\u2014Arts. 749 and 750, Municipal Code.\nThe appellant dug a well and laid a water pipe on a certain road and the respondent took against him an action n\u00e9gatoire de servitude, alleging ownership in the land. The appellant's plea was that the road had been a public highway for over forty years and thus became the property of the corporation either by dedication or by prescription of thirty years; he also invoked the prescription of ten years enacted by the statute 18 Vict. c. 100; and he further alleged that he had obtained the permission of the Municipal Council.\nHeld that there had been no dedication, as the existence of the necessary animus dedicandi on the part of the respondent or his predecessors in title has not been established, and that the prescription of thirty years could not be invoked as the possession of the public as owner was neither exclusive nor unequivocal.\nSemble, per Anglin J., that, under the law of Quebec, a highway may be created by dedication. Brodeur J., contra and Mignault J., dubitante.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The sub-sections 8 and 9 of 18 Vict. c. 100, s. 41 are applicable only to roads which have been in existence and in public use for ten years before the first of July, 1855. Harvey v. The Dominion Textile Co. (59 Can. S.C.R. 508) followed. Per Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014Even if the road was a chemin de tol\u00e9rance subject to articles 749 and 750 of the former municipal code, the ownership of the land still remained in the respondent and the appellant had no right to do the works complained of.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 27 K.B. 490) affirmed.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Roy J., and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe appellant and the respondent both lived in St. Octave-de-M\u00e9tis, in the province of Quebec, In that village two roads crossed at right angle, the main road or maritime road and the church road or Kempt road. The grand-father of the respondent was the owner of a property having both roads as boundaries ; and, having constructed his residence at a certain distance from these roads, he opened a road communicating with both and passing in front of his house. This small road was always opened at both ends, except during winter ; and it was fenced on each side except in front of the house. Until thirty years ago, the respondent kept a store at his house, where was also the post office of the village. The public was using this small road continually, either to go to the store or post office, or to shorten the distance from the maritime road to the church road. The road was kept in order by the respondent except in the summer of 1916 when the corporation made small repairs. When the cadastral plan was prepared in 1878, an official number was given to this small road on the official plans, after the surveyor had obtained from the father of the respondent particulars as to these lands.\nF. Roy K.C. for the appellant.\nL. St. Laurent K.C. for the respondent. Idington J.\u2014This appeal was well presented and counsel on either side seems to have left nothing unnoticed either in law or fact. Therefore, we have had some very interesting questions presented for our consideration which would, if the case had to turn upon some of them, involve further investigation of the basis upon which the law of dedication rests in the Province of Quebec, and much municipal legislation might have to be considered if it were necessary to follow that line of thought.\nThe Court of King's Bench has held that there was no dedication under the peculiar circumstances existent for over forty years under which the public were permitted to use this alleged public highway, or lane as I think it might more properly be called. I cannot see that the court below erred at all in reaching such conclusion and for that reason alone the appeal should be dismissed. The many other interesting questions I have referred to need not therefore be examined.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014While I incline to the view that it is sufficiently established that under the law of Quebec a highway may be created by dedication (Chavigny de la Chevroti\u00e8re v. Cit\u00e9 de Montreal;[2] Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9;[3] Rhodes v. P\u00e9russe[4]; Harvey Dominion Textile Co.[5]; I am clearly of the opinion that the evidence in this case falls short of what would be necessary to establish the existence of the necessary animus dedicandi on the part of the plaintiff or his predecessors in title. The position of the house and barns on the plaintiff's property sufficiently accounts for the opening of the lane or road in question as a private way; and whatever significance might otherwise be attached to the absence of gates at the ends of the road, where it abuts on the two highways, the facts that the Post Office was located in the plaintiff's house for many years down to 1881 and that Henry Page kept a store there sufficiently account for any user of the road during that period by persons seeking access to that building and for its having been kept open as it was, without ascribing to the owner an intention to dedicate it to the public as a highway. Such an intention is not to be presumed from acts of user which admit of another equally probable or even more probable explanation.\nFor the same reason the user shewn during this period would not avail to support title by prescription. The possession of the public was neither exclusive nor unequivocal. It was concurrent with the owner's user for his private purposes.\nMoreover the cadastral plan drawn up in 1881 in accordance with a survey made in 1878 based on information supplied by the Pages affords evidence of an assertion of ownership of the road by them. It is given a cadastral number on this plan. One act of this kind by the owner is of much more weight upon the question of intention than many acts of enjoyment. Poole v. Huskinson;[6] Chinnock v. Hartley District Council.[7] After 1881 many acts of interruption of user by the owner are shewn by the evidence. Moreover, if the road in question became a highway by dedication, the ownership of the soil would have remained in the plaintiff and the defendant could not justify sinking a well and carrying a pipe under the surface of the road.\nI discussed the purview and operation of the statute 18 Vict. ch. 100, very fully in Harvey v. Dominion Textile Co.,[8] and I adhere to the view there expressed. That statute does not apply to a road first opened in 1847.\nIf Arts. 749 and 750 of the Municipal Code apply, since they deal with roads established in a particular manner, they must be regarded as exceptions to Art. 752, which deals with municipal roads generally and effect must be given to their explicit provisions that the property in the land over which roads within their purview are carried continues vested in the owner or occupant. Although, therefore, Arts. 749 and 750 should apply to the road here in question, the defendant was nevertheless a trespasser in digging a well and laying a water pipe in it. Permission of the Municipal Council could not authorize such an invasion of the plaintiff's property.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de savoir si une route commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9e \"Chemin Page\" et qui porte le n\u00b0 6 sur le cadastre de la paroisse de St-Octave de M\u00e9tis est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la corporation municipale ou de l'intim\u00e9 Page.\nL'appelant, avec l'autorisation des autorit\u00e9s municipales, a creus\u00e9 un puits sur le bord de cette route et y a pos\u00e9 des conduites d'eau. Une action n\u00e9gatoire de servitude est maintenant institu\u00e9e contre lui par l'intim\u00e9 Page qui pr\u00e9tend que lui et ses auteurs ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taires de cette route. L'appelant dit, au contraire, que la corporation municipale en est devenue propri\u00e9taire par abandon (dedication), par prescription trentenaire ou par la prescription d\u00e9cennale \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'Acte 18 V., ch. 100. Abandon (dedication).\nDans une cause de Harvey v. Dominion Textile Co.[9] je me suis demand\u00e9 si cette doctrine de la common law dedication du droit anglais pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec ; et, sans exprimer d'opinion d\u00e9finitive, j'avais alors donn\u00e9 quelques-uns des motifs qui me portaient \u00e0 croire qu'elle \u00e9tait contraire aux textes formels du code civil. Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 de nouveau la question en la pr\u00e9sente cause, j'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que cette doctrine n'y a pas force de loi.\nLa \"dedication\" est le r\u00e9sultat d'une situation particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Angleterre, qui ne se retrouve m\u00eame pas en Ecosse. Aussi la Chambre des Lords dans la cause de Mann v. Brodie, jug\u00e9e en 1885 (2) a refus\u00e9 d'appliquer \u00e0 l'Ecosse les principes de la dedication.\nLord Blackburn, dans cette cause de Mann v. Brodie,[10] nous indique clairement les circonstances suivantes qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette doctrine. En Angleterre, l'acquisition d'un droit pouvait se faire par prescription; mais la prescription ne pouvant s'op\u00e9rer que par possession imm\u00e9moriale, la preuve en \u00e9tait pratiquement impossible ; et alors au moyen de fictions l\u00e9gales appel\u00e9es \"lost grant,\" \"presumed grant\" ou \"dedication\" on est venu au secours de ceux qui apparemment \u00e9taient les v\u00e9ritables propri\u00e9taires du droit mais qui \u00e9taient incapables de produire de titre.\nLa \"dedication\" n'a pas cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie avec beaucoup d'enthousiasme. Mais, comme le dit Lord Blackburn dans cette cause de Mann v. Brodie[11], si on a r\u00e9ussi au moyen de la dedication \u00e0 se d\u00e9barrasser de la th\u00e9orie d\u00e9fectueuse de la prescription,\nan opposite evil of establishing public rights of way on very short usurpation has sometimes been incurred.\nEt c'est pour cela que la jurisprudence en Angleterre a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il fallait pour qu'il y eut \"dedication\" que l'intention de donner au public le droit de jouir de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme chemin fut bien \u00e9vidente. Poole v. Huskinson[12].\nVoil\u00e0 les circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette th\u00e9orie de la dedication et Lord Blackburn, toujours dans cette cause de Mann v. Brodie,11 disait de cette th\u00e9orie du droit anglais qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas la\nperfection of reason or such as ought to be introduced in the law of Scotland,\net alors la Chambre des Lords d\u00e9cidait la cause de Mann v. Brodie11 en appliquant la prescription de quarante ans, telle qu'elle existait en Ecosse. Voir Macpherson v. Scottish[13].\nDans la province d'Ontario et dans les autres provinces de droit anglais, la th\u00e9orie de la \"dedication\" est en force. Les lois municipales de Qu\u00e9bec ont, je le sais, copi\u00e9 en grande partie celles d'Ontario. Mais il ne faudrait pas conclure de l\u00e0 que toutes les lois anglaises sur la mati\u00e8re, et notamment la doctrine de la \"dedication,\" sont devenues incorpor\u00e9es dans notre l\u00e9gislation et que nous ne devons pas rechercher si dans l'exercice de certains droits no as ne violons des principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de nos propres lois telles que nous les retrouvons dans notre code civil ou encore dans notre code municipal. Si la Chambre des Lords ne voulait pas, dans la cause de Mann v. Brodie,[14] introduire en Ecosse la th\u00e9orie de la \"dedication\" parce qu'elle \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur des circonstances que Ton ne retrouvait pas en Ecosse, il me semble que nous sommes justifiables de voir si nous ne violentons pas quelques principes de notre droit an l'appliquant ici. Ainsi, dans Qu\u00e9bec comme en Ecosse, nous avons une prescription \u00e0 p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Elle est de quarante ans en Ecosse: elle est de trente ans chez nous (art. 2242 C.C.). Si en raison d'une p\u00e9riode certaine dans la prescription en Ecosse la Chambre des Lords refusait d'y introduire la \"dedication,\" n'y a-t-il pas raison de faire la m\u00eame chose pour une cause dans Qu\u00e9bec.\nLes corporations municipales sont r\u00e9gies par les lois affectant les individus, dit l'article 356 du code civil. Elles ne peuvent devenir propri\u00e9taires que de la mani\u00e8re \u00e9dict\u00e9e par les lois sp\u00e9ciales qui les r\u00e9gissent ou par la loi commune (article 358 C.C.). Le code municipal n'indique nulle part que la \"dedication\" est reconnue et accept\u00e9e. Les seuls articles qui peuvent s'en rapprocher sont les articles 749 et 750 de l'ancien code municipal qui sont maintenant l'article 464 du nouveau code et dont je reparlerai plus loin.\nL'appelant Gauvreau pr\u00e9tend qu'il y a eu de la part de Page abandon ou donation du terrain sur lequel est assis le chemin. Or peut-on faire une donation d'immeubles sans titre? L'article 776 du code civil d\u00e9clare que les actes portant donations entre vifs doivent \u00eatre notari\u00e9s \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9. Cette disposition formelle du code dispose, je crois, de la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant. Si on s'avise de consid\u00e9rer r\u00e9tablissement de la route comme une servitude sur le terrain de l'intim\u00e9, on se trouvera encore en contravention formelle avec l'article 549 du code civil qui d\u00e9clare que nulle servitude ne peut s'\u00e9tablir sans titre.\nMais on dit: La th\u00e9orie de la \"dedication\" est accept\u00e9e dans Qu\u00e9bec par une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions qui remontent \u00e0 la cause de Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9,[15] et qui comprennent De la Chevroti\u00e8re v. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al,[16] d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9, et Rhodes v. P\u00e9russe,[17] d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par cette cour.\nLa cause de Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e915 soulevait \u00e0 la fois la question de la prescription trentenaire, celle de l'application de l'acte 18 V., ch. 100, et celle de la \"dedication.\" Le jug\u00e9, tel que nous le retrouvons dans les rapports judiciaires, est\nque tout chemin ouvert et fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 comme tel sans contestation par le public pendant l'espace de dix ans et au del\u00e0 doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un chemin public et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement reconnu chemin public suivant l'esprit de la loi.\nOn a \u00e9videmment appliqu\u00e9 dans cette cause la loi de 1855, 18 V., qui y est d'ailleurs discut\u00e9e longuement. Incidemment dans ses notes l'honorable juge-en-chef a mentionn\u00e9 avec approbation la prescription trentenaire et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi qu'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e peut devenir propri\u00e9t\u00e9 publique par la dedication. Mais ce dernier point ne para\u00eet pas \u00eatre celui sur lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la cause. C'est un obiter dictum.\nCans la cause de De la Chevroti\u00e8re v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, (1) Lord Fitzgerald, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 un statut sp\u00e9cial qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 et qui a servi de base \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision, dit les paroles suivantes, que je consid\u00e8re aussi comme obiter dictum.\nThere has been made out independently of any statutory provision an ample case of user on the one side and dedication or abandonment on the other which would constitute the place in question a public place over which the public at large had rights which the law would give effect to independently of the provisions of any statute.\nDans la cause de Rhodes v. P\u00e9russe[18], l'honorable juge-en-chef de cette cour, qui a rendu le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour, a discut\u00e9 la question de prescription trentenaire qui se soulevait et la question de \"dedication;\" mais la rue dont il s'agissait avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte en vertu d'une obligation formelle impos\u00e9e par la Couronne au concessionnaire. Il ne s'agissait pas l\u00e0 d'une donation par le propri\u00e9taire d'une partie de son terrain, mais de l'\u00e9xecution d'une obligation de sa part.\nDans aucune de ces causes, on ne para\u00eet pas avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 formellement si un propri\u00e9taire peut faire donation de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour un chemin sans qu'il fasse un acte \u00e0 cet effet.\nS'il n'y avait aucune disposition formelle dans nos codes sur la mati\u00e8re, je comprendrais la force de l'opinion que la \"dedication\" peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e. Mais les corporations municipales sont r\u00e9gies, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, par les lois affectant les individus; et elles n'ont pas d'autres privil\u00e8ges que ceux qui leur sont reconnus formellement par la loi et les droits incompatibles avec une disposition de nos lois ne sauraient \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par elles.\nJe pourrais r\u00e9f\u00e9rer sur ce point \u00e0 la discussion lumineuse faite par Sir Louis-Hyppolite Lafontaine dans la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre cause de Wilcox v. Wilcox[19]. En admettant m\u00eame que la \"dedication\" existerait dans Qu\u00e9bec, je crois que la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en la pr\u00e9sente cause ne d\u00e9montre pas clairement que les Page, grand-p\u00e8re, p\u00e8re et fils, aient jamais eu l'intention d'abandonner leur terrain \u00e0 la corporation municipale.\nJe serais d'opinion que cette preuve d\u00e9montre tout au plus que cette route a \u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9e comme chemin de tol\u00e9rance sous les dispositions des articles 749 et 750 de l'ancien code municipal (art. 464 du nouveau code). Cette route est cl\u00f4tur\u00e9e de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'exception d'un petit espace o\u00f9 se trouvent la maison et ses d\u00e9pendances, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 habituellement ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 ses extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s et elle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 entretenue par le propri\u00e9taire. Elle a, en d'autres termes, les traits caract\u00e9ristiques d'un chemin de tol\u00e9rance et serait par l\u00e0 m\u00eame un chemin public; mais, comme le disent ces articles, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce chemin appartiendrait au propri\u00e9taire, l'intim\u00e9. L'appelant ne pouvait donc pas avec la simple permission de la corporation municipale y creuser un puits et le relier au moyen d'un tuyau avec sa maison. C'\u00e9taient l\u00e0 des actes de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui demandaient l'autorisation du propri\u00e9taire du sol.\nPRESCRIPTION TRENTENAIRE.\nEn vertu de l'article 2242 du code civil, les droits et actions dont la prescription n'est pas autrement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e se prescrivent par trente ans. Or, dit l'appelant, le public a eu possession de ce chemin depuis plus de trente ans; par cons\u00e9quent, il y a prescription.\nL'article 2193 C.C. nous \u00e9nonce les conditions requises pour prescrire au moyen de la possession. Il faut qu'elle soit continue et non interrompue, paisible, publique, non \u00e9quivoque et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire.\nLa possession qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause r\u00e9unit plusieurs des conditions n\u00e9cessaires; mais elle me para\u00eet \u00e9quivoque et manque alors d'une qualit\u00e9 essentielle. Le propri\u00e9taire a toujours fait lui-m\u00eame tous les travaux d'entretien, de r\u00e9paration et de construction sur ce chemin.\nLa situation serait diff\u00e9rente si la corporation municipale avait elle-m\u00eame fait ses travaux ou en avait ordonn\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution. (Proudhon, Domaine public, vol. 2, p. 369). Cette route \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e non-seulement par le public; mais le propri\u00e9taire l'utilisait surtout pour l'exploitation de sa ferme et de son magasin. Dalloz, vo. Prescription n\u00b0 333, dit en parlant de la prescription que les corporations municipales peuvent invoquer:\nPour prescrire contre un de ses habitants des terres vaines et Vagues, une commune a besoin d'une possession ut universi et exclusive; la possession simultan\u00e9e du propri\u00e9taire fait obstacle \u00e0 cette prescription.\nBeaudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 25, n\u00b0 289, en discutant cette question de possession, dit:\nDes actes de jouissance qui ne porteraient que sur des produits isol\u00e9s d'un fonds ou sur certains avantages d'un fonds ne constitueraient encore qu'une possession \u00e9quivoque, insuffisante pour faire acqu\u00e9rir par prescription la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du fonds; tels seraient certains faits de passage, de puisage, de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de mat\u00e9riaux.\nDalloz, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Prescription n\u00b0 203; Aubry Rau, 5e \u00e9dition, p. 137, par. 137, et p. 538, par. 217.\nPRESCRIPTION DECENNALE.\nL'appellant invoque \u00e0 l'appui de la prescription d\u00e9cennale, la loi 18 V., ch. 100, s. 41, s.s. 9. Les sous-sections 8 et 9 reli\u00e9es ensemble par la conjonction et: 8. Tout chemin d\u00e9clar\u00e9 grand chemin public par un proc\u00e8s-verbal, r\u00e8glement ou ordre d'un grand voyer, pr\u00e9fet, commissaire, ou conseil municipal, l\u00e9galement dress\u00e9 et en vigueur au moment o\u00f9 cet acte entrera en op\u00e9ration, sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme chemin suivant l'esprit de cet acte, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il en soit autrement ordonn\u00e9 par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente;\n9. Et tout chemin ouvert et fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 comme tel par le public sans contestation de son droit, pendant l'espace de dix ann\u00e9es ou plus, sera cens\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement reconnu comme grand chemin public par quelque autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente comme sus-dit, et \u00eatre un chemin suivant l'esprit de cet acte.\nCette sous-section 9 fait partie de l'Acte des Municipalit\u00e9s et des Chemins. Apr\u00e8s plusieurs tentatives plus ou moins fructueuses d'\u00e9tablir des autorit\u00e9s municipales dans le Bas-Canada, la l\u00e9gislature, en 1855, a adopt\u00e9 cette loi des municipalit\u00e9s et des chemins, qui a \u00e9tabli l'organisation municipale qui est encore maintenue, dans ses grandes lignes, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le l\u00e9gislateur, par cette loi, mettait l'administration de la voirie sous le contr\u00f4le des autorit\u00e9s municipales et il cr\u00e9ait en m\u00eame temps les conseils municipaux. Jusque vers cette \u00e9poque l'administration de la voirie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le grand voyer, et le l\u00e9gislateur a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'enlever cette juridiction \u00e0 cet officier pour la mettre entre les mains de personnes qui seraient \u00e9lues directement par le peuple.\nOn voulait \u00e9videmment, par les textes que nous venons de citer, d\u00e9terminer quels \u00e9taient les chemins qui allaient tomber sous le contr\u00f4le de ce nouveau corps public qui s'appelait le conseil municipal.\nPar la sous-section 8, tous les chemins dont on avait les proc\u00e8s-verbaux devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme chemins publics; et quant \u00e0 ceux au sujet desquels on ne pourrait pas produire d'ordonnance, alors le fait qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverts pendant dix ans serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une preuve suffisante de leur qualit\u00e9 de chemins publics. La loi de 1855 \u00e9tait refondue en 1861 ; mais on ne trouve l\u00e0 aucune trace de la sous-section 9 de la section 41 de l'acte de 1855. Nous ne la retrouvons pas non plus dans le code municipal, fait en 1870. Pourquoi? C'est que, suivant moi, cette disposition de la loi de 1855 n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que pour affecter les chemins alors existants; et il n'y avait pas lieu, par cons\u00e9quent, de continuer \u00e0 l'ins\u00e9rer dans les statuts. C'\u00e9tait une loi essentiellement temporaire.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que la route en question existait en 1845, c'est-\u00e0-dire dix ans avant la loi de 1855. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'appelant ne peut pas s'autoriser de cette loi pour invoquer la prescription d\u00e9cennale.\nDans ces circonstances, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le jugement de la cour d'appel qui a maintenu Faction n\u00e9gatoire de servitude de l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nL'appelant devra avoir jusqu'au 15 juin prochain pour combler le puits et enlever les tuyaux.\nMignault J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9 poursuit l'appelant, par action n\u00e9gatoire, all\u00e9guant qu'il est propri\u00e9taire des lots 2, 3 (partie) 4, 5, 6, 6a et 7 du cadastre de St-Octave-de-M\u00e9tis; que l'appelant est propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble contigu, et qu'il exerce sans droit une servitude de puisage d'eau sur l'immeuble de l'intim\u00e9; et l'intim\u00e9 demande que son immeuble soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 franc et clair de toute telle servitude et qu'il soit fait d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'appelant de l'exercer \u00e0 l'avenir.\nL'appelant conteste cette action, et all\u00e8gue que les lots 6 et 6a o\u00f9 se trouvent le puits et les tuyaux d'aqueduc de l'appelant n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et sont depuis plus de quarante ans un chemin public par \"d\u00e9dicace,\" usage par le public et destination de l'intim\u00e9 et de ses auteurs, et il conclut au renvoi de l'action. Par un amendement, l'appelant invoque \u00e0 l'encontre de Faction de l'intim\u00e9 la prescription trentenaire, sans dire au profit de qui cette prescription serait acquise.\nL'action de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, mais ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel,[20] et l'appelant nous demande de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nLa seule question discut\u00e9e par ces arr\u00eats est la question, qui assur\u00e9ment n'est pas nouvelle, de savoir si le terrain o\u00f9 l'appelant pr\u00e9tend exercer le droit de puisage d'eau, est devenu un chemin public par la destination du propri\u00e9taire, ou par la prescription trentenaire, et toutes les d\u00e9cisions, tr\u00e8s nombreuses, de nos tribunaux sur la destination comme moyen d'\u00e9tablir un chemin public ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es. C'est la seule d\u00e9fense que l'appelant oppose \u00e0 Faction de l'intim\u00e9, et cette d\u00e9fense lui \u00e9tait ouverte, car si elle est bein fond\u00e9e, et si le terrain en question n'appartient pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, son action n\u00e9gatoire, fond\u00e9e sur son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, manque absolument de base juridique.\nAussi bri\u00e8vement que possible\u2014car j'ai dit que la question telle que pos\u00e9e n'est pas nouvelle\u2014j'exposerai les conclusions que je crois devoir adopter.\nEt d'abord la prescription trentenaire\u2014si vraiment on peut l'invoquer sous le code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec comme moyen d'\u00e9tablir un chemin public\u2014ne me para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Cette prescription est n\u00e9cessairement fond\u00e9e sur la possession, laquelle, aux termes de l'article 2193 C.C., doit \u00eatre continue et non interrompue, paisible, publi- que, non \u00e9quivoque et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire. Le public qui circule librement dans un chemin ne peut \u00eatre regard\u00e9, \u00e0 mon avis, comme ayant poss\u00e9d\u00e9 ce chemin, et si m\u00eame il avait une sorte de possession, on ne pourrait dire, surtout dans l'esp\u00e8ce soumise, que cette possession est non \u00e9quivoque et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire. C'est tout au plus une possession promiscue, et aucun de ceux qui passent dans le chemin ne fait par l\u00e0 un acte de propri\u00e9taire. Notre loi \u00e9carte la prescription comme mode d'acquisition des servitudes, tandis que le code Napol\u00e9on l'admet avec certaines restrictions, ce qui peut probablement expliquer quelques opinions d'auteurs en France; et je ne puis croire que par des actes de passage r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, qui seraient impuissants \u00e0 cr\u00e9er la servitude de passage, et qui ne seraient pas la possession exig\u00e9e par l'article 2193, on puisse transformer, par la prescription, un terrain particulier en un chemin public. D'ailleurs la prescription doit \u00eatre plaid\u00e9e et ne peut l'\u00eatre \u00e0 mon avis que par celui au profit de qui elle a couru, et l'appelant n'est pas dans ce cas.\nMais envisageant la prescription qu'invoque l'appelant comme se confondant r\u00e9ellement avec la destination du terrain en question comme chemin public, je vais en quelques mots expliquer les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce.\nIl y a \u00e0 St-Octave-de-M\u00e9tis deux chemins qui se croisent \u00e0 angle droit, le chemin de front ou chemin maritime et la route de l'\u00e9glise ou chemin Kempt. Le grand-p\u00e8re de l'intim\u00e9, Henry Page, avait un terrain donnant sur les deux chemins, et ayant construit une r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 quelque distance de ces chemins, il ouvrait une route communiquant aux deux et passant devant sa maison qui existe encore. Cette route para\u00eet avoir toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte aux deux bouts, sauf qu'on pr\u00e9tend que Page la fermait en hiver en plantant des piquets aux deux entr\u00e9es, et elle \u00e9tait cl\u00f4tur\u00e9e de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, si ce n'est devant la maison et la grange de Page o\u00f9 il n'y avait cl\u00f4ture que d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9. Jusqu'\u00e0 il y a environ trente ans le bureau de poste de la localit\u00e9 \u00e9tait dans la maison de Page, et celui-ci y tenait \u00e9galement un magasin. Le public passait librement dans ce chemin, tant pour atteindre le magasin et le bureau de poste, que pour raccourcir la route quand on allait du chemin maritime au chemin Kempt et r\u00e9ciproquement. Le chemin a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 entretenu par les Page, mais, dans l'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1916, la municipalit\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 quelqu'un pour y \u00e9tendre un peu de sable. Quand le cadastre de la paroisse fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en 1877 ou 1878 par le t\u00e9moin Lepage, William Page, fils de Henry Page et p\u00e8re de l'intim\u00e9, lui fournit des renseignements au sujet de ces terrains, et Lepage donna un num\u00e9ro sur le plan officiel au chemin, en raison, dit-il, des renseignements qu'il re\u00e7ut de Page.\nEn 1881, William Page a vendu \u00e0 la m\u00e8re de l'appelant un emplacement situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'angle du chemin Page et du chemin maritime, qui est le terrain desservi par l'aqueduc dont l'intim\u00e9 se plaint. L'acte de vente d\u00e9crit l'emplacement comme \u00e9tant\nle long de la petite route se trouvant sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur.\nCette petite route est celle qu'on all\u00e8gue \u00eatre devenue un chemin public, et l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la description qu'en fait l'acte d\u00e9montre que William Page r\u00e9clamait, en 1881, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce chemin.\nTels sont assez bri\u00e8vement les faits saillants sur lesquels on se base pour soutenir que le chemin Page est devenu chemin public par destination de propri\u00e9taire. Il n'y a pas de controverse quant \u00e0 ces faits, et tout d\u00e9pend des conclusions ou inferences qu'il convient d'en tirer.\nLa cr\u00e9ation d'un chemin public par destination ou par \"d\u00e9dicace,\" comme on l'appelle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue en la province de Qu\u00e9bec, peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 tort, par une longue suite d'arr\u00eats, mais elle suppose n\u00e9cessairement, comme tout acte d'abandon de droits, une volont\u00e9 non \u00e9quivoque du propri\u00e9taire du terrain d'abandonner ce terrain au public. Cette volont\u00e9 non \u00e9quivoque me para\u00eet manquer ici, car l'ouverture de la route s'explique par la situation de la maison de Henry Page et par le fait qu'il y tenait un magasin et le bureau de poste, et il devait n\u00e9cessairement, tant pour ses propres besoins que pour permettre \u00e0 sa client\u00e8le et au public de se rendre \u00e0 son magasin et au bureau de poste, \u00e9tablir une voie de communication pour y arriver. Que l'on ait souvent pass\u00e9 tout droit pour raccourcir la route entre le chemin maritime et le chemin Kempt n'emp\u00eache nullement que l'intention de Page n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement de donner acc\u00e8s chez lui et d\u00e9montrerait tout au plus que Page ne contr\u00f4lait pas rigoureusement la circulation dans son chemin.\nOn invoque dans cette cause, comme on le fait d'ordinaire, la loi 18 Vict., ch. 100, art. 9. Dans la cause de Harvey v. Dominion Textile Co.[21] mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin, a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante \u00e0 mon avis que cette loi qui date de 1855\u2014si vraiment ce n'est pas une disposition d'une nature purement transitoire\u2014ne peut s'appliquer qu'aux routes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvertes au public dix ans avant sa passation. J'accepte cette interpr\u00e9tation et il s'ensuit que cette loi ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Mais je crois que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence ici d'un cas o\u00f9 les articles 749 et 750 (le second \u00e9tant la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du premier) du code municipal de 1870 s'appliquent, et que le chemin en question a tous les caract\u00e8res du chemin de tol\u00e9rance dont parlent ces articles. Mais, observation capitale qu'il convient de faire, le terrain d'un tel chemin reste la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de celui qui Ta ouvert, tandis que sous l'article 752 du code municipal le terrain des chemins municipaux ordinaires appartient \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9. Il faut avouer que la comparaison du texte des articles 749 et 750 et de l'article 752 de l'ancien code municipal (arts. 464 et 466 dans le nouveau code) n'est pas tr\u00e8s satisfaisante, car le chemin de tol\u00e9rance est un chemin municipal (art. 749) et pourtant, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence des chemins municipaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 752, son emplacement reste la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de celui qui l'a ouvert. Mais \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ici que les articles 749 et 750 s'appliquent, il en r\u00e9sulte que l'intim\u00e9 est propri\u00e9taire du terrain de cette route, et que le public (tant que le chemin n'est pas l\u00e9galement ferm\u00e9, et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire ici de dire si le propri\u00e9taire, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9, peut le fermer), a seulement le droit d'y passer. Ce droit de passer dans cette route ne donne pas \u00e0 l'appelant le droit d'y creuser un puits et d'y poser des tuyaux d'aqueduc. Il s'ensuit que le moyen de d\u00e9fense que l'appelant oppose \u00e0 l'action de l'intim\u00e9 est mal fond\u00e9.\nUne question que je r\u00e9serve, et sur laquelle il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce maintenant, est de savoir si on peut invoquer la doctrine d'origine anglaise de la \"d\u00e9dicace\" dans les localit\u00e9s auxquelles le code municipal s'applique. En d'autres termes, y a-t-il, dans ces localit\u00e9s, d'autre \"d\u00e9dicace\" que celle que reconnaissent les articles sus-cit\u00e9s du code municipal? Cette question est importante et je n'aurais certainement pas la pr\u00e9tention de la r\u00e9soudre avant qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le sujet d'une discussion compl\u00e8te devant nous.\nIl est regrettable que les parties, au lieu de soulever ce grand d\u00e9bat, n'aient pas pu s'entendre \u00e0 l'amiable, car c'est la tentative de l'appelant de s'approvisionner d'eau potable qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ce proc\u00e8s. L'intim\u00e9 ne para\u00eet souffrir aucun pr\u00e9judice par suite du puits et des tuyaux d'aqueduc de l'appelant, et avec un peu de bonne volont\u00e9 et sans sacrifier aucun droit r\u00e9el, les parties auraient pu vivre ensemble en bons voisins. Mais chacune d'elles s'en tient \u00e0 ses droits stricts et absolus, et comme l'appelant ne peut acqu\u00e9rir une servitude sans titre, et qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 contester le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, sa d\u00e9fense doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Je suis donc d'avis de confirmer le jugement de la cour d'appel avec d\u00e9pens. Le d\u00e9lai donn\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re cour pour remplir le puits, enlever les tuyaux et remettre le terrain dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'auparavant devrait \u00eatre \u00e9tendu jusqu'au 15 juin 1920.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tessier & Cot\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Gagnon, Sasseville & Gagnon.\n[1] Q.R. 27 K.B. 490.\n[2] 12 App. Cas. 149, at p. 157.\n[3] 6.

(Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam Strang and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1919: November 24, 25; 1920: February 3.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nCompany\u2014Payment for shares\u2014Loan to shareholders\u2014Action by shareholder\u2014Status.\nA company, with a capital of $100,000, was formed to take over the business of J.B.H. & Co., in Toronto. S., a merchant of Glasgow, Scot., subscribes for $51,000 worth of stock, it being agreed, as evidenced by a by-law of the company, that the money paid for it should be deposited with the firm of S. & Son, Glasgow, and used to finance the company\u2019s purchases in Europe. S. sent to Toronto his cheque for $51,000 and it was endorsed by the company and remitted to the Glasgow firm. Some years after J.B.H. started a new business, and his wife, a shareholder in the company, brought an action, on behalf of all shareholders, to compel S. to pay the $51,000 to the company, and for a declaration that S., who had been president of the company since its organization, had never qualified as a director and all the acts of the company were, therefore, illegal and void.\nHeld, that the plaintiff, a minority shareholder, could not maintain the action against the will of the majority after acquiescence in and benefit from the operations of the company and the agreement as to the disposition of the cheque for $51,000.\nHeld, also, Davies, C.J. dubitante and Duff J. expressing no opinion, that the cheque for $51,000 accepted by the company as such constituted a valid payment by S. for his 510 shares and its remittance to the firm of S. & Son was not a loan by the company of the amount to S., a shareholder, prohibited by sec. 29 of the Companies Act.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 215) reversing that at the trial (43 Ont. L.R. 617) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge[2] in favour of the plaintiff and dismissing the action.\nThe facts of this case are stated in the above head-note.\nHellmuth K.C. and Birmbaum for the appellant.\nNesbitt K.C. and Langmuir for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the close of the argument in this case I was not satisfied with the soundness of the judgment appealed from. Subsequent consideration of the facts has not removed my doubts, but as I am not clearly convinced that the judgment is unsound I will not dissent from the judgment now proposed, dismissing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant suing as a shareholder, as she does, asking the court to interfere with the internal management of a corporate company\u2019s affairs, must clearly establish that what she complains of is either something done ultra vires the powers of the company or such an oppressive and unjust exercise of the powers of the majority shareholders for the promotion of an advantage to themselves to the peculiar detriment of the minority, or that what is complained of is fraudulent. Whether or not there may be (of which I am doubtful) possible cases of an exceptional character founded on grounds beyond those I specify, in which the court can find any jurisdiction for giving relief to a single shareholder suing as appellant, does not matter, for those put forward herein either rest upon some one of the grounds I specify or fail entirely.\nThe J.B. Henderson & Co., Limited, now in question, and in which appellant is a shareholder, was incorporated on the 23rd September, 1909, under and by virtue of the first part of the (Dominion) Companies Act, ch. 79 of the R.S.C., 1906, for the following purposes and objects:\u2014\n(a) To purchase, acquire and take over the business heretofore carried on at the said City of Toronto by the said James Black Henderson under the name, style and firm of J.B. Henderson & Co. as Commission Agents and Dry Goods Merchants, and the good will thereof and the stock-in-trade, furniture and effects of the same.\n(b) To carry on the business, both wholesale and retail of general dry goods, merchants, drapers, haberdashers, milliners, dressmakers, tailors, furriers, lacemen, clothiershosiers, glovers and general outfitters.\n(c) To acquire, purchase, hold, sell, dispose of, supply, manufacture and produce all manner and kind of goods, wares and merchandise dealt in or appertaining or incidental to the business or any part of the business aforesaid, and to carry on as aforesaid the business of commission agents in all the lines of goods hereinbefore mentioned.\n(d) To acquire any business of the nature or character which the company is authorized to carry on and the good-will thereof.\n(e) To act as agents for traders, dealers and manufacturers of any goods, wares or merchandise of the nature or description hereinbefore mentioned.\n(f) To purchase, acquire, hold, lease and dispose of patent rights and licences and such motive and manufacturing powers or any interest therein as may be considered desirable or necessary for or in connection with the aforesaid objects of the Company.\n(g) To pay out of the funds of the Company the costs of and incidental to the incorporation, promotion and organization of the Company. The operations of the Company are to be carried on throughout the Dominion of Canada and elsewhere.\nThe capital stock of the said company was to be $100,000, divided into one thousand shares of $100 each. The respondent, William Strang, a merchant in Glasgow, Scotland, subscribed for a single share on the 20th Nov., 1909, at Toronto.\nThe husband of the appellant, who was the James Black Henderson referred to above, subscribed on the 15th Sept., 1909, for $23,500, and she, next day, for $1,000.\nThree other persons subscribed on said 15th Sept. for the respective sums of $5,000, $100, and $100.\nNo more was ever subscribed, except by said William Strang, who later subscribed for a sum which, with his first for one share, made a total of $51,000.\nThe stock in trade and goodwill of the Henderson business was taken over at the sum subscribed by him.\nThere were by-laws passed and directors elected constituting a Board consisting of the said William Strang, said J.B. Henderson, and one McJanet, who was an employee of the company, who had subscribed the said $5,000. Of these Strang was elected president and Henderson vice-president.\nBy-laws were duly adopted for carring on the business.\nThe foregoing outline presents all the leading features of the kind of the company which this was, and how it started about its business.\nThe said William Strang gave his cheque to the order of the company for the full amount of his stock in May, 1910. That cheque was duly acknowledged as payment for said shares and kept by said company in charge of its officers in Toronto and a stock certificate was issued by them on 25th August, 1910, to Strang for the full amount of five hundred and ten shares.\nThe cheque was then duly indorsed over by said Henderson, as vice-president, to the order of William Strang & Co., a firm carrying on business in Glasgow.\nIf that is not payment then there might be something to complain of.\nI agree with the learned trial judge and two of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal that it was payment.\nAnd it was none the less so because the cheque was so indorsed over to the firm which agreed to hold themselves liable for the due application of the amount to meet the engagements of the company in Great Britain and elsewhere abroad, in order to facilitate, both by cash advances and credits, the purchases and other dealings of the company in carrying on its business.\nNor was it less a payment because those thus getting it in due course chose, instead of going through the form of presenting it and getting the cash, to adjust the matter by a debit and credit account in their ledger.\nThe said firm seems to have had not only ample means but also credit in the commercial world to accomplish all that was had in view by all concerned.\nIn the result this mode of handling the business was continued for six or seven years on the most friendly and satisfactory terms to all concerned.\nThe business as a result became (when the war stress is considered) a more prosperous concern than the firm of Henderson & Co. could have hoped for, but for the aid thus furnished.\nThen there arose personal differences with Henderson, who, with two other persons, started in Toronto a business of their own. This suit seems to have been instituted by Henderson\u2019s wife to wreck the incorporated company and serve the ends of him and his new firm.\nAnd, as part of the scheme for doing so, the pretension is set up not only that there never was a payment of stock but also that as an incident of so holding the courts appealed to are also bound to hold that Strang never was qualified to act as a director and hence all done by the board null and void.\nWith a holding that the cheque so indorsed over, as already stated, not to him but to his firm, was a complete payment, these pretensions all fall.\nOne more claim is made in that alternative, and it is that the court must order the payment by said firm of the money to the company.\nWhy? For what end? Evidently not even the solemn, formal mockery of handing it back to officers who are in the result virtually the nominees of the man attacked, and who is a majority shareholder in the company, but apparently the petty purpose of wasting money in law costs and exchange and embarrassing the management of the business.\nIt is claimed the money thus held subject to calls to answer the requirements of the business abroad and for no other purpose, was a loan to William Strang and not to the firm, who are, inconsistently enough, also sued for its recovery, and therefore ultra vires as being in breach of the section of the Companies Act (sec. 29) which provides that\nthe Company shall in no case make any loan to any shareholder of the Company.\nThere was in no sense, such as comprehended in the statutory provision, a loan to William Strang, or indeed to any one else, but simply a mode adopted of carrying on the business of the company in the most economical and advantageous way possible to all concerned. And to execute that purpose, evidenced thereby, a system was adopted of making good reciprocally to each party concerned therein on a fair and equitable basis by due allowances on either part in the way of interest, instead of dividends and remittances thereof and cross remittances of earnings from money on deposit.\nTo any one reading the long agreement providing for every contingency that is therein set forth, nothing but an honest business effort to deal justly and conformably to the law is manifest.\nIf there had been anything in the way of simulation, as a basis of fraud in violation of the enactment invoked, it would have developed, in the actual operation of the scheme for years of accounting, something which appellant could have put forward to demonstrate that as fact beyond peradevnture there was a basis furnished for the court to lay hold of and act upon to prevent a violation of the statutory law invoked.\nIn the numerous accounts kept, rendered and produced in evidence there is nothing pointed to of that sort such as would support such a contention.\nIndeed counsel quite properly admitted there was no fraud, but insisted that the mere form was bad and hence ultra vires.\nI submit we must ever attempt to grasp, if we can, the substance, and not pursue the mere shadowy forms as a basis of action.\nThe appellant having acted for many years upon this assumption of an honest observance of the law, and recognized the course adopted as such, can hardly be permitted now to turn round and say that those co-operating with her for years were doing something else and she innocent.\nThey are both in the same relative position towards each other whether good or bad, legal or illegal.\nAnd if illegal she cannot be heard now to plead ignorance but must be held responsible for the position in which her husband, for example, has placed her. And that is to disqualify her from maintaining this action even if it had been well founded otherwise, as I hold it is not.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed on the short ground that the appellant, by her conduct, has precluded herself from attacking the transaction she now seeks to impeach.\nAssuming the transaction to be ultra vires, she could only maintain her status by shewing that the ends of justice required that she should be permitted to sue in her own name in opposition to the wishes of the majority of the shareholders.\nUnder the circumstances disclosed by the evidence I am forced to the conclusion that the appellant\u2019s claim has no foundation of substantial justice and that she has not made good her right to maintain the action in her own name.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The material facts of this case, as I read the evidence, are accurately and succintly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell.[3] For the reasons assigned by that learned judge, I am of the opinion that the shares allotted to Wm. Strang have been fully paid up and that for the sum of $51,000 in question the firm of Wm. Strang and Son, and not Wm. Strang as the holder of unpaid shares, is accountable to the J.B. Henderson Company. I cannot view all that took place\u2014the forwarding of Wm. Strang\u2019s cheque to the company\u2014the entry of payment in its books\u2014the indorsement of the cheque over to it by Wm. Strang & Son\u2014the solemn agreement executed by the members of that firm fixing the terms on which the $51,000 represented by the cheque should be held and dealt with by them\u2014as the mere sham and attempted evasion of the statute which the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas seems to consider it. A very substantial change was effected in the rights and obligations both of the company and of the firm of Wm. Strang & Son sufficient to put the reality of the transaction beyond question. The company\u2019s rights under the agreement against Wm. Strang & Son in respect of the $51,000 are consistent only with that sum being its property held for its benefit and purposes, as defined in that document, and therefore inconsistent with the company not having received payment of that amount from Wm. Strang, or with his being still its debtor for the same sum in respect of unpaid shares.\nWithout expressing a concluded opinion upon it, I incline, with all the appellate judges, to the view that if the transaction between the company and Wm. Strang & Son should be regarded as a loan, it would not be in contravention of s. 29 (2) of the Company\u2019s Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 79. But, for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, I concur in his view, which is also of Britton and Riddell JJ.,[4] that that transaction was not a loan but a \u201cdeposit on special terms,\u201d as Mr. Justice Riddell puts it, and as such entirely outside the statutory prohibition.\nI agree with the learned trial judge in his disposition of the grounds of claim which he has designated (b), (c), (d), and (f).[5]\nI would merely add that, if this action might have been maintainable by the J.B. Henderson Company, the evidence warrants an inference, if not of actual participation at least of such acquiescence by the present plaintiff in the acts which she now impeaches that \u201cthe necessity for the court doing justice\u201d, (Russell v. Wakefield Water Works Co.[6]; Towers v. African Tug Co.[7]; Fullerton v. Crawford[8]; would appear not to require that she should be allowed as a shareholder, suing on behalf of herself and all other shareholders (other than the individual defendant) of the defendant company, to assert its rights.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The two main questions here are the following:\u2014\n1. Did the respondent, William Strang, pay for the 510 shares which he agreed to take in J.B. Henderson & Co., Limited?\n2. Was the agreement signed on the 24th August, 1910, between J.B. Henderson & Co., Limited, and William Strang and Son, ultra vires of the company?\nOn the first question, the finding of the learned trial judge was that William Strang did pay for his shares, the learned judges of the Appellate Division being equally divided as to this payment, although they all agreed that the judgment should be reversed.\nThe facts of the case are not at all complicated, although a great mass of evidence both documentary and by witnesses has been placed in the record. It appears that for some years Mr. James Black Henderson of Toronto was the Canadian purchasing and selling agent of the Scotch firm of William Strang & Son, of Glasgow, Scotland, composed of Mr. William Strang and four of his brothers. In the summer of 1909, Henderson was in rather poor health, and William Strang being in Toronto, it was decided to form a joint stock company to take over Henderson\u2019s business, under the name of J.B. Henderson & Co., Limited. William Strang desired to have a controlling interest in this company, which was natural as it was to handle his firm\u2019s goods, and upon its formation, with a capital of $100,000, he subscribed for 501 shares, representing $51,000, at par. Henderson, on the other hand, sold to the new company his stock-in-trade and good will for $23,500, taking in payment 235 fully paid shares. The other stock subscribers were W.G. McJanet, 50 shares or $5,000; Albert E. Weston, one share or $100; Robina Stark, one share or $100 and Mrs. J.B. Henderson (Henderson\u2019s wife, the present plaintiff) ten shares or $1,000.\nAll parties fully recognized that the authorized capital of the company was more than it required to carry on its business, and as its purchases of goods were almost entirely to be made in Europe, and principally from the firm of William Strang & Son, it was also evident and fully admitted by the interested parties that adequate financial arrangements would have to be made in Europe in order to buy goods there on the most advantageous terms. Several schemes were devised and discussed and finally it was agreed that the stock subscribed by all save William Strang would be issued as preference stock, entitled to a six per cent. dividend, and that William Strang\u2019s stock would be issued as common stock. And as to William Strang\u2019s stock, inasmuch as he was advised that it would have to be paid, he agreed to send over to the company his cheque for $51,000, or its equivalent in sterling, it being understood that the company would indorse the cheque and remit it to William Strang & Son as a special deposit free from interest, where it would serve to finance purchases made by the company on the European market, the company paying interest at six per cent. on all sums withdrawn by it, or advanced by William Strang & Sons on account of purchases made by the Company. William Strang was not to be entitled to interest on his $51,000, and no dividend was to be payable on his common stock until the six per cent. on the preference stock had been paid, and then the latter stock would rank equally with the common stock on any dividend that might be declared.\nThis arrangement was duly carried out and authorized by a by-law of the company and by a contract made by it with William Strang & Son. The question now is\u2014and it must be remembered that this question is raised, not by a creditor of the company, but by a shareholder\u2014whether what was done is equivalent to a payment by William Strang of the stock subscribed by him.\nHad William Strang\u2019s cheque been cashed by the company, and had the latter immediately remitted the sum of $51,000 to William Strang & Son as a special deposit in accordance with the arrangement made, it could not have been contended that William Strang had not paid for his stock, whatever opinion might be entertained with regard to the deposit of this sum with William Strang & Son. But by cashing William Strang\u2019s cheque and remitting the proceeds to William Strang & Son, the company would have incurred expenses for exchange and brokerage, and this expense it avoided and absolutely the same result was attained by indorsing over William Strang\u2019s cheque to William Strang & Son. There is no question whatever as to the absolute good faith of all the parties, and this being so, I cannot but think that William Strang paid for his stock as effectually as he would have done had his cheque been cashed by the company and the proceeds remitted to William Strang & Son. And, in my opinion, this conclusion is fully supported by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Larocque v. Beauchemin.[9]\nI am therefore of opinion that William Strang paid for his shares.\nThe question whether the arrangement arrived at was ultra vires of the company should, in my judgment, be answered in the negative. I cannot look upon the deposit of William Strang\u2019s cheque with William Strang & Son as being a loan to a shareholder. It was what it purported to be, a mere deposit for the benefit of the company, in order to secure the most advantageous terms for its purchases on the European market. And moreover the firm of William Strang & Son was, by the law of Scotland, duly proved in this case, a legal entity entirely distinct from William Strang personally. I also fail to see in such a deposit, although it was of a large part, even the greater part, of the company\u2019s capital, anything beyond the powers of the company. Two things must be remembered here. First there is no suggestion of bad faith or fraud, nor of any prejudice suffered by the creditors of the company or by its shareholders, all of whom agreed to the arrangement. Secondly, the firm of William Strang & Son is a legal entity distinct from William Strang personally. Had that firm been a corporation or a bank\u2014and had it acted as banker as well as vendor in its relations with the company\u2014I cannot imagine that it could be contended that by making a deposit of the sum paid by William Strang for his shares under such an arrangement, the company exceeded its powers. And inasmuch as the firm of William Strang & Son is an entity distinct from William Strang personally, in the absence of any suggestion of fraud, I cannot see that William Strang\u2019s interest in the firm\u2014whatever it may be\u2014affects the validity of the transaction any more than it would have affected it had this firm been a corporation or a bank in which William Strang had shares. The stipulation that the company should pay six per cent. interest on any withdrawals out of the sum of $51,000 would have been very objectionable if the contract had been made with William Strang personally for it would have given Strang interest on his common stock if the company took possession of its own moneys, irrespective of the declaration of any dividend. But this stipulation was made with a third party, and the appellant does not suggest any intent to defraud creditors of the company or its shareholders.\nThe contention is however made in the appellant\u2019s factum that the agreement entered into was wholly for the benefit of William Strang as majority shareholder, and that it was oppressive on the minority shareholders. I cannot view it as such. On the contrary, I think that the arrangement was most advantageous for the company, and, if any shareholders derived therefrom more benefit than others, it was the minority shareholders, whose stock was preference stock entitled to a dividend of six per cent. before any distribution of profits and in such distribution or dividend the holders of the preference stock shared on the same basis as William Strang, holder of the common stock. It is obvious, moreover, that the company through this arrangement was enabled to purchase its goods on the European market on much better terms than if the settlement for each purchase had to be made separately by the acceptance and negotiation of drafts through the vendor\u2019s bank. After nine years only, on account of some trouble between Henderson and Strang, is the complaint made that this contract was ultra vires, and this complaint is by a shareholder who has benefited thereby and not by a creditor of the company. In my opinion, in view of the circumstances of the case, this appeal should not be entertained.\nAs a consequence, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Watson, Smoke, Smith & Sinclair.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n[1] 45 Ont.

V., c. 63.\nThe appellant appeals from an order of the Board of Commerce of Canada dated 6th of February, 1920. The Board, after declaring newsprint to be \"a necessary of life\", by clause 1 prohibits the appellant from taking any price exceeding $80 per ton for newsprint, and declares that any price in excess of that sum \"shall be deemed to include unfair profit;\" by clause 2, it forbids the appellant accumulating and withholding from sale any quantity of newsprint beyond an amount reasonably required for the ordinary purposes of its business; and by clause 4, the appellant is required by the Board to furnish at certain times and at fixed prices defined quantities of newsprint to designated purchasers.\nHeld, Brodeur J. expressing no opinion, that clauses 1 and 2 of the order had not been made by the Board in the exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it by \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" as newsprint could not be deemed to be \"a necessary of life.\" Ejusdem generis rule applied.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014\"The Combines and Fair Prices Act\" is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nHeld also, that clause 4 of the order could not have been deemed necessary \"by reason of the existence of real * * * war * * * for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada,\" and that an order-in-council purporting to confer on the Paper Controller jurisdiction to make it therefore, transcended the power vested in the Governor-in-Council by s. 6 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\" Mignault J. dissenting. Per Idington J.\u2014The control of newsprint has to do neither with \"trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture,\" nor with the \"appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof,\" and is therefore not within the ambit of s. 6 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\" \"Pulp and Paper Control\" was improperly reserved from the repeal, on December 20th, 1919, of orders-in-council passed under that statute.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014While the statute 9 & 10 Geo.

The Order purports to have been made by the Board in the exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it by \"The Board of Commerce Act\" and \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" and also of jurisdiction formerly exercised by Mr. R.

That any price on the sale of roll newsprint exceeding eighty dollars per ton car lots shall be deemed to include an unfair profit and the said company is hereby, and until the further order of this board, restrained and prohibited from the making or taking of unfair profits for or upon the holding or disposition of said necessary of life, to wit, newsprint; that is to say at any price which is to be deemed as aforesaid to include an unfair profit.\n2. That the said company be and it is hereby restrained and prohibited from accumulating and withholding from sale as aforesaid any quantity beyond amounts aforesaid of the said necessary of life, namely, newsprint.\nAnd further specifically directed the appellant forthwith not later than the 10th February, 1920, to ship free on board cars one car standard newsprint as described consigned to the Montreal Star newspaper at Montreal, at the price of $80 a ton, and thereafter weekly as prescribed; and each of two other publishing companies in Montreal, quantities of paper as described at same price and on same terms.\nThe order recites as follows:\u2014\nThat Price Brothers and Company, Limited, hereinafter called the company, are under obligation to supply newsprint to Canadian publishers at the rate of eleven thousand two hundred and fifty tons per annum at prices heretofore lawfully fixed:\nAnd that the company is now supplying newsprint to Canadian publishers at the rate of approximately two thousand five hundred tons per annum, but has not delivered further supplies in Canada under its said obligation;\nAnd that newsprint is a necessary of life under \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\"\nAnd that the said company is accumulating and withholding from sale the said necessary of life beyond an amount thereof reasonably required for the ordinary purpose of the business of the said company;\nAnd the undersigned deeming it expedient in exercise of the powers and authority of the Board of Commerce under \"The Board of Commerce Act\" and under \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" and under and by virtue of the order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council concerning paper control dated 29th January, 1920, and numbered P.C. 230 to order and declare as herein set forth.\nThe said order in council dated 29th January, 1920, is as follows:\u2014\nHis Excellency the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, is pleased to order and it is hereby ordered that until the publication of a Proclamation by the Governor General in Council under the Authority of the \"War Measures act, 1914,\" declaring that war no longer exists the Board of Commerce of Canada, shall\u2014\n(a) have, exercise and perform all powers, jurisdiction, authority and duties which were heretofore or are exercisable by the Commissioner and Controller of Paper, provided that the Orders of said Board with respect to newsprint paper, sulphate and sulphide, shall be effective and have the force of law as and when made and shall not require confirmation by Order in Council, nor shall the exercise by said Board of any of said powers or the performance by said Board of any of said duties, be subject to appeal except as by the Board of Commerce Act provided;\n(b) be appointed such Commissioner and Controller of Paper;\n(c) have jurisdiction, power and authority to direct, require and compel shipment by manufacturers of newsprint paper of such quantities of newsprint paper as, in the opinion of the Board, are necessary and can be provided from any paper mill or persons, place or places in Canada;\n(d) shall have power and jurisdiction to order and direct that the breach or non-observance by any person or corporation of any order or direction which the said Board may make or give under authority of this Order shall entail the same consequences and liability for the same penalties as are provided by section 20, subsection (2) of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, including the cumulative responsibilities of co-directors and associate directors and officers of companies and corporations, and that all other provisions of law as to the jurisdiction of courts and otherwise as to procedure to enforce orders as set forth in the said Acts shall apply to all matters hereunder; and shall have all powers and authority to continue and carry on to completion all business and proceedings now pending in the office of the Commissioner and Controller of paper.\nThe \"War Measures Act\" of 1914 was assented to on the 22nd August, 1914, and the only war then in existence and to which it doubtless related, was that which shortly before that time had begun with Germany and Austria.\nPractically that ended with the Armistice of 11th November, 1918, but it must be held in law to have existed until the signing of the Treaty of Peace.\nThat was declared by an Imperial Proclamation to have taken place on the 29th of June, 1919. The assent of Germany had been given the day before, and later that of Austria was given on the 10th day of September, 1919.\nThe 6th section of the \"War Measures Act\" is that which enabled the Governor in Council to\nmake from time to time such orders and regulations as he may, by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nand that specifically assigns a number of subject matters as within the classes of subjects intended to be comprehended therein.\nTrue the section provides for and anticipates a possibly wider range of subjects, but for the present purpose I have not heard of any such having arisen.\nThat which we have to deal with, if by any reasonable possibility at all within the operative ambit of the Act, I think must fall within subsection (e) which reads as follows:\u2014\n(e) trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture; It certainly is not covered by either \"exportation\" or \"importation.\" Nor can it fall within such\" trading\" as conceivably within the range of what a war measure often has to deal with and forbid or enforce if reason is at all applicable as I hold it must be to deal sensibly with the madness of war and all implied therein.\nI have much difficulty in seeing how anything in subsec. (e) can apply to the mere direction of selling newsprint paper by a manufacturer thereof to a person wishing to use it. Indeed, after much consideration, I cannot think how that purely business transaction of a very ordinary type can be said to have any relevancy to the matters therein specified of possibly vital importance in many ways conceivable in a state of war.\nSubsection (f): appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof,\nclearly extends only to the taking and using of private property in such a way as the authorities concerned may require to meet the exigencies of the case.\nThe entire item certainly does not cover anything comprehended in what we have to consider in way of regulating the private dealings between parties carrying on their respective businesses.\nIndeed the argument of counsel referred only to the possibilities of mystery and secrecy which might arise and could not reasonably ever be disclosed, but in fact the time therefor has ceased and it is hard to conceive that it ever existed in relation to what is here in question. Nothing forbidding the disclosure in a free country would seem to have existed in that which is involved herein. Then, from the point of view of the \"War Measures Act,\" we come to the order in council of 20th December, 1919, which I submit recognizes to the fullest extent the termination of the war, yet strangely excepts from the general operation of all such orders and regulations as needed therefor and are to be repealed, the item of \"pulp and paper control\"\u2014with eight other items.\nI can conceive of problems in way of liquidation, as it were, of such items, as \"internment operations\" and \"trading with the enemy,\" requiring a reservation, but I am quite unable to conceive how the item of \"Pulp and Paper control\" can fall therein or thereunder.\nEach transaction relative thereto had been already liquidated by the delivery of paper and payment therefor.\nIn the last desperate resort, as it were, the justification for the order is rested upon \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" and the powers of the Board of Commerce thereunder.\nSection 16 of said Act reads as follows:\u2014\n16. For the purposes of this part of this Act, the expression \"necessary of life\" means a staple and ordinary article of food (whether fresh, preserved, canned, or otherwise treated) clothing and fuel, including the products, materials and ingredients from or of which any thereof are in whole or in part manufactured, composed, derived or made, and such articles of any description as the Board may from time to time by special regulation prescribe.\nI am unable to understand how newsprint can under such a definition of \"necessaries of life\" fall thereunder, or anything the Board of Commerce by any due observance of the ejusdem generis rule, which must be adhered to, in the interpretation and construction thereof, may see fit to include within the definition, can be held as falling thereunder. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the order in council now in question cannot be properly maintained and hence that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014A careful review of all the considerations presented on the argument has only confirmed my opinion that the fourth paragraph of the Order impeached on the appeal cannot be sustained as emanating from any authority given by the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\"\nIn this connection the sole point requiring examination is that which arises out of Mr. Biggar's contention in his admirable argument that orders-in-council made by the Governor-General in Council professedly under the authority of section 6 of that Act are not judicially revisable. I think such orders are reviewable, in this sense that when in a proper proceeding the validity of them is called into question, it is the duty of a court of justice to consider and decide whether the conditions of jurisdiction are fulfilled and if they are not being fulfilled, to pronounce the sentence of the law upon the illegal order.\nOne of the conditions of jurisdiction is, in my judgment, that the Governor in Council shall decide that the particular measure in question is necessary or advisable for reasons which have some relation to the perils actual or possible of real or apprehended war\u2014(I leave the case of insurrection out of view as having no relevancy) or as having some relation to the prosecution of the war or the objects of it.\nThe recitals of the order of the 20th December are I think in themselves sufficient to constrain any court to the conclusion that the Order of the 29th January was not preceded or accompanied by any such decision.\nAs to the first and second paragraphs of the order of the Board of Commerce, I adhere without any doubt whatever to the opinion expressed in the course of the argument that the classes of articles which the Board is authorized to bring by regulation within the category \"necessaries of life\" do not comprehend articles which are not necessarily by reason of their value required for some purposes connected with the physical life of the individual.\nAnglin J.\u2014Price Bros. & Co., Limited, appeal from an order of the Board of Commerce, dated the 6th of February, 1920, by leave of a judge of this court granted under s. 41 (2) of \"The Board of Commerce Act,\" 9 & 10 Geo. V.., c. 37. The order purports to have been made by the Board in the exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it by \"The Board of Commerce Act\" and \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act.\" (9 & 10 Geo. V., c. 45) and also of jurisdiction formerly exercised by Mr. R. A. Pringle, K.C., as Paper Controller, which His Excellency the Governor-in-Council purported to vest, in a modified and extended form, in the Board of Commerce by order-in-council dated the 29th of January, 1920.\nWhile several questions are formulated in the petition on which leave to appeal was obtained, they all seem to resolve themselves into one\u2014the power of the Board to make the impugned order. Three clauses of it\u2014Nos. 1, 2 and 4\u2014are especially challenged. Clause No. 1 prohibits the appellant from taking any price exceeding $80 per ton for newsprint, declaring that any price in excess of that sum \"shall\nbe deemed to include unfair profit.\" Clause No. 2 forbids the appellant accumulating and withholding from sale any quantity of newsprint beyond an amount reasonably required for the ordinary purposes of its business. These two clauses are upheld by counsel representing the Attorney General of Canada on the ground that newsprint was rightly declared by the Board to be \"a necessary of life\" within s. 16 of \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" and that as such the Board was empowered to deal with it as it did in those clauses.\nThe argument covered a wide field, the constitutionality of both statutes involved being challenged and various questions discussed as to the construction and sufficiency of the findings of fact in the order. In the view I take of the matter, however, it seems necessary only to consider on this branch of the case whether the finding or declaration that newsprint is a necessary of life within s. 16 of \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act\" can be upheld. If it cannot, the jurisdiction of the Board to make clauses 1 and 2 of its order cannot be maintained under that Act and \"The Board of Commerce Act\"; so far as they may be supported under any powers vested in the Board as Paper Controller they may be more conveniently considered with clause 4, which, it is common ground, can be supported only under the latter powers.\nBy clause 4 the appellant is required to furnish at certain times to named purchasers and at fixed prices defined quantities of newsprint. The appellant challenges the power of Parliament to confer jurisdiction to make such an order on the ground that it involves an undoubted invasion of the field of \"property and civil rights\" assigned by the B.N.A. Act to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces; and it also maintains that the orders-in-council under which the Board has acted were not authorized by the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" (5 Geo. V., c. 2) under which they purport to have been made. I find it unnecessary to pass upon the alleged invasion of provincial rights and therefore refrain from any expression of opinion upon it. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[1].\nBy sec. 5 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" it is enacted that war (by which, I take it, is meant the \"real war\" during which, only, under sec. 3, s. 6 is in force) declared to have existed since the 4th day of August, 1914,\nshall be deemed to exist until the Governor-in-Council by proclamation published in the Canada Gazette declares that it no longer exists.\nIt is common ground that such a proclamation has not yet been made or published. Therefore \"real war\" is still existing for the purposes of s. 3; and s. 6 is consequently still in force.\nNow s. 6 empowers the Governor-in-Council to make such orders and regulations\nas he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada;\nand in particular in regard to\ntrading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture\nand\nappropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof,\nAssuming the validity of this legislation both as being restricted to a field within s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act and as not involving a delegation of powers beyond the competence of Parliament, whether the orders-in-council on which the Board must rely to justify the exercise of the powers which it asserts as Paper Controller are within its purview must still be considered.\nIn view of the provisions of the statute, 9 & 10 Geo. V., c. 63, I think the validity of the orders-in-council therein recited is probably not now open to question on the ground that they transcend the jurisdiction which the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" purports to confer on the Governor-in-Council; and it may also perhaps be assumed that Parliament thereby recognized the office of \"Commissioner and Controller of Paper\" as one not personal to Mr. Pringle but as an office which would continue, should he resign or be removed therefrom, and might thereupon be filled by appointment of the Governor-in-Council. But, having regard to the apparent purpose of that statute, to its title and recital and to the use in s. 1 of the past participle \"begun\" and the omission of any such future perfect adjectival phrase as \"which shall have been begun,\" I cannot think it was intended thereby to enlarge the scope of the jurisdiction, intended to be conferred on the Governor-in-Council by the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" or to enable the Paper Controller to exercise powers greater or more extended that under that Act the Governor-in-Council is authorized to vest in him, or to extend his powers further than might be necessary to carry to completion and final disposition work begun by him within powers for conferring which the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" rightly construed may be invoked as authority. In particular, I cannot regard the statute of 1919 (c. 63) as repealing or dispensing with the condition expressed in s. 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" that orders and regulations made thereunder must be such as the Governor-in-Council\nmay by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, or welfare of Canada.\nIf that Act was designed to authorize the Paper Controller, whether directly or through the medium of an order-in-council, to interfere with property and civil rights, as the Board purports to do by the order appealed from, its constitutionality would certainly call for very grave consideration.\nPassing over as not material several intervening orders-in-council\u2014one of the 7th of July, 1919, one of the 1st of December, 1919, one of the 15th December, 1919, and two of the 5th of January, 1920, providing means for making orders of the Paper Controller effective, one of the 30th of December, 1919, approving orders of the Controller fixing prices on newsprint from, the 1st of January to the 1st of July, 1920, two of the 22nd of January, 1920, accepting Mr. Pringle's resignation and appointing Mr. W. R. Breadner in his stead and one of the 29th of January accepting Mr. Breadner's resignation, we come to the vitally important order-in-council\u2014that of the 29th of January, 1920, appointing the Board of Commerce as Paper Controller with extended powers and jurisdiction. The approval of the Governor-in-Council, therefore required before orders of the Paper Controller became effective, was thereby dispensed with, and the appeal to the Paper Controller Tribunal, established under order-in-council of the 16th of September, 1918, was abolished. In lieu thereof the orders and acts of the Board as Paper Controller were made subject to appeal only as provided by \"The Board of Commerce Act,\" under which the present appeal is brought. In addition to\nall powers, jurisdiction, authorities and duties * * * heretofore exercisable by the Commissioner and Controller of Paper.\nthe Board was expressly vested with\njurisdiction, power and authority to direct, require and compel shipment by manufacturers of newsprint paper of such quantities of newsprint paper as, in the opinion of the Board, are necessary and can be provided from any paper mill or persons, place or places in Canada.\nI shall assume that the terms of this order-in-council, if valid, are wide enough to clothe the Board with power to make its order of the 6th of February, now appealed from. To support that order, so far as it depends on the Board's jurisdiction as Paper Controller, it is essential that the order-in-council now under consideration should be maintained. In so far as it provides for the appointment of the Board as Paper Controller and purports to confer on it powers necessary to carry to completion matters begun by the Paper Controller before the 7th of July, 1919, (when c. 63 of the statutes of that year was assented to) its validity may be assumed. But the Board's order of the 6th of February is not restricted to such matters. On the contrary it deals with distinctly new matters\u2014matters not theretofore begun\u2014the fixing of the price of newsprint and its accumulation by Price Bros. from the date of the order until the 15th of March and the supply of that commodity by Price Bros. in fixed quantities and at fixed prices to certain consumers for future periods. Can the validity of an order-in-council passed on the 20th of January, 1920, under the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" conferring power to make such an order be maintained? The common knowledge possessed by every man on the street, of which courts of justice cannot divest themselves, makes it impossible to believe that the Governor-in-Council on the 29th of January, 1920, deemed it\nnecessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order, or welfare of Canada * * * by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection.\nto confer on the Paper Controller such powers as the Board has purported to exercise by its order now in appeal. Advisability or necessity, however great, arising out of post-war conditions is not the same thing as, and should not be confounded with advisability or necessity\nby reason of the existence of real or apprehended war.\nReal war had long since ceased, although, in a fictitious sense, the continued existence of it for some purposes is provided for by s. 5 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\" That in passing the order-in-council of the 29th of January, 1920, the Governor-in-Council was actuated by any apprehension of war, invasion or insurrection is not suggested.\nIf further evidence were needed that the Governor-in-Council was apprised that emergency legislation by orders-in-council was no longer necessary or advisable by reason of the existence of war, it is furnished by his own order-in-council of the 20th of December, 1919, which recites that \"so far as affects the question under consideration\" (i.e., the duration of emergency legislation by orders-in-council) the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act (Con.), 1914, of the United Kingdom (5 & 6 Geo. V., c. 8) and of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" while varying considerably, \"were enacted for the same purpsoes\"\u2014that a legal committee appointed in England by His Majesty's Government had reported that the legislative powers conferred on the Government by the former Act\ncan be exercised only during the war and that the orders and regulations made by the Government under the statute could not have any valid operation after the termination of the war,\nand also that\nthe powers are given by reason of the national emergency and vest the Executive with an authority so wide that we think it must have been intended only to exist during the existence of the emergency.\nThe order-in-council of the 20th of December further recites that:\nIt must be realized that although no proclamation has yet been issued declaring that the war no longer exists actual war conditions have in fact long ago ceased to exist, and consequently existence of war cannot longer be urged as a reason in fact for maintaining these extraordinary regulations as necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order, and welfare of Canada.\nIt is true that, while many orders-in-council passed under the \"War. Measures Act, 1914,\" were repealed by the order-in-council containing these recitals, the orders-in-council respecting \"Pulp and Paper Control\" were directed to remain in force, as were those respecting some eight other subjects; but this may have been\u2014probably was\u2014because, as in the case of \"Internment Operations\" for instance, it was necessary to carry to completion and wind up work and undertakings begun during the war and still unfinished.\nIn view of the foregoing facts, however, in my opinion it cannot be suggested, without imputing bad faith to the Governor-in-Council, that in making the order-in-Council of the 29th of January, 1920, he professed to do something which he\ndeemed necessary or advisable for the * * * security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection.\nIt is noteworthy that, under the opening paragraph of that order-in-council, the powers which it purports to confer on the Board are to be exercised not so long as the Governor-in-Council deems necessary for the security, etc., of Canada by reason of the existence of war, but\nuntil the publication of a proclamation by the Governor-in-Council under the authority of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" declaring that the war no longer exists.\nA very strong indication is thus afforded that the Governor-in-Council must have acted in January, 1920, under the erronous impression\u2014I say it with all respect\u2014that until the actual publication of a peace proclamation in the Canada Gazette his legislative powers under s. 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" were absolute and unqualified and were not subject to the condition that their exercise must be deemed by him\nnecessary or advisable for the security, etc. of Canada by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection.\nConfronted with the alternatives of an imputation of bad faith or of finding that there has been an attempted exercise of power through overlooking, or under a mistaken view as to the effect of, a condition requisite for its exercise imposed by the Act conferring it, I have no hesitation in choosing the latter. I am therefore of the opinion that the order appealed from exceeds any powers which it was competent for the Governor-in-Council on the 29th of January, 1920, to confer on the Paper Controller, and cannot be supported under the Board's jurisdiction to discharge the duties of that office.\nOn the other branch of the case I am of the opinion that the Board erred in declaring newsprint to be a \"necessary of life\" under s. 16 of \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act\" and that it therefore exceeded its jurisdiction as administrator of that Act in making the order appealed from. Sec. 16 is as follows:\u2014\n16. For the purposes of this part of this Act the expression \"Necessary of life\" means a staple and ordinary article of food (whether fresh, preserved, canned or otherwise treated), clothing and (sic) fuel, including the products, materials and ingredients from or of which any part thereof are in whole or in part manufactured, composed, derived or made, and such other articles of any description as the Board may from time to time by special regulation prescribe.\nThe following three rules of construction are so well known that it seems almost pedantic to re-state them; but their co-ordination and relations inter se are perhaps not always equally well understood.\nLord Wensleydale's golden rule, that the grammatical and ordinary sense of words is to be adhered to unless that would lead to some absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency so great as to convince the court that the intention could not have been to use them in that ordinary signification, applies to general words, as to other words. Generalia verba sunt generaliter intelligenda, 3 Inst. c. 21, p. 76; Attorney General v. Mercer[2]. On the other hand general words must be restricted to the fitness of the subject matter (Bacon's Maxims, No. 10) and to the actual apparent objects of the Act (River Wear Commissioners v. A damson[3], following the intent of the Legislature to be \"gathered from the necessity of the matter and according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretion.\" Stradling v. Morgan[4]; Cox v. Hakes[5].\nWhere general words are found, especially in a statute, following an enumeration of persons or things all susceptible of being regarded as specimens of a single genus or category, but not exhaustive thereof their construction should be restricted to things of that class or category (Reg. v. Edmunston[6], unless it is reasonably clear from the context or the general scope and purview of the Act that Parliament intended that they should be given a broader signification.\nRecent applications of the rule last stated, and usually known as the ejusdem generis rule, are to be found in the judgments in the House of Lords in Stott (Baltic) Steamers, Ltd., v. Marten[7], and the judgment of Sankey J. in Attorney General v. Brown[8].\nAt first blush the words \"of any description\" appended to the general words \"other articles\" would almost seem to have been inserted to indicate an intention to exclude the application to this section of the ejusdem generis rule, and to require that the general words \"other articles\" should here be given their ordinary general construction. Yet, although no authority has been cited where that rule has been applied notwithstanding the addition of the words \"of any description\" to such general words as \"other articles,\" it has frequently been acted on where the equally comprehensive word \"whatsoever\" (see Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 2 ed., p. 223) has been appended to similar general words, such as \"other persons.\" Thus, in construing the phrase \"no tradesman, artificer, workman, labourer, or other person whatsoever\" of the Sunday Observance Act of 1677 it has been held that a farmer (Reg. v. Cleworth[9], a barber (Palmer v. Snow)[10] and a coach proprietor (Sandiman v. Breach)[11] are not within its purview. In Fish v. Jesson[12], a devise of \"all debts, accounts, reckonings and demands whatsoever,\" made to a servant, was held not to include a trunk belonging to the testator in his hands at the date of the will and at the death of the testator which contained jewels, medals, etc. Again in Harrison v. Blackburn[13], the description in a bill of sale\u2014\nall the household goods, furniture, stock-in-trade, and other household effects * * * in and about the dwelling-house and all other personal estate whatsoever.\nof the assignor\u2014was held not to carry his term or interest in the house. In Ystradyfodwg & Pontypridd Main Sewerage Board v. Bensied[14], Lord Halsbury referred to\na very familiar canon of construction that, where you have a word which may have a general meaning wider than that which was intended by the legislature, when you find it associated with other words which shew the category within which it is to come, it is cut down and overridden according to the general proposition which is familiarly described as the ejusdem generis principle. In the present case far from indicating that an application of the restrictive rule would probably defeat the object of the statute or that there is good reason for believing that the legislature intended the general words it has used to bear a more extended meaning than if restricted to things similar in kind to those by the enumeration of which they are preceded, consideration of the character of the Act and of the context as a whole rather leads to the contrary view\u2014that Parliament cannot have meant that words the \"other articles\" should bear their ordinary broad signification. In the first place, if they did, the enumeration of articles of food, clothing and fuel was quite unnecessary and the restriction to articles \"staple and ordinary,\" the careful particularization of\nthe products, materials and ingredients from or of which any thereof are in whole or in part manufactured, composed, derived or made\nand the specification, in the case of food,\nwhether fresh, preserved, canned or otherwise treated,\nserve no purpose. If the words \"other articles of any description\" mean \"anything whatsoever,\" the section may be paraphrased thus: \"Necessary of life\" means any article of any description which the Board of Commerce may from time to time by special regulation declare to be such. Can it be that that is what Parliament intended? Re Stockport Ragged, Industrial and Reformatory Schools[15].\nMoreover, if s. 17, taken with s. 28, should be regarded as an enactment in the nature of criminal law\u2014as counsel representing the Attorney General contended, and I incline to think rightly\u2014the Board would thus be enabled by its mere declaration to render criminal the accumulation or withholding from sale, to the extent stated in s. 17, of any article whatever, however little likely to be regarded as a necessary of life as that term is ordinarily understood. It is to me inconceivable that Parliament meant to confer such wide and unheard of powers. I rather think that no one would be more surprised and shocked than the legislators themselves were they informed that they had done so. I am therefore satisfied that Parliament must have intended that the words \"other articles of any description\" in sec. 16, notwithstanding their obvious and emphasized generality, should receive a much more restricted construction; and no other restriction that can be put upon them occurs to me which has so much to commend it, as being probably that which Parliament had in mind, as that embodied in the well-known maxim noscuntur a sociis. Parliament was dealing with articles of food, clothing and fuel. It had these present to its mind. It must be taken to have been fully cognizant of the legal maxim just quoted and of its embodiment in the ejusdem generis rule of construction so frequently acted on by the courts. What more natural than that it should have meant \"other articles\" to comprise only things which like food, clothing and fuel are requisite to maintain the physical health and vitality of the human body? Medicines have been suggested as falling within such a category; and there are, no doubt, some few other things essential to the life, health and sustenance of the body which are not strictly articles of food, clothing or fuel for which Parliament thought it well to provide, I cannot conceive of any genus or category that would include newsprint with articles of food, clothing and fuel. Nor, in my opinion, had there been no definition whatever of the term \"necessary of life,\" would the Board have been justified in treating newsprint as such.\nEven restricted as I think it should be, the discretion vested in the Board by its mere declaration to constitute criminal offences in regard to matters not specified by Parliament may seem open to some objection. But it is certainly much less objectionable than the unlimited and unqualified power for which counsel representing the Attorney General contended.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the order appealed from cannot be sustained either under the jurisdiction of the Board of Commerce as administrator of the Combines and Fair Prices Act or under that which it may lawfully exercise as Paper Controller.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an appeal by Price Brothers & Co. from an order of the Board of Commerce passed on the 6th of February, 1920, by which they were restrained from accumulating newsprint and were ordered to sell their goods to three Montreal publishers.\nThis order was made under the provisions of the \"War Measures Act\" of 1914 and under \"The Board of Commerce Act\" and \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act of 1914.\nIt is contended on the part of the appellants that the Board was without jurisdiction for making such an order and that it was beyond the powers of the Dominion Parliament to make or authorize it.\nThe Attorney General upholds the legality and the validity of the order and claims that the power of the Federal Parliament to look after the defence of the country rendered valid any legislation passed for the purpose of regulating the channels through which a particular commodity should move and the price at which it could be sold. He would consider that the Federal Parliament could then secure to newspapers an adequate supply of paper, and that such legislation would be a measure of defence.\nThe \"War Measures Act\" of 1914 on which the order in question is based was very wide. But it never contemplated that the price at which newspapers would be supplied with their raw material should be fixed by the Government or by some other authority.\nThe Act contemplated measures that would be rendered necessary for the defence of the country, as the censorship of the news, the arrest, detention and deportation of undesirable persons or of enemy subjects, the levy of an army, the control of the transport by land, air and water, the control of the food for war purposes and maintaining the forces. But it seems to me that it requires a great deal of imagination to include in those war measures the supply of newsprint to the press, and especially the exact price at which the newspapers should be supplied \"with paper.\nIt is certainly not what Parliament intended to authorize when they gave the Governor-in-Council the power to pass orders-in-council of the nature of defensive measures.\nBesides these powers could be exercised only during the war. We have in the record proclamations stating formally that in the opinion of the Government the state of war has ceased to exist. The order which is attacked being posterior to the declarations made that the war is at an end, it was passed at a time when the power, if it ever legally existed, had ceased to have force and effect. It is contended by the Attorney General that the Federal Parliament, in view of its power to regulate trade and commerce, could pass the legislation embodied in the Acts in question.\nThe words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" may cover a very large field of possible legislation and there has been much discussion as to their limits. They were first considered in the Parsons Case[16] in 1881; and there it was stated that these words in their unlimited sense would include every regulation of trade ranging from commercial treaties with foreign governments down to minute rules for regulating particular trades, but a consideration of the context and of other parts shews that these words should not be used in their unlimited sense. The collocation of the regulation of Trade and Commerce with classes of subjects of national and general concern affords an indication that regulations relating to general trade and commerce were in the mind of those who framed the \"British North America Act\".\nViews to the same effect have been expressed by the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[17] and in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[18].\nThe last case where this power of regulating trade and commerce has been considered by the Privy Council, is Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta (Insurance Reference)[19]; and it was held there that\nthe regulation of Trade and Commerce does not extend to the regulation of a particular trade.\nIn \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" there is an attempt to regulate the trade of those who are engaged in (the trade of necessaries of life, as there was an attempt in the Insurance Legislation to regulate the trade of those engaged in the business of insurance.\nThat power cannot, in view of the above decisions, be exercised by the Federal Parliament.\nOn the whole, I have come to the conclusion that the Board of Commerce has no jurisdiction to pass the order of the 6th of February, 1920, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMignault J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal, by leave of a judge of this court, on certain questions as to the jurisdiction of the Board of Commerce of Canada to make the order complained of by the appellant. The Attorney General of Canada appeared to defend the order, and the questions of jurisdiction submitted were exhaustively argued.\nThe main provisions of this order are preceded by a kind of preamble stating that the appellant is under obligation to supply newsprint to Canadian publishers at the rate of 11,250 tons per annum at prices heretofore lawfully fixed, but is now supplying it at the rate approximately of 2,500 tons per annum, and has not delivered further supplies in Canada; that newsprint is a necessary of life under \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act;\" that the appellant is accumulating and withholding the said necessary of life beyond an amount thereof reasonably required for the ordinary purposes of its business; and it is declared that the Board of Commerce deems it expedient, in the exercise of its powers and authority under \"The Board of Commerce Act,\" and \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act\" and under and by virtue of the Order-in-Council of the Governor General-in-Council concerning paper control, dated 29th January, 1920, and numbered P.C. 230, to order and declare as follows: 1. That any price on the sale of roll newsprint exceeding eighty dollars per ton car lots shall be deemed to include an unfair profit and the said Company is hereby, and until the further order of this Board, restrained and prohibited from the making or taking of unfair profits for or upon the holding or disposition of said necessary of life, to wit, newsprint, that is to say at any price which is to be deemed as aforesaid to include an unfair profit.\n2. That the said Company be and it is hereby restrained and prohibited from accumulating and withholding from sale as aforesaid any quantity beyond amounts aforesaid of the said necessary of life, namely, newsprint.\n3. The clauses above numbered 1 and 2, are to be deemed interim provisions and are to remain in force until the fifteenth day of March, 1920, with leave to the Company to move to rescind them and to any other person concerned to renew and extend the said provisions.\n4. Under the special authority vested in the undersigned by virtue of said Order in Council and otherwise existing under the said Acts the undersigned direct that the said Price Brothers and Company Limited, do\u2014\n(a) Forthwith and not later than the tenth day of February, 1920, ship Free on Board cars on the railway at or near by a mill of the said Company one car standard newsprint 32 lb. basis, 72 inch rolls, 33 inches diameter, pulpwood cores with metal ends consigned to the publishers of The Montreal Star newspaper at Montreal, Quebec, freight charges collect, at the price of eighty dollars per ton, bill of lading to be attached to bill of exchange, and that the said Company do thereafter in each and every period of seven days computed from time to time from and including the said tenth day of February make such shipments of the like commodity to the said consignee in the same manner and on the same terms in all respects so that the said publishers shall receive in all 93 tons of said newsprint in each and every consecutive period of seven days so computed until further order; the carload first herein mentioned is to be included in computing the first week's shipment of 93 tons.\n(b) Forthwith and not later than the tenth day of February, 1920, ship Free on Board Cars on the railway at or near by a mill of the said Company one car standard newsprint 32 lbs. basis, consisting of 30 rolls, 16\u00be inches, and the balance of the said cars in rolls 33\u00bd inch all of said rolls to be from 30 to 32 inches in diameter, 3 inch iron cores consigned to The Herald Publishing Company, Limited, Montreal, Qubeec, freight charges collect at the price of eighty dollars per ton, bill of lading to be attached to bill of exchange, and that the said Company do thereafter in each and every period of ten days from and including said tenth day of February make such shipments of the like commodity to the said consignee in the same manner and on the same terms, so that the said The Herald Publishing Company, Limited, shall receive one car load composed as aforesaid of said newsprint in each and every consecutive period of ten days computed from said tenth day of February, until further order.\n(c) That the said Company do forthwith ship from a mill as aforesaid consigned to Poirier, Bessette and Cie, 129-133 Rue Cadieux, Montreal, one car load standard newsprint 32 lb. basis, consisting of 29 inch rolls, diameter from 30 to 33 inches, with paper cores from 3 to 4 inches, the price and terms and means of shipment and payment to be as aforesaid, and each month hereafter on or before tenth day thereof the said Price Brothers and Company, Limited, shall make a like shipment to said consignees in the same manner and on the same terms.\nThe petition for leave to appeal submits seven questions which, in so far as they involve the jurisdiction of the Board, can be reduced to two:\n1. Was the order in question authorized by the Dominion Parliament? and\n2. Had the Dominion Parliament power to authorize it?\nIf the answer to either question be in the negative, the Board must be held to have acted without jurisdiction, and if a negative answer be given to the first question, it will be unnecessary to reply to the second.\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the order involve the question whether newsprint is a necessary of life under \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act,\" 1919, (9 & 10 Geo. V., ch. 45). It is so declared in the order appealed from.\nThe definition of \"necessary of life\" is given by section 16 of the statute in the following terms:\nFor the purposes of this part of this Act, the expression 'necessary of life', means a staple and ordinary article of food (whether fresh, preserved, canned, or otherwise treated), clothing and fuel, including the products, materials and ingredients from or of which any thereof are in whole or in part manufactured, composed, derived or made, and such other articles of any description as the Board may from time to time by special regulation prescribe.\nIt is obvious from this definition that in the contemplation of Parliament necessaries of life are primarily articles necessary to sustain life, as distinguished from luxuries. Being necessaries of life, and the requirements of human life being of infinite variety, they cannot be confined to staple and ordinary articles of food, clothing and fuel, and as it was impossible to enumerate them, the Board was given the power from time to time to declare \"such other articles of any description\" as it might from time to time by special regulation prescribe, to be necessaries of life. It is argued that the ejusdem generis rule should be applied here and that the defining power of the Board should be restricted to articles of the same kind as staple and ordinary articles of food, clothing and fuel. But to so hold would defeat the will of Parliament, for, as I have said, the requirements of human life vary ad infinitum, and it would not be difficult to enumerate articles useful or necessary for the purposes of human life which are neither food, nor clothing, nor fuel, such as medicine for the sick, crutches for the lame and eye glasses for persons with defective eyesight. I think the intention of Parliament to exclude the ejusdem generis, or noscitur a sociis rules is sufficiently shewn here by the words \"such other articles of any description\" (see Larsen v. Sylvester[20], where the House of Lords held that the ejusdem generis rule was excluded by the words, \"frosts, floods, strikes and any other unavoidable accidents or hindrances of what kind soever\"), and the general scheme of the Act is to entrust to the Board of Commerce the power of defining what articles, other than food, clothing and fuel, are necessaries of life, any complete or exclusive enumeration being impossible. I would not therefore cut down the generality of the terms of section 16 by resorting to the rule, undoubtedly very useful in many cases, that general terms following special ones are to be restricted to the kind of things specially enumerated. Moreover, if the ejusdem generis or noscitur a sociis rules apply, the powers of definition conferred upon the Board are entirely meaningless, for the enumerated articles alone could be considered necessaries of life.\nThis does not mean, however, that this power of definition must not be exercised reasonably, in other words that the articles which the Board declares to be necessaries of life should not have some relation to the requirements of human life, varied and difficult to define a priori though they may be. And I must say that I fail to discover any possible connection between the requirements of human life and newsprint paper. It even appears almost an abuse of language to call it a necessity of life. Whatever place newspapers may occupy in modern society, and it is no doubt a very important one, and however indispensable newsprint may be for educational and other like purposes, it certainly does not proximately or even remotely come within the class of things that can be used for the requirements of human life. I therefore am of opinion that the Board acted without jurisdiction in declaring it a necessary of life.\nThis conclusion shews that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order complained of cannot be supported under the authority of \"The Board of Commerce Act\" or \"The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919,\" and these paragraphs therefore were not authorized by Parliament. This being so, it is unnecessary to determine in this case whether Parliament could validly pass these two Acts.\nParagraph 4 of the order is based on different considerations and the authority of the Board of Commerce to order the supply of newsprint to the consumers therein mentioned can only be supported under the authority vested in the Board as Commissioner and Controller of Paper by virtue of the Order in Council of the 29th January, 1920, and the Orders in Council that preceded it.\nIt may be remarked that the office of Paper Controller was created at the height of the war by various Orders in Council adopted by the Governor General in Council, whereby the powers of the Controller were defined and gradually, as occasion required, increased. The powers, jurisdiction and authority of the Paper Controller were recognized and confirmed by the Dominion statute, 9 & 10 Geo. V., ch. 63, assented to on July 7th, 1919, and were continued until the publication in the Canada Gazette of a proclamation by the Governor in Council declaring that the war which commenced on the 4th August, 1914, no longer exists.\nThe Orders in Council concerning the Paper Controller and paper control were made by the Governor General in Council under the authority of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and were recognized as having been so made by the statute of 1919 above mentioned. This is a direct confirmation by Parliament of the authority exercised by the Governor General in Council under the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and in so far as the Orders in Council mentioned in the statute are concerned, certainly precludes any question whether in making them the Governor General in Council acted within the authority conferred by the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\" It is to be noted that the statute of 1919 was passed several months after the Armistice of the 11th November, 1918, had put an end to active military operations, and after the treaty of peace with Germany was signed, although before its ratification. Inasmuch however as the Governor General in Council made important orders after the passing of the statute of 1919 concerning paper control, among them that of the 29th January, 1920, on which paragraph 4 of the order in question is based, I will briefly examine whether the authority of the Governor General in Council can be sustained under the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\"\nMuch stress is laid on the words of section 6 of the Act empowering the Governor in Council to make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may, by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada. And it is argued that these powers can be exercised only during the existence of real or apprehended war and that no such condition now exists.\nIt appears sufficient to answer that by section 3 of the Act, the provisions of section 6 are only in force during war, invasion, or insurrection, real or apprehended; that by section 4, the issue of a proclamation by His Majesty, or under the authority of the Governor in Council, is conclusive evidence that war, invasion or insurrection, real or apprehended, exists and has existed for any period therein stated, and of its continuance until, by the issue of a further proclamation it is declared that it no longer exists; that by section 5 it is declared that war has continuously existed since the 4th day of August, 1914, and shall be deemed to exist until the Governor in Council by proclamation published in the Canada Gazette declares that it no longer exists; and that no such proclamation has yet been published. This, I take it, precludes us from holding that war having ceased, the jurisdiction of the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act can no longer be exercised.\nThe appellant also relies on the Order-in-Council of the 20th December, 1919. This Order in Council recites that a report from the Minister of Justice has been laid before the Governor General in Council,\ndirecting attention to the present situation with regard to the Government Orders and Regulations which were sanctioned under the authority of the War Measures Act, 1914, and which still remain in operation.\nThe report refers to the terms by which authority is conferred upon the Governor in Council by section 6 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and to the report made by the legal committee appointed in England to consider and report upon the interpretation of the term \"period of war,\" which report states that\nin our opinion the true construction of the section is that the regulations so issued can operate only during the continuance of the war. The purpose expressed is for securing the public safety and the defence of the realm, which we think mean the public safety so far as threatened by our enemies in the present war and the defence of the realm against these enemies. The powers are given by reason of the national emergency and vest the Executive with an authority so wide that we think it must have been intended only to exist during the existence of the emergency.\nThe Minister of Justice observes that the provisions of the Defence of the Realm (Con.) Act, 1914, of the United Kingdom, and of the \"War Measures Act, 1914\" of Canada, vary considerably, but so far as affects the question under consideration they were enacted for the same purpose, and the considerations upon which the opinion of the Committee proceeds are very pertinent to the question as to the operation of the Canadian Orders and Regulations. He adds: It must be realized that although no proclamation has yet been issued declaring that war no longer exists, actual war conditions have in fact long ago ceased to exist, and consequently the existence of war cannot longer be urged as a reason in fact for maintaining these extraordinary regulations as necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nThe Armistice which concluded hostilities became effective on the 11th November, 1918, the expeditionary force has since been withdrawn and demobilized and the country generally is devoting its energies to re-establishment in the ordinary avocations of peace.\nIn these circumstances the Minister considers that the time has arrived when the emergency Government legislation should cease to operate.\nThe report of the Minister of Justice apparently recommended the repeal of the emergency Government legislation generally, but it evidently was not acted upon in this wide sense, as is shewn by the enacting clause of the Order in Council which reads as follows:\nTherefore His Excellency the Governor General-in-Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, is pleased to repeal all Orders and Regulations of the Governor-in-Council which depend for their sanction upon section 6 of the War Measures Act, 1914, and the same are hereby repealed as from the first day of January, 1920, with the exception of the Orders and Regulations enumerated and included in the annexed schedule, which latter Orders and Regulations shall continue in force until the last day of the next session of Parliament.\nThe schedule enumerates nine subjects as to which the Orders in Council and regulations of the Governor-in-Council are to remain in force, among them, and the first in the list, \"pulp and paper control.\"\nI think therefore that the appellant can found no argument on this Order in Council of the 20th December, 1919. It obviously must be taken as a whole, and the report of the Minister of Justice must be read either as being subject to the exceptions made by the Order in Council, or as not having been adopted as to these exceptions. In other words, as to the excepted orders and regulations, the considerations expressed by the Minister do not apply. Even if the Order in Council could be given the absolute and sweeping effect contended for, it cannot, in so far as paper control is concerned, prevail against the express provisions of the statute of 1919.\nNor can this Order in Council be held to be, as was somewhat timidly suggested, the peace proclamation referred to in section 5 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and in the statute of 1919.\nIt would be a singular process of reasoning, if I may say so with deference, to apply an Order in Council with specific exceptions as if it had contained no such exceptions. This is not construing the Order in Council, it is striking out and disregarding some of its most material provisions.\nThe situation consequently is this; no peace proclamation as provided in the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and the statute of 1919 has been published and therefore, in so far as concerns paper control and the powers of the Paper Controller, the legal presumption of the existence of war, which I take to be juris et de jure, cannot be rebutted. That this legal presumption may be contrary to existing facts is a matter for the consideration of Parliament that enacted it, but not for a court of law which is bound by it. The anomaly of such a situation calls for action by Parliament or by the Governor in Council to bring it to an end, but no such action appears to me to be open to this court.\nI may add that a considerable number of Orders in Council are printed in the appeal book, notably one of the 3rd November, 1917, mentioned in the statute of 1919, and by which the Paper Controller was authorized to fix the price and distribution of newsprint paper. It cannot be said that any real departure from these Orders in Council is made by the Order in Council of the 29th January, 1920, but the same policy, as a measure adopted under the War Measures Act, 1914, has been continued, and the resistance of the appellant to this policy has led to the making of the order here in question.\nThe appellant cited two proclamations of His Majesty the King, published in the London Gazette of the 1st of July, 1919.\nThe first proclamation refers to the signing of the peace treaty with Germany, and orders that upon the exchange of the ratifications thereof, the said treaty of peace be inviolably observed.\nThe second proclamation states that whereas it has pleased Almighty God to bring to a close the late widespread and sanguinary war in which His Majesty was engaged with Germany and her allies, therefore His Majesty commands that a general thanksgiving to Almighty God for His manifold and great mercies be observed throughout His Majesty's Dominions on Sunday the sixth day of July then instant.\nSurely these proclamations cannot do away with the necessity of the proclamation of peace, required by the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and the statute of 1919. And it may further be added that by an Order of His Majesty the King in Council, dated the 9th day of February, 1920, and published in an extra of the Canada Gazette of March 29th, 1920, the war is declared terminated on the 10th day of January, 1920, only as to Germany and not as to the other belligerents. This shows that the proclamations published in the London Gazette on July 1st, 1919, cannot be given the effect contended for by the appellant.\nIt cannot be successfully contended that the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" transcends the powers of Parliament. It must therefore be given full effect and until it is repealed or until the peace proclamation is published, the authority of the Governor-in-Council to make these Orders in Council cannot de disputed. No question of encroachment on provincial powers of legislation under these circumstances can arise.\nIt has been argued that paper control has no connection with the purposes mentioned in the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" as justifying the Governor-in-Council in making the orders and regulations therein authorized. It seems to me that unless I am ready to impute bad faith to the Crown, I should not take upon myself to determine whether its orders are necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada. It is indeed conceivable that paper control may be very important in the national interest in the case of an emergency like war. I would, however, consider it sufficient to say in this case that no reason has been shown why this court should undertake to revise and set aside the discretion exercised by the Governor-in-Council under the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" in relation to the control of paper which discretion received the approval of Parliament, as shown by the statute of 1919.\nMy opinion consequently in that paragraph 4 of the Order in Council complained of is of binding force. I would however, for the reasons above stated, strike out paragraphs 1 and 2, allowing the appeal to that extent, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Prud'homme.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: O.

The Registrar.\u2014This a motion to affirm jurisdiction. The facts shortly are as follows:\u2014\nAn action was brought by Andrew H. D. Breakey et al. against the corporation of Metgermette-Nord in which the plaintiffs alleged:\n1. Les demandeurs sont contribuables de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse, port\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation comme propri\u00e9taires de bien-fonds imposables, pour une valeur consid\u00e9rable, et sont les plus grands propri\u00e9taires fonciers de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse, sans tenir compte des biens-fonds ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, et sont sp\u00e9cialement int\u00e9ress\u00e9s dans les affaires municipales de la d\u00e9fenderesse et sp\u00e9cialement dans le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation en vigueur.\n2. La corporation d\u00e9fenderesse a actuellement un r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation sur lequel elle se base pour faire ses r\u00e9partitions pour taxes municipales et qui sert \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des taxes impos\u00e9es par la corporation scolaire du m\u00eame endroit;\n3. Au mois de juillet dernier, les estimateurs de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse pr\u00e9par\u00e8rent un r\u00f4le, qui fut homologu\u00e9 au mois de septembre suivant et qui sera produit, en vertu duquel r\u00f4le la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse a tax\u00e9 et impos\u00e9 et a mis susceptible d'\u00eatre tax\u00e9s et impos\u00e9s et a mentionn\u00e9 sur le dit r\u00f4le, comme appartenant aux demandeurs en propri\u00e9t\u00e9, les lots suivants, savoir:\nRang 2, lots 17 et 18; rang 2, lot 25; rang 2, lot 33; rang 2, lot 34; rang 2, lot 35; rang 3, lot 16; rang 3, lot 58; rang 5, lot 1; rang 5, lot 2; rang 5, lots 8 et 9; rang 6, lot 5; rang 6, lot 6; rang 6, lot 7, rang 6, lot 8; rang 6, lot 10; rang 6, lot 9; rang 7, lot 9; rang 7, lot 29; rang 7, lot 33;\n4. Les demandeurs n'ont rien \u00e0 faire sur ces lots 17 et 18 du rang 2, n'\u00e9tant pas propri\u00e9taires, ni du fonds, ni de la coupe du bois.\n5. Les demandeurs ne sont pas propri\u00e9taires des lots 33 et 34 du rang 2, ni du fonds, ni de la coupe du bois.\n6. Les demandeurs ne sont pas propri\u00e9taires du lot 25, rang 2, n'ayant qu'un droit de flotter le bois.\n7. Les demandeurs ne poss\u00e8dent qu'un demi-acre, comme propri\u00e9taires sur la partie nord-est du lot 35, rang 2, dont la coupe sur la balance.\n8. Les demandeurs n'ont rien \u00e0 faire avec le lot 33 du rang 7, n'ayant ni la coupe ni le fonds.\n9. Quant aux autres lots ci-dessus d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, les demandeurs ne sont propri\u00e9taires que de la coupe de bois.\n10. Les demandeurs n'ont aucun droit de possession, ni d'occupation, et n'ont rien \u00e0 faire sur ces lots qui leur sont compl\u00e8tement \u00e9trangers, \u00e0 part ce que ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9. 11. La d\u00e9fenderesse pr\u00e9tend que les demandeurs sont propri\u00e9taires de la coupe de bois qui existe sur ces lots et elle a port\u00e9 ces diff\u00e9rents lots au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, pr\u00e9tendant avoir le droit d'\u00e9valuer les coupes de bois, s\u00e9par\u00e9ment du fonds, de consid\u00e9rer immeubles, au point de vue municipal, les susdits lots, en vue de taxer les demandeurs comme propri\u00e9taires de ces coupes de bois.\n12. En portant les demandeurs comme propri\u00e9taires de ces lots au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, sachant que les demandeurs ne l'\u00e9taient pas, mais pensant avoir le droit de taxer et d'\u00e9valuer, au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, des coupes de bois s\u00e9par\u00e9ment des fonds, la d\u00e9fenderesse a agi ill\u00e9galement sans droit et exc\u00e9dant ses pouvoirs.\nTo this the defendant pleaded:\n1. Ignore le paragraphe 1, la d\u00e9fenderesse d\u00e9clarant s'en tenir au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation.\n2. Admet le paragraphe 2.\n3. La paragraphe 3 est ni\u00e9, sauf quant \u00e0 l'existence et la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du r\u00f4le.\n4. Ignore les d\u00e9clarations mentionn\u00e9es au dernier paragraphe du paragraphe 3, et les paragraphes 4-5-6-7-8-9-10.\n5. Nie les paragraphes 11 et 12 de l'action.\n6. Aucune plainte n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e par les demandeurs lors de l'homologation du r\u00f4le; les demandeurs sont des absents qui n'ont nomm\u00e9 personne dans la municipalit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse et ni les \u00e9valuateurs ni la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peuvent se renseigner aupr\u00e8s d'eux dans la pr\u00e9paration de leur r\u00f4le.\nThe motion was argued before me on the basis that the question to be decided was whether or not a right to cut wood upon lands in the Province of Quebec had the effect of making the person having the privilege the owner of an immovable and therefore liable to be placed on the valuation roll as such owner; it would seem to me, however, that as to certain lots the plaintiffs distinctly allege that they have been placed upon the roll where they have not even a right to cut timber (see paragraphs 4, 5, 6), and as the plea neither admits nor denies these allegations, it would appear to me that we have here a distinct issue raised as to the title to these lots and the court has jurisdiction by virtue of sec. 46 (b) of the Supreme Court Act. But dealing with the matter on the basis of the arguments of counsel, the question for determination then is: Does the issue involve any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or other matters or things where rights in future might be bound?\nA determination of this requires that certain articles of the codes should be construed. Art. 16, subarticle 27 of the Municipal Code reads as follows:\nThe words \"land\" or \"immovable\" or \"immovable property\" mean all lands or parcels of land in a municipality, owned or occupied by one person or by several persons jointly, and include the buildings and improvements thereon.\nArt. 649, Title XXII and following, of the Municipal Code, provide for the duties of the assessors in preparing their valuation rolls and amongst other things they are told that all immovable property is taxable property with some exceptions not of moment here. They are also told they must draw up the valuation roll setting out the particulars required by title XXII of the Municipal Code.\nBy Art. 654 of title XXII the assessors are directed to enter on the valuation roll in separate columns, amongst other things, the real value of every taxable immovable or part of an immovable and 6th, the name and surname of the owner of every immovable or part of immovable, if known. It is further provided in the same title that after the roll is prepared, it is to be deposited in the office of the corporation, certain notices must be given, and after complaints have been adjusted, the roll becomes homologated.\nTitle XXIII of the Municipal Code provides for the imposition of taxes based upon the taxable property as set out in the valuation roll. The Municipal Code also contains provisions for appeal, but the law is well established that where the complaint is that the municipal authority has exceeded its powers and its act is therefore ultra vires, a person complaining on this ground is not precluded from taking proceedings in the Superior Court to obtain redress.\nThe defendants rely upon the interpretation of immovables as defined in Art. 381 of the Civil Code as amended by 2 Geo. V. ch. 45 which reads as follows:\u2014\n381. Rights of emphyteusis, of usufruct of immovable things, of use and habitation, the right to cut timber perpetually or for a limited time, servitudes and rights or actions which tend to obtain possession of an immovable, are immovable by reason of the objects to which they are attached.\nIt may well be that the interpretation they place upon immovable is correct and includes the right to cut timber in the present instance, but that is a question of the merits of the appeal. What I have to determine is: Is there jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to hear the appeal? Or in other words: Does the matter in controversy in the appeal involve matters or things ejusdem generis with titles to lands where rights in future may be bound?\nI am of the opinion that it does. Gilbert v. Gilman,[1]; Foster v. St. Joseph[2]. Counsel for the defendants claims that the action is premature and that the valuation roll has no such finality as would warrant an action to have it annulled, but it appears to me clear from the terms of the Municipal Code that the preparation of the valuation roll is a necessary part of the machinery by which the rates are imposed upon the owners of immovable property and I do not see why it cannot be attacked after homologation, which the declaration alleges to have taken place, as readily as later on when all proceedings have been completed and the municipal council proceeds to fix the rate to be imposed upon the property included in the valuation roll.\nThe plaintiff relies upon the jurisprudence of the court particularly Stevenson v. City of Montreal[3]. The facts of that case are not on all fours with the present but the difference I do not think is material. The fact that in the Stevenson Case (1) a by-law was passed for the widening of a street and the valuation roll was based upon the by-law, does not, I think, give the valuation roll any higher standing than the roll which has to be prepared under the provisions of the municipal code.\nI am of the opinion therefore, as I have said, that the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. If I am wrong in my conclusions, the defendant is not precluded by my order from moving later on to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction as nothing I do can have the effect of conferring jurisdiction upon the court if otherwise it has none. The application is granted, costs in the cause.\nSee\u2014Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Rat Portage Lumber Co.[4]. Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[5]. McPherson v. Temiskaming Lumber Co.[6].\nE. R. CAMERON,\nRegistrar.\nJanuary 16th, 1920.\nRomeo Langlais K.C. for the motion to quash.\nLouis St. Laurent K.C., contra. Idington J (dissenting)\u2014The basis of assessment in Quebec distinguishes between real and personal property. The Court of King's Bench has decided that appellants' title, which is admitted and, as such, is no way in dispute, gives him a property of which the quality is such that it must be classified as real property and hence liable to be assessed as such.\nThe resultant tax, it is admitted, cannot by any possibility reach the sum of two thousand dollars. Hence that basis for an appeal here fails.\nNor can the provision of subsec. (b) of section 46 of the Supreme Court Act, which reads as follows:\n(b) relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to His Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound,\nbe relied on.\nSo long as the title, as such, is beyond dispute, the question of the quality of property which is held thereby does not, in my opinion, fall within the meaning of this subsection.\nI, therefore, think the motion to quash should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J. concurs in dismissing the motion with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nMignault J. The appellants seek to have a valuation roll of the respondent set aside as to a large number of properties which are entered in the roll as belonging to the appellants and subject to being assessed against them for municipal and school taxes, and allege that as to some of these properties they own neither the soil, nor the right to cut timber, and as to others they own merely the right to cut timber. They further complain that the respondents have undertaken to value the right to cut timber separately from the soil and to assess the appellants as owners of such right.\nThe appellant's action was maintained by the Superior Court but dismissed by the Court of King's Bench, and the appellants appeal to this court. They succeeded in having the jurisdiction of this court affirmed by the Registrar and the respondent now moves to have the appeal quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nI am of opinion that we have jurisdiction. As to some of the properties mentioned in the declaration, the issue is whether the appellants own either the soil or the right to cut timber thereon, and this raises a question as to the title of these properties. As to the others, the issue is whether the appellants can be assessed in respect of the right to cut timber independently of the right of ownership in the soil. The right to cut timber perpetually or for a limited time is an immovable right (Art. 381 C.C.). Future rights of the appellants in respect of this immovable right and its being subject to assessment are therefore involved.\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 16 Can.

J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nRailway\u2014Drunken passenger\u2014Ejectment from train\u2014Suitable place\u2014Findings of Jury.\nThe right of a conductor on a railway train to eject a passenger for disorderly conduct is not absolute but must be exercised with proper precaution to avoid putting the passenger in danger.\nA drunken traveller was put off a train at a closed and unlighted station at one o'clock in the morning and some hours later his body was found on the track near the station in a condition indicating that he had been killed by a passing train. In an action by the administrator of his estate against the railway company: Held, Davies C. J. dissenting, that the evidence justified the jury in finding that deceased when ejected was not in a state to take care of himself and that putting him off in that condition at such a place and at such an hour was negligence on the part of the company which led to his death.\nJudgment appealed from (53 N.S. Rep. 88) reversed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming, by an equal division, the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant company.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nJ. J. Power K.C. for the appellant.\nHenry K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014At the close of the argument at bar in this appeal I was of the opinion that the judgment appealed from was right and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nFinding, however, in conference with my colleagues that this view was not shared in by them, I deemed it my duty to read all the evidence most carefully and to read and weigh the reasons of the different judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and the trial judge, who differed in their conclusions.\nThe result is that I find myself more strongly confirmed in the impression I had formed on the oral argument that the appellant had not proved any case of negligence against the company causing the death of the deceased.\nThe facts are not complicated and it seems to me that the evidence on all the material and vital facts is one way and that the findings of the jury on these facts as regards the conduct of the deceased on the train before he was put off by the conductor, and as to the place he was put off being an \"unfit place\" to put him off, were directly contrary to the evidence.\nThe learned trial judge's decision is short and to the point and I transcribe it in full:\u2014\nTo recover in an action of this kind it is settled law that the negligence alleged and proved must be the proximate cause of the accident or injury. Here, according to the proof and findings, Dunn was ejected or put off an up-train or train going west, and was run down hours later by a down train, or train going east, with no evidence as to the cause of the accident, except marks on the track, indicating that a train going east had run over the man. The jury has found the defendant company's negligence to be in putting Dunn off the up-train at Hantsport.\nThis is not connected with the accident, and may have had no connection with it. I am obliged to hold that the negligence found does not establish a case upon which plaintiff can recover. For all that appears such negligence may not have in any manner contributed to the accident, and I direct judgment for the defendant company. The Wakelin Case[2] is, I think, a conclusive authority against plaintiff.\nThe broad simple facts are that the deceased was a passenger on an excursion train leaving Halifax for Kentville between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, the train consisting of an engine and fifteen passenger cars, all cars being filled with passengers. The deceased had been visiting his brother who lived in Woodside on the Dartmouth side of Halifax Harbour, and left about 7 p.m. to take a car to Dartmouth ferry across to Halifax and then some conveyance to the railway station in Halifax. He came aboard the train the worse for liquor but by no means helpless, became very disorderly, made himself generally a nuisance to the other passengers and, in fact, assaulted an old couple sitting quietly in their seats. The conductor remonstrated with him and seems to have treated him with great patience and forbearance, the result being that he was violently attacked by deceased who broke one of the car windows and tried to choke him. Only after much effort was the conductor successful in getting the man comparatively quieted down. After this disorderly conduct had culminated in the violent attack upon the conductor, the latter decided to land the passenger when the train arrived at Hantsport, the next stopping place. I agree so fully and completely with the conclusions of the trial judge and of chief Justice Harris of the Supreme Court on appeal from the judgment of the trial judge, that I do not feel it necessary to re-state the facts and the conclusions to be drawn from them at any length.\nThe first question to be determined is whether the conduct of the deceased while on the express train was so disorderly and unruly as justified the conductor in putting him off the train and, if so, whether the place where he put him off, Hantsport station, was a fit and proper place to do so. As regards the latter point, I may say that the evidence showed Hantsport station is situated in an incorporated town and is not distant from the main thoroughfare of the town more than about one hundred yards.\nThe excursion train was a very lengthly one and the steps of the car from which the deceased was ejected when the train stopped at Hanstport opened on an extension of the train platform built up of ashes packed and hardened and protected by side planks. There was no more danger or difficulty in the deceased alighting on this ash extension of the station platform than upon the platform of which it was an extension.\nI am of the opinion that this station was a fit and proper place to put off the disorderly passenger, and the only remaining question is whether the deceased's conduct had been so disorderly as to have made him a nuisance and offensive to other passengers in the train. It was proved beyond doubt that he was under the influence of liquor, was using profane language, actually assaulted several persons in the train without the slightest provocation and eventually assaulted the conductor violently, breaking at the time one of the windows of the car. The conductor appears to me to have treated the deceased, unruly and provocative as his conduct was, with a good deal of forbearance and restraint and in a manner deserving commendation and not censure.\nThe result of my reading of the whole evidence, the vital and material parts being uncontradicted, is that I think the conductor was not only warranted and justified, after the deceased's disorderly conduct and the violent personal assault made upon him by the deceased passenger and his inability to keep him quiet, in deciding to put him off the train on reaching Hantsport, but that if he had failed so to put him off he would have assumed a greater responsibility that he was justified on doing. It was not only the conductor's right to land him where he did but, in my opinion under the circumstances, his duty. The manner of his being put off was, of course, criticised, but I cannot find there was more force used than was reasonably necessary to carry out his ejection. It is true it was after midnight, and the station offices were closed, but the hotel of the town was not many yards away and when last seen by the witnesses who spoke of the man's ejection as the train moved away from the station he was walking away from the track towards the town.\nIf I am right in my conclusion with uncontradicted evidence that the conductor was justified in putting the deceased off at the Hantsport station, the appeal must fail.\nIf, however, I am wrong in so holding, I am of the opinion that the fact of the deceased's body having been found with life extinct on the following morning on the car track, where he had eventually been killed by a passing train, would not of itself have been sufficient to uphold the verdict. There is not a scintilla of evidence as to what became of the man after having been put off at the station. Whether he had liquor on his person and took more of it or got it otherwise, there is no hint. He evidently, we may surmise, wandered on the track while in a state of inebriety, sat down or lay down on the track, probably fell into a drunken sleep and was struck by one of the company's trains coming from the opposite direction to that of the train from which he had been ejected. No negligence is charged against the train which must have struck him. The expulsion, if wrongful, was not the cause of the man's death, nor is there any necessary connection between that expulsion and his death. If, in his half drunken condition, he wandered on to the track and sat or lay down there, and went asleep and was killed, the company is not surely liable, evidence to connect the alleged wrongful landing of the passenger at the station with the accident being entirely wanting.\nI think the principle decided in the well-known case of Wakelin v. The London and South Western Ry. Co. by the House of Lords in 1886 and reported in[3], applicable in this case. To hold the company liable it must be established by proof that the accident to which the death of the deceased is attributable was caused by its negligence. If, in the absence of direct proof, the circumstances which are established are equally consistent with the allegations of the plaintiff as with the denial of the defendants, the plaintiff must fail. The plaintiff was very far from being helplessly drunk when he was put off at the station. He was drunk enough to make himself offensive and a nuisance, but not by any means helplessly drunk. Whether he obtained more liquor after being put off the train or not, there is not a particle of evidence. His condition was his own fault and the company is not liable after his expulsion for his imprudence or his fool-hardiness in running into danger on the track and being killed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The only question raised herein deserving consideration is whether or not the conductor of a passenger train exercised due care in putting off the said train (about 1 a.m. on a dark night, at a station, and leaving unattended) a passenger who was so drunk that he staggered in the car, and when put off staggered and fell in sight of both the said conductor and a brakeman of the train who had been deputed by the former to see that such passenger did not get on again.\nThe passenger so put off was found on the respondent's railway track, five or six hours later, eleven or twelve hundred feet distant from the said station, evidently mangled to death as the result of being run over by another engine or train.\nThere was no light or accommodation in the station and none shewn to exist in a near by hotel, or elsewhere in the vicinity.\nAssuming the respondent's by-law enabling its conductor to put off a passenger, possessed of a ticket entitling him to proceed further, when misconducting himself, is the doing so justifiable under such circumstances, so obviously likely to lead to such results, as in question herein, without taking the slightest precaution to guard against same? The jury answered that in the negative by finding respondent, by reason of such want of care, to have caused the death of said passenger, as well as in answering many other questions submitted to them affirming the conditions I have outlined.\nThe subsequent finding of the dead body where it was, not only justifies that finding as the cause of death, but illuminates the whole story and demonstrates, if circumstances ever can demonstrate anything, the hopelessly drunken condition of the man and the need there was for due care in regard to him in such a condition and in such a dangerous situation.\nIn broad daylight when there would perhaps be in such a situation many there, engaged in their daily avocations, likely to supply the needed care, such an incident might be justifiable.\nThe question of law raised herein upon the findings of the jury is of an entirely different character.\nI am of the opinion that in this peculiar case herein presented there was ample evidence to submit to the jury relative to the question of the duty of due care, under the circumstances, and that their finding of fact, which was wholly within their province to decide, should not be set aside.\nAnd I am the more inclined to such holding by this evident loss of temper on the part of the conductor leading to and resulting from the scuffle between him and the drunken passenger.\nI can see no further excuse for the entire abandonment of a human being in such a condition, to such obvious possible consequences as ensued.\nAnd that excuse for the entire want of care on the part of the respondent's conductor, under such circumstances does not, in my opinion, justify the course pursued.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Russell and Mr. Justice Mellish in the result they reached in the court below, and so much am I in accord with the elaborate review of the facts presented by the latter, that I do not feel it necessary to repeat same here.\nNor do I deem it necessary to demonstrate that the Wakelin Case[4] is quite irrelevant unless we are prepared to hold that a drunken man has in law so lost his rights that he may lawfully be pitched overboard regardless of the consequences.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and judgment be entered for the amount of damages found by the jury with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014After some hesitation due chiefly to the difficulty and delicacy of the position of a railway conductor called upon to deal with a disorderly drunken passenger and the danger of unduly curtailing or circumscribing his powers and restricting his discretion, I have reached the conclusion that there was evidence on which a jury might, without laying itself open to a charge of perversity, find that, having regard to the state of inebriety of the late Stanley Dunn and to the conditions at Hantsport station at the time, it was not a proper place at which to remove him from the defendant's train. The right of removal of a disorderly passenger which is conferred on the conductor is not absolute. It must be exercised reasonably. He cannot under it justify putting a passenger off the train under such circumstances that, as a direct consequence, he is exposed to danger of losing his life or of serious personal injury.\nIf, upon evidence warranting that belief, the jury was of the opinion that leaving Dunn alone on the platform of the closed and unlighted Hantsport station at 1.30 a.m. seriously imperilled his life, they were quite right in concluding that the conductor was negligent in doing so. It was eminently for them to determine whether Dunn was or was not in such an advanced state of intoxication that leaving him where he was placed involved endangering his life because he was unable to take care of himself. If so the conductor should have found some other means of discharging his duty to prevent Dunn being a source of danger or annoyance to his fellow passengers as well as a menace to himself until he could be removed from the train without jeopardizing his life. For instance, as Russell J. suggests, he might have been taken to the baggage car and detained there until a suitable place for removing him from the train should be reached.\nThe absence of direct proof of causal connection between the leaving of a man on the station platform and his death, in my opinion, does not present any serious difficulty. It was quite open for the jury to-infer that he wandered from the platform to and along the tracks and eventually lay down on the latter in a state of drunken stupor and was killed there about 3 o'clock in the morning by the second engine of the train when returning from Kentville to Halifax. Indeed that seems to be the most probable inference from all the facts in evidence. That he should have wandered on to the tracks was, I think, a natural and probable result of his being left unattended on the dark station platform in the condition in which he was\u2014such a result as the conductor should have anticipated might ensue.\nThis case is readily distinguishable from Delahanty v. Michigan Central Rly. Co.[5], where a passenger was put off at an open, lighted station and was not incapable of taking care of himself though slightly intoxicated and also from the Wakelin Case[6], where it was a matter of pure conjecture how the man who was killed got on the line, and there was nothing to justify an inference that he got there by any fault of the company. On this aspect of the case the decision of this court in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Griffith[7], seems to afford authority for rejecting the attack on the verdict.\nThere was evidence in my opinion which makes it impossible to say that the jury's answers to the sixth, eighth and ninth questions were not such as could reasonably be found. They therefore cannot be set aside. Upon them the plaintiff was entitled to judgment.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $2,000, found by the jury to have been the damages sustained, with costs of the action and of the appeals to the court en banc and to this court.\nMignault J.\u2014By the by-laws of the company respondent, admitted to be validly passed by-laws of the respondent, it was provided as follows:\u2014 12. Persons intoxicated, or otherwise unable to take care of themselves, will not be furnished with tickets or allowed to enter the cars or premises of the company, and if found in the cars or upon the premises of the company, they may be removed.\n15. Any person in or upon a carriage, station, platform of the Company, or elsewhere upon the Company's premises, in a state of intoxication, or fighting or guilty of other disorderly conduct, or using foul, obscene or abusive language, or otherwise wilfully interfering with the comfort of other passengers, is guilty of an offence under this By-law. In addition to liability to fine under this section, any such person may be summarily ejected from such station or premises of the Company, or in the case of a moving train, such person may be removed or ejected from the train with his baggage at any usual stopping place, or near a dwelling house, and the conductor and train servants may use force, doing no unnecessary violence, to restrain passengers and others upon the train from fighting, using foul, obscene, or abusive language, or other disorderly conduct.\nThe jury found that the deceased was killed by an engine or train of the respondent moving towards the east (questions 1 and 2); that his conduct on the excursion train between Halifax and Hantsport had not been such as to interfere with the comfort or endanger the safety of other passengers on the said train sufficiently to eject him from the train (question 3); that he had not used vulgar, offensive, obscene or blasphemous language in the hearing of his fellow passengers (question 4); that he had conducted himself in a disorderly manner during his journey from Halifax to Hantsport (question 5); that there was negligence on the part of the respondent company in connection with the death of the deceased and that caused such death, and that such negligence consisted in putting a drunken man off the train at a late hour at night in an unfit place (question 6); that the deceased was not ejected from the train in question at a usual stopping place for trains of the respondent company (question 7); that the deceased at the time he was ejected was not in a fit state as regards sobriety to take care of himself (question 8); that under the circumstances the place where the deceased was ejected from the train, was not a proper place for that purpose (question 9); and the jury assessed the damages at $2,000 equally divided between the deceased's father and mother.\nThe learned trial judge, notwithstanding the findings of the jury, dismissed the action because in his opinion the negligence found against the respondent in putting the deceased off the train at Hantsport was not the cause of the accident and may have had no connection with it.\nIn my opinion, with all deference, the jury could infer from the circumstances of the case, that putting off the deceased at 1.30 a.m., on the ash extension of the station platform, near a closed and unlighted station, in a town without any lights, was the cause of Dunn's death; He was found killed on the tracks some distance to the west and it was a matter for the jury to determine, and there was evidence from which they could draw the inference, whether putting off this drunken and helpless man at such a place and at such an hour was the cause of his having been killed by one of the engines of the excursion train which returned through Hantsport a couple of hours later.\nIf, therefore, there be negligence in ejecting Dunn from the train at such an hour and in such a place, the connection between this negligence and Dunn's death is established by the jury's finding which I cannot consider perverse.\nBut was there negligence, or in other words did the respondent fail in any duty which it owed the deceased? Dunn had a ticket for this train and had a right to travel on it, but he had no right to conduct himself in a disorderly manner, or to interfere with the comfort of the other passengers. The jury found that he had conducted himself in a disorderly manner and this, under the by-laws of the company, authorized the conductor to eject him\nat any usual stopping place, or near a dwelling house.\nHantsport was a usual stopping place of the railway, and the finding of the jury that it was not, seems hard to reconcile with the evidence, unless the jury considered the ash extension of the platform not a usual stopping place, but, reading together the answers to questions 7 and 9, it is clear that they did not consider this place, even if it were a usual stopping place, as a proper place to leave a drunken man at such an hour, on a dark night, with the electric lights of the town not burning and the station closed and without any lights.\nThe right to eject a drunken man and disorderly passenger from a train, according to the by-law, is not an absolute one. He must be removed at a usual stopping place or near a dwelling house. This clearly shews that he must be ejected at some place where he can be looked after. To leave him in the middle of the night on the extension of a station platform with a closed station and no light anywhere, would not place him in a better position than if he were ejected in the fields. This does not mean that the company must keep him on the train, but if they choose to eject him in his drunken state, they must eject him at a proper place so as not to leave him in his helpless condition where no one can look after him, and where he is in obvious danger of getting on the railway track and being injured or killed by a passing train. The dictates of humanity as well as the by-law itself seem to me to require this of the railway company.\nThe respondents, in paragraph 16 of their plea, somewhat in contradiction of a previous statement of the plea, say that the deceased on the day in question\nwas intoxicated, or otherwise unable to take care of himself and while in the said condition was found in a car of the defendant company and was removed therefrom by servants or employees of the defendant company.\nIf he was unable to take care of himself, and the jury so found, I cannot think the verdict of the jury perverse in finding negligence against the respondent.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and give judgment to the appellant according to the jury's verdict, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Terrell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

L.R. 483) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe Hallam Co. bought wool from the defendants which by the order was to correspond with a sample supplied. It proved to be of an inferior quality and acceptance was refused. The vendors would not take it back and it was re-sold at an advance of five cents a pound over the contract price. The purchasers then brought an action for damages and recovered fifteen cents on the trial which the Appellate Division affirmed. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy K.C., and Dancey for the appellants.\nTilley K.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was an action brought to recover damages for the delivery of a quantity of wool by the appellants (defendants) to the respondents (plaintiffs) of an inferior quality to that sold to them by sample.\nThe appellants contended that the respondents plaintiffs having accepted the goods were not entitled to recover damages, but the trial judge and the Appellate Division both held that while the acceptance of delivery of the wool which was packed in sewn up bags passed the property in the goods delivered to the plaintiffs it did not relieve the defendants from liability for damages for delivery of goods of an inferior quality to that of the sample by which they were sold, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at the sum of $7,500, being the difference between the quality of the goods warranted and sold by the sample and that actually delivered.\nThese questions of fact of the quality of the wool sold and that actually delivered were found in plaintiffs\u2019 favour by the trial judge and these findings were confirmed by the Appellate Division from whose judgment this appeal has been taken. That court also maintained the assessment of damages of the trial judge as having been made under the proper rule applicable in such cases as this.\nAs to the findings of fact made by both courts, this court will not interfere except of course in cases of clear error, and certainly this case is not one of that class.\nAs to the main question, that of the rule or measure of damages which should be applied in cases such as the one before us, I think the courts below have acted correctly. The rule, as I understand it, is that the measure of such damages in cases of the delivery of goods of an inferior quality to that warranted is the difference between the market value of the goods of the quality warranted and contracted to be delivered, and that of the quality actually delivered. Mayne on Damages, (8th ed.) p. 228; Rodocanachi v. Milburn Bros.[2]; Williams Bros. v. Agius, Limited[3].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario arises out of a sale by the appellants, carrying on business at Blyth, in the Province of Ontario, to respondent, carrying on business at Toronto, of a quantity of grey shoddy wool, claimed by the latter to have been bought by sample.\nA sample undoubtedly had been submitted by appellants shipping it to the respondent, and communications passed over the telephone, and by letter, in relation to latter buying about 50,000 pounds thereof at forty cents a pound. The respondent agreed to take about that quantity, at said price, and asked appellant by letter to arrange for three cars on which to load it.\nRespondent by letter said, amongst other things, that, upon that being done, \u201cthe writer will go up and have the wool weighed.\u201d\nThere was nothing said therein or otherwise relative to inspection.\nA letter written by appellants same or next day to the respondent used the expression \u201cyou to come as usual to take over stock.\u201d\nThis letter never was received by the respondent and hence is of no consequence other than shewing a different point of view had been taken by each party, as to the question of inspection.\nThe appellant alleges in argument that by reason of a former misunderstanding and adjustment thereof there had grown up a well understood course of dealing between them by which the respondent was to make such inspection at the point of shipment, as it saw fit, of any goods sold to it by them, and default that, could not be heard to complain.\nCertainly the adoption of such a rule and its observance would have been a most satisfactory and businesslike method. But it was not pleaded as a matter of fact in such express terms as now urged.\nThe pleading alleged that the goods were\nsold to the plaintiff by the defendants subject to the examinations inspect on and approval of the plaintiff\u2019 messenger\netc., at Blyth.\nIn the particular bargain made herein there was no allusion made to such terms.\nAnd when counsel for appellant at the trial approached the subject he failed to press upon the attention of the learned trial judge, who ruled out a question as to reasons, all that is now urged upon us as set forth above, and, I understand, was urged below.\nI cannot say that under such a pleading and such circumstances the learned trial judge erred in his ruling.\nHence we must rely upon the actual facts proven which disclose that the business as transacted at Blyth consisted only of a weighing and loading of the goods then on the cars.\nThere really was no actual inspection such as any one would have expected to find if the bargain had been made as pleaded or in accord with an alleged established course of dealing.\nThen also it became known to appellants that the shipment was to be made to Carleton Place instead of to Toronto.\nWhy did they not then suggest inspection by way of an adherence to the alleged course of dealing?\nOn the other hand it may well be asked, why the manager of respondent was sent up to Blyth for the mere minor, menial or clerical purpose, of weighing, or checking weight of goods.\nI cannot help suspecting that it was the confidence reposed in appellants which induced the manager to have thus appeared to waive inspection.\nIt became the duty of appellants, or at least the part of prudence, on the alleged basis of dealing, to have seen that it was observed and that no cause of complaint could be possible. Instead of that course being pursued they passed in silence an obvious non-observance of the alleged course of dealing. I am unable to say that as matter of law, under all the foregoing circumstances, that the respondent was not entitled to rely upon the implied warranty the courts below have proceeded upon.\nI am unable, however, to agree, after reading all the evidence adduced in support of respondent\u2019s claim, with the assessment of damages adopted by the learned trial judge and upheld by the majority of the Appellate Division.\nWhether we adopt the rule for assessing damages as laid down in \u201cBenjamin on Sales\u201d as to the difference in value between the article as delivered and the article as warranted, or that in the English \u201cSale of Goods Act, 1895\u201d, which I incline to think is but another way of expressing the common law rule when it provides that\nthe loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the breach\nshall be the measure of damages, the evidence does not justify the said assessment of damages.\nWe find the utmost profit expected (by respondent conversant with the market price) from a re-sale, based upon the identical samples delivered by appellants, was an advance of five cents a pound; for immediately respondent got possession of the samples, they were submitted to a firm in Carleton Place and a bargain made for a re-sale at forty-five cents a pound. It seems to me idle, in face of such a contract made by respondent at the very time when that in question was expected to be, and was being, carried out, to contend that it can properly be held to have suffered any greater damages in the way of loss of profit than this five cents per pound of profit which it failed to reap, or indeed any other damages, unless so far as the quality of the goods fell below the sample as to be unsaleable at the price agreed upon.\nThe respondent is not to be treated as a child ignorant of the conditions of the market, but as being possessed of all the information relative to the market, and the possibilities of re-selling such goods as the sample indicated might be reasonably expected to produce.\nI think, bearing that in mind, that forty-five cents must be conclusively taken herein as the basis for the estimated damages.\nA perusal of the evidence adduced on behalf of the respondent produces in my mind a clear conviction that there was not a settled market price such as can often be appealed to as a sure and safe basis upon which to estimate damages.\nThe market for the class of goods in question seems to have been in an unsettled state and subject to a purely chance sort of speculative condition, furnishing no better basis upon which to proceed than the re-sale at an advance of five cents a pound.\nA letter of the firm of Cram & Co. to whom the respondent had re-sold, tells that if the goods had been up to the sample, they could have re-sold at a profit of $7,500. Yet we do not find any claim made by that firm for damages of any kind for the breach of contract it has made with respondent. That firm instead seems to have been glad to receive back its cheque without a murmur.\nIn ordinary cases we might have heard, within the principles laid down in Wallis v. Pratt[4], of a claim for this $7,500 allowed by the learned trial judge, but no such pretension is set up. If fifteen thousand dollars damages had been awarded in such a case, arising out of a twenty thousand dollar contract, from the result of which respondent had received before trial, and indeed within six months, the sum of about fourteen thousand dollars as proceeds of re-sales, I respectfully submit such a result should have so arrested the attention of the courts below as to the need of a closer examination of the evidential basis for measuring of damages than, in my view, has been given herein.\nThat possibility which I present is only one of the many possibilities presented by several witnesses in a rather loose sort of way.\nCram is asked the following leading question, and answers as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You say, comparing the bulk with the sample, that it had a great deal more shoddy, and not only that but some parts were absolutely worthless and useless, that should not be there, that was not in the sample, and you say there was a difference of 25 or 30 cents a lb. in value?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nWhen I find in the letter of his firm to the respondent, rejecting the goods, the following sentence:\u2014\nWe opened up five (5) sacks of this stock promiscuously, and find it not in any sack, up to the five-pound (5-lb.) sample, on which basis we bought this wool.\nI am not such impressed with the basis for this estimate.\nOnly five sacks examined out of a probable seventy in that car, does not seem, when we find all the witnesses testifying to a great variation in the quality of the sacks, a fair basis to found said estimate upon.\nNor is that much improved as a fair test by finding him speak as follows:\u2014 Q.\u2014How many of those bales would you examine? A.\u2014Possibly I examined a couple of dozen before I notified Mr. Hallam, that is, of the first car.\nI submit the formal statement made at the time in the above quotation from the letter to the respondent is more likely to be correct than this chance guess made some months later in the witness box.\nThe witness apparently had examined a second car and possibly his memory got confused, for he says in another place:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You say you examined a certain number of the sacks in the first car? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ. How many sacks did you examine? A.\u2014Off hand I would say probably a dozen or two.\nQ.\u2014How many would there be in a car? A.\u2014If you divide the car by three, there would be about 70. They sometimes vary, according to the size of the car.\nQ.\u2014But of the 7 or 80, you examined probably a dozen bags? A.\u2014A dozen or two.\nThe third car he did not examine at all.\nI submit all this as a specimen of the guide we have if we depart from the lines I lay down above to be got from the actual transactions involved in the sale to and re-sale by respondent as the only reliable guiding basis to start from to estimate damages.\nMr. Logan, produced by respondent as an expert, says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Did you see the sample of the bulk that is in question here?\nA.\u2014All I saw was the two sacks that Mr. Cram sent up to us to be tested.\nThis witness applied to these sacks a mechanical test, result of which he gives and then respondent\u2019s counsel properly drops him as an expert.\nThe result of that test, however, might have been followed up by others from which we might have got something reliable, but it was not. There were two other witnesses called who could speak as experts besides Mr. Hallam, respondent\u2019s president.\nOf these two, one had bought at forty-two cents a considerable quantity of this shoddy wool and both speak of respective examinations made recently before the trial of a sample submitted by respondent taken from the remaining stock on hand after the re-sales made by respondent, of which I am about to speak.\nNeither give what I would consider a more satisfactory basis upon which to assess damages than what I am about to submit, as result of the consideration of all the circumstances so far as available in evidence.\nThe respondent called the appellants\u2019 attention to the results reported by Cram, and proposed, very fairly as it appears to me, to the appellants, or one of them, to go down with a representative of respondent and see the parties concerned at Carleton Place and also the goods and try and arrange a settlement. Respondent even offered to pay expenses of doing so, but appellants refused, apparently determined to stand on what they conceived to be their legal rights.\nSome weeks were lost in this sort of haggling, and finally this action was brought on the 13th March, 1918, apparently from the claim made by the indorsement on the writ, for a cancellation of the whole contract, as the claim made indicates it was for the entire price paid. When, better advised, that contention was changed in the statement of claim to a claim of $12,621.25 for damages on the much exaggerated basis of 25 cents a pound, though re\u2011sales had then been made of eighteen sacks at 43\u00bd to 45c. a pound.\nNo effort was made by respondent, as should have been done, to re-sell the goods till some time later, and then there were sales made at prices which lead me to the conclusion that if proper energy had been used the whole would have been re-sold at a price of more than the original cost price of forty cents a pound, and have left the assessable damages at five cents a pound.\nThe increased price got by this mode of proceeding evidently would have re-paid all the attendant expenses upon such a fair and common sense method, which, after all, is but the law upon the subject binding the party claiming damages for breach of a contract to do all that he reasonably can to minimize the loss.\nThere is no satisfactory reason or explanation given for failure to pursue this course. If chance brought a purchaser he seems to have been dealt with.\nEvery one knew that unless an effort was made to re-sell before Australian wool came into the market, there was no chance of doing so at prices to minimize the loss. And the only excuse I can find for such an unreasonable course of conduct is that the parties were at war by means of a law-suit.\nIf that attitude had ceased and a more reasonable course been pursued, I think possibly and indeed probably the respondent would still have been entitled to a judgment for $2,500 or thereabouts\u2014whatever the five cents a pound would have produced. Roughly speaking the expenses might have eaten up the excess of price got over forty cents a pound. And that is the sum to which I would now reduce the judgment, instead of the $7,500 awarded.\nPerhaps the plan of the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division, who suggests a reference to determine the damages, might work out a more accurate result, but I am of opinion that there had better be an end of some things even of a lawsuit.\nHere we have presented the curious result of a judgment for $7,500, when a statement of respondent presents, after making every allowance to itself for claims not recognizable in law, only a balance of $6,468.62, yet a judgment stands for $7,500.\nIs it by way of penalty as the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas suggests?\nOf course this statement is headed with an incidental suggestion that the sample standard was worth 55c. per pound, but I prefer the cool judgment of the merchant selling at 45c. as a proper test of value of the sample, to that of the litigant and probably exaggerated estimates given by those who probably knew less than he.\nAmong the indefensible items in this statement, appears a shrinkage of weight due to delay of respondent in re-selling; a charge of 7% for interest, and insurance for a period too prolonged, and $1,398 for commission.\nMr. Hallam\u2019s evidence which seems given fairly estimates the goods on hand at 30c. after all the loss of market and possibly deteriorated condition of the goods, suggests to me that a middle line might be drawn between what I have arrived at and that of the learned trial judge.\nHence if the respondent prefers the risk and annoyance of a reference in order to demonstrate that by proper efforts there could not have been by due energy a re-sale effected in the early part of 1918 which would have minimized the loss, I would agree thereto, the costs thereof to abide the result. And lest it be necessary for some to have a decision to prove the law as stated relative to the duty to minimize the loss, see latest decision of Court of Appeal in England in Payzu v. Saunders[5], at pages 587 et seq.\nMeantime I think this appeal should be allowed either fixing the damages at $2,500, or a reference to reduce that already awarded on the lines I have indicated; the costs of this appeal and in the courts below to abide the result of such reference.\nANGLIN J.\u2014On the evidence in the record it is not possible to disturb the findings that the sale in question was by sample, that there was no acceptance of the wool furnished as equal in quality to the sample and that it was in fact substantially inferior. The weight of the testimony also supports the conclusion that the difference in market value between goods of the quality of the sample and the goods actually supplied was at the date of delivery at least 15c. per pound.\nThe ordinary rule that the measure of the purchaser\u2019s damages in such a case is\nthe difference between the value of goods of the quality contracted for at the time of delivery and the value of the goods actually delivered. Loder v. Kekul\u00e9[6], at pp. 139-40,\nadopted by Mr. Mayne in his excellent Treatise on Damages, (4th ed.) at p. 228, was applied by the learned trial judge and in the Appellate Division. I find no circumstances in evidence to justify a departure from it. Except as affording some evidence of market value (Clare v. Maynard[7], the prices agreed to on the re-sale by the defendant and on the subsequent re-sale by his purchaser cannot be taken into account. Neither of them conclusively determines the market value of goods of the same quality as the sample. Rodocanachi v. Milburn Bros.[8]; Williams Bros. v. Agius, Limited[9].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014One of the issues in this case is whether the sale of the goods in question is a sale by sample. The two courts below have come to the conclusion that it was a sale by sample. The facts disclosed by the evidence shew to me conclusively that the sale was properly described as such.\nA sample of the goods for which a price was quoted was sent to the respondent company by the appellants and the letter sent by the respondent to the appellants confirming a telephone conversation as to the purchase of these goods declared \u201csame to be up to five pound sample expressed us.\u201d Nothing could be clearer; and if the vendors were of opinion that the sale was not to be carried out according to the sample they should have called the attention of the purchaser to what they call today an erroneous statement.\nThey claim to have sent a letter which in some respects shews that the sale was not absolutely as alleged by the respondent. But this letter was never received by the respondent. Besides this letter does not shew that the sample which had been sent previously to the purchaser would not determine the quality of the goods. It is contended by the appellants that the goods were duly received by the respondent company and that their obligation as to the quality of the goods was duly fulfilled. It is true that an important officer was sent by the respondent company to attend the loading of the cars but the goods were not inspected by him and the finding of the courts below was that he went there with the purpose of having the goods properly weighed; and the evidence of this officer, though conflicting with the evidence of one of the appellants, was accepted by the trial judge. I do not feel disposed to disturb this finding.\nThere has been raised a question as to the amount of damages which should have been awarded. There is evidence which shews that the fifteen cents per pound which was allowed was fair and represented the damages to which the plaintiff was entitled.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In this case I am of opinion that the sale of the wool was a sale by sample and that the wool delivered having been inferior to the sample, there was a breach of warranty entitling the respondent to recover damages from the appellants.\nThe only question remaining is as to the measure of damages. The learned trial judge allowed fifteen cents per pound, which is certainly a moderate amount, for the sample was worth from 57 to 60 cents a pound and the contract price was 40 cents.\nBut the appellants say that inasmuch as the respondent had re-sold the wool to one Cram for 45 cents a pound, the most he would have realized out of the transaction was 5c. per pound, and that at all events his damages could not exceed the latter amount. This reasoning appears to me to be fallacious. The usual rule, as stated by the learned trial judge, is that the measure of damages is the difference in value between the thing contracted for and the thing delivered. Here the respondent contracted for wool which was to equal the sample and for which he was to pay 40c. per pound. That he had himself contracted to sell the wool for 45c. is not a matter which the appellants can set up to escape liability to pay, as damages, the difference between the value of the wool contracted for and its actual value as delivered. As stated by Lord Haldane in Williams Brothers v. Agius, Limited[10], at page 520:\u2014\nThe law does not take into account in estimating the damages anything that is accidental as between the plaintiff and the defendant as for instance a contract entered into by the plaintiff with a third party.\nSee also Rodocanachi v. Milburn[11], approved by the House of Lords in the case just cited.\nIn this case Cram who bought the wool on the same sample had re-sold it at a higher price, and the respondent may be called on to pay him damages for not having delivered goods equal to the sample, Cram having refused to accept the wool on that ground. If the respondent received only the profit he was to make on his sale to Cram and was liable to the latter for damages, he would not be compensated by receiving from the appellants only the profit he would have made on the sale to Cram.\nIt may be added that although the respondent had agreed to pay 40c. per pound for this wool, it does not follow that the wool delivered was worth 40c. As a matter of fact, as found by the learned trial judge, it was worth a good deal less. My opinion therefore is that the learned trial judge adopted the true measure of damages, and that the appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division, which affirmed the trial judge, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Loftus E.

Idington J. dissents.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] refusing to set aside an order estreating a recognizance.\nPetropolis was committed for trial on a charge of indecent assault and gave bail for his appearance. The Grand Jury preferred an indictment for rape and he failed to be present when the case was called for trial. By order of the trial judge his recognizance was estreated, and an application to another judge to set aside the order was referred to the full court which refused to do so. An appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada. Respondent moves to quash.\nSubject to the motion, argument was heard on the merits.\nPower K.C. for the appellant.\nMathers K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant entered into a recognizance, taken before a stipendiary magistrate in and for the county of Halifax, who had committed one Basil Mandakos for trial upon a charge of indecent assault, for the sum of one thousand dollars which was made upon the following condition:\u2014\nThe condition of the within recognizance is such, that whereas the said Basil Mandakos was this day committed for trial to stand his trial at the next term of the Supreme Court of Criminal Jurisdiction to be holden in and for the county of Halifax on the 6th day of October, A.D. 1918 for that he did at Dartmouth in the county of Halifax on the 1st day of May, A.D. 1918 unlawfully and indecently assault one Jennie Young.\nIf, therefore, the said Basil Mandakos will appear at the next court of Criminal Jurisdiction to be holden in and for the county of Halifax and there surrender himself into the custody of the Keeper of the common jail there and plead to such indictment as may be found against him by the Grand Jury for and in respect to the charge aforesaid, and take his trial upon the same, and does not depart the said court without leave, then the said recognizance to be void, otherwise to stand in full force and virtue.\nThe judge who was first applied to for an order enforcing the same, directed it to be estreated because the accused did not appear and plead to an indictment for rape found by the Grand Jury.\nThereupon another judge was applied to by the appellant to set aside the order and the writ of fieri facias issued thereon.\nDue notice was given of said motion by service on the Attorney General of Nova Scotia.\nThe learned judge, so applied to, referred the motion to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia at the November sittings of 1919.\nThe court entertained the motion without making any question of such a course of procedure being correctly adopted as the mode of relief, so far as hearing of argument and deciding it.\nThe majority of the court held (Mr. Justice Longley dissenting) that the motion should be dismissed because upon their construction of the recognizance and conditions, the accused having been presented by the Grand Jury in a true bill accusing him of rape, and failed to plead thereto, the surety was liable.\nIt is objected by counsel for the Attorney General that the appeal here, though allowed by the court below, admittedly the court of last resort in the province, is not within our jurisdiction.\nThe question must be determined by the interpretation and construction of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act which reads as follows:\u2014\n36. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court: Provided that,\u2014\n(a) there shall be no appeal from a judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge or in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty; and,\n(b) there shall be no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code. R.S., c. 135, ss. 24 and 31; 54-55 V, c. 25, s. 2; 55-56 V, c. 29, ss. 742 and 750.\nI am unable to understand how proceedings for the recovery of the alleged debt due the respondent can be as urged either a criminal case or within any of the other exceptions in foregoing.\nThe Crown rules made 2nd February, 1901, by the judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, seem to substitute for all earlier procedure a clear and explicit method of dealing with all such debts by rule 83, rendering it the duty of any one taking a recognizance to transmit it to the office of the Clerk of the Crown in the county in which the proceedings are instituted and file same there.\nThe procedure for enforcing same does not in any way savour of a criminal charge nor in any respect does the judgment enforcing the recognizance constitute the surety a criminal, or the motion to set aside the judgment against him a criminal case, within the meaning of the section 36 quoted above.\nI, therefore, have no doubt of our jurisdiction. The provisions in the Criminal Code relative to the enforcement of such an obligation are obviously made to adopt the local court and officers who may be applied to therefor, and the legal machinery provided thereby as it were, as that through which such enforcement is made as that which is most appropriate.\nThe case of those claims arising in Nova Scotia would seem to fall under section 1099 of the Code which is supplemented by the rules I have already referred to.\nThe power and procedure are what the province may have furnished by virtue of its legislative authority under the British North America Act.\nThe motion on its merits ought, I think, to have been allowed.\nThe language of the instrument seems to me, with great respect, incapable of any other meaning than what it says.\nHagarty C. J. is good enough authority for me and his several judgments on behalf of the Queen's Bench hearing a motion of same nature as that in question herein in the cases of The Queen v. Wheeler[2] and The Queen v. Ritchie[3] I should abide by.\nThe high regard I hold for the late Mr. Justice Killam should induce me also to give heed to his in The Queen v. Hamilton[4] but that case he decided is not so clearly in point.\nAll these cases, however, clearly indicate that the law for relief for an improper forfeiture of recognizance is recognized elsewhere in Canada as well as in Nova Scotia to be the same.\nIf the converse case had been made to appear and a recognizance taken to ensure the accused answering the higher charge of rape and an indictment found for only indecent assault, the respondent's contention herein might be more arguable, but we need not follow that, I submit, further or pass any opinion thereon.\nI may point out, however, that the Criminal Code by section 856, seems to authorize any number of counts in an indictment save in the case of murder, and hence the Crown officer retained in such a case as this might be well advised to meet the difficulty which has arisen here by following a count for rape with one for indecent assault.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion this is an \"appeal in a criminal case\" within clause (b) of the proviso to s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, which enacts that\nthere shall be no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code.\nThis court quite recently determined in Mitchell v. Tracey[5] in accordance with the view expressed by three of its members in Re McNutt[6] that the word \"criminal\" in clause (a) of the same proviso is used in a very wide sense\u2014in contradistinction to the word \"civil.\" I think the words \"criminal case\" in clause (b) should receive a similar construction. These words in my opinion were used to signify what is more artfully expressed in section 47 of the English Judicature Act of 1877 in the words \"any criminal cause or matter.\" These latter words have, time and again, been held to extend to all the various proceedings incidental to a criminal prosecution. Ex parte Alice Woodall[7]; The Queen v. Steel[8]; and Rex v. Governor of Brixton Prison[9] cited by Mr. Mathersin his excellent argument, are instances. As put by Fletcher-Moulton L. J. in the case last cited discussing the scope of the words quoted from the English section:\nIf any portion of an application or order involves the consideration of a criminal cause or matter, it arises out of it and in such a case this court (the English Court of Appeal) is not competent to entertain an appeal.\nLord Esher in the Woodhall Case (1) had said:\u2014\nI think that the clause of section 47 in question applies to a decision by way of judicial determination of any question raised or with regard to proceedings the subject matter of which is criminal, at whatever stage of the proceedings the question arises.\nHe repeated this language in Reg. v. Young[10]. See also Ex parte Schofield[11]. The Criminal Code makes no provision for the appeal before us, (s. 1024). It therefore does not lie.\nIn substance what is sought\u2014what the appellant must obtain in order to succeed\u2014is the setting aside of the order for the estreat or forfeiture of the recognizance given by him for the appearance of one Mandakos to answer\nsuch indictment as may be found against him by the Grand Jury in respect to the charge aforesaid\u2014viz., a charge \"that he * * * unlawfully and indecently assaulted one Jennie Young.\nThe information laid was for rape. The magistrate holding the preliminary investigation thought the evidence would not support that charge and committed the accused for trial \"for the lesser charge of indecent assault\" and thereupon took the recognizance of himself and the present appellant for his appearance to stand his trial. The Grand Jury in due course presented an indictment for rape. Mandakos failed to appear for trial. By an order, dated the 14th April, 1919, intituled\nIn the Supreme Court; March Criminal Sittings, 1918 (a manifest mistake for 1919) Between 'The King,' plaintiff, and Basil Mandakos, defendant,\nthe recognizance was ordered \"forfeited and estreated\" and directed to be placed upon the estreat roll.\" The roll prepared by the Clerk of the Court is produced and after setting out the recognizance proceeds:\u2014\nAnd afterwards the said Basil Mandakos did not fulfil the conditions of the said recognizance but failed to surrender himself and take his trial as therein provided and after having been duly called in open court the said recognizance was on the 14th day of April A.D. 1919, at Halifax aforesaid, declared and adjudged by the court to be forfeited and estreated. Therefore it is considered that 'Our Sovereign Lord, the King, do recover, etc.\nThese proceedings were all taken under the Criminal Code, and (except possibly the final adjudication on the roll) in the discharge by the Supreme Court of its duties as a court of criminal jurisdiction.\nThe contention of the appellant on the merits is that the condition of the recognizance did not require the principal to appear to answer an indictment for rape, but only for indecent assault; and that there was therefore no breach justifying estreat.\nThe forfeiture and estreat of bail always was a function of the criminal courts. No other court has judicial cognizance of the fact of the default on which the estreat is based, which occurs in facie curiae. Sec. 1100 of the Criminal Code enacts that the forfeiture and estreat of recognizance is to be made by the court before which the principal party thereto was bound to appear.\nThat court was in this instance the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia at its criminal sittings. In adjudicating the recovery by the Crown of the debt resultant upon the forfeiture or estreat and directing the levy of execution therefor it may be that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was exercising a civil jurisdiction (Re Talbot's Bail,[12], but see The King v. Harvie,[13], that formerly belonged to the Court of Exphequer in England, into which it was the duty of the Clerk of the Crown, sitting in the Criminal Court, to \"estreat\" the recognizance duly certified. (Archbold's Criminal Pleading and Evidence, 21st ed., 101). The practice followed in the present case under the Criminal Code and the Nova Scotia Crown rules appears to be similar to that prescribed by 22 & 23 Vic. (Imp.) c. 21, s. 32, whereby the return of recognizance into the Court of Exchequer is done away with and the Clerk of Assize is directed instead to enroll forfeited recognizance, fines, etc., and to send a copy of the roll, accompanied by a writ of execution in a prescribed form, to the sheriff, whose duty it is to levy thereupon.\nThe appellant's motion in the Nova Scotia courts was to set aside the order for estreat and forfeiture. Unless he can obtain that relief his appeal cannot succeed. He has no good ground of complaint against the subsequent proceedings assuming the validity and regularity of the estreat itself. That the estreat and forfeiture of the recognizance was a proceeding in a criminal case, taken in a criminal court, and governed by criminal procedure, and, as such, not appealable to this court I have no doubt.\nI would therefore quash the appeal.\nMignault J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] 53 N.S.

Rep. 506) that this limitation does not apply to the valuation of the property for levying school rates.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] confirming the levy of school rates on appellant's property.\nThe only question raised on the appeal was whether or not the valuation on the appellant's property fixed by the contract mentioned in the head-note at $100,000 should be the valuation for school rates. The judgment appealed against held that it should not and that the assessment was properly made on the real value.\nTeed K.C. and Stevens K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Baxter K.C. (Cormier with them) for the respondents. The Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick whereby it was decided that the appellant was not entitled to claim, under and by virtue of legislation fixing a reduced basis of valuation of its property for the purposes of assessment \"for rates and taxes within said town\" of Edmundston, that such legislation extended to and necessarily determined the valuation basis for rates and taxes imposed by and through the legal machinery whereby respondent was entitled to have rates and taxes imposed for the support of the respondents' schools.\nIt is to be observed that there are three distinct corporate entities in each county entitled to levy rates and taxes within said town.\nThe town corporation is one; the county is another; and the Board of School Trustees of the District is a third.\nThe respondent in this case had jurisdiction over the town and part of the adjacent parish forming a school district known as School District Number 1.\nThe county corporation embraced both and much more.\nAnd a very curious feature of the legislation now in question is that by section four of the first Act passed to carry out the purposes of the promoters thereof, it was expressly provided as follows:\u2014\n4. In any valuation of the property and income of the said town of Edmundston for county purposes hereinafter to be made, during the period of twenty-five years in which this Act is made to apply, the total valuation of the real and personal property, lands, tenements and hereditaments and capital stock and income of the said Fraser, Limited, shall not exceed the sum fixed by paragraph one of this Act until fixed by said town council under paragraph two of this Act, from and after which time said valuation shall be the amount so fixed by said town council.\nWhy, if the same rule was supposed to apply to every rate or tax levied in the town no matter for what purpose, was this express provision made as against the county and not a word said as against the school rates or respondents' right to levy therefor.\nI can only infer that it was because the promoters of the legislation well knew that the settled policy of the legislature was, as the learned Chief Justice below states, against such obviously unjust exemptions.\nThe trifling amount the county would lose, or fail to reap, by the fixing of this assessment basis would hardly be worth contesting.\nThe increased expenses of the administration of county affairs likely to flow from the establishment of such an industry as the appellant's would be but a drop in the bucket.\nOn the other hand the probable increase of school expenses, if appellant's enterprise turned out successful, would be sensibly felt.\nAnd the maxim so often applied, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, seems to me applicable to this piece of legislation, which doubtless was a legislative expression of a contract between appellant and the town in process of formation.\nIt was followed by another Act validating the actual contract which resulted and that validating Act provided as follows:\u2014\n3. So much of the said Act, 2 George V, chapter 104 as is inconsistent with the provisions of this Act is hereby repealed.\nThe suggestion made by counsel for appellant that in many similar Acts, through abundant caution, the words \"saving and excepting school rates or taxes,\" or the like expression, was used, does not carry with me much weight when I bear in mind that, though pressed to do so, he could not point to a single instance, of the many he cited, wherein provision was made in such cases for providing the machinery for carrying out such exception but, on the contrary, the ordinary provision of the school Acts for effecting such purpose was apparently thought to be all that was necessary.\nIf in such cases that legal machinery given school boards for effectually levying their rates, can be carried out notwithstanding the basis of the levy being alleged to be the town assessors' valuation then surely it can be done equally well when as here we have the legal presumption held to be on the construction of the Act that school rates are in law excepted from the operation of the Act.\nI think the other questions raised in argument are so effectually dealt with by the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, with which I agree, that I need not repeat his reasons here.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014It is a settled principle that legislation intended to carry into effect contractual arrangements between local authorities and individuals shall not, unless the language is too clear to admit of a doubt, be construed as having collateral effects touching interests outside of those which, as being the interests of the parties immediately concerned, the legislature may be supposed to have had exclusively in view. That principle applies in this case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appellant company is not entitled to have its assessment for purposes of school taxation limited as provided for by the New Brunswick statute, 2 Geo. V, c. 104, and the agreement of 1917, confirmed by the Act, 8 Geo. V, c. 65.\nThe town of Edmundston has not exercised the power, conferred by section 108 of the Schools Act (C.S.N.B., 1903, c. 50), to bring itself under the provisions of section 105 of that statute. Section 111 therefore does not apply to School District No. 1, of which the town of Edmundston forms a part. That is made reasonably clear by the collocation of section 111 and the presence in it of the words\nrates ordered to be levied by the city or town council in accordance with the requisition of the Board of School Trustees or otherwise under the provisions of this Act.\nAs stated by counsel for the respondents in their factum, the words of section 111 just quoted\ndistinctly refer to the provisions of s. 105 (12) and (13), which have no counterpart in ss. 76 to 79, which alone are applicable to School District No. 1 of the Parish of Madawaska.\nThe valuation dealt with by the two statutes cited is of property liable\nfor assessment for rates and taxes within such town.\nNo provision is made for the assessment of property of the appellant situate outside the town but within the school district. Prima facie these two statutes deal with assessment for taxes and rates for town purposes only. The Board of School Trustees was not privy to the passing of this legislation and it is not a party to the agreement between the appellant and the town of Edmundston confirmed by the latter Act. It is most improbable that the legislature would pass legislation intended to affect the interests of the schools of the district adversely in a matter so important and to such an extent without at least notifying the school board and giving it an opportunity to protest against the interests committed to its charge being thus injured. At all events an intention so to act should not be imputed to the legislature unless the legislation in explicit and unmistakable terms puts its existence beyond question. I find no such terms in either statute. On the contrary both Acts, as I read them, purport to deal only with the interests of the parties who were before the legislature seeking them\u2014Frasers, Limited and the town of Edmundston.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick that the assessors pursued a proper and a reasonable course in first placing on the property of the appellant its actual or true valuation (in this case $1,000,000) and appending thereto the statement.\nnet assessment as per contract with the town of Edmundston to be reduced to ($100,000) one hundred thousand dollars.\nThe appeal on this\u2014the main subject of it\u2014fails and should be dismissed as against the school trustees.\nTwo minor questions affecting the town of Edmundston, though referred to in the appellant's factum, were not pressed at bar. It is therefore thought better to reserve the rights of the appellant as to them in the hope that the parties may reach an agreement which will render disposition of them unnecessary.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question in this case is whether or not the limit of valuation for municipal assessment would include school taxes.\nBy a statute passed in 1912 the legislature of New Brunswick declared that, in view of the contemplated establishment by the appellants of a large industrial concern within the town of Edmundston, the valuation of their real and personal property for twenty-five years should not exceed $200,000.\nThis legislation was to come into force when the Lieutenant Governor in Council was satisfied that the sum of $250,000 on capital account had been expended.\nNothing was done under the provisions of this Act.\nIn December, 1916, a contract was made between the appellants and the town of Edmundston dealing with different objects, viz., the sale by the town to the company of electrical energy, the supply of water, the taking of some earth material required by the company for construction purposes and containing the following:\n9. The valuation for assessment purposes as provided for under chapter 104 of 2 George V, of the Acts of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick shall be fixed at the sum of $100,000.\nIt was provided by this contract that the necessary legislation to confirm the agreement should be obtained by the town.\nAt the session of the legislature of 1917 an Act was passed to confirm this contract between the appellants and the town of Edmundston and to amend the Act of 1912; and section 2 declared:\nSection 9 of the said contract shall come into force and effect and be binding upon the said town of Edmundston and the said Fraser when a sum of $250,000 would have been expended and when a proclamation would be issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nThe appellants made the necessary expenditure and the proclamation was issued in March, 1918.\nIs this legislation binding for school purposes?\nIf we had to deal with the legislation of 1912 which was somewhat general in its character the decision of this court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Winnipeg,[2] could not perhaps be easily distinguished from it. It was held in that case that the exemption\nfrom all municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind\nwould include school taxes. It should be remembered, however, that in the province of Manitoba where this case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Winnipeg,[3] arose, the city had to levy and collect not only the municipal but likewise the school taxes. The school trustees of the city had no power to levy taxes for school purposes.\nIn the province of New Brunswick the taxes are levied and collected by the school trustees; and the legislature, in confirming a contract between the town of Edmundston and the appellants by which the assessment for town purposes was to be limited to $100,000, would not be supposed to intend to restrict the powers of the school corporation. We might consult on this point the case of Osment v. Town of Indian Head.[4], where it was held that an exemption from general municipal taxation does not include school taxes under the municipal ordinance.\nI am of opinion that the confirmation of this contract is binding, as declared by section 2 thereof, on the corporation of Edmundston and the appellants only, and not on the school trustees.\nThe judgment a quo which dismissed the appellants' contention should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stevens & Lawson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Max D.

The shipwrights were left in possession and, without any order from the court, completed the work and claimed payment in full from the proceeds of sale on the value of work done and materials supplied after as well as before the arrest.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the shipwrights having acted in good faith their claim in respect to the work done after the arrest so far as the selling value of the ship was thereby increased should be allowed in priority to that of the creditors.\nPer Idington J. If it can be established that the creditors knew or should have known that the shipwrights had continued the work in good faith believing that they could share in the proceeds of sale for payment, the shipwrights and creditors should share in the fund pro rat\u00e2. Failing to establish such knowledge the claim of the creditors should be restricted to the selling value of the ship at the date of the arrest and the shipwrights be paid out of the balance of the proceeds of sale.\nPer Brodeur J. The shipwrights have no priority in respect to the later work but should rank pari passu with the creditors on the whole fund.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (19 Ex. C.R. 259) varied.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the respondent.\nThe only question raised on this appeal was that stated in the head-note, namely, whether or not the Halifax Shipyards Co. had a right to be paid in full out of the proceeds of the sale of the Ship Westerian for work and labour performed and materials supplied in alterations on the ship after her arrest by the plaintiffs. The judgment of the Exchequer Court allowed this claim in so far as the work done was reasonable and necessary.\nGeoffrion K.C. and J. B. Kerney for the appellants.\nBurchell K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The ship \"Westerian\" was sold under proceedings taken by appellants for the purpose of enforcing claims which for the most part would have constituted liens upon her, but, by virtue of the circumstances which had transpired, ceased to have that quality, unless and until in an analogous sense there arose a respective precedence in favour of each appellant, by virtue of the said respective appellants' proceedings over those having failed to take the like steps to enforce their respective claims.\nAt the time when the first seizure of the \"Westerian\" for the purpose of enforcing one of those claims, took place, the intervening respondent was engaged in making repairs upon her under a contract with the owners which it had entered into for doing so, according to some specifications named and others to be delivered as the work progressed.\nAt the time of the said seizure, said work to the value of $15,000 had been executed, for which it is admitted the intervening respondent had a lien prior to these other claims.\nThe said respondent seems to have paid no attention to the seizure made, but continued its work under said contract without making any application to the court for protection in doing so, or permission thus to deal with property in the custody of the law, until another $15,000 worth of work, if to be estimated on basis of said contract, had been done.\nThe ship was sold for about $80,000, about four months after the seizure, and about two months after all the said work had been completed, and that fund is now in court.\nIt does not seem to have occurred to respondent until after the work had been nearly all completed to move herein. Then, upon doing so, an order was made by the District Registrar giving it liberty to appear and intervene in said action.\nThere should, I submit, have been something more decisive done by respondent than appears, before the sale of the ship, so that all concerned should have understood how they respectively were situated in relation to such a claim.\nOn the other hand I cannot help thinking that appellants, at the date of the application for said order allowing intervention, which took place about two weeks before the work was finished, must have had their attention thereby called to the fact that respondent must have assumed it would have a lien.\nNothing appears, in the case presented to us, helping us fully to understand many things bearing upon that very peculiar situation which was being developed.\nI cannot help having a strong suspicion that the appellants stood by, knowing that the respondent was finishing its job, and hoping that it would be well done, or at all events acted with some knowledge thereof, in such a way as to debar them from taking advantage, as they seek to do by this appeal, of the curious legal situation which has developed. Counsel for appellant, on my suggesting during the argument something like unto such possibilities, very properly pointed out that his clients' places of business were in Montreal, and this work was being done in Halifax, and there was no evidence of any of them having agents in Halifax, and that therefore, we must assume, upon such facts, they were ignorant of what was being done, and hence we could not deal with such a situation, or hold them bound by any estoppel, equitable or otherwise, from claiming as they do now.\nThe solicitor of appellants, however, carried on business in Halifax. Should he not be held as such agent for all the purposes in question of each appellant?\nI refer to all this because, after an examination of all the authorities cited by Mr. Justice Cassels and others referred to in argument, and occurring to me since, I remain, as the argument left me, under the impression that without more evidence than he had, or we have, to go upon, the terms of the order made are too wide.\nTo settle the law upon such a basis would enable parties situated as respondent was at the time of the seizure, to act as the respondent has acted herein, and to obtain as of right what the order now gives herein.\nIt may well be that no injustice may be likely to arise under this order now in question, but we have not such facts before us as to enable me to say so.\nOn the other hand, if my surmise is possible of demonstration, I think an opportunity should be given respondent to do so in the reference which has been directed below and must be had in any event.\nAnd in the event of respondent succeeding in establishing actual knowledge of the later work being done, or facts which would establish ground for the fair inference that they were put upon inquiry, and should have made further inquiry, and be bound by the highly probable results thereof, I should then be prepared to hold that the better way of applying the equitable doctrine invoked, would be to let the respondent rank in common with appellants upon the fund now in question.\nI see no ground for supposing that any of the parties concerned acted fraudulently or from any improper motive but incline to think each and all of them acted in entire ignorance of the law because they never considered the curious possibilities.\nBut that having so developed each feels justified in putting forth such arguments as, in law, may or may not uphold their respective contentions.\nTo maintain in its present form the order appealed from would give priority to respondent in a way which might work out grave injustice to some of those concerned, and also hold out a premium to those hereafter tempted to offend against the law in like manner as respondent has done by proceeding improvidently without the leave of the court.\nWhilst it is very desirable that appellants should not be permitted to profit at the expense of the respondent, yet there may, for aught we can learn from the record before us, have been created situations by reason of the course of the several proceedings taken which might render it impossible to push respondent's claim very far.\nFor example, we find the ship sold for $80,000, apparently about enough to cover all the claims and costs, except this item now in question. Assuming that the respondent's neglect to get leave of the court led all others innocently to believe that in fact the claims would be all covered by such a bid, and thus those others were induced thereby to refrain from protecting their interests by way of further bidding, would respondent be entitled in equity to encroach upon the fund further than in respect of items such as the removal of the coal and the like which saved the loss of the ship by the fire started in it?\nI have been throughout under the impression that these assumptions are probably not maintainable and of little consequence. Yet I think it right to thus illustrate how much we are groping in the dark for want of a more detailed and accurate history of all that has transpired which can bear upon the equitable rights of the respective parties concerned.\nThe solicitor for the appellants, as already observed, carried on business in Halifax and probably acted throughout in all these proceedings which began with the issue of the first writ on the 17th of January, 1919.\nHence I imagine it improbable that the lastly mentioned of the alternatives to be considered will present any serious difficulties. Yet a very little information in way of dates might have saved the trouble of suggesting its possibilities.\nThe inquiry as to the respondent's claim began April, 1919\u2014exact date not given\u2014and as to what was done from 8th March, 1919, to that date, or a reasonable time before sale on 10th May, 1919, from which it might be inferred appellants had a reasonable opportunity to consider the possibilities of this claim and govern themselves accordingly in relation to the sale, we are left only to guess at the facts. Passing these several suggestions, and again, for want of evidence, assuming nothing in any of them and considering the order made to rest upon the rather bare equity that inadvertently the respondent had so acted as to add to the proceeds realized, how far should the court below have gone?\nI agree with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that the value of the vessel when sold, if she had been in the same condition in which she was at the date of the seizure, is all appellants are entitled to out of the fund. How to determine that is no easy task.\nYet I think a reference to find such saleable value, on the 10th of May, 1919, on the assumption of the vessel being in the same plight and condition as when seized on 17th January, should produce the result sought for.\nRegard being had to the actual facts bearing upon selling value on the date of the sale, is no doubt what should be proceeded upon. And the deduction of any additional saleable value, realized by virtue of the labour and expense of the respondent after the first seizure, should produce the same result.\nIs that what the reference by the order now in question to determine \"the value of the work and labour done and materials supplied on and after the 17th of January, 1919, as may be reasonable and beneficial upon and to defendant ship\" is at all likely to produce? I am afraid not. Looked at from the point of view of the owners, no doubt all that was done would be reasonable and beneficial to the defendant ship. But, it is argued, and I think possibly with a great deal of reason, that what was done did not add to the realizable selling value so much as implied in the direction given. It is what actually was added, by virtue of said labour and expense, to the price realized, in other words, forms that part of the fund now in question, which respondent is entitled to.\nIn conclusion, any words should be adopted in the formal judgment which will embrace and adequately define and direct, first, a reference to determine whether or not the appellants having the conduct of the sale knew, or should have known, within a reasonable time preceding same, the facts that respondent had proceeded with the work now in question after the seizure, in good faith believing itself entitled to share, in respect of payment therefor, in the proceeds of the sale.\nAnd if that answered affirmatively then no need for further inquiry. In that event the respondent should share pro rat\u00e2 with appellants in the distribution of the fund in question, and the costs of respondent throughout should be added to the amount proven to have been expended by it in labour and material after the seizure.\nThen, secondly, default that finding and the ending of anything such as suggested above that would render it inequitable to do so, the saleable value of the ship, without such work and labour since seizure, as above indicated, should be determined by the referee, and the claims of the appellants upon the fund should be restricted thereto.\nIn such event the respondent should be paid its claims, for said work in question, out of the balance of the fund in court after deducting the saleable value so found.\nThe costs of the appeal in such latter event should be reserved to be disposed of by the local judge. Anglin J.\u2014The question for determination in this appeal is the right of the respondent intervenor, a shipwright, who, under a contract for repairs then in course of execution, had possession of the defendant ship at the time of her arrest at the suit of the plaintiffs, to claim priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the vessel under an order of the court in respect of some $15,000 expended in completing such repairs after the arrest, without the sanction of the court but in good faith. The circumstances out of which this question arises are sufficiently set forth in the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court.[2]\nThe learned trial judge (Drysdale J.) allowed the intervenor's claim for priority in respect of expenditure incurred before the arrest\u2014properly no doubt, recognizing and protecting its common law possessory lien therefor; Williams v. Allsup,[3]; 26 Hals. Laws of England Nos. 984 and 997; and in respect of that part of the judgment there has been no appeal. He wholly disallowed the claim for expenditure after the arrest because incurred without the sanction of the court.\nOn appeal from the latter part of this judgment the learned judge of the Exchequer Court allowed the intervenor's claim so far as its expenditure may be found to\nbe reasonable and beneficial upon and to the defendant ship\nby the District Registrar assisted by merchants, to whom a reference was directed, and granted priority therefor over the claim of the plaintiffs. From this judgment the plaintiffs now appeal.\nThe claim of the plaintiff, the Montreal Dry Docks & Ship Repairing Company, is for the cost of earlier repairs in respect of which it had relinquished any possessory lien. Its co-plaintiffs have claims for necessaries supplied to the ship during the course of such earlier repairs and before she came into possession of the intervenor. The rights of all the plaintiffs in rem arise, therefore, only upon, and date from, the arrest of the ship at their suit.\nNo doubt the intervenor would have been better advised to have sought the sanction of the court before proceeding with further repairs after the arrest of the ship, which, however, was left in its actual possession until the repairs had been completed. That sanction not having been obtained, however, the question arises what are the respective rights of the plaintiffs and the intervenor in regard to the cost of such subsequent repairs.\nConsideration of the numerous authorities cited and some others\u2014none of them directly in point\u2014has satisfied me that the basic principle on which this issue should be determined was correctly stated by Mr. Justice Cassels when he said:\u2014\nThese authorities indicate that the right of the plaintiffs who seized the vessel is on the value of the vessel at the date of the seizure (when they first acquired a right in rem) and not in the value subsequently enhanced by the necessary work of the shipwright.\nThat principle is found in the decision of Sir Robert Phillimore in The St. Olaf[4] in the following passage quoted by Mr, Justice Cassels:\nThe right of the plaintiff who proceeds against the St. Olaf was to have the value of the vessel at the time she was brought into court, as far as the proceedings in rem are concerned. His right was to have this res made responsible for the damage inflicted on his ship, so far as the value of it extended, and the repair of the vessel subsequent to the damage for the purpose of preventing a deterioration of the property could not in any way increase his right or the obligation of the other party. It left them, as I conceive, in statu quo in that respect. As put by Dr. Lushington in The Aline[5] at p. 120):\nWith respect to any subsequent accretion in the value of the vessel arising from repairs done after the period when the damage was occasioned (in the case at bar after the arrest out of which the plaintiffs' statutory lien arises) his claim to participate in the benefits of such increase of value must depend upon the consideration how that increase arises, and to whom in equity it belongs.\nAs put by Lord Esher in The Cella[6] at p. 87:\u2014\nWhatever may be the judgment of the court it must take effect from the time of the writ * * * * But if the money be in court or the court has possession of the res, it can give effect to its judgment as if it had been delivered the moment after it took possession of the res. It is contrary to the principle of these cases and to justice that the rights of the parties should depend not upon any act of theirs but upon the amount of business which the court has to do. Therefore the judgment in regard to a thing, or to money which is in the hands of the court, may be taken to have been delivered the moment the thing or the money came into the possession of the court.\nUnder the doctrine thus stated the plaintiffs would not have the benefit of any repairs subsequent to the arrest.\nIt may be that\nas against the owner who repairs his vessel at his own expense, the claim of the successful suitor would extend to the full amount of his loss against the ship and the subsequent repairs;\nThe Aline,5, at page 120; yet a stranger making such repairs on the faith of a possessory lien, which he erroneously conceived he would have, although not entitled to an equitable lien, The Aneroid[7], at page 191, may be in a better position to receive equitable consideration to which the owner cannot lay claim. On the one hand the ship-wright cannot be allowed to improve the plaintiffs out of whatever interest they acquired in the res by the arrest. Their right was to have it taken and sold for their benefit as it then stood and that right may not be prejudiced, as it well might be if full effect were given to the contention of Mr. Burchell that because the respondent had a contractual right, as against the owner, to retain the vessel and to complete the repairs to her which it had undertaken to make, the plaintiffs' security acquired by the arrest is subject to that right and the respondent is therefore entitled to priority over the plaintiffs for the full amount of its expenditure regardless of whether the selling value of the vessel was or was not thereby increased. While such a claim might be maintained if the assent of the plaintiffs to the completion of the repairs had been expressly given or might fairly be implied, (Jowitt & Sons v Union Cold Storage Co.[8] at page 10), the evidence here scarcely warrants such an inference. The respondent, in effect, asserts that its possessory lien extends to the post-arrest repairs because the Marshall did not deprive it of actual possession. But, as stated by Townsend J. in The Acacia[9],\nthe property proceeded against ** when arrested is deemed to be in the custody of the Marshall, although it may really remain in the hands of the party\nwith whom he found it. The intervenor's possessory lien ceased with the arrest, but his interest then accrued will be protected by the court which deprived him of his legal possession. (The Tergeste[10], at pages 32-34). As to it the plaintiffs acquired their security on the res cum onere. For any subsequent expenditure, however, not sanctioned by the court, the intervenor's claim must rest on equitable considerations, such as prevailed in the two receivership cases cited by Mr. Justice Cassels. On the other hand, on what principle can the plaintiffs claim the benefit of whatever additional saleable value was given to the vessel by the subsequent expenditure made by the intervenor? Equity would seem to require that, having acted in good faith, it should have the advantage of whatever increase in the saleable value of the res is brought about, so long as no prejudice is done to any statutory right acquired by the plaintiffs through the arrest (The Aline[11], at p. 121). As put in the factum of the respondent,\nmuch is to be said in favour of a principle which does justice to one party without doing injustice to the other.\nWhile the Exchequer Court does not possess the full equitable jurisdiction now vested in the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division by the Judicature Acts (Bow McLachlan v. The Camosun[12], in the decision of cases properly within the jurisdiction of the former Court of Admiralty, with which the Exchequer Court is vested, \"equitable considerations ought to have their weight\" (The Saracen,[13], at page 74. As put by Dr. Lushington in The Don Francisco[14], at p. 472:\nThe Court of Admiralty may, in deciding a case, be influenced by equitable consideration.\nFrom the very first it was held that the jurisdiction which the plaintiffs had invoked, originally conferred in 1840, (3 & 4 Vict., c. 65), should be exercised \"in equity and upon equitable principles.\" The Alexander Larsen[15], in 1841, at pages 290, 295. It is certainly within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to determine the extent to which the res formerly in its possession and the fund now in court representing it became a security to the plaintiffs by the arrest\u2014how far it is subject to the so-called statutory lien in their favour; and it is also within its jurisdiction to determine in respect of what amount the intervenor has a possessory lien and the priorities of these two liens inter se. By the fourth section of the Admiralty Court Act of 1861 the Admiralty Court was given express jurisdiction over claims for building, equipping or repairing any ship. In determining the question as to the extent of the plaintiffs' rights the court may properly so deal with the res under its control that an injustice shall not be done to a person who by the expenditure of money in good faith has improved the subject matter of the common security and increased its saleable value.\nA careful study of the authorities has not only failed to disclose anything directly opposed to the disposition of the question before us which, as I have indicated, seems to me to be proper, but has led me to the conclusion that that disposition accords with their spirit, although nothing directly in point can be found.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs and affirm the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, as I conceive he intended it should have been framed. In order that his idea may be more clearly embodied and more precisely expressed, the formal judgment of the court as issued, should be modified by striking out of the third paragraph the words\nas may be reasonable and beneficial upon and to the defendant ship\nand substituting therefor\nso far as the selling value of the defendant ship was thereby increased\nBrodeuk J. (dissenting).\u2014The question in this case is whether the respondents should have priority for the repairs made to the ship \"Westerian\" after she was arrested by the appellants. The local judge in admiralty decided that no such priority could be claimed, but his judgment was reversed by the Exchequer Court.\nThe appellants admit that the respondents should rank pari passu with them.\nThe claims made by the two parties arise out of repairs which were made for the purpose of converting the ship from an inland water vessel into a sea-going ship.,\nAt one time the appellants could have claimed a possessory lien for the repairs they did on the ship but for reasons which are not disclosed in the record they abandoned their possession and lost their lien.\nThe vessel was then delivered by her owner to the respondents to have the remodelling completed. When these repairs were going on the vessel on the 17th of January, was arrested.\nIn spite of this arrest the respondents went on to complete the repairs without obtaining from the court any authorization to that effect. There is no objection on the part of the appellants that the respondents should have priority for the repairs made before the seizure, but the contest is as to the rank of the claims for the repairs made after the arrest.\nFrom the time the arrest took place the ship was in charge of the court and if some repair work had to be done to her, it became necessary for those interested to apply to the court to obtain necessary authorization to do the work. The respondents should not have assumed a power which was entirely in the discretion of the court. It would not be easy for us to determine whether such authorization would have been given or not. As far as equity is concerned, both parties are in the same position. The respondents will have the benefit, when the sale takes place, of the $50,000 worth of repairs made by the appellants to the vessel and, on the other hand, the appellants will have the benefit of the $25,000 worth of repairs made by the respondents.\nThe rule that they should all rank pari passu appears to me as being the most equitable one.\nThe appeal should be maintained with costs of this court and of the court below and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored with a proviso that the claims of the parties should rank pari passu.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

He then went to a signal station a few feet away and on returning was struck by the oncoming train. He had a clear view of the track to the east before he started to cross and was nearly over when struck. He could not account for his failure to see the train coming. Seven hundred feet east of the crossing was a semaphore and the train stopped several hundred feet east of that and came on without stopping again. On the trial of an action against the railway company the jury negatived contributory negligence and found the company negligent in not stopping at a reasonable distance east of the distant signal (semaphore) and proceeding with sufficient caution approaching wreck zone which was observed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 528) that the jury were justified in finding that the failure to moderate the speed of the train when approaching the crossing was negligence and to infer from the evidence that had the train been brought to a stop as the Railway Act requires the plaintiff would have had a better opportunity to escape injury.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial by which the action was dismissed. The material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nH.S. Robertson for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This action is one to recover damages for injuries received by respondent Follick when struck by an engine of the appellant railway company as he was crossing the track in front of the appellant\u2019s approaching train at a railway crossing called Niagara Junction.\nThe facts are fairly stated in the appellant\u2019s factum as follows:\u2014\nAt the place in question the line of the Grank Trunk Railway running west from Niagara Falls intersects a branch line of the Michigan Central Railway running south to Fort Erie. The appellant\u2019s trains run on the Grand Trunk tracks and the train in question was a regular west bound passenger train.\nThe respondent was a section foreman of the Michigan Central Railway and at the time of the accident about 5.15 a.m. on the 21st of December, 1916, was engaged in helping to clear up a wreck that had occurred upon its branch line at a point a little south of the Grand Trunk line.\nThere are two signals or semaphores to protect the railway crossing against trains coming from the East. One is about seven hundred feet east of the crossing and is called the distant signal; the other is close to the crossing and is called the home signal. Both signals are under the control of a signal man stationed at the crossing in a small building called the \u201cH\u201d office.\nA little while before the arrival of the train on the morning in question the signal man notified the conductor of the wrecking train that the appellant\u2019s train would soon pass and the wrecking operations were suspended and the wrecking train taken off the crossing, its engine going to the north side and the cars standing on the south side of the track on which the appellant\u2019s train was travelling. The signal man on the approach of the appellant\u2019s train gave it both signals clear so that the train could come through.\nThe respondent had shortly before this sent his men home to breakfast and he himself was preparing to go and went into the \u201cH\u201d office for his lantern. Coming out of the door of that office he was facing directly towards the approaching train, but it is said that it was hidden from him at the moment by a car of the wrecking train which stood about seven feet south of the Grand Trunk tracks. The respondent walked from the door of the \u201cH\u201d office in a northerly direction towards the Grand Trunk tracks, having the above mentioned car on his right hand. He says that when he reached the north end of the car he looked easterly, and although the country is level and free of obstructions for at least one third of a mile to the east he says he did not notice the appellant\u2019s approaching train, although its headlight was burning and bell ringing and the engine was almost upon him.\nThe respondent continued on his course to and across the Grand Trunk tracks and had just passed the north rail of the track when the appellant\u2019s engine struck him and severely injured him.\nThe respondent is quite unable to explain why he did not notice the approaching train. Various explanations were suggested to him. He had been at work constantly for a period of twenty-two hours at the time of the accident and the appellants suggested that that fact may have been the effective cause of the accident. His counsel and some of his witnesses suggested that he may have been blinded by the headlight of the Michigan Central wrecking engine which stood at the north side of the Grand Trunk track. The respondent frankly confessed that he could not explain it.\nOn behalf of the respondent it was contended that the appellants were responsible for the accident because in the first place it is alleged their train did not come to a stop before proceeding over the railway crossing as it was required to do. The evidence as to the stopping of the train was conflicting. Some witnesses said the train did not stop at all after it had come in sight of the crossing. Other witnesses said that it did stop at a point about five hundred feet east of the distant signal, and then came on, the signals shewing a clear track. The jury contented themselves with finding on this point merely that the train did not stop at a reasonable distance east of the distant signal.\nThe respondent also complained that the train was run at an excessive speed. The evidence as to the speed of the train was also conflicting. The estimates of speed given by different witnesses varied from ten to twenty-five miles an hour. The jury did not make a finding as to the speed of the train. They found the appellants chargeable with negligence in not\nproceeding with sufficient caution approaching wreck zone which was observed.\nI frankly confess that at the close of the argument at bar, Mr. Robertson had by his able argument and clear presentation of the case for the railway company almost, if not quite, convinced me that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. After however, reading the evidence and judgments, and most carefully considering them in connection with the findings of the jury, I entertained great doubts that my first impressions of the case after the argument were correct.\nIn the result, I find myself in the position of being unable to decide that the judgment appealed from is so clearly wrong that I would be justified in reversing it.\nUnder these circumstances I will not, though still doubting, dissent from the judgment proposed dismissing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal must turn upon the question of whether or not there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the injuries which respondent suffered on the occasion in question were caused by the failure of appellant\nin not stopping its train at a reasonable distance east of the distant signal and proceeding with sufficient caution approaching wreck zone which was observed.\nThe appellant, in my opinion, absolutely discarded the statutory provisions contained in sections 277 and 278 of the Railway Act, which are as follows:\u2014\n277. No train or engine or electric car shall pass over any crossing where two lines of railway, or the main tracks of any branch lines, cross each other at rail level whether they are owned by different companies or the same company, until a proper signal has been received by the conductor or engineer in charge of such train or engine from a competent person or watchman in charge of such crossing that the way is clear.\n278. Every engine, train or electric car shall, before it passes over any such crossing as in the last preceding section mentioned, be brought to a full stop; provided that whenever there is in use, at any such crossing, an interlocking switch and signal system, or other device which in the opinion of the board, renders it safe to permit engines and trains or electric cars to pass over such crossing without being brought to a stop, the board may, by order, permit such engines and trains and cars to pass over such crossing without stopping under such regulations as to speed and other matters as the board deems proper.\nThe statute does not in express terms define the exact distance from the crossing at which the \u201cfull stop\u201d is to be made, but uses very imperative terms when it says\nthe engine, train or electric car shall, before it passes over any such crossing, * * be brought to a full stop.\nI should say that the stopping seventeen hundred feet away, alleged in this case, by the appellant was a mere mocking of the Act.\nSome electric cars do stop several times in that distance. If one happened to have stopped that far back from a crossing, would it be justified in rushing ahead when it came to the railway crossing, even if, as urged herein, the signal to pass was up?\nI submit decidedly not and hold that such a car must, before crossing, come \u201cto a full stop\u201d immediately next the crossing place.\nI say this to illustrate how variable the conditions may be for the respective moving things specified in the statute.\nObviously what would be the exact stopping place for an electric car might, for many reasons, be impossible for a train, or even an engine alone, upon a steam railway.\nHence Parliament, finding it impossible by the ordinary use of language accurately to define a common distance serviceable for each and all of these different kinds of traffic appliances, left that to the reasonable allowance necessary to be made in each respective case by those concerned, impliedly requiring, however, the exercise of a reasonable judgment. The verdict in terms finds this was not exercised and the evidence supports that finding.\nIn the case presented herein reasonable judgment seems to have been entirely absent. I can find no excuse for such a disregard of its use. I am quite sure that the signal being up permitting the crossing was no excuse for disregarding this statutory obligation, otherwise there would have been no occasion or need for enacting section 278.\nThe latter was an added, independent and imperative safeguard which experience, no doubt, had dictated was necessary; and it is to the observance, or non-observance, of that alone, and the possible relation of that non-observance to the accident in question, that we should direct our attention in this case.\nThe primary object of this statutory safeguard probably was to avert the possible collision of crossing trains, whilst at the same time protecting those employed in the complicated situation often found co-existent with such crossings.\nBut its existence and observance was something which all those working at the point of crossing, or immediately thereabout, had a right to rely upon for their protection.\nAnd all the more so when working under the peculiar conditions in question of removing a wrecked train, as respondent had been doing for twenty-two hours on a stretch up to the very moment of the crossing, and (after putting away his tools) he had picked up his lantern and was necessarily crossing the track on his way home.\nHad the statute been duly observed on that occasion, it seems quite clear he would not have been touched by the appellant\u2019s train. Had he been a mere casual trespasser he might have had no ground in law to complain.\nBut as a man lawfully engaged in his employment at the place in question, he was entitled to that measure of protection which a due observance of the statute would have produced.\nThe circumstances in which he was placed, by reason of the appellant\u2019s non-observance of the statute, rendered the conditions for his discharge of duty far more hazardous than need have been.\nThere is thus to my mind evidence of the natural sequence connecting the illegal act of appellant with the injuries suffered by respondent, which, of necessity, had to be submitted to the jury.\nI find no difficulty in understanding the verdict of the jury in light of the evidence and the learned judge\u2019s charge.\nI fail to understand the relevancy of the case of the Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. McKay[2] relied upon by counsel for appellant.\nAccording to the construction put therein, by the majority of this court, upon the statute there in question, the railway company had duly observed the terms thereof.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I was much impressed during the argument by Mr. Robertson\u2019s ingenious and forceful contention that the failure of the employees of the defendant company to stop its train at a reasonable distance east of the distant signal could not have been the proximate cause\u2014causa causans\u2014of the injury to the plaintiff, but was as most a remote cause or cause sine qu\u00e2 non. If all that the jury were entitled to infer from this omission of duty was that if it had been fulfilled the train would not have reached the crossing until the plaintiff had passed over it, I incline to think Mr. Robertson would be right. But it seems to me that the jury was entitled to infer more, and to find that, had the stop been made as required by the statute, the plaintiff would have had a much better opportunity by reason of a reduced speed of the train to escape being run down. Of course nobody can positively affirm that he would have escaped; but as, in the familiar cases of failure to sound the whistle or ring the bell as prescribed by the statute, the jury is allowed to infer that the omission to do so is the cause of injuries sustained at a highway crossing, although nobody can assert that had the bell been rung or the whistle blown the injured person\u2019s attention would have been thereby attracted to the approaching train and the accident averted, and the company cannot successfully appeal in such cases from a finding that its negligence was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, so here it seems to be impossible to hold that the jury was not warranted in inferring that the failure to discharge the statutory duty of stopping within a reasonable distance of the diamond crossing was truly a causa causans of the plaintiff being run down.\nWhile the additional finding\u2014that the defendants were negligent\nin not * * proceeding with sufficient caution approaching a wreck zone, which was observed\u2014\nseems a little vague and indefinite, on turning to the statement of claim I find that, in addition to failing to stop as prescribed by the statute, the only other negligence charged against the defendants is \u201crunning at an excessive speed\u201d and \u201cnot giving the proper statutory warning on approaching the level crossing.\u201d There is no evidence of the latter omission and it is not mentioned in the charge of the learned trial judge. But he does direct the jury\u2019s attention specifically to the allegation of excessive speed\u2014\u201cthat the train was going at too great a speed\u201d and he tells them that they should\neliminate from (their) consideration anything except such negligence as caused injuries to the plaintiff.\nAlthough it is not so clear as in the recent case of British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Dunphy[3], that the jury\u2019s finding of lack of precautions was directed to the specific neglect charged, I incline to think we should not ascribe to them an intention to travel outside the record or to find negligence of which there was no evidence and that we should assume that failure to moderate the speed of the train in approaching the wreck zone was the lack of due caution for which they meant to find the company to blame.\nNo objection to the findings seems to have been made when they were brought in. If counsel were not satisfied that they were sufficient and responsive to the questions submitted they might have called the attention of the trial judge to the matter and he might have directed the jury to bring in a more specific finding.\nOn the whole, while the case is undoubtedly close to the line, interference with the judgment appealed from seems to me not to be warranted. BRODEUR J.\u2014This is a railway accident. The action instituted by the respondent claims that as a result of the appellants\u2019 negligence he suffered damages. The negligence that is complained of is want of conformity to the statutory provisions of the Railway Act in reference to level railway crossings.\nSection 278 of the Railway Act enacts that a train, before it passes over a level railway crossing, must be brought to a full stop.\nThe question of fact is whether the appellants\u2019 railway train did or did not come to a full stop at the place where the law requires them so to do. The evidence is conflicting on that point. The jury was fully charged as to that and they found that the company was at fault. It was also for the jury to determine in those circumstances if there was contributory negligence and their findings are not such that we could consider them as perverse.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Chadwick & Sedgewick.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.H.

City of Victoria v. Mackay (56 Can.

Per Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The Registrar having declined to act upon the city respondent's application for registration of its title and no steps having been taken by it to appeal from this refusal under s. 114 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" it is not now open to the respondent to allege that the appellant's mortgage, though registered under such application, must be taken subject to a pending registration.

A by-law was passed expropriating that land, the property of one Moody. The \"Municipal Act\" enacted that such a by-law should be published in the Official Gazette and in a local newspaper. Instead of publishing a copy of the by-law, the respondent published a notice containing a statement of some of its salient provisions. The respondent later on served Moody with a notice to treat, paid him the compensation claimed by him and took from him a deed of the land. The respondent applied for registration of its title, but the Registrar declined to act upon it; and the respondent made no appeal against this refusal. A year later, Moody mortgaged his land, including the strip in question in this case, to the appellant, who registered in due course his mortgage in the land registry office. Subsequently to such registration the respondent municipality completed the registration of its title and proceeded with the actual work of the widening of Pandora avenue, removing the fences and verandah encroaching on the strip of land and also building a sidewalk. The respondents assert rights, as against the appellant mortgagee, to the strip of land in question on three grounds: 1. by expropriation, provided the by-law has been published according to statute; 2, by grant from Moody, provided the respondent's application to the Registrar for registration of its deed was still \"pending\" when the appellant registered his mortgage; and 3, by dedication, provided the necessary conditions for such were satisfied.\nJ. A. Ritchie and Leitch, for the appellant.\nMayers, for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent is a municipal corporation, created as a town by a British Columbia statute in 1867 (which was republished in the Revised Statutes of British Columbia 1871), and is endowed with all the powers given thereby, so far as not modified by later legislation, and was later constituted a city.\nIts council proposed, in the year 1911, or thereabout, to widen Pandora Ave., one of the streets of said City, and first by resolution and later by a by-law declared the said street should be widened according to a plan prepared by its engineer.\nThat by-law was followed by another expropriating by-law which never came into effect in law by reason of the failure to follow the requirements of the relevant statute as to publication which we held in City of Victoria v. Mackay,[3] to be an imperative condition precedent to such a by-law becoming effective.\nI cannot accept the suggestion submitted in argument that a mere notice, such as was published, can be held a due compliance with the statute.\nThe respondents' counsel proceeded to carry out the said purpose of widening said street by procuring from one Moody, the owner of the land in question, a deed dated 23rd of May, 1912, of the strip thereof so needed for that part of the street fronting his lot, and paid him $6,200 therefor.\nThe deed recited as follows:\u2014\nWHEREAS the Corporation of the City of Victoria, under the authority of the local improvement General By-law and Amendments thereto, and of certain by-laws relating to the particular work, have expropriated land for the purpose of widening Pandora Avenue from Douglas Street to Amelia Street;\nAND WHEREAS the said Party of the First Part is the owner or has some interest in the said lands hereinafter mentioned:\nAND WHEREAS the said lands hereinafter mentioned are necessary for the purpose of the said widening;\nand then in consideration of $6,200 (the receipt of which is acknowledged) granted the said strip now in question to the respondent.\nMoody thereby covenanted to execute such further assurances as necessary, and released to said corporation all his claims on said land.\nThe said price was duly paid out of the proceeds of the loan obtained to carry out the work of widening and paving on said street.\nStress was laid in argument upon the later use of said strip as part of the street, and also upon steps taken and orders got validating said loan, and impliedly validating, it was urged, the whole proceeding.\nIn my view, the alleged implication of validating said by-law is ineffective save so far as needed to protect the debenture holders in their rights as against respondent and those ratepayers liable for the loan so got, to carry out the local improvement in question.\nThe fundamental question raised, upon which the claim of the respondent or either of them rests, is whether or not the said deed from Moody to the city respondent, and the payment of the consideration therefor by the said city, constitute a dedication of the said strip for the use of the public as a highway.\nDedication requires an abandonment to the public use of any property or part of the dominion over same by the owner and an acceptance thereof by the public, or some one in authority to represent it, in giving such acceptance.\nI am quite unable to understand how it can be maintained that a deed of grant which expressly gives the entire property for the purpose of constituting it part of a highway and accepts voluntary compensation therefor, can be held less than a dedication, or that a duly constituted authority having power to deal with the question in paying the price can be said not to have accepted it.\nThe mode of giving, or the circumstances of its acceptance, and the proof of both as well as the extent of the gift, have given rise to many questions of law and fact, leading judges and writers upon these subjects to use, according to the exigencies of each case dealt with, more or less comprehensive language, in dealing therewith, respectively.\nBut the broad comprehensive lines of the principles upon which dedication rests do not permit of rights created in accord therewith being frittered away by being limited to the appropriate language used by judges in some or even many of a very large class of cases falling within said principles, when accidentally defining the rights of each party in relation to the existence of possibly a very narrow right or power resting on said principles.\nIt seems to me idle to argue that because the by-law was ineffective as a means of enforcing expropriation therefore all the acts done by parties to such an express grant, must be treated as void.\nClearly the sole question which need be considered herein is whether or not there has been an effective giving of the land for the specific purpose of being used as a highway, and acceptance of that given, for the purpose claimed when that donated had been paid for by the donee or grantee and thus the grant became irrevocable.\nThe suggestion that a gift without any consideration is necessarily implied in the doctrine and that valuable consideration having passed renders the doctrine inoperative, is most remarkable.\nThough it has been applied most frequently after long use by the public, when there did not appear to have been any consideration, that does not justify the assumption that where consideration having been paid then there is no place for the application of the doctrine.\nThe case for dedication is often much stronger when there has been an express or implied consideration. The case of dedication by a plan is one where certainly there is an implied consideration. There the consideration is the expectation of the benefits to be received, by virtue of sales made by the proprietor to parties expected to purchase one or more of the lots set out in the subdivision plan, which is often revocable until use by the public of receipt of the expected consideration therefor, through the sale and purchase of some lot pursuant to the plan.\nThen we have the case cited to us of Cook v. Harris & al,[4] where an express monetary consideration was given by neighbours desiring a dedication, and the owner gave a bond to the commissioners and it was held that even if the bond was invalid, yet the dedication was complete.\nWe have also the cases of McLean v. Howland,[5]; Fraser v. Diamond,[6]; Reaume v. Windsor,[7] ; supporting the same view as well as the dictum of high authority in the judgment in the case of The Attorney General v. Biphosphated Guano Co.[8]\nThere seems, I respectfully submit, a further confusion of thought in assuming that, because user is often relied upon in support of a claim of dedication, therefore until actual user there can be no dedication.\nAs pointed out by Buckley J. in the case of the Attorney General v. Esher Linoleum Company, Limited,[9] user is not dedication though in most of the cases dedication is proved by user.\nThe moment the consideration was paid and the land was conveyed, it thenceforward was devoted to the public for use as part of the highway and could not be used for any other purpose. Any one of the public had then and ever since the right to use it as part of the street and no one could complain of such use.\nThe fact that the second by-law as an instrument designed to enforce expropriation was as such invalid, did not render it illegal in the sense that a fraudulent or criminal attempt taints all it touches. It was good and stood as a mere resolution.\nIn view of what had preceded it, that proposition is not absolutely necessary to maintain the actual acceptance by the council of the grant and thereby complete the dedication.\nThe question of the capacity of the respondent city to take, without a by-law, such a deed and accept thereby the grant and make it valid, is of graver import by reason of the curious language of the statute of incorporation which reads, in section 56, as follows:\u2014\nThe municipal council shall be capable of holding real estate and have the entire control of all corporate property.\nThe rather loose manner of expressing the power by designating the municipal council as the party to become vested, has caused me some concern; for it certainly could never have been intended by the legislature to vest the property in the council, but rather in the corporation of which the council is only the governing body.\nI hold the capacity, though so expressed, to have been intended to enable the corporation acting through its council by mere resolution to take and hold real estate. I do so the more readily because the respondents claim in their factum that the city had such capacity, and no argument to the contrary has been presented by the appellants. It seems to be assumed by the course of the appellants argument that the by-law being, as such, ineffective, all else done the way of executing the purpose of the city respondent must also be held void.\nBut if the city had, as I hold, the capacity to buy a road allowance without resorting to a by-law for expropriation, then that which had been done completely established the widening of the highway so far as that part in question herein is concerned.\nThe appellants rely on many Ontario cases, and some Quebec cases, where such projects for making or widening highways have quite properly been held, under the respective law applicable, invalid for want of a by-law.\nIn doing so they overlook the fact that the Ontario cases were decided under a municipal Act which expressly declared that the powers of the council shall be exercised by by-law when not otherwise authorized or provided for and that the like enactments in Quebec governed the decisions in that province, cited to us.\nThe British Columbia legislature adopted an entirely different conception and without rendering the by-law an imperative necessity in all cases enacted that the municipal councils might, in a long list of cases specified, if they chose to do so, enact by-laws for any of the given cases.\nIt was thus left open to the municipal council of respondent (Victoria) or any other similarly empowered to hold real estate, to proceed to constitute highways by the purchase of the right of way. Everything of that sort could thus be done by mere resolutions. Of course if driven to expropriation proceeding that would involve the necessity of passing a by-law. And hence in this case if respondent city had to rely upon expropriation alone and had proceeded entirely thereunder and obtained Moody's title thereby, then it might well be held that in such a case the by-law being ineffective the whole proceeding would fail. But that not being the case and the deed having been got by virtue of a voluntary bargain, and presented for registration, the highway pro tanto was duly constituted. The failure of its non registration was entirely the fault of the registrar in whose hands it was for registration when Moody gave, inadvertently I suspect, a mortgage on this whole lot including that he had duly conveyed to the city.\nI fail to find anything in the provisions of the \"Land Registry Act\" which can help the appellants as against either of the respondents asserting their respective rights to protect the public.\nI do not think it is necessary to go through all the provisions of that Act to demonstrate that each of those relied upon is ineffective. Let us take the most drastic of all those provisions, which is contained in the amendment of the act by section 8 of ch. 36, passed 1st of March, 1913, which reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery certificate of indefeasible title issued under this Act shall so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled, be conclusive evidence of law and in equity, as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever, that the person named in such certificate is seized of an estate in fee simple in the land therein described against the whole world subject to.\nThis is subject to a number of express exceptions set forth in section 22 of ch. 127 of the R.S.B.C. being \"The Land Registry Act.\"\nOf these s.s. (e) specifies\nany public highway or right of way, water course or right of water other public easement. If I am right in my conclusion that the right of way had been effectively constituted by what happened in way of dedication, how can this furnish any answer to the claim of the Attorney General maintained on behalf of the Crown which had always up to this enactment been wholly excepted?\nI submit this does not as against him amount to anything in support of appellants on such facts.\nSections 4, 5 and 6 of the \"Highways Act\" (now R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 99) are relied upon by respondents and I think rightly as to sections 4 and 5, which are as follows:\u2014\n4. All roads, other than private roads, shall be deemed common and public highways.\n5. Unless otherwise provided for, the soil and freehold of every public highway shall be vested in His Majesty, his heirs and successors.\nIt seems clear that either the city or the attorney general representing the public must have a grievance and right to a remedy, and possibly both, under the peculiar circumstances of the case.\nIf either, then needless to pursue the inquiry.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The first point for consideration is this: Was by-law 1183 published witin the meaning of s.s. 176 of sec. 53, ch. 170 R.S.B.C. 1911? In common usage \"publication\" as applied to a document means, I think, something more than the giving of public notice of the existence of the document and information as to where it may be found and inspected. \"Publication\" of a document or newspaper means, I think, according to common speech in the absence of a qualifying context, the publication of the document in extenso. I think too much importance ought not to be attached to the fact that in other provisions of the Act the direction is that the council shall publish a copy. In addition to the clause under consideration there are sections of the statute, see e.g. sections 140 and 47 as amended in 1912, in which the council is directed to publish the by-law. These last mentioned provisions contemplate mainly the circumstances and needs of rural municipalities and it is difficult to suppose that in these sections the legislature is providing for publication in the limited degree which is now contended is sufficient under s.s. 176.\nIt should also be noted that s.s. 176 applies, of course, to rural as well as urban municipalities and that the legislature must have had in view some practical expedient for bringing home notice of the plans of the council to persons being interested, we may, I think, not unreasonably assume that the legislative intention is best interpreted by reading the words according to their ordinary meaning.\nThe next question is: Can by-laws 1151 and 1183 have effect in the absence of publication? The enactments of s.s. 176 are explicit and they have been authoritatively interpreted by this court in City of Victoria v. Mackay[10], as imposing the requirement of publication as a condition of any by-law passed under the authority of them taking legal effect as such. It should be mentioned here that no very convincing reason was suggested why by-law 1151 is not subject to the requirement of publication. The point is not very material and it may be that by-law 1183 is complete in itself; it ought not to be supposed that the assumption that this by-law was not within the condition is approved by this judgment. The respondent's counsel meets the difficulty by arguing that the by-laws are sustainable as enacted under the authority of another provision of the Act; the contention being that as regards by-laws passed under that authority the requirement of s.s. 176 in relation to publication is inoperative.\nThe provision invoked in support of this is s.s. 145a of sec. 53 and is in these words:\u2014\nSec. 53.\u2014In every municipality the council may from time to time make, alter and repeal by-laws for any of the following purposes, or in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\u2014\n(a) Subsection 145:\u2014For accepting, purchasing, or taking or entering upon, holding and using any real property in any way necessary or convenient for corporate purposes, and so that the council may direct the taking or entering upon immediately after the passing of any such by-law, subject to the restrictions of this Act contained.\nThe reasons which have convinced me that this view is not the right one are these. Ch. 170 contains a number of provisions having a variety of purposes by which powers of compulsory taking are given explicitly to the council, in some cases some specific restriction being imposed while in others a specific procedure is laid down. As an example of a specific restriction, s.s. 166 may be referred to\u2014a clause dealing with the construction of sewers in which authority to expropriate is given but the land to be taken is limited to such lands as the council may deem necessary for the purpose of \"constructing the main sewer\" and is not in any case to exceed \"10 feet in width.\" In s.s. 176 we have a special procedure.\nWhatever be the purpose served by s.s. 145 (a) there appears to be no reason for failing to give effect to the words \"subject to the restrictions in this Act contained\" and the object of this part of the subsection at all events appears to be plain. The words are put there no doubt in order to exclude the construction which is now put forward, the effect of which would be that by resorting to this general provision the council could in those cases which have been specially provided for, escape the inconvenience of observing the specific restriction laid down or the specific procedure prescribed.\nI conclude that by-laws passed with the purpose and intended to have the effect expressed in by-laws 1151 and 1183 can only become operative in law when the procedure laid down in s.s. 176 is observed.\nIt follows that subject to the question whether the highway was or was not established by dedication, the discussion of which I postpone for the moment, the proceedings necessary to establish a street by by-law under the authority of the \"Municipal Act\" were not taken; that the proceedings necessary to authorize the expropriation of property for the purpose of opening a street were not taken; and consequently that the respondent corporation cannot maintain its action on the ground that a title to the lands in question was acquired compulsorily for highway purposes.\nIn these circumstances, it seems impossible to hold that the corporation can establish a title under its conveyance from Moody as against the registered mortgage of Bailey. When Bailey applied for the registration of his mortgage, when he received a certificate of incumbrances, when he made his advance there was not even an application pending for the registration of the title of the corporation under the conveyance from Moody. An application had been made, it is true, for registration of the title but it was supported only by the production of the by-law, and it appears to have been only an attempt to comply with the requirement of s.s. 176 which prescribes that after the publication of a by-law for expropriation passed under that subsection the municipality shall apply for the registration of its title and shall file a copy of the by-law.\nIt is quite true that this application was made long before the registration of Bailey's mortgage but for some reason it was never entered in the list of incumbrances and noted against Moody's property. Nevertheless, whatever may have been the delinquencies of the officials of the Land Registry Office in their dealings with this application, the corporation appears to be concluded by the fact that after the registration of Bailey's mortgage its application was refused. In these circumstances sec. 104 of the Land Registry Act appears to be conclusive against the appellant.\nThe Registrar having declined to act upon the application and no steps having been taken under sec. 114, it is not now open to the defendant corporation to allege that the appellant Bailey's mortgage must be taken subject to a pending registration (see National Mortgage Co. v. Ralston)[11]; Howard v. Miller[12] it is to be observed, was a decision relating to the effect of the registration of an agreement to purchase land and turned upon the point that on the facts disclosed the respondent was not entitled to enforce his agreement specifically as against the opposite party. No such situation arises here, Bailey's mortgage being a legal mortgage.\nThe substantive question for decision is that to which the learned judges in British Columbia evidently devoted their attention, namely whether in the locus in question a public highway has been established by dedication. For this purpose two concurrent conditions must be satisfied, 1st, there must be on the part of the owner the actual intention to dedicate, (Folkstone v. Brockman)m[13], and 2nd, it must appear that the intention was carried out by the way being thrown open to the public and that the way has been accepted by the public. (Attorney General v. Biphosphated Guano Co.)[14]. I can find nothing in the legislation of British Columbia relating to municipalities giving the municipality authority on behalf of the public to accept a dedication by the mere acceptance of a deed of grant of land for the purpose of creating a highway, and in my opinion acceptance by the public can only be evidenced by public user or by the act of some public authority done in the execution of statutory powers.\nIt should be observed that by section 22 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" ch. R.S.B.C. 1911, the title of the holder of a certificate of indefeasible title is expressly made subject to any \"public highway,\" and it follows, I think, that if the public highway had been actually created by dedication before the registration of Bailey's mortgage, there could be no doubt that the public right would prevail as against the registered interest.\nIn the absence of some legal obstacle arising from the character of the municipality as a statutory corporation, governed as regards it capacity and the exercise of them, by the provisions of the \"Municipal Act,\" the evidence in favour of the existence of the animus dedicandi on the part of both Moody and the corporation would appear to be very cogent. Moody conveyed to the municipality on the assumption, it is true, that a street had been established by the procedure laid down in the \"Municipal Act,\" but on the other hand it is a most important circumstance that he, in transferring his land to the municipality, and the officers of the corporation in accepting it, were dealing with it as land devoted to the purpose of establishing a highway, an improved street along the front of that part of the property which Moody retained; a circumstance which no doubt affected materially both Moody and the corporation officials respectively in their judgment as to the amount to be demanded and paid by way of compensation. The intention of the council to devote the strip of land to that purpose is unequivocally declared, and had the intention been acted upon by the immediate opening of the street and that again followed by acceptance by public user, the only question I should have thought it necessary to consider at this point would have been whether or not the municipality could lawfully create a street by its ineffectual endeavours to follow the procedure laid down in s.s. 176 of section 53. As the municipality could not without a breach of faith continue to hold the land while applying it to a purpose other than that for which it was transferred, it is possible that the transaction (coupled with user by the public) might, in the hypothetical circumstances suggested, be regarded as a transfer to the municipality as a trustee for highway purposes and as amounting to dedication by the owner with the assent of the municipality and acceptance by the public. It may be that under the British Columbia statutes the results would be as suggested, namely, that the title to the fee would pass to the Crown instead of to the municipality but the fact that this collateral and unexpected result would ensue would hardly be of sufficient importance to counterbalance the fact that it was the settled and unqualified determination of both parties to the transaction, that the highway was to be established. Reverting now to the actual facts before us, these facts fail to establish the existence of a highway at the time Bailey made the advance and took his mortgage; and as against Bailey it seems to be clear enough that the public right can only be held to have arisen if the facts in evidence are sufficient to support the inference that he assented to the setting apart of the strip in question for the public purposes of a street.\nThe principle to be applied is expressed by Lord Macnaghten in Simpson v. Attorney General,[15] thus:\u2014\nAs regards the second, it is, I think, enough for me to say that a dedication must be made with intention to dedicate, and that the mere acting so as to lead persons into the supposition that a way is dedicated to the public does not in itself amount to dedication; Barraclough v. Johnson[16].\nThe facts proved do not appear to me to be sufficient to support the inference which the learned judges below have drawn.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs assert rights as against the defendant mortgagee to the strip of land in question on three distinct grounds: (1) By expropriation; (2) By grant; (3) By dedication. Under either the first or the second head the title would be vested in the plaintiff city; under the third head the right of highway would be in the public; hence the joinder of the Attorney General as co\u2014plaintiff.\nThere can be no doubt that the expropriation proceedings taken by the city were instituted under ss. 176 of s. 53 of the \"Municipal Act\" (R.S.B.C., 1911, c. 170) and, since it makes special and specific provision for the acquisition of land for street widening (the purpose of acquiring the land in question) recourse, in my opinion, cannot be had to general powers for the acquisition of land conferred either by s.s. 145 of s. 53, or by s. 399 of the \"Municipal Act\" in order to escape the effect or failure to comply with an essential requirement of s.s. 176. Generalia specialibus non derogant; Ex parte Stephens[17]. The heading of Part II of the \"Municipal Act,\" of which No. 53 is the first section, viz., \"Powers required to be exercised by By-law,\" makes it clear that a valid by-law is essential to the exercise of powers conferred by provisions included in that part of the statute. Hammersmith Rly. Co. v. Brand[18] ; Eastern Counties and London & Blackwall Rly. Cos. v. Marriage[19]; City of Toronto v. Toronto Rly. Co.[20].\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the by-law passed under s.s. 176 was ineffectual for want of publication as prescribed by that section. City of Victoria v. Mackay[21]. The expense and trouble involved in publishing such a by-law in extenso might afford a strong argument for an amendment of the statute if the legislature should be convinced that the object of its policy would be sufficiently attained by the publication of a mere notice of the by-law, such as we have in this case, in some convenient and accessible place where a copy of it might be seen. But such an argument scarcely affords ground for a court undertaking to dispense with the observance of such a distinct requirement as that expressed in the words\nevery by-law passed under the provisions of this sub-section before coming into effect shall be published.\nI agree with the learned trial judge and the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, with whom Eberts J. concurred, that this implies publication in full. Sections 3 and 5 of the \"Municipal Act\" make it clear that s.s. 176 applies to the city of Victoria and that nothing in any special act relating to it shall \"impair, restrict or otherwise affect\" the powers which that subsection confers. The plaintiff municipality therefore did not acquire title by expropriation.\nNeither can it assert title under its unregistered grant from the owner Moody in view of the provisions of s. 104 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 27) that\nno instrument * * purporting to transfer * * land or any estate or interest therein * * shall pass any estate or interest either at law or in equity in such land until the same shall be registered in compliance with the provisions of this Act.\nThe city's application for the registration of the conveyance from Moody having been ultimately rejected and no steps having been taken to set aside the registrar's decision under s. 114, the case must be treated as if no application for registration of it had been pending when application was made to register the Bailey mortgage and it was in fact registered. National Mortgage Co. v. Rolston[22].\nThe claim of highway by dedication requires more consideration. In order to bind the mortgagee, against whom no finding has been made that he took his mortgage with notice either of the city's attempted expropriation or of its negotiations with Moody and the conveyance given by him\u2014and the evidence would not warrant such a finding\u2014it must be established either that a highway existed when he obtained and registered his mortgage, which would in that case be subject to this public right, (\"Land Registry Act,\" s.s. 34 and 22 (e),) or that the mortgagee himself dedicated his interest for highway purposes or is estopped by his conduct since becoming mortgagee from denying the existence of the highway claimed.\nAfter fully considering the testimony of Bailey himself and all the other evidence in the record I have failed to find anything on which the existence at any time of the essential animus dedicandi (Simpson v. Attorney General[23]; Mann v. Brodie[24]; Barra-clough v. Johnson[25] could safely be attributed to him. Neither do I see in his conduct, which was purely negative or passive, enough to found an estoppel against him. There is, in my opinion, nothing whatever to show that he was aware of circumstances which might give to his inaction the significance that the plaintiff now attributes to it\u2014nothing to shew that a situation arose which called for active interference by a mere mortgagee at the peril of loss or impairment of his rights.\nNotwithstanding the undoubted fact that it was the purpose of Moody, the owner, to convey the land in question to the city as a vendor and because he deemed himself obliged to part with it under the expropriation proceedings which had been instituted, I incline to the view and shall assume that his deed, though wholly ineffectual to convey any estate or interest, may be taken to evidence sufficiently the existence on his part of intention to dedicate the land described in it for a public highway\u2014that it may even be regarded as an express dedication. Reaume v. City of Windsor[26] affirmed here on the second day of May, 1916. The appropriation and setting apart of the land for a public street would seem (to adopt the phrase of counsel for the respondent) to be \"the conclusive factors\" in dedication rather than the voluntary or gratuitous character of the transaction on the part of the owner.\nBut, in order to bring a highway into existence by dedication in addition to the intention of the owner of the soil to dedicate it to the public for that purpose, however directly evidenced, an acceptance by the public is also essential; Moore v. Woodstock Woolen Mills[27]; Mackett v. Commissioners of Herne Bay[28]; Attorney General v. Biphosphated Guana Co.[29]; and the crucial question is this case in my opinion is whether there was such an acceptance as was necessary to make the land in dispute part of Pandora Avenue before the execution and registration of the defendant's mortgage. User by the public\u2014the usual indication of acceptance by the public\u2014is entirely absent. Nothing was done to throw the strip of land open until after Bailey had become the registered mortgagee of it. There was no expenditure of public money upon it. It remained fenced in with, and, to all appearances, part and parcel of, the Moody property.\nBut it is said there is abundant evidence of acceptance by the municipal corporation and that that is acceptance on behalf of the public, or its equivalent. Of the intention of the municipality to devote this land to highway purposes there can be no question and there seems to be some American authority which may be invoked in support of the position that acceptance by the municipality without statutory authorization may be tantamount to acceptance by the public. The cases are collected and reviewed in 18 Corpus Juris, Vbo. Dedication, pars. 79, 80, 88 and 99. But I have failed to find any English authority which accepts that view.\nThe municipal corporation is a purely statutory body and it has and can exercise only such powers as are conferred upon it by statute. Its position in this respect is well stated by Brayton J. delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in Remington v. Millerd[30]:\u2014\nSupposing the dedication to be proved, is there in this case any evidence of an acceptance by the public, any assent on their part to the use of the land in the mode intended? The usual evidence of such acceptance, namely, a user by them, is here wanting. This way has never been used. In all the cases cited there had been a use by the public from which their assent might be inferred, and in many of them the use had been for so long a period as to warrant the presumption not only of their assent, but of the act of dedication also. It is not easy to perceive how otherwise than by user this assent is to be shewn. The term public includes the whole community, the whole mass of individuals in the state. They cannot constitute agents to assent for them. The whole doctrine of dedication is based upon the fact that the public have no agents; that there is no one with whom the owner of the land can agree or contract directly; and it is therefore said that in these cases it is not necessary that the public should be a party, and that, from the necessity of this case, they cannot be.\nDoes the plea contain any other evidence of an acceptance on the part of the public? If so, it is the fact that the town council of East Greenwich, on the 31st day of August, 1844, declared the way to be an open highway, and ordered it to be repaired at the expense of said town. If this be evidence of such acceptance, it must be because the town council are to be deemed the general agent of the public, and for this purpose represent them, or because they are by statute specially empowered to accept the way in the mode set forth.\nBut are they such agent? Have they any such representative character? They are the creature of the statute, invested with certain definite powers. They are enabled to do such acts as the statute authorizes and to do them in the mode prescribed; and if they assume to do other acts, or to do them in other modes, their doings are merely void, and cannot become the more valid from any representative character which may be imputed to them. It is difficult to see how they are the agents of the public, more than the surveyor of highways.\nHere the sole authority of the municipal corporation for\nestablishing * * * opening, * * * making, * * * improving * * * widening, * * * roads, streets, * * * or other public thoroughfares.\nis conferred by s.s. 176 of s. 53 of the \"Municipal Act.\" A by-law meeting the requirements of that section is the method prescribed for the exercise of those powers. The by-law passed by the council was inefficacious because of non-compliance with an essential requirement. (City of Victoria v. Mackay)[31]. It follows that the only power which the city possessed to widen Pandora Avenue or to procure or apply land for that purpose has not been exercised. To permit it to establish or widen a street otherwise than by following the specific method prescribed would be in effect to supersede the statute and to concede to the municipal corporation a power which it does not possess. It follows in my opinion that there was no highway in existence when the defendant's mortgage was executed and registered.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and would direct the entry of judgment dismissing the action with costs. BRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondents claim the title to a strip of land on Pandora Avenue, in Victoria, B.C.\nNotice of expropriation of that piece of property had been given by the city of Victoria, and after notice to treat, the owner Moody agreed, on the 23rd of May 1912, to sell that strip of land to the municipal corporation for a certain sum of money. The city unfortunately did not register its title; and in March, 1913, Moody gave to the appellant Bailey a mortgage affecting his property on Pandora Avenue and, by the description. which is made in the deed, covering the strip of land sold to the corporation.\nThere was evidently no fraud on the part of the parties to the deed of mortgage and it is evident that they have acted in absolute good faith. In 1917 the city of Victoria having discovered its omission to register its conveyance applied to the Land Registry Office for registration but having found that the conveyance could only be registered subject to the Bailey mortgage, and Bailey having refused to sign a release, the present' action has been instituted to have the Moody conveyance registered in priority to the Bailey mortgage.\nThe action was maintained by the trial judge and by the court of Appeal, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Eberts dissenting.\nThe trial judge found that the expropriation by-law was invalid because it had not been duly published but that the Moody conveyance constituted a dedication of the strip of land in question and that Bailey had acquiesced in such dedication.\nThe dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal held that there was no legal evidence of dedication, that the transaction between Moody and the city was a compulsory sale, that Moody never intended to dedicate and that Bailey never acquiesced in such dedication.\nThe most important issue to dispose of at first is whether there is dedication.\nThere was at first a by-law passed by the city for the expropriation of the land in question, but the by-law was never duly published and registered. This court in a case of The City of Victoria v. Mackay[32], held that the publication of a by-law is a necessary condition to its validity.\nThe proceedings which have subsequently taken place consist in a notice to treat to Moody, in the delivery by the latter of his claim which seemed to have been accepted by the city since it issued its cheque for it and a conveyance was duly executed by him on the 23rd May, 1912, of a strip of land in front of his property for the purpose of widening Pandora Avenue.\nWould that constitute dedication of this strip of land? I would not hesitate in answering in the affirmative. No formal conveyance is required to affect a common law dedication; but where there is a deed or writing as in this case, the conclusion is still more certain. Dedication means the setting apart by the owner of land for the use of the public. In most of the cases of dedication, the title is a matter of inference as to the intention of the owner and as to the acceptance by the public. But in this case there is no doubt as to the intention of the owner Moody, since he formally signed a deed in which he declared that the land was granted for the purpose of widening a public street. There is no doubt also as to the grant being accepted by the municipal corporation representing the public.\nBut, besides, works have been carried out by the municipal corporation on this strip of land in order to utilize it as a public street. The fences and verandah which were encroaching on the strip of land were removed and a' sidewalk was built. All this was done when Bailey was the mortgagee of the property. Since he claims to-day that his mortgage was covering the whole lot, including the strip of land in question, he should have protested against the municipal authorities using part of his property .He was fully aware of the situation. For months and months this widening of Pandora Avenue was discussed in the press and was the subject of public discussion in the municipal council amongst the residents of the locality. When he loaned money to Moody he made inquiries as to the value of the property; and it may \"be reasonably inferred that the estimation he got was as to the property less the strip of land in dispute. He saw the front of the property being altered, the fences and the verandah and the steps being removed; he saw the sidewalks being built and he did not object. He must be held as having acquiesced in the corporation respondent taking and using this strip of land. His conduct shews that he has himself dedicated it to the public. It is now too late for him to claim certain rights which the mortgagor did not intend to recover.\nIt is not necessary that the public should have possession of the lands dedicated for any great length of time. All that is required is the assent to the use of the property by the public and the actual enjoy- ment of the same by the public for a length of time sufficient to have created on the part of the public such reliance upon the enjoyment of such easements as that the denial of such rights would now interfere with the public convenience and with private rights.\nThe appellant claims that the city of Victoria not having registered the conveyance by Moody of the strip of land, no estate or interest has passed; (sect. 104 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" 1911).\nUnder the provisions of the \"Land Registry Act,\" the holder of a registered mortgage, as Bailey, is only prim\u00e2 facie entitled to the estate interest in respect of which he is registered subject to the rights of the Crown (R.S.B.C. 1911 ch. 127, s. 34) and if a person has an indefeasible fee under section 22 he is seized of an estate in fee simple in the land against the whole world subject to different reservations; amongst others is the public highway.\nThe evidence, as I have said, shews to me that a public highway on the strip of land in dispute exists and the appellant cannot successfully claim that his title could prevent the public from using it.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.;\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014My learned brothers have so fully dealt with this case that my conclusions may be briefly expressed.\nThe City of Victoria had decided by by-law to widen Pandora Avenue and to take by expropriation a strip from Moody's land facing on that avenue, and a notice to treat was served on Moody. This was in 1912, and Moody, whose land was being taken compulsorily, filed in April, 1912, a claim with the city for compensation, cost of removal of buildings and depreciation in rental value amounting to $6,260. The city decided to pay this amount to Moody and the latter, on the 23rd May, 1912, executed a conveyance to the city for the sum of $6,260, of the strip of land required for the widening of the avenue. This conveyance was not registered and it is only in March 1917, that the city applied for its registration.\nThe expropriation by-law was not published as required by R.S.B.C., ch. 170, sec. 53, sub-sec. 176, par. 2, and the notice of its adoption, which was published in the Gazette, is not, in my opinion, the publication required as a condition of the by-law coming into effect. I concur with the reasons of my brother Duff on this branch of the case and hold that this by-law did not come into effect, although Moody\u2014 and this is a feature of the case in so far as the question of dedication is concerned\u2014 must be taken to have assumed that under this by-law his land was expropriated for the purpose of the street widening and that the sole question was as to the amount of the compensation to be paid him.\nThe city, it is true, applied for registration of the by-law in June, 1912, and this application should have been noted as pending by the registrar, which how\u2014ever was not done. The application was refused in October, 1914, and the city did not appeal from the refusal.\nIn the meantime it was proposed to Bailey, who then resided in Victoria, to loan $15,000 on Moody's property, and after Bailey had ascertained the assessed value of the property, a mortgage was granted to him by Moody of this property on the 8th March, 1913. On the 10th March, 1913, Bailey obtained from the Registrar-General a certificate of incumbrance shewing that there were no charges on Moody's land save Bailey's application to register his mortgage. Bailey duly advanced the $15,000 to Moody on the security of the property and his mortgage was registered on the 15th April, 1913.\nAs matters then stood, Bailey's mortgage was the only charge on Moody's property and was unaffected by Moody's unregistered conveyance to the City of Victoria. The latter however being unable to set up against Bailey the expropriation by-law for want of publication and Moody's conveyance for want of registration, claims that Moody dedicated the strip of land for the purposes of the highway and the Attorney General of British Columbia, as representing the public, joined the city in demanding that this dedication be declared effective.\nDedication is of course a matter of intention, and I will assume that Moody, who had received a notice to treat and who was submitting to a by-law expropriating a strip of his land for the widening of the highway intended to dedicate this strip as a part of the highway. But intention to dedicate, although of course essential, does not alone suffice for a complete dedication. There must be an acceptance by the public and this acceptance is complete when there has been user of the dedicated land by the public.\nNow it cannot be questioned that any user of this strip of land by the public was subsequent to the registration of Bailey's mortgage, and unless Bailey acquiesced in the dedication by Moody, I would think that no dedication of the strip of land by Moody can be set up against Bailey. To my mind, under the circumstances of this case, the only question is whether or not Bailey assented to Moody's dedication. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that the dedication had been accepted by the city before the Moody mortgage, because he apparently thought that public user\u2014and there was none before April, 1914\u2014 was not essential to a valid dedication. But assuming that this view was incorrect and that the mortgagee's assent or public user was essential to complete the dedication, the learned trial judge held that Bailey had assented to the dedication. This, as the learned judge clearly indicates, was merely an inference. He says:\u2014\nAssuming that where a mortgagor is in possession of mortgaged premises, the mortgagee's assent is necessary to a dedication, and further assuming that user is essential to a valid dedication, I hold, on the facts here, the defendant must be held to have given such consent. The inference of assent by a mortgagee, cannot, I think, require more cogent proof than does the inference of dedication by the owner. If so, the evidence (excluding everything that occurred prior to April, 1914), already referred to as establishing dedication by Moody, establishes, in my opinion, assent by Bailey. In addition to this evidence, the record shews that Bailey was throughout this period resident in Victoria, that at any rate, some short time after the actual work was entered upon, he devoted particular attention to this property because of default in the payment of interest, that he has personally used the sidewalk built on the disputed land and that he made no objection until his pleadings in this action were filed.\nBailey was not called to testify before the learned trial judge, but his evidence on discovery was put in at the trial, and his story is that so long as his interest was paid, and it was regularly paid for a couple of years, he did not bother about the property at all. He saw that the fence had been removed, that a sidewalk had been built along the strip, but he considered that it did not concern him at all so long as his interest was paid. There was of course a good deal of talk about the future of Pandora Avenue, for at the time there was quite a boom in real estate in Victoria, but Bailey's position seems to be this, that when he lent the money the property was assessed at a value of from $75,000 to $80,000, that he thought he had a gilt edge security, and it only was when the interest payments stopped and very high taxes were imposed on the property for the widening, that he concerned himself with the matter.\nWith all deference, I cannot think that from Bailey's evidence a fair inference can be drawn that Bailey assented to the dedication by Moody of a strip of his property as a part of the highway. As I have said, the assent of Bailey was merely inferred by the learned trial judge from the circumstances, and in a matter of inference this court is in as favourable a position as was the learned trial judge. Thinking as I do that Bailey, by the registration of his mortgage after obtaining a certificate from the Registrar that the property was clear of charges, acquired a title which was unaffected by the expropriation scheme of the City of Victoria, I would not without the clearest evidence assume that Bailey assented to anything which would deprive him of his security as to any portion of the land covered by his mortgage. The City of Victoria acted with extreme carelessness in this matter. It paid Moody, obtained a conveyance from him and neglected to register it. It passed an expropriation by-law and failed to publish it as required by statute. It attempted to register this by-law, and when registration was refused, it did not appeal from the refusal as it could have done. The allegation that there was dedication by Moody appears to have been an afterthought, and was only made by an amendment. I would not under these circumstances come to the assistance of the city so as to affect in any way a security obtained for a bond fide advance of money made on the faith of the public register. In arriving at this conclusion I have given due consideration to the fact that the finding of the learned trial judge that Bailey assented to the dedication was concurred in by a majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal. But I do not think that the great weight which is generally given to concurrent findings of fact prejudices me in a matter of this kind from expressing my own judgment as to the inference drawn by the learned judges. In Montgomerie & Co., Ltd., v. Wallace-James[33], the House of Lords decided that there was no law or settled practice of that House to prevent it from differing even from two concurrent judgments of fact, and that the House could not decline the duty of formally expressing its own judgment. Of course, as stated by Lord Macnaghten in Johnston v. O'Neill[34], adopting the dictum of Lord Watson in Owners of the \"P. Caland\" v. Glamorgan Steamship Co.[35],\na court of last resort ought not to disturb concurrent findings of fact by the courts below, unless they can arrive at\u2014I will not say a certain, because in such matters there can be no absolute certainty\u2014but a tolerably clear conviction that these findings are erroneous.\nHere I feel convinced that the finding that Bailey assented to a dedication by Moody is erroneous, may I say so with all possible respect for the learned judges who thought otherwise. Moreover, as I have said, this is a matter of inference and does not rest upon the credibility of witnesses, and the recent case of Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Ins. Co[36], is an authority for the proposition that\nwhere the question is as to the proper inference to be drawn from truthful evidence, then the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges of an appellate court. The appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed and the respondents' action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: John R.

Three days later, on before he died, it was again presented and read over to him, clause by clause, the solicitor, as each was read, asking if he understood it and he indicating that he did. The will was then executed by the testator making his mark the solicitor guiding his hand as he could not see. In an action to set it aside\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (46 Ont.

Macdonnell for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the close of the argument in this case which was quite elaborate and dealt with every phase of the evidence bearing upon the capacity of the testator to make the will in question alike when the instructions were given for its making on the Tuesday, and again on the Friday when it was executed, I was of the opinion that the appellant had utterly failed to establish the testator\u2019s incapacity.\nIn deference, however, to the opinion of the trial judge to the contrary effect, I have read and carefully considered all of the evidence called to our attention, with the result that I am more strongly confirmed in my opinion.\nThe Appellate Division which set aside the judgment of the trial judge and affirmed the validity of the will speaks of Mr. Anderson, the solicitor who took his instructions from the testator and drew the will, as a \u201ccareful and competent solicitor.\u201d He, it appears to me, took great pains to make sure that the testator fully understood the disposition he was making of his property, reading each paragraph over slowly and carefully to him and satisfying himself that the testator clearly understood them. Then we have the evidence of Dr. Forrest, who attended the deceased while he was in hospital and speaks of his mental and physical condition when the instructions for the making of the will were given and when it was read over to the testator, clause by clause, and executed by him.\nI agree fully with the judgment of the Appellate Division, delivered by Maclaren J.A., allowing the appeal from the judgment of the trial judge and affirming the validity of the will. The decision of the Privy Council in the case of Perera v. Perera[3], is relied upon in the judgment appealed from and is, I think, peculiarly applicable to the case before us. The head\u2011note to that case reads that\nwhere a testator is of sound mind when he gives instructions for a will but at the time of signature accepts the instrument drawn in pursuance thereof without being able to follow its provisions, held, he must be deemed to be of sound mind when it is executed.\nLord Macnaghten in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee is reported at page 361, as follows:\u2014\nThe learned counsel for the appellant did not contend that the witnesses in support of the will were acting in conspiracy or saying what they knew to be false. He said that the will may have been, and probably was, read over to the testator, but that there was nothing to shew that he followed the reading of the will or understood its meaning. He adopted the argument of Laurie J., to the effect that it was not enough to prove that a testator was of sound mind when he gave instructions for his will, and that the instrument drawn in pursuance of those instructions was signed by him as his will, if it is not shewn that he was capable of understanding its provisions at the time of signature. That, however, is not the law. In Parker v. Felgate[4], Sir James Hannen lays down the law thus: \u201cIf a person has given instructions to a solicitor to make a will, and the solicitor prepares it in accordance with those instructions, all that is necessary to make it a good will, if executed by the testator, is that he should be able to think thus far: I gave my solicitor instructions to prepare a will making a certain disposition of my property; I have no doubt that he has given effect to my intention, and I accept the document which is put before me as carrying it out.\nTheir Lordships think that the ruling of Sir James Hannen is good law and good sense. They could not, therefore, hold the will invalid even if they were persuaded that Perera was unable to follow all the provisions of his will when it was read over to him by Gooneratne\u2019s clerk. But they desire to add that they see no reason to doubt or qualify the testimony of the witnesses who agreed in saying that the testator was of sound mind when the will was executed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014The evidence of the solicitor who drew the will in question is, to my mind, conclusive that the testator was, at the time of giving instructions therefor, possessed of testamentary capacity and sufficiently so to give said instructions and to understand the will drawn in accord therewith as read to him, when he assented thereto.\nThe solicitor, although he had become acquainted with him in the course of serving him professionally, knew nothing of his family relations, save and except what he got from himself on that occasion.\nThe will which resulted from the instructions so given by the testator, is what, under all the circumstances in question, including the destruction of a previous will, one might not unreasonably expect.\nIt seems to fit the testator\u2019s peculiar circumstances and purposes in a way that would have been impossible had he been in the sort of comatose state some would seem to be inclined to lead us to believe.\nThe refusal to make his mark on Tuesday, when too feeble to write, shews the man and the mind, in a way to indicate he knew what he was about\u2014and declined to go down as a mere marksman, though too feeble to be quite sure of holding his pen to the end of writing out his signature.\nThe repeated categorical assent (given on the following Friday when the will was executed) to each clause therein indicates that degree of intelligence and understanding on the part of the testator which has been upheld in many cases as sufficient for the mere execution of a will prepared according to instructions given when testamentary capacity had existed as I find herein.\nI therefore think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014Without discrediting and in large part rejecting the testimony of Mr. Anderson, the solicitor who prepared the impeached will, it is, in my opinion, not possible to set it aside. That I am certainly not prepared to do.\nThe testamentary capacity of the testator on the Tuesday, when instructions for the will were given and it was drafted, is in my opinion well established by the evidence considered as a whole. Although Dr. Forrest undoubtedly left himself open to some criticism as a witness, I cannot regard his testimony as entirely undeserving of credit.\nWhile the condition of the testator on the Friday, when the will was executed, is perhaps more questionable, the weight of the evidence, in my opinion, is that he then had the degree of capacity required under such authorities as Parker v. Felgate,[5]; Perera v. Perera[6], and Kaulbach v. Archbold[7].\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Mignault.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014After carefully reading the evidence in this case I am satisfied that the testator, Hugh Faulkner, had sufficient testamentary capacity on the afternoon of Tuesday, January 29th, 1918, after his admission to the hospital, to give instructions for his will. Outside of his brother, the respondent, several independent witnesses saw him on that Tuesday, and state that he was perfectly rational, although severely ill, and with assistance he walked down the stairs and steps of his lodging house, and went to the hospital in a taxi. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Anderson, the solicitor who prepared the will, arrived at the hospital and received the testator\u2019s instructions, and unless Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony is rejected as unreliable, the testator fully understood the nature of the disposition which he was making of his property. The will was written out by Mr. Anderson then and there and read over to the testator, but when the time came to sign it, Hugh Faulkner was in a sleepy or drowsy condition, and after a couple of attempts, Mr. Anderson and the nurse thought they had better wait and have him sign another time. Had he then signed the will, I do not think that on the evidence it could be successfully contended that he did not have sufficient testamentary capacity.\nMr. Anderson was called early on Friday, he says, by the superintendent of the hospital, Miss Walkdem, to have the will signed, and it was then that the testator, his hand being aided by Mr. Anderson, for the disease had blinded him, put his mark to the will before three witnesses, including Dr. Forrest, his medical attendant, for whose arrival Mr. Anderson had very prudently waited before proceeding with the execution of the will. The question then was: Could the testator think thus far\nI gave my solicitor instructions to prepare a will making a certain disposition of my property; I have no doubt that he has given effect to my intention, and I accept the document which is put before me as carrying it out.\n(Per Sir James Hannen in Parker v. Felgate[8], approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Perera v. Perera[9]. In fact this test is more than satisfied because Mr. Anderson states:\u2014\nI said to him \u201cMr. Faulkner, do you know who is speaking? Anderson is speaking.\u201d He said: \u201cYes, oh yes.\u201d \u201cAre you willing to have your will signed this morning?\u201d He said \u201cYes.\u201d Then I said \u201cYou remember the other day you did not sign your will, you would not make your mark?\u201d He said \u201cYes.\u201d I said \u201cAre you willing to make your mark this morning, I am afraid you cannot see.\u201d He said \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cthe will is the same will that I drew the other day, only we will have to change the date of it to this morning.\u201d I think I changed the date right there. Then I read it over to him. I read it clause by clause, and after each clause\u2014Q.\u2014Just a moment. In reading it over to him, what was your judgment as to whether he heard and understood what you were reading? A. He certainly heard and understood, to my mind, what was said.\nMr. Anderson adds that he went back to the clause concerning the appellant, to whom $1.00 only was bequeathed, and asked the testator if he wished to change this legacy, and he answered \u201cNo.\u201d\nAs I have said, it would be necessary to reject Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony to decide that the will was not properly executed by a competent testator.\nI have considered, of course, the nurses\u2019 evidence that Hugh Faulkner, while at the hospital, was unconscious all the time, apparently because they could not get him to speak to them. The expert medical testimony is not sufficiently strong to my mind, characterized as it really is by many qualifications, to discredit the direct evidence of testamentary capacity. The testator, it is clear, was not delirious at any time, he was generally in a state of stupor, from which, however, he could be and evidently was roused, sufficiently, without doubt, to give his instructions for his will on the Tuesday, and on the Friday sufficiently to know that he was executing the will prepared according to these instructions.\nThe Appellate Division under these circumstances reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge, and after reading the evidence, I would not feel justified in disturbing its judgment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Irwin, Hales & Irwin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Anderson & McMaster.\n[1] 46 Ont.

Idington J. contra.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Power to regulate does not imply, generally, power to prohibit (City of Toronto v. Virgo, [1896] A.C. 88); but it necessarily implies power to restrain the doing of that which is contrary to the regulation authorized, and, in that sense and that extent, involves the power to prohibit.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014There is jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain this appeal, as the matter in controversy affects the future rights of the respondent as to the use and employment of his property. Idington J. dubitante. Judgment of the Court of King's Bench, (Q.R. 29 K.B. 124) reversed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting. Appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court[2] and dismissing the appellant's; plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCharles Laurendeau K.C. and Paul Lacoste K.C., for the appellant.\nT. P. Butler K.C. and Geo. H. Montgomery K.C., for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014In this case the appellant by its declaration seeks to have a building valued at $50,000 or over, demolished because someone had in mind the intention to use it when erected as a public garage which it is claimed would be an offence against a by-law of appellant.\nNo other relief is sought by the conclusion of the declaration.\nCounsel for appellant is unable to cite any statutory authority for such a drastic method of enforcing obedience to the requirements of the prohibition of a by-law.\nThe by-law itself contains none but the ordinary money penalty for the breach thereof and imprisonment as an alternative and in case of persistent breaches imprisonment. An argument is attempted to be founded upon articles 1065 and 1066 of the Civil Code and other articles relevant to obligations. I am of the opinion that there is nothing in any one or all of the articles referred to which can be made relevant to what is involved herein, and hence for that sole reason that there is no statutory authority for such a drastic remedy for infringing an alleged by-law, this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe case has been argued in all its aspects at great length and hence in deference thereto I should perhaps express my opinion as to some of the leading contentions set sp.\nThe by-law in question it is alleged is founded upon the powers given the appellant by the general comprehensive sections of its charter to enact by-laws for its good government, and of which section 299 gives the specific powers to be exercised by the way of bylaw. None of the grounds set forth cover that question.\nThen section 300 is relied upon but none of the specific provisions therein seem to touch upon what is involved herein unless it fall within paragraph 44a of section 300 of the Charter, or 55 which read as follows:\u2014\n44a. To regulate the kind of buildings that may be erected on certain streets, parts or sections of streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park to determine at what distance from the line of the streets, public places or parks the houses shall be built, provided that such distance shall not be fixed at more than twenty-five feet from the said line, or to prohibit the construction, occupation and maintenance of factories, workshops, taverns, billiard-rooms, pigeon-hole rooms, livery-stables, butcher's stalls or other shops or similar places of business in the said streets, parts or sections of certain streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park, saving the indemnity, if any, payable to the proprietors, tenants or occupants of the buildings now built or being built or who have building permits, which indemnity shall be determined by three arbitrators; one to be appointed by the city, one by the proprietor, tenant or occupant interested and the third by the two former, and, in default of agreement by a judge of the Superior Court.\n55. To prohibit offensive or unwholesome business or establishments within the city or within one mile of the limits thereof; to prohibit the erection or occupation of any offensive buildings in any place or site where they will damage the neighbouring property, and determine the localities where certain manufactories or occupations may be carried on. The by-law 570 relied upon herein to found the claim for demolition, is as follows, as set forth in the appellant's factum:\u2014\nBesides the Penal Clause, By-law No. 570 contains only the following clause:\u2014\n\"The following streets are reserved Exclusively for residential purposes:\u2014\nDurocher, Hutchison, Mance, St. Famille and St. Urbain Streets, between Sherbrooke Street and Pine Avenue.\"\nI can find nothing in this to prohibit such an erection as in question. And I can find no reason founded thereon for the demolition of a building which, admittedly, as to part of it fronting on Mance Street, might be converted into and used as an apartment house.\nAnd as to the major part of it, fronting on another than any of those streets named, by no stretch of imagination can those parts be defined as within the area defined in the by-law.\nIt is to be observed that this action is not to prohibit the use of the said building or any part of it as a public garage, but solely because it may be adaptable therefor, or any other like purpose, that the desire to demolish it is sought to be gratified.\nThe attempt founded upon such powers as given to remove factories or workshops from residential districts or prohibit their operation therein must, if ever, be dealt with in a much more specific manner than is done by this by-law.\nI need not follow the curious question of a licence having been given expressly to build a public garage and work done on faith thereof, and a lease therefor made of the premises a month before the appellant's authorities changed their minds and attempted to object thereto, and prevent the building being completed. I see no ground upon which such an action can be founded and enforced resting upon no other right than said by-law; and that itself founded only on such legislative provisions as presented above.\nI incline to the opinion that the appeal taken by appellant is not within our jurisdiction but the case hawing been, subject thereto, fully argued out, I need not form a definite opinion thereon which might be found more difficult to dispose of than the want of legal merits in the appeal itself.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of this case are fully stated in the judgments rendered in the Superior Court[3] and in the Court of King's Bench[4] and in the opinion to be delivered by my brother Mignault, which I have had the advantage of reading.\nI concur in the disposition made by my learned brother of the motion to quash this appeal.\nMuch was made in argument of alleged permits to construct the public garage in question granted to the respondent by civic officials. I agree with Mr. Justice Carroll when he says:\u2014\nAucune autorit\u00e9 ne pouvait lui conf\u00e9rer le droit de construire en violation des prescriptions de la loi, et aucune autorit\u00e9 municipale ne pouvait acquiescer \u00e0 pareille ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Les actes des officiers municipaux ne sont valides que s'ils sont conformes \u00e0 la loi.\nSee Yabbicom v. The King[5]. It may be said that if the respondent is obliged to demolish his building or sustain loss in converting it into a structure to be made use of for some less profitable purpose he will have a legal right to recover damages from the municipal corporation owing to the conduct of its officials and representatives. On that point I express no opinion. But any equitable considerations which he can invoke arising out of what occurred in regard to the granting of the building permits, approval of plans, etc., are more than offset by his acquiescence in the demand of the city that he should change the character of the building in Jeanne Mance St. so as to make it conform to by-law No. 570, his taking out of a permit to complete it as an apartment house and his undertaking that, if not fined in the Recorder's Court (where a prosecution was instituted and carried to conviction) for a breach of by-law No. 570, he would complete the building in accordance with the permit so obtained. I am quite unable to assent to the view of Mr. Justice Martin that the equities of this case are all against the appellant. If not equally balanced, they seem to me rather to preponderate in its favour.\nBut the question we have to decide cannot be disposed of on equitable grounds. We have to determine whether by-law No. 570 of the City of Montreal is valid and effective to prevent the erection and maintenance of a public garage on Jeanne Mance Street just above Sherbrooke Street. I respectfully adopt the following passage from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Quebec.\nJe d\u00e9sire \u00e9carter imm\u00e9diatement du d\u00e9bat la consid\u00e9ration du montant des dommages que l'appelant pourra souffrir par cette d\u00e9molition, ainsi que le montant des dommages que les propri\u00e9taires voisins pourraient souffrir par suite du maintien du garage\u2014si ce n'est pour souligner l'importance de la cause. Ce point de vue fait appel \u00e0 des sentiments auxquels les juges doivent fermer leur coeur. La cour est en face d'une question de loi\u2014et non d'une question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Si le r\u00e8glement civique N\u00b0. 570 a force de loi, si ce r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, il nous faut le dire sans regarder aux consequences.\nI also agree with that learned judge that the objections founded on Jeanne Mance Street being called \"Mance Street\" in the by-law, and on the fact that the frontage of lot 43, of which lot 43-1 (on which the building in question is erected) is a subdivision, is on Sherbrooke street, lack substance. There is no room for any doubt that Jeanne Mance Street is the street intended to be designated in the by-law and the respondent's garage as constructed in fact fronts on that street.\nThe only questions of real importance to be determined are: (a) whether by-law No. 570 is authorized by the charter of the city of Montreal; (b) whether that by-law is sufficiently clear, precise and definite; and (c) to what consequences a breach of it will subject the respondent.\nParagraph 44 of article 300 of the city charter, set out in the judgment of my brother Mignault, empowers the municipal corporation to regulate the height, construction and materials of all buildings and their architecture, dimensions, symmetry, etc. Paragraph 44 (a)\u2014an amendment of 1 Geo. V. (2 Sess. c. 60)\u2014confers power to pass by-laws\nto regulate the kind of buildings that may be erected on certain streets, parts or sections of streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park; to determine at what distance from the line of the streets, public places or parks the houses shall be built, provided that such distance shall not be fixed at more than twenty-five feet from the said line, or to prohibit the construction, occupation and maintenance of factories, workshops, taverns, billiard-rooms, pigeonhole rooms, livery-stables, butcher's stalls or other shops or similar places of business in the said streets, parts or sections of certain streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park, saving the indem- nity, if any, payable to the proprietors, tenants or occupants of the buildings now built or being built or who have building permits, which indemnity shall be determined by three arbitrators: one to be appointed by the City, one by the proprietor, tenant or occupant interested and the third by the two former, and, in default of agreement, by a judge of the Superior Court.\nIn view of the specific provisions of the charter, I incline to think that any general power to pass bylaws for the good government, etc., of the city conferred by Arts. 299, 300, and 300 (c), cannot be invoked to sustain by-law No. 570, although the article last cited\u2014an amendment of 3 Geo. V. (c. 54)\u2014may, as my brother Mignault suggests, furnish a strong argument against giving a restrictive effect to any of the provisions of the specific clauses\u2014inter alia, of paragraph 44 (a) of art. 300.\nNo other authority than City of Toronto v. Virgo[6] need be cited for the general proposition that power to regulate does not imply power to prohibit. Thus, under the first clause of Art. 44 (a) the city could not entirely prohibit the erection of any buildings whatsoever on any named street nor could it entirely prohibit the erection within the city limits of any particular kind of building, in the sense in which that phrase is used in paragraph 44 (a). But every power to regulate necessarily implies power to restrain the doing of that which is contrary to the regulation authorized, and in that sense and to that extent involves the power to prohibit. As Rousset says in his work \"Science Nouvelle Des Lois,\" T\u00f4me I, at p. 224:\nRestreindre le champ de la libert\u00e9 naturelle, lui interdire certains actes d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, c'est en cela et en cela seulement que consiste le pouvoir r\u00e9gulateur de l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative sur l'exercice des droits individuels des citoyens.\u2014A ce point de vue la loi ne peut \u00eatre qu'une prohibition d'action. La formule de sa r\u00e9daction sera donc n\u00e9cessairement prohibitive.\u2014C'est ce qu'il s'agissait de constater. Compare Kruse v. Johnston[7]. The word \"exclusively\" in by-law 570, expresses the prohibition of the erection of buildings not suitable for a residential street. Effective regulation of the kind of buildings that may be erected on certain streets necessarily involves the right to authorize the erection of buildings of some descriptions and to prohibit the erection of those of other descriptions on such streets.\nThe legislature in passing art. 44 (a) certainly did not intend senselessly to repeat the enactment of paragraph 44. It had in that paragraph dealt exhaustively with such matters as materials, height, dimensions, architecture, symmetry and stability. By the phrase \"kind of buildings\" in art. 44 (a) must therefore be meant something quite different. As the context shews it is with the destination of the building\u2014the use for which it is designed\u2014that that paragraph deals\u2014the kind of building, i.e., industrial, commercial, residential, educational, religious. Of that I cannot conceive any reasonable doubt.\nThe first clause of paragraph 44 (a) in my opinion, taken by itself, is quite broad enough to empower the municipal corporation to prescribe that in certain streets no buildings other than residences (i.e. private dwelling houses) shall be built, or to enact that from certain streets commercial and industrial buildings shall be excluded. Does anything in the rest of the paragraph require that the ex facie generality of the power so conferred should be restricted? The clause immediately following, which deals with the distance of houses from street lines, certainly does not. But it is said that the next succeeding clause or to prohibit the construction, occupation and maintenance of factories, workshops, taverns, billiard-rooms, pigeon-hole rooms, livery-stables, butcher's stalls or other shops or similar places of business in the said streets, parts or sections of certain streets or oh any land fronting on any public place or park\u2014\nclearly indicates that any power of prohibition involved in the right to regulate conferred by the first clause of the ordinance must be restricted to the particular classes of buildings enumerated in such later clause-factories, workshops, etc.\u2014or, if not, that the presence of this express provision for prohibition precludes the implication of any power to prohibit being involved in the right of regulation first conferred, because if such a power to prohibit exists under the first clause, the later clause, \"or to prohibit, etc.,\" is unnecessary and useless. This argument of course assumes that the subject matter of the two clauses is the same.\nOn an analysis of the paragraph the force of these contentions disappears. In the first place the separation of the clause \"to regulate, etc,\" from the clause \"to prohibit, etc.,\" by the intervening clause dealing with the distances of houses from street lines, in itself goes far to negative the idea that the latter could have been intended as a particularization of the subjects to which any prohibitive power conferred by the former should be restricted. But the two clauses really deal with different subject matters. The earlier clause has to do only with the erection of buildings; the latter with the construction, maintenance, and operation of a number of things, some of which (e.g. billiard-rooms and butcher stalls) may occupy a comparatively small part of a building. Original erection of buildings is dealt with by the first clause. Reconstruction and occupation of existing buildings come under the second. In regard to new buildings the legislature has seen fit to confer an unlimited power of regulation. The municipal corporation is given complete discretion as to the kind of new buildings which it will allow to be erected on streets designated by it. But in the case of existing buildings only certain uses of them may be prohibited; and here the power is properly extended to prohibition of occupation and maintenance as well as construction.\nThe use of the word \"construction\" in the later clause at first presented some difficulty; but it is properly used in connection with such things as butcher stalls and pigeon-hole rooms in the fitting up of which work of construction is necessary; and in other cases it may well be taken to mean reconstruction or alteration. I find nothing in the subsequent clauses of paragraph 44 (a) which can properly be invoked to restrict the generality of the power conferred by its opening clause.\nThe concluding provision for indemnity in paragraph 44 (a) obviously refers to cases in which the operation of the by-law would interfere with the use made of structures already built, or to be made of structures in course of erection, or for which permits had issued at the date of its passing. There is nothing to shew that any such cases exist in regard to the streets named in the by-law. Moreover, the statute itself preserves or confers the right to indemnity in such cases and an express provision for it in the by-law would scarcely seem to be required.\nSection 1 of by-law No. 570 reads as follows:\u2014\nSection 1.\u2014The following streets are reserved exclusively for residential purposes:\u2014\nDurocher, Hutchison, Mance, St. Famille and St. Urbain Streets, between Sherbrooke and Pine Avenue. It seems to have been practically common ground in the courts below, as it was at bar in this court, that the erection of any building other than a dwelling house fronting on any of the streets named in the by-law would contravene it. I am far from being satisfied, however, that this construction of the words \"for residential purposes\" is not too narrow. I rather incline to the view that \"residential\" is used in contradistinction to \"business and industrial\" and that such buildings as churches and schools would not necessarily be excluded\u2014that buildings not of a business or industrial character, such as are ordinarily found in exclusively residential districts, are not prohibited.\nWright v. Berry[8].\nNor does this imply such vagueness or indefiniteness in the by-law as would render it invalid.\nI fully recognize the force of the general rules that the language of by-laws should be explicit and free from ambiguity, and that by-laws in restraint of rights of property as well as penal by-laws should be strictly construed. But the very statement of the latter rule implies that a by-law is not necessarily invalid because its terms call for construction\u2014as does also another well recognized rule, viz., that a by-law of a public representative body clothed with ample authority should be \"benevolently\" interpreted and supported if possible. Kruse v. Johnston[9] It may be a counsel of perfection that in drafting by-laws the use of words susceptible of more than one interpretation should be avoided; but it is too much to exact of municipal councils that such a degree of certainty should always be attained. It would be going quite too far to say that merely because a term used in a by-law may be susceptible of more than one interpretation the by-law is necessarily bad for uncertainty.\nAs Lord Alverstone said in Leyton Urban Council v. Chew[10]\nI quite agree that a man ought to know what he is required to do, but the answer is that the by-law gives him sufficient information.\nException had been there taken to the presence in a construction by-law of the words\nor otherwise in a suitable manner and with suitable materials.\nSee too Dunning v. Maker[11].\nDuring the course of the argument I directed attention to s. s. 10 of s. 406 of the Ontario Municipal Act, which empowers councils of cities and towns to pass by-laws\nfor declaring any highway or part of a highway to be a residential street,\nand I put to counsel the question: \"Could a by-law passed by the council of an Ontario town in these terms\u2014'B Street is hereby declared to be a residential street'\u2014be successfully attacked as too vague and indefinite to be enforced?\" In the application of such a by-law it would of course be necessary to determine just what class of buildings should be permitted in a residential street. But I cannot think that the by-law should therefore be held invalid. That business and industrial establishments are excluded by by-law No. 570 there would seem to be no room for reasonable doubt. Nor can there be any question that a public garage is a business establishment, if indeed it is not industrial as well. I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that by-law No. 570 is valid and effectual, as a regulation passed under the first clause of paragraph 44 (a) of Art. 300 of the charter of the City of Montreal, to prohibit the erection on the part of Jeanne Mance Street here in question of a public garage.\nTo what consequences has the defendant's contravention of by-law No. 570 subjected him? He argues that he is merely liable to the penalty which the by-law provides and that the plaintiffs have no other means of enforcing it. But a person prepared to do so cannot thus purchase the right to disobey the law. The public interest forbids that the enforcement of the penalty should be the sole remedy for the breach of such a by-law and requires that the regulation itself should be made effective. The general rule of construction that where a law creates a new obligation and enforces its performance in a specific manner, that performance cannot be enforced in any other manner (Doe d. Murray v. Bridges[12] is of course well established. But that rule is more uniformly applicable to statutes creating private rights than to those imposing public obligations. Atkinson v. Newcastle Waterworks Co.[13]. Moreover whether the general rule is to prevail or an exception to it should be admitted must depend on the scope and language of the act which creates the obligation. Pasmore v. Oswaldtwistle Urban District Council[14] per Lord Macnaghten. The provisions and object of the Act must be looked at. Vallance v. Falle[15]; Brain v. Thomas[16]. Here the object and scope of by-law No. 570 make it clear, in my opinion, that the recovery of the penalties prescribed was not meant to be the sole remedy available for its enforcement. A breach of the obligation which it imposes falls within the purview of Art. 1066 C.C., as my brother Mignault points out.\nI entirely agree however that the demolition of a costly building should be ordered only as a last resort, and if the owner persists in defying the law, and I concur in the allowance of a further period of six months to permit of compliance by the defendant with the by-law.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored subject to the modification that if within six months the defendant converts the building on lot 43-1 into something permissible under by-law No. 570, the order for its demolition shall not be enforced.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Je suis d'opinion que la motion pour casser l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e et que l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel et que le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli. Je partage l'opinion de mon coll\u00e9gue, le juge Mignault.\nMignault J.\u2014At the hearing the respondent moved to quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction. In my opinion this motion cannot be granted for the simple reason that the matter in controversy affects the future rights of the respondent as to the use and enjoyment of his property. Mr. Montgomery urged that the interest of the appellant alone was to be considered, but here the appellant seeks to have the respondent's building demolished and therefore the matter in controversy relates to a title to lands, to wit the right of the respondent to build on his property, as he has done, and the right of the appellant to demand the demolition of the building so erected. If the appellant is right, the respondent's title and right of use of his land is materially restricted. The motion should be dismissed with costs.\nOn the merits, the main question is whether the appellant had the right to pass by-law No. 570, and, if this right exists, whether the by-law prohibits the erection of a public garage on Mance Street, so that the appellant would be justified in asking for the demolition of the public garage erected by the respondent.\nBy-law No. 570, passed in 1915, enacts as follows:\u2014\nSection 1.\u2014The following streets are reserved exclusively for residential purposes:\nDurocher, Hutchison, Mance, St. Famille and St. Urbain Streets, between Sherbrooke and Pine Avenue.\nSection 2.\u2014Every person offending against the above provision shall be liable to a fine, with or without costs, and in default of immediate payment of said fine, with or without costs, as the case may be, to an imprisonment, the amount of said fine and the term of imprisonment to be fixed by the Recorder's Court of the City of Montreal, at its discretion, but such fine shall not exceed forty dollars, and the imprisonment shall not be for a longer period than two calendar months, the said imprisonment, however, to cease at any time before the expiration of the term fixed by the said Recorder's Court upon payment of the said fine, or fine and costs, as the case may be, and if the infringement of this by-law continues, the offender shall be liable to the fine and penalty provided by this by-law for each day during which the infringement is continued.\nThe first question is whether this by-law was authorized by the appellant's charter, 62 Vict. (Que.) ch. 58, and amendments.\nThe appellant cites several of the provisions of this charter to which I will briefly refer. Section 299 of the charter gives the city council the right to pass by-laws for the peace, order, good government and general welfare of the city, and for all matters and things whatsoever that concern and affect the city as a city and body politic and corporate, provided always that such by-laws be not repugnant to the laws of the Province of Quebec or of Canada. And the section adds\nfor greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the scope of the foregoing provision, or of any power otherwise conferred by the charter,\na list of eighteen subjects, none of which cover the matter now under consideration.\nSubsection 44 of section 300 of the charter gives the city council the power\nto regulate the height, construction and materials of all buildings * * * to regulate the architecture, dimensions and symmetry of buildings in certain streets * * * to prohibit the construction of buildings and structures not conforming to such regulations, and to direct the suspension, at any time, of the erection of any such building as does not conform to such regulations, and to cause the demolition of any building not conforming to such regulations, if necessary.\nSubsection 44a of the same section, as amended, gives the council the power\nto regulate the kind of buildings that may be erected on certain streets, parts or sections of streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park; to determine at what distance from the line of the streets, public places or parks the houses shall be built, * * * or to prohibit the construction, occupation and maintenance of factories, workshops, taverns, billiard-rooms, pigeon-hole rooms, livery stables, butcher's stalls or other shops or similar places of business in the said streets, parks, or sections of certain streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park * * *\nSubsection 55 of section 300 also enacts that the council shall have the power\nto prohibit offensive or unwholesome businesses or establishments within the city or within one mile of the limits thereof; to prohibit the erection or occupation of any offensive buildings in any place or site where they will damage the neighbouring property, and determine the localities where certain manufactories or occupations may be carried on. Section 300 c. added by 3 Geo. V., ch. 54, section 9, provides as follows:\u2014\n300 c. In order to give full effect to articles 299 and 300 and to extend and complete the same, so as to secure full autonomy for the city and to avoid any interpretation of such articles and their paragraphs which might be considered as a restriction of its powers, the city is authorized to adopt, repeal or amend and carry out all necessary by-laws concerning the proper administration of its affairs, peace, order and safety as well as all matters which may concern or affect public interest and the welfare of the citizens; provided always that such by-laws be not inconsistent with the laws of Canada or of this Province, nor contrary to any special provision of this charter.\nI think the statutory provisions which I have cited\u2014and they are the only ones on which the appellant relies\u2014must be read together. Section 300 gives to the city specific powers enumerated in considerably more than a hundred subsections. Paragraph one of section 299 and section 300c are of the same class of enactments, and, standing by themselves, would probably not allow the city to prevent the construction by the respondent of a building for commercial purposes on his own property, (City of Toronto v. Virgo)[17], although section 300c. shews that it was not intended that sections 299 and 300 should be restrictively construed. Of course the general powers given to the city are not to be repugnant to or inconsistent with the laws of Canada or of the province, and therefore the respondent may, not unreasonably, contend that his right to make full use of his title of ownership under articles 406 and 407 of the Civil Code ought not to be regarded as taken away or restricted by these mere general enactments. But while this is no doubt true, the question still remains whether the respondent's right to make any use he desires of his property is not restricted\u2014and the legislature could undoubtedly restrict it\u2014 by the specific enactments of section 300 of the charter, I will therefore endeavour to answer this question by considering subsections 44, 44a and 55 of section 300.\nSubsection 44 speaks about regulating the height, construction and materials of all buildings as well as the architecture, dimensions and symmetry of buildings in certain streets, and the city is authorized to prohibit the construction of buildings not conforming to such regulations and to cause their demolition if necessary\u201e In my opinion this subsection does not help the appellant.\nSubsection 55 concerns the prohibition of \"offensive or unwholesome\" businesses, establishments or buildings which the city is empowered to prohibit \"within the city or within one mile of the limits thereof.\" It surely cannot be contended that this subsection would apply to a commercial building or a public garage on a street like Mance Street, for if it does the appellant could prevent the erection of public garages or commercial buildings anywhere within the city or within a further radius of one mile. And as to the power to determine the localities where certain manufactories or occupations may be carried on, it seems sufficient to say that By-law No. 570 does not profess to do anything of the kind. The appellant in his factum cites by-law No. 551, which prohibits the erection on either side of Sherbrooke Street between St. Denis and City Councillors Streets, of any public garage, but the by-law here under consideration goes much further and purports to reserve a part of Mance and other streets for residential purposes exclusively.\nThere remains only subsection 44a which allows the city to regulate the \"kind of buildings\" (in the French text \"le genre des constructions\") that may be erected on certain streets, parts or sections of streets or on any land fronting on a public place or park. It was suggested that by \"kind of buildings\" is meant the regulation of the mode of construction, architecture, materials, dimensions, height, etc. But that matter is already dealt with in subsection 44, which exhausts the subject in so far as the mode of construction, materials, and the architectural properties of buildings are concerned, so the \"kind of buildings\" referred to in subsection 44a, which was added to the charter by a subsequent amendment, must be the kind, either residential, commercial or industrial, of buildings which may be erected in certain locations. The description of these localities as being certain streets or parts or sections of streets or land fronting on any public place or park would indicate that it was intended to preserve to certain locations a more select or refined character, which, it is urged, is eminently desirable in a large modern city. The evidence shews that Mance Street, above Sherbrooke Street, was an exclusively residential street before the construction of the respondent's garage, and that after the opening of this garage, the neighbours were awakened at all hours of the night by the tooting of motor cars for admission to the garage, which of course was a decided nuisance to the immediate vicinity. The evidence is also that there is a repair shop in connection with this garage, and this would well come within the description of a \"workshop\" which is among the buildings or establishments which subsection 44a permits the city to prohibit in certain streets, parts or sections of streets or land fronting on any public place or park.\nI have not lost sight of the possible suggestion that the words \"the kind of buildings\" should be restricted to the kind enumerated below, to wit, factories, workshops, etc. It may also be said that the word \"construction\" in connection with the enumeration would be useless if the regulation of the \"kind of buildings\" that may be erected applies to all buildings that could be constructed in the localities indicated. I think however that the two clauses are severable and bear on different subjects. In the first the question is of the kind of new buildings that may be erected, in the second of the fitting up of existing buildings for the enumerated purposes, and in the latter case I understand the word \"construction\" in the sense of \"alteration\" or \"fitting up\" for a certain purpose. There obviously can be no \"construction\" of billiard-rooms, pigeon-hole rooms or butcher stalls, in the same sense as the \"construction\" of a new building. I consequently think that the introductory clause of subsection 44a is not cut down by the enumeration, from which moreover it is separated by an independent provision.\nI would therefore conclude that under subsection 44a the appellant could prevent the construction of any buildings other than residential ones on the part of Mance Street mentioned in the by-law, and this would exclude the public garage which the respondent claims to have the right to build there.\nWe now have to consider the terms of By-law 570.\nThe vital enactment of this by-law is contained in the words:\u2014\nThe following streets are reserved exclusively for residentia purposes:\nDurocher, Hutchison, Mance, St. Famille and St. Urbain streets, between Sherbrooke Street and Pine Avenue.\nIt is contended that this enactment is too vague to have any meaning. I cannot agree with this contention. The reservation of these streets exclusively for residential purposes means that no buildings other than what can properly be considered as residential ones may be erected on them. It is said that this would exclude buildings such as churches or schools. It is unnecessary to express any opinion on this point, for it is obvious that the respondent's public garage is not a residential building. And I may add, merely as an apt illustration, that the Municipal Act of Ontario (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 192, section 406, subsection 10), empowers cities and towns to pass by-laws for declaring any highway or part of a highway \"to be a residential street,\" and this language would certainly prevent the erection, on a street declared residential, of a public garage such as that of the respondent.\nI am therefore of opinion that By-law 570 is sufficiently supported by subsection 44a and that it suffices to render the respondent's public garage an unlawful one.\nIt is said that the by-law provides a penalty and that this penalty only, and not the demolition of the building, can be claimed. There are no doubt cases where this argument has successfully been made, but I do not think that here the imposition of a penalty deprives the appellant of any other remedy to prevent the erection of a building in violation of the by-law; on the contrary, Art. 1066 of the Civil Code clearly allows the demand for the demolition or undoing of anything done in breach of an obligation. The facts here are that as soon as it was discovered that the respondent intended to build a public garage fronting on Mance Street, the appellant notified him to desist and he then promised to convert his building into an apartment house, and actually asked for, and obtained, a building permit for this purpose, and wrote to the appellant that he had not proceeded with the work on the Mance Street end of the building except in accordance with the new plans and permit. The respondent subsequently decided to complete the building as a public garage, but he did so at his own risk, and his pretext that his tenant refused to consent to its being converted into an apartment house, is certainly no excuse for the violation of the by-law.\nIt is said that the appellant authorized by the building permits which it gave to the respondent the construction of a public garage on Mance Street. The building permits do not bear this construction, for they are limited to the construction of a public garage on lot 67, which is not on Mance Street, and do not allow the construction of a public garage fronting on Mance Street and situate on the rear part (looking from Sherbrooke Street) of lot 43-1 which abuts both on Sherbrooke and Mance Streets.\nObjection is also made to the name of \"Mance Street\" in the by-law, the real name being \"Jeanne Mance Street.\" But there is no doubt as to the identity of the street meant to be dealt with, and the objection cannot be entertained.\nI think therefore that the appellant is entitled to succeed, but I would allow the respondent six months to change the destination of his building so as to conform with the by-law, and on his failure to do so I would grant the prayer of the appellant for the demolition.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laurendeau, Archambault, Damphousse, Jarry, Butler & St.-Pierre.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

A manufacturing company, under a conditional sale agreement, sold in 1913 certain machinery, and in 1915 the purchaser gave to F. as security for an advance of money a \"first mortgage debenture\" thereon which was declared to be \"a specific charge\" as regards the \"fixed assets\" of the purchaser but was never registered.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] affirming the judgment of Ives J. at the trial (1) and maintaining the respondent's, plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. for the appellant.\nH. P. O. Savary K.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The issue in this appeal was an interpleader one to determine the priority of the parties' rights to certain property of the Press Publishing Company, Limited under the respective securities of the litigants.\nI am of the opinion that the decision of the trial judge, Mr. Justice Ives, was correct, namely, that the failure of the defendant appellant to renew the registration of its lien agreement on the 3rd day of October, 1917, when the previous registration expired, had the effect of losing the priority of the defendant's lien agreement over the plaintiff's debenture.\nThis judgment was unanimously concurred in by the Appellate Division.\nThe appeal, therefore should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014If, as I submit we must, we strictly observe the terms of the interpleader issue herein and read it in light of the facts leading up to its framing and apply the relevant law, the question raised by this appeal is in a very narrow compass. The appellant, under a conditional sale agreement, agreed to sell for $2,150 in 1913 to the Press Publishing Company, Limited, some printing machines and delivered same to the latter.\nThe said Press Publishing Company in 1915, gave to the respondents as security for an advance of $6,763.47, a first mortgage debenture, the validity of which as such is not impeached.\nThe Press Publishing Company, Limited, became insolvent and its property was seized by the sheriff under executions of other creditors than parties hereto and the landlord had later placed in his hands a warrant to distrain for rent. Thereupon an order was made for its winding up.\nIn the course of proceedings thereunder it was decided by the creditors and others concerned, and affirmed by an order of the Master at Calgary, to transfer to the respondents as holders of said debentures, all the assets, undertaking and business of said company, free from all liabilities of the company subject only to such hens or charges as might exist therein for taxes\nor under chattel mortgages or lien notes or agreements or claims for rent entitled to priority over the said debenture but reserving to the said Edward H. McArthur and the said James C. Foster, Jr., all rights which they might have, notwithstanding this order, to resist or contest any claim of mortgage or lien upon the said assets, be and the same is hereby approved.\nThe Order of the Master proceeded further thus:\u2014\nAnd it is further ordered that the Liquidator be and it is hereby authorized and empowered to carry out and complete such settlement and to sell and transfer unto the said Edward H. McArthur and James C. Foster, Jr. all of the assets, undertaking and business of the said Company, subject to such mortgages and liens as may appear to be a charge thereon in priority to the charge created by the Debenture held by them, and that the acceptance of such transfer shall not prejudice or affect any rights which the said Edward H. McArthur and the said James C. Foster, Jr. have, or, but for the making of this Order and the transfer hereunder, might have had to resist or contest any such mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance, and they shall take and hold said assets, undertaking and business subject only to such mortgages, liens, charges and encumbrances as are or were prior to the making of this order, entitled to priority over the charge created by their said debenture, but reserving unto the Intertype Corporation only the right to contest the validity of the debenture held by the said Edward H. McArthur and James C. Foster, Jr., and to take such action or proceedings at its own expense and for its own benefit only as it may see fit, to set aside the same for the purpose only of recovering the amount owing by the Company to the said Intertype Corporation.\nF. Clarry,\nM.C.\nThe issue arising out of the foregoing is as follows:\u2014\nWhereas the above named James C. Foster, Junior, and Edward H. McArthur affirm, and the above named International Typesetting Machine Company and J. V. Drumheller deny, that certain goods and chattels formerly in the possession of The Press Publishing Company, Limited, seized by the Sheriff of the Judicial District of Calgary under Warrant of Distress from W. R. Hull, are the property of the plaintiffs, or that the plaintiffs have the right to possession thereof, as against the defendants, or either of them; and it has been ordered by order of the Master dated the 14th day of January, A.D. 1919, that the said question shall be tried by a Judge without a Jury at Calgary at a date to be fixed by the Clerk of the Court.\nThe appellant by its solicitors then gave a written admission of facts for the purposes of this \"action,\" admitting respondents' advance; that it was made on the express condition that a debenture would be issued to respondents to secure its repayment; and further in detail admitted all the legal requirements to constitute, in my opinion, the validity of the debenture, and admit non-payment of the money; and that respondents are the holders of the debenture and had made demand for payment, and that yet it remains unpaid.\nThere was no reservation of any kind in the appellant's favour in the admission.\nThe appellant was not at the time of its making the agreement of sale with the Press Publishing Company in law bound to renew its registration of such lien agreement as it had, but long before the seizure by the sheriff the law was changed by an amendment of the statute of Alberta, 1916, chapter 3, section 8, which provided that unless registration is renewed\nany such agreement, proviso or condition as is mentioned in Section 1 of this Act, shall cease to have effect and the property or right of possession therein mentioned shall be deemed to have passed to the purchaser.\nThe appellant made default in complying with the law by failing to renew on 3rd Oct. 1918.\nAs a result thereof I am of the opinion that its title and right of possession passed to and became vested in The Press Publishing Company, Limited, which was the purchaser.\nThe moment that occurred, the respondent's claim as against the Press Company became ipso facto operative upon that which had so passed and remained so throughout.\nWhether other creditors might, in turn, have sought successfully to have impeached that result, by reason of any failure on the part of the respondents to register, in any of the ways which the \"Companies Act\" or \"The Bills of Sale Ordinance\" require, is not open on this issue. It might conceivably be open to argument on behalf of such creditors in a proper case. That does not concern us, for all such matters are precluded by the proceedings I have so fully recited leading up to the order transferring the property then in liquidation to the respondents.\nAnd the form of the issue founded thereon, together with the all comprehensive admission of appellant, leaves no room for other creditors or even the appellant itself to start a new issue. As this way of looking at the case seems to me quite impregnable, I need not pursue the matter further.\nI may, however, say that if I could find any flaw in the process of reasoning I adopt, and had to consider the matter from the point of view taken by the court below, I could not see my way to reverse, though I do see in that way of looking at the case a rather wider field for argument not touched upon before us, which rests upon the peculiar provision in \"The Bills of Sale Ordinance\" contemplating evidently a renewal of debenture mortgages, and again the registration of them being provided in another place.\nI confess I have not followed up these respective provisions to see whether in force or not and concurrently so.\nBut if they are, I may be permitted to say, the sooner the confusion they may create is removed by legislation the better.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The debenture of the 5th April, 1915, charges the \"fixed assets\" of the company and the charge upon these assets is declared to be a \"specific charge.\" As regards the \"fixed assets,\" therefore, I have no hesitation in holding that the debenture is a mortgage within \"The Bills of Sale Ordinance,\" and, not having been registered, it is, under the authority of the Dearborn Case[2], void as against creditors.\nBy the order of the 27th of December, 1918, the right was reserved to the appellant company alone to contest the validity of the debenture as against the appellant company and the issue directed to be tried is in the following terms: Whereas the above named James C. Foster, Junior, and Edward H. McArthur affirm, and the above named International Typesetting Machine Company and J. V. Drumheller deny, that certain goods and chattels formerly in the possession of the Press Publishing Company, Limited, seized by the sheriff of the Judicial District of Calgary under Warrant of Distress from W. R. Hull, are the property of the plaintiffs, or that the plaintiffs have the right to possession thereof, as against the defendants, or either of them.\nThe right of the appellant company to contest the validity of the debenture as against the respondents is not open to dispute and the claim of the respondents as affirmants in the issue must, therefore, fail.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. I concur with my borther Idington.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant, in October, 1913, had sold to The Press Publishing Co., Limited, a machine described as \"one model A Intertype,\" for $2,150, the price being payable by instalments, and the title to the property remaining in the appellant until full payment of the purchase price, which however was never fully paid. The agreement was registered as required by the \"Ordinance respecting Hire Receipts and Conditional Sales of Goods\" (ch. 44 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories). In 1916 an amendment was adopted requiring the filing of an annual renewal statement, and the appellant failed to file this renewal statement as it should have done on the 3rd October, 1918, the effect of this failure being, in the words of the statute, that the agreement\nshall cease to have effect, and the property or right of possession therein mentioned shall be deemed to have passed to the purchaser or bailee.\nOn that date however, 3rd October, 1918, the appellant's solicitors sent a distress warrant to the sheriff with instructions to seize the machine, and on the following day the sheriff answered that the goods were under seizure under a landlord's warrant, so that it would not be necessary to seize under the appellant's warrant, but that he (the sheriff) had placed the warrant on file and would protect the legal amount of the appellant's claim in the event of sale.\nWhile the appellant's title to the machine in question was fully protected by registration, the respondents obtained from the Press Publishing Company, Limited, a first mortgage debenture for an advance of $6,763.47, carrying interest at seven per cent and dated the 5th April, 1915. This debenture contained the following clauses:\u2014\n3. The company hereby charges with such payments its undertaking and all its property whatsoever and wheresoever, both present and future and such charge under this debenture as regards the company's fixed assets and good-will is to be a specific charge, and as regards the company's other assets is to be a floating security, but so that the company is not to be at liberty to create any mortgage or charge on its property ranking in priority to or pari passu with this debenture.\n4. The company may at any time, without notice, pay off this debenture.\n5. The principal moneys hereby secured shall immediately become payable if an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding up of the company.\nThe respondent's debenture was never registered in the Registration Office under \"The Bills of Sales Ordinance,\" nor was it registered with the registrar of joint stock companies.\nBy \"The Bills of Sales Ordinance\" chapter 43 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, section 6):\nEvery mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and actual and continued possession of the things mortgaged, shall within thirty days from the execution thereof be registered * * * and section 11 provides that a mortgage not registered\nshall be absolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nIn Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company v. Dearborn[3] this court held that the word \"creditors\" as used in section 17 of this ordinance\u2014and the opinions of the judges shew that the meaning of this word in sections 11 and 17 was considered for purposes of construction\u2014means all creditors of the mortgagor, and not merely execution creditors. It would therefore appear that even if the appellant is not an execution creditor, its status as a contract creditor of the Press Publishing Co., Limited, would entitle it to treat the mortgage debenture of the respondents, if subject to registration, as being absolutely null and void.\nThe respondents, however, contend that their debenture was not subject to registration. The learned trial judge, whose judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division of Alberta, accepted this contention. He said:\u2014\nClearly the security is not a mortgage but a charge and does not come within the provisions of \"The Bills of Sales Ordinance\" according to the cases, Johnston v. Wade[4], and the cases there cited.\nI cannot, with respect, agree with this construction of the debenture or of the ordinance. The debenture expressly states that it is to be a specific charge as regards the company's fixed assets and good-will. If such a charge is not of the nature of a mortgage I cannot see how it could affect the company's fixed assets, and if it is a mortgage, it is null and void for want of registration as regards the company's creditors, and the appellant is undoubtedly a creditor of the company. In Johnston v. Wade[5], the bond contained the following conditions:\u2014\nThe company hereby charges with such payments its undertaking and all its property real and personal, rights, powers and assets of every kind and description, present and future, including its uncalled capital.\nIn the present case, as I have said, the bond expressly provides that the charge under the debenture\nas regards the company's fixed assets and good-will is to be a specific charge, and as regards the company's other assets it is to be a floating security.\nThis sufficiently distinguishes this case from Johnston v. Wade(1), and also from several English decisions relied on by the respondents, where the effect of a floating charge was considered, for here, as to the fixed assets of the company, the debenture was made a specific and not a floating charge.\nOn this view of the case it does not appear necessary to consider whether the appellant has or has not a hen on the machine it sold to the Press Publishing Company, Limited. It is, however, contended that by the amendment of 1916 it is provided that if the required renewal statement is not filed the conditional sale agreement\nshall cease to have effect, and the property or right of possession therein mentioned shall be deemed to have passed to the purchaser or bailee.\nI would think that this enactment would not render the agreement void inter partes (see also Stuart Manufacturing Co. v. Whitaker[6]), but it appears sufficient, as regards any mortgage created by the respondent's debenture, to say that the appellant was and is a creditor of the Press Publishing Company, Limited. I have hitherto discussed the questions submitted as they were presented by the learned counsel of both parties, each of whom denied the validity of the lien or charge claimed by the other. I may also add that both courts below dealt with the matter as involving a question of priority between two rival claimants.\nThe question arose under an order of the Master in Chambers, of the 14th January, 1919, subsequent to the liquidation proceedings taken against the Press Publishing Company, Limited. This order authorized a settlement of the claim of the respondents by transferring to them all the assets of the company free and clear of all debts and liabilities of the company, but subject to such mortgages, liens, charges and encumbrances as are or were, prior to the making of the order, entitled to priority over the charge created by the respondent's debenture, reserving unto the appellant only the right to contest the validity of the debenture, and to take proceedings to set aside the same for the purpose only of recovering the amount owing by the company to the appellant.\nThen an interpleader order was made on the 22nd February, 1919, stating as follows the question to be decided:\nWhereas the above named James C. Foster, Junior, and Edward H. McArthur affirm, and the above named International Typesetting Machine Company and J. V. Drumheller deny, that certain goods and chattels formerly in the possession of the Press Publishing Company, Limited, seized by the sheriff of the Judicial District of Calgary, under warrant of distress from W. R. Hull, are the property of the plaintiffs (Foster and McArthur), or that the plaintiffs have the right to possession thereof, as against the defendants (International Typesetting Company and Drumheller) or either of them; and it has been ordered by order of the Master dated the 14th day of January, A.D. 1919, that the said question be judged by a judge without a jury at Calgary, at a date to be fixed by the Clerk of the Court: Therefore let the same be tried accordingly.\nOn the question thus submitted, I am of opinion, for the reasons above stated, that this question should be answered in the negative. I do not however wish to be understood as passing in any way on the rights of any creditor who had seized the machine in question, if any such rights can now be asserted.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1919] 2 W.W.R. 652.\n[2] 58 Can.

L.R. 22; [1920] 1 W.W.R. 220) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. A. Cruise for the appellant.\nJ. M. Stevenson for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I must say that, alike during the argument at bar and since then during my reading and examination of the case and factums, I entertained some misgivings as to the soundness of the judgment appealed from.\nThe question seems to me reduced to this: Had Stephen Heichman, the defendant's son, at the time of his death such a cause of action as entitled him to maintain an action against his father either for specific performance of his alleged agreement to give and convey to him the two-quarter sections of land in question or, in the alternative, for damages, as claimed in the statement of claim. If he had not, it goes without saying that the plaintiff company, as administrator of his estate, could not maintain the action.\nI have reached the conclusion that the findings of fact by the learned trial judge are clearly such as the evidence justified. His rejection of the evidence of Paul Serak and his complete discrediting of him and his acceptance of the evidence of Solinak and Antonenko as to what took place between the father and the son when the written document signed by the defendant, the father, purporting to evidence that he had conveyed the half-section of land in question to his son was read and that this was done and intended to be done in consideration of his son marrying Mary, the daughter of the witness Solinak, coupled with the fact that such document satisfied the father of the intended bride who gave his consent to the marriage which shortly afterwards took place, satisfy me that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was right and the ground on which it was based of estoppel was sound.\nThe deceased son was induced to change his condition in life and enter into a marriage with Mary Solinak on the explicit statement made and the written document signed by defendant and read by the son in the father's presence to his future father-in-law that he, the son, was the owner of the half-section of land in controversy, as he, the father, had transferred the half-section to his son or was about doing so.\nIt does seem to me that the son having been thus induced to change his condition in life and assume the duties and responsibilities of married life could enforce that contract as against the father, the defendant herein, and that the latter would, in equity, be estopped from repudiating his representations of fact respecting the ownership of the half-section in question or \"from setting up his own iniquity as a defence.\"\nThe representations of fact made by the defendant and which resulted in the marriage of his son related to, and covered as well, the personal property involved in the action. His representations were that he was giving the half-section of land to his son and the horses and machinery necessary to work the same.\nI concur in the judgment of the Court of Appeal as stated in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Newlands on the main and substantial question before us, which I think is sufficiently supported by the authorities to which he refers. I cannot, however, agree with respect to the point of a partnership reference on which he thinks an amendment of the trial judge's judgment should be made. No such question was pleaded by the defendant, or in issue, or thrashed out at the trial and I would restore the trial judge's judgment unamended, excepting that the extension of the time given for the return to the plaintiff of his personal property should date from the day of this judgment.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the finding of facts by the learned trial judge was amply justified by the evidence assuming he was right, as a perusal of the relevant evidence assures me he was, in utterly discrediting the witness Serak as he did in a minor degree the appellant.\nIt might have been more satisfactory had the learned trial judge expressly said his finding was arrived at and intended to be applied in light of and in conformity with the statement of the law correctly stated by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal.\nThere is no doubt that they viewed the facts disclosed in the evidence as relevant to the principles of law upon which they proceeded.\nIt is very easy to confuse a representation of an existent fact with a promise to produce a condition of things in harmony therewith.\nI see no reason to think that the Court of Appeal has done so and thereby erred in the application of the relevant law upon which they rely.\nThe mode of thought, and expression given thereto through interpreters, as in this case, is much more likely to have been correctly appreciated by the learned judges in appeal, by reason of their experience in dealing with the like incidents of a trial in the province of Saskatchewan, than we who have not had the same, though possibly something analogous, in our respective experience.\nWe should, therefore, be slow to reverse in such a case where we find the Court of Appeal has correctly apprehended the principle of law upon which they profess to act and apply thereto the evidence presented under such like difficulties.\nMoreover, it is quite clear that what Solinak saw appellant about, was to be assured of the existent financial condition of his proposed son-in-law, in order to secure the future happiness of his daughter whose marriage he was being asked to consent to.\nHe left convinced by the appellant's actual representations and conduct that what had been done to satisfy him in that regard had in fact, by and in conformity with the representations or silence giving consent thereto as actual representations of fact, been accomplished.\nI am, therefore, not disposed to act upon mere criticism of forms of expression of an interpreter suggesting another possible meaning than that which the court below has placed thereon, when clearly seized, as that court seems to have been, of the principle of law to which the evidence must be applied.\nI therefore think the appeal fails.\nBut in regard to the cross-appeal I doubt if the facts in any way one can look upon them, give any title to the measure of relief which the court below has given.\nIf the parties are well advised they can reach a much more equitable result than anything based either upon the assumption of any partnership to be implied from the facts or adjustment based thereon, or anything analogous thereto, and would suggest they attempt same before the cross-appeal is finally disposed of.\nIn the event of their failure we must dispose of same as best we can.\nMeantime I would dismiss the appeal with costs and suspend the disposition of the cross-appeal for such brief period as the parties may intimate a desire for their attempting to consider same.\nAnglin J.\u2014Although I was at first somewhat in doubt, on further consideration of the evidence of Efram Solinak and George Antonenko, in the light of all the circumstances, I think it sufficiently supports the finding that a representation was made by the defendant that his son, Stephen, was the actual beneficial owner of, if not the legal holder of the title to, the half-section in question. I see no good reason why the plaintiff, as personal representative of Stephen Heichman and as trustee for Mary Heichman, whose intermarriage took place, as the defendant knew was intended, on the faith of that representation, cannot maintain this suit. It is not necessary to discuss the other grounds of action preferred by the plaintiff, viz., actual conveyance and contract to convey. For the reasons more fully stated by Mr. Justice Newlands I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action instituted by the administrator of the deceased Peter Heichman for a transfer of a half-section of land in Saskatchewan and the return of certain chattels. The deceased was married to Mary Solinak under the following circumstances:\nHe went to see her at Battleford where she was living and she expressed then her willingness to marry him provided her father would be agreeable. The father of the bride, before giving his consent, wanted to know about the financial situation of the young man, met his father and there it was represented to him that the prospective son-in-law was the owner of the half-section in question in this case and of certain chattels. He was shewn a typewritten paper describing the son as the owner. The father of the young girl was satisfied with the representations made and the marriage took place a short time afterwards.\nThe young man and his wife resided with his father for a while and then went to settle on this half-section where he died a few months after.\nAfter his death (the young wife being herself very sick) his father brought her to his house and removed all the chattels from the half section, and even the money which the young couple possessed.\nSoon after the young wife was removed to some other place and the present action in recovery of the land and of the chattels is now instituted.\nThe defendant claims that his son was to give him a certain sum of money, viz., $3,000, and that credit was to be given on the purchase price of the half-section and that the contracts to that effect, though drafted, were never executed.\nThe evidence is somewhat conflicting as to what was said and done; but the trial judge and the Court of Appeal accepted the evidence of the plaintiff. This evidence shows that the defendant represented to the father of the bride that his son was the owner of the property in question and that the payment of a sum of $3,000 was never mentioned.\nWhat has become of the slip of paper which was read at the interview between the two fathers? The respondent denies its existence but the court has found that such a document was read. Has this document been taken by the appellant from the house of his son when he took away everything, even the money? Of course the appellant denies that but such a thing might have occurred.\nThere is no doubt that the evidence as accepted by the courts below is to the effect that the appellant represented that his son was the owner of the land and chattels in question. The law is that where upon proposals of marriage third persons represent anything material in a light different from the truth they shall be bound to make good the statement they make. Montefiori v. Montefiori[2], Mills v. Fox[3].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThere is a cross appeal.\nThe trial judge has charged the defendant with the value of the whole crop. The evidence shows, however, that this crop had been put in by the defendant himself and that he should not be charged with the whole value thereof and a reference was ordered to determine what amount should be properly charged to the defendant. The cross-appeal should be held over in order to give the parties an opportunity to settle. Mignault J.\u2014In this case the evidence is very conflicting and the learned trial judge, on the vital fact as to the ownership by the appellant's son, Stephen Heichman, of the south half of section 30 of township 38, believed the testimony adduced by the respondent in preference to that of the appellant's witnesses. He did not, however, state specifically the facts found by him, being content with saying that he found that the facts were as alleged by the witnesses on behalf of the respondent. Reference must therefore be had to this testimony, which was taken through an interpreter, the witnesses being Russians.\nThe story is that Stephen Heichman desired to marry Mary Solinak and asked the latter's father, Efram Solinak, to allow the marriage, pretending that he owned two farms. Thereupon Solinak, to make sure of Stephen's prospects in life, went with Stephen and one George Antenenko to see the appellant. I quote from his testimony.\nQ. What was said to Peter Heichman?\nA. I told Peter Heichman, \"Your son wants to marry my daughter.\"\nQ. Yes?\nA. Stephen told me that he had two farms, that you were giving him four horses and all the machinery.\nQ. Yes?\nA. Peter Heichman then said, \"Yes, I am giving those.\"\nQ. Did he say he was giving the land too, as well as the machinery?\nA. Then I asked, \"In whose name stands the land? Is the land standing?\"\nQ. Yes?\nA. \"The land is in my name but I am giving it to him. He is my son.\"\nAntenenko swore:\nQ. What took place?\nA. We came over there to Peter Heichman's after 12.\nQ. Yes?\nA. Only John was home, and the children. Stephen then told John to go and get the father. Q. Yes?\nA. Then the father came and we got acquainted.\nQ. Yes?\nA. Solinak then started to ask questions.\nQ. What about?\nA. \"Your son wants to marry my daughter.\"\nQ. Yes?\nA. 'He says he has two farms, four horses, and all the machinery.\"\nQ. Solinak said that to Peter?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what did Peter Heichman say?\nA. Peter Heichman then said, \"Yes, that is right.\" Peter Heichman (should be Solinak) then asked in whose name was the land.\nQ. Peter Heichman asked?\nA. Solinak asked Peter Heichman in whose name was the land.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And Heichman then said, \"It is in my name.\"\nQ. Yes?\nA. \"Are you going to make this transfer over to Stephen?\" \"Yes, all right.\"\nThat conversation took place late on Sunday night, the 10th February, 1918. On the Monday morning, the 11th, the appellant went with Stephen to see a Justice of the Peace, one Paul Serak, and the two afterwards returned with a typewritten paper, which Stephen read to Solinak and Antenenko in presence of the appellant. The former gives the contents of the paper as read as follows:\nI, Peter Heichman, give the south half of section 30, township 38, range 11, to my son Stephen, to my son I am giving this land.\nAntenenko's version is:\u2014\nI, Peter Heichman, turn over to Stephen Heichman the south of 30, half section 11-38; 38-11.\nThis satisfied Solinak and he consented to the marriage and returned home. The marriage took place on March 1st, Stephen brought his wife home, and afterwards the appellant built him a house on the south half of section 30, where he resided until his death in October of the same year. The difficulty of the respondent's case is no doubt increased by the fact that if such a paper ever existed it has disappeared, and this renders it imperative to carefully scrutinize the secondary evidence by which it is sought to prove its contents. The same critical scrutiny must be directed to the evidence by which the appellant attempted to contradict this secondary proof, for he afterwards called Paul Serak, the Justice of the Peace whom the father and son went to see on February 11th, and Serak stated that he had drawn up a paper purporting to be a receipt from the appellant to Stephen for the sum of $3,000, as a first payment on some land, and he is not sure whether the land was described in the receipt. Serak also said that he had subsequently prepared a formal agreement of sale of the land in question which was never signed, and one of the copies of which he files. The trial judge however did not credit Serak's testimony, and the alleged receipt is not produced, so I will not further consider Serak's story.\nApparently the learned trial judge considered the evidence sufficient to show that a gift had been made by the father to the son in consideration of the latter's marriage to Solinak's daughter. In the Court of Appeal, the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, very reluctantly he said, acquiesced in the strong findings of the trial judge. Mr. Justice Newlands, with whom Mr. Justice Lamont concurred, based his judgment in favor of the respondent on a representation made by the appellant to Solinak, Antenenko and Stephen Heichman, that he had given this farm and the implements to Stephen, estopping the appellant from now denying the truth of this representation. Mr. Cruise, who very ably argued the case on behalf of the appellant, contended that if the respondent relied on a contract of gift by the appellant to Spephen, no action could be taken on such a contract under the statute of frauds in the absence of a memorandum signed by the appellant. He further urges that no sufficient consideration has been shown for a gift of, or a promise to give, the land to Stephen. And as to the claim of estoppel founded on representation, Mr. Cruise argued that there was no representation of an existing fact, but at the most a representation, in the first interview, that the appellant would make over the land to Stephen. In regard to the document read in the second interview, Mr. Cruise urged that no existing fact was then represented but merely a statement made as to its contents. He further contended that if there was any representation, it was made to Solinak who is not a party to the action.\nAs to the contention based on the statute of frauds, I may say that the appellant did not plead the statute. Moreover this contention is fully answered by the evidence given by Solinak and Antenenko and believed by the learned trial judge of the contents of the writing read by Stephen in the appellant's presence, which writing was stated to have been signed by both the appellant and Stephen. This writing, it is true, has disappeared, but evidence was made without objection of its contents and I have no doubt that where a sufficient memorandum in writing under the statute of frauds is proved to have existed but to have been lost, secondary evidence of its contents can be made. As sworn to by both Solinak and Antonenko, the document read by Stephen satisfies all the requirements of the statute. Then as to consideration, marriage is a valuable consideration to support an ante-nuptial promise by a third person (Halsbury, Contract, No. 803). Shadwell v. Shadwell[4], is in point. There the plaintiff's uncle had promised an annuity to the plaintiff on hearing of the latter's intention to marry. It was held that the marriage was sufficient consideration to support the promise. Mr. Cruise attempted to distinguish the case of Shadwell v. Shadwell4 by saying that here the promise was made to obtain the consent of the prospective father-in-law to the marriage and not to Stephen to induce him to marry. It must not be forgotten however that Stephen was the person chiefly interested in obtaining both the consent of Solinak, which would permit of his marriage, and the settlement on him of the land which would aid him in discharging the added pecuniary obligations resulting from his marriage. In the words of Erle C. J. Stephen\nmay have made a most material change in his position, and induced the object of his affections to do the same, and may have incurred pecuniary liabilities resulting in embarrassments which would be in every sense a loss if the income which had been promised should be withheld. (Shadwell v. Shadwell4 At page 174.\nI must therefore think that the objection as to want of consideration is not well taken.\nThus far I have considered the respondent's claim in so far as it can rest on a contract. I think the trial judge and the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan so viewed it. As I have said, however, the two other judges of the Court of Appeal preferred to base their conclusions on a representation made by the appellant that he had given the land to Stephen, estopping him from now denying the gift. I cannot free myself from doubt that this ground should be adopted. So far as there was representation, it would appear that it was solely made to Solinak, and Stephen, by reading the document signed by him and his father, was, in a way, a party to this representation. But so far as there was a contract, it was made with Stephen and my opinion is that it was sufficiently supported by the consideration of Stephen's marriage. On this ground I think the learned trial judge was right in giving judgment to the plaintiff.\nI would dismiss the appellant's appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cruise, Tufts & Lindal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bence, Stevenson & McLorg.\n[1] 13 Sask.

The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. L. Perron K.C., for the appellant.\nA. Wainwright K.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014At the close of the argument the court was unanimously of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored on the ground that the contract or bill of lading for the carriage of the goods fixed and determined the damages for which the defendant might become liable, namely, on the basis of the value of the goods at the time and place of shipment.\nThe defendant company did not dispute their liability for damages, the goods having been destroyed by their negligence during their transit. The sole question was as to the proper test by which their liability for damages should be determined. The defendant's contention was that their liability should be determined from the cost to the plaintiffs of these goods under their contract with the Dominion Textile Co., Ltd., by which they agreed to purchase the entire output of the mills for four cents per pound for one year. That price so agreed to be paid was the value, they contended, of the goods in Quebec on which their liability should be based and determined.\nThe trial judge held that the true value of the goods to the plaintiff under the contract of carriage was not the cost or price at which they purchased them from the mills but what they would fetch in the open market at the time and place of shipment and assessed the damages on that basis at eight cents per pound, or $2,010.24. The Court of King's Bench[2] reversed this finding, holding that the purchase price at which the plaintiffs bought from the mills was the test of value of the goods under the contract of carriage to them for the loss of which only they could recover, and accordingly reduced the damages by half or to $1,005.12.\nI am of opinion that the Court of King's Bench erred in the test they accepted as to the value of the goods at the time and place of shipment. That value, I think, was not the price which under a yearly contract for the entire output of the textile company's mills they had bought the goods for, but the market value of those goods to them at the time and place of shipment of the goods. Their contract for the purchase of the entire output of the mills may or may not have been a good one; it may or may not have been improvident. It is not evidence of the market value of the goods at the time and place of shipment which was proved independently as very nearly double the cost to them from the mills. The carrier had nothing to do with that price. If they had paid double the market value, they certainly could not recover such value from the carrier, nor can the fact of their having purchased at less than the market price at the time of shipment avail against the market value. An ordinary purchase in open market would be very different.\nThe evidence uncontradicted at the trial shewed that the goods had been purchased by plaintiffs for resale in Montreal where their market value at the time of shipment was between 8 and 8 5-8 cents per pound and that the only difference between the market value in Quebec and Montreal was the cost of carriage from Quebec to Montreal. This cost, $71.25, was no doubt inadvertently not deducted from the damages awarded in the Superior Court and must be, of course, deducted now.\nIn some way or another which has not been explained this vital and necessary evidence of the market value of the goods in Quebec at the time and place of shipment was overlooked by the Court of King's Bench. There, however, we find it in the record clear and distinct and uncontradicted, and so finding it must render our judgment accordingly.\nA question was raised during the argument as to whether the bill of lading or contract of carriage was not illegal as contravening the 4th section of the statute 9 & 10 Ed. VII, ch. 61, but as the defendants, respondents, so far from relying on that section distinctly rest their case upon the validity of the contract I do not deem it necessary to discuss the question.\nIn my judgment the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with a reduction of the amount by the sum of $71.25, the cost of the carriage between Quebec and Montreal.\nThe case of Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[3], is, I think, much in point in some of the material points involved in this appeal. The head-note of that case in the Law Journal report states the decision of their Lordships to have been, inter alia, as follows:\nWhere a contract provided for the delivery of goods at a place where there was no market for them, damages for non-delivery should be calculated with reference to the market at which the purchaser, as the vendor knew, intended to sell them, with allowance for the cost of carriage. Idington J.\u2014The only evidence we have for our guide as to the value of the goods in question when destroyed, explicitly puts them at market prices in Montreal supplemented by clear and express evidence of their value in Montreal at the time in question and further, in accordance with common sense that their value in Quebec, the point of shipment in question, was the same less the expense of transportation from Quebec to Montreal.\nThus, even under the contract insisted upon by the respondent\u2014of the legality of which there may be a doubt upon which I do not pass because the point was not taken below\u2014the value is amply demonstrated.\nWhat right has the respondent to reduce the value to the cost price, at another point than Quebec, of the goods which may have been got at a bargain, due to business foresight on the part of appellant, long before the time in question?\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the damages assessed on the basis of the market value sworn to.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendants come into court admitting liability. The sole question at issue is the measure of damages to which the plaintiffs are entitled. The defendants assert that that measure is fixed by the terms of the special clause in the bill of lading under which the goods were shipped for the loss of which the plaintiffs sue. The plaintiffs contest the validity of this special clause on the ground that it contravenes s. 4 of c. 61 of 9 & 10 Ed. VII. (D.). But it is probably unnecessary to determine that question and I express no opinion upon it. Assuming the validity of the special clause of the bill of lading relied upon, I find myself, with great respect, unable to agree with the view, which seems to have prevailed in the Court of King's Bench[4], that by \"the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment\" (in this case Quebec) the parties meant the cost price of the goods to the owner at the place where he bought them (in this case Montmorency) plus the charges for freight. I find no justification for such a departure from the ordinary meaning of plain language. \"Cost price plus freight\" and \"value\" are by no means the same thing. The utmost that can be said is that the former may afford some evidence of the latter.\nThe only evidence in the record is that the value of the goods in question was the same in Quebec as in Montreal, due allowance being made for the cost of transportation; and the uncontradicted testimony is that the goods could not have been replaced at the time they were destroyed.\nThe only evidence of value was given by the plaintiff's manager who tells of actual sales in Montreal on September 4th at 9\u00bd cents, on September 6th, at 8 7-8 cents and on September 26th at 8 cents. The learned trial judge found the value at the date of the breach (Sept. 12th) to have been between 8 and 8 5-8 cents a pound. He fixed the value \"within the terms of the bill of lading\" at 8 cents a pound and allowed the plaintiffs as damages on that basis, $2,010.24.\nCounsel for the appellant conceded at bar that there should be a deduction from this amount of $71.25 to cover cost of transportation. I rather think it should be 44\/50 ths of that amount ($62.70) since six bags out of the fifty were duly delivered, only 44 having been destroyed. The learned trial judge appears to have fully intended to make this deduction as two considerants in his judgment shew. He apparently omitted to do so when finally computing the amount of the damages.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and would restore the judgment of the Superior Court modified however to the extent indicated.\nBrodeur J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9e est une compagnie de navigation qui, en septembre 1918, a re\u00e7u \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec de la Dominion Textile Co. quarante-quatre balles de d\u00e9chets de coton et s'est charg\u00e9e de les transporter \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al sur l'un de ses bateaux.\nElle avait stipul\u00e9 dans le connaissement que le montant des dommages qu'elle pourrait encourir devrait \u00eatre bas\u00e9 sur la valeur de ces marchandises au port d'exp\u00e9dition, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nJe serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que cette clause du connaissement f\u00fbt ill\u00e9gale si elle eut pour effet de restreindre ou de diminuer la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire du navire, car je crois qu'elle violerait la \"Loi du transport des marchandises par eau\" (9 & 10 Ed.

Si un contrat est inex\u00e9cut\u00e9, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dus par celui qui y contrevient doivent remplacer tout l'avantage sur lequel le cr\u00e9ancier pouvait raisonnablement compter, et le d\u00e9biteur n'est tenu responsable que des dommages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus et qui sont la suite imm\u00e9diate et directe de cette inex\u00e9cution, \u00e0 moins qu'il y ait dol de sa part; et personne ne sugg\u00e8re que l'intim\u00e9e s'est rendue coupable de dol.\nDans le contrat de transport, si le voiturier perd la chose, il doit en rembourser la valeur int\u00e9grale. (Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol.22, n.\u00b0 2574).\nIl est admis par les deux parties que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la compagnie de navigation doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans le cas actuel par la valeur des effets au port d'exp\u00e9dition. Or, quelle est cette valeur?\nL'intim\u00e9e dit que c'est le prix pay\u00e9 par la demanderesse \u00e0 la Dominion Textile Co. La demanderesse pr\u00e9tend que le prix qu'elle a pay\u00e9 \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bas et ne repr\u00e9sentait pas la valeur actuelle du march\u00e9. Et elle prouve par un t\u00e9moin dont la d\u00e9position n'est pas contredite que la valeur actuelle de ces effets \u00e9tait d'environ huit cents la livre. Il nous dit qu'\u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec il \u00e9tait impossible de se procurer sur le march\u00e9 des marchandises de cette nature et que l'endroit le plus rapproch\u00e9 o\u00f9 l'on pouvait les avoir \u00e9tait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al o\u00f9 elles valaient environ huit cents, plus les frais de transport. Il n'y a pas de doute, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[6], que l'on pouvait, dans un cas comme celui-l\u00e0, avoir recours au prix du march\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al pour \u00e9tablir la valeur des marchandises \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa preuve constate que les marchandises avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues en vertu d'un contrat \u00e0 long terme \u00e0 l'appelante par la Dominion Textile Co. C'\u00e9tait un contrat qui pouvait avoir ses avantages mais qui avait aussi ses mauvais cot\u00e9s.\nDans ce cas-l\u00e0 quelle est la somme que doit rembourser le transporteur ? Est-ce la valeur des marchandises, ou bien si c'est le prix ? Baudry-Lacantinerie (loc. cit. no 3585) pose cette question et la r\u00e9sout comme suit:\nLorsque les marchandises avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues par l'exp\u00e9diteur au destinataire, est-ce leur valeur ou le prix de vente qui doit \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 par le voiturier?\nIl nous semble que la premi\u00e8re solution ne fait aucun doute dans le cas o\u00f9 le prix \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la valeur, et cela que les marchandises aient voyag\u00e9 aux risques de l'exp\u00e9diteur ou aux risques du destinataire \u2026 En tout cas, quelle que soit la partie aux risques de qui la marchandise voyage, c'est, suivant le droit commun, la valeur de la chose qui doit \u00eatre rembours\u00e9e.\nDans notre cas, le prix d'achat \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la valeur de la marchandise. Alors, adoptant l'opinion de cet auteur, je suis oblig\u00e9 de dire que la cour d'appel a fait erreur en basant son jugement sur le prix pay\u00e9 par la compagnie appelante.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel. Le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli. On devra d\u00e9duire de ce dernier jugement une somme de $62.70 qui y a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e par erreur. Mignault J.\u2014This action arose out of a shipment, in September, 1918, of fifty bales of cotton waste consigned to the appellant at Montreal by the Dominion Textile Company, Limited, from which company they had been bought by the appellant at the Dominion Textile Company's Mills at Montmorency, Quebec, the shipment being made from Quebec to Montreal. The bill of lading contained the following condition:\nThe amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable shall be computed on the basis of the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading (including the freight and other charges if paid and the duty if paid or payable and not refunded), unless a lower value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has been agreed upon or is determined by the classification or tariff upon which the rate is based, in any of which events such lower value shall be the amount to govern such computation, whether or not such loss or damage occurs from negligence.\nThe appellant alleged that when the said bales reached Montreal, employees of the respondent, through carelessness and neglect, instead of placing them in the respondent's sheds, left them on the dock exposed to the rain, where 44 of the said bales were spoiled, and the appellant claimed as damages $2,387.16.\nBy its plea the respondent, setting up the above condition, admitted its liability for the said loss\ncomputed on the basis of the value of the said goods at the place and time of shipment as provided in the bill of lading,\nso that the only question is as to the amount to which the appellant is entitled.\nThe learned trial judge (Maclennan J.) found that the goods had been purchased by the appellant from the Dominion Textile Company at four cents per pound, that there were no users of said goods in Quebec, but there were users and a market for them in Montreal where they were being brought for resale by the appellant, and where their market value, at the time of shipment, was between eight and eight and five-eighths cents per pound; that the true value of said goods to the appellant at the time and place of shipment was not the invoice price or cost at which the appellant, had bought them under a yearly contract, but what they would fetch in the open market at such time and place; that the only difference between the market value of said goods in Quebec and Montreal was the cost of their carriage from Quebec to Montreal, and that their value at Quebec might be taken to be the market value thereof in the ordinary course of business in the open market at Montreal, less the cost of carriage from Quebec to Montreal; and fixing their value at eight cents per pound for forty-four bales, weighing 25,128 pounds, the learned trial judge gave judgment to the appellant for $2,010.24.\nOn appeal to the Court of King's Bench[7], the latter court reduced the judgment to $1,076.12 for the following reasons:\nConsid\u00e9rant que les 44 balles de d\u00e9chets de coton dont il s'agit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9es et g\u00e2t\u00e9es, comme l'intim\u00e9e le pr\u00e9tend et comme la cour sup\u00e9rieure l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9;\nConsid\u00e9rant cependant que la base du quantum adopt\u00e9 par la cour sup\u00e9rieure est erron\u00e9e et que ledit jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure\u2014vu que le prix d'achat \u00e9tait de 4 cts la livre\u2014se trouvait \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 l'appelante un profit de 100% sur les marchandises en question, sans les avoir revendues, sans y avoir touch\u00e9 et sans avoir fait aucune d\u00e9pense ni encouru aucun risque \u00e0 ce sujet;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9, dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, est, toutes choses \u00e9gales d'ailleurs, celui de la perte subie ou du prix auquel l'acheteur pourrait se procurer d'autres marchandises semblables, mais que, dans la pr\u00e9sente action, il y a, entre les parties, un contrat contenu dans la lettre de voiture et qui r\u00e8gle cette question dans l'esp\u00e8ce;\nConsid\u00e9rant que cette lettre de voiture d\u00e9clare que te montant de la perte ou du dommage pour lequel l'appelant est responsable sera calcul\u00e9 sur la base de la valeur des marchandises au temps et au Heu de l'exp\u00e9dition: Consid\u00e9rant que les marchandises en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9es \u00e0 Montmorency, pr\u00e8s de Qu\u00e9bec, de la Montreal Textile Co. au prix de 4 centins la livre:\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce chiffre \u00e9tablit la valeur des marchandises en question au point d'exp\u00e9dition, tel que le veut la lettre de voiture;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'en accordant 8 centins pour le prix d'une livre, la cour sup\u00e9rieure a accord\u00e9 la valeur, non pas au point d'exp\u00e9dition, tel que le veut le contrat, qui est la loi des parties, mais \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, au point de d\u00e9barquement, et que la lettre de voiture a sp\u00e9cialement pourvu \u00e0 ce que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante soit celle de la valeur au point de l'exp\u00e9dition.\nThe appellant now appeals to this court from the latter judgment.\nWith all possible respect, I think the judgment appealed from is clearly wrong. The measure of damages was fixed by the bill of lading, and it was \"the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment.\" The determination of this value involves a pure question of fact and we have only to look at the evidence, which was properly directed to show the value of the goods to the appellant, to decide what amount should be awarded.\nMr. Lichtenheim, managing director of the appellant, was called by the latter. He said, in answer to questions put by the appellant's counsel:\nQ. I want to know what they were selling for at the market price?\nA. Your Lordship, the goods were purchased on a contract many months before they were ready for sale and you cannot sell those goods in that way until you obtain possession of them, never knowing whether you are going to get them or not.\nQ. Those goods were shipped from Quebec?\nA. Montmorency Falls.\nQ. The boat company took them from Quebec?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You have stated in your examination \"on discovery\" what the value of those goods was in Montreal? A. Yes.\nQ. Was there any difference between the value of those goods in Quebec and in Montreal? A. Freight and cartage only. And they could not have been replaced by the company at the price for which we wanted to sell. Q. All I am concerned with is whether there was any difference in the value between Quebec and Montreal, and if so what it was?\nA. The freight and cartage. That was the market price of the material at that time.\nThis evidence, which was not contradicted or tested by cross-examination, establishes that the only difference between the market value of the goods as between Quebec and Montreal, was the freight and cartage. In his examination on discovery, Lichtenheim swore that he could have sold the goods at 9\u00bd cents per pound if he had them. As the witness testified to sales at 8, 8\u215e and 9 cents, the learned trial judge accepted the value as being 8 cents per pound, finding that the only difference between the price at Montreal and Quebec was the cost of carriage.\nI take it that we are bound by this evidence which, as I have said, was not contradicted, and it establishes the value of the goods at Quebec, the place of shipment, by merely deducting from their value in Montreal the cost of shipment to the latter city. It also seems to me that in the case of two cities relatively near to each other, even though there be no buyers in the one, if there be buyers in the other, the value of the goods in the former can be fairly considered as being that at which they could be sold in the latter, less the cost of carriage. I am also of opinion that the value to be considered is the value to the purchaser; Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[8]. This is in agreement with art. 1073 of the Civil Code, which allows to the creditor the profit of which he has been deprived, and the appellant would not be compensated according to this rule if he were given only the price he paid for the goods, excluding any profit on the same. I have duly considered the reasons of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench, but, with deference, it seems to me that under this contract, and there is involved here merely a matter of contract, it cannot be said that the value of the goods is the purchase price of the same, or the price at which similar goods could be bought by the appellant. It is noteworthy that Lichtenheim swears he could not have purchased identical goods in the open market, but it suffices to say that the measure of damages was fixed by the contract, and was not the price at which the goods were purchased but their value at the place and time of shipment. This raises merely a question of fact and unfortunately for the respondent the evidence of this value, uncontradicted as it was, is conclusive against it.\nMr. Perron for the appellant conceded at the argument that the cost of the carriage of the goods from Quebec to Montreal, which the bill of lading stated to have been $71.39, for 50 bales, making $62.82 for the 44 bales in question, should be deducted from the value found by the learned trial judge. This deduction however should be without effect on the costs.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge, reducing however the amount allowed to $1,947.42.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davidson, Wainwright, Alexander & Elder.\n[1] Q.R. 29 K.B. 186.\n[2] Q.R. 29 K.B. 186.\n[3] 80 L.J.

V, c. 45, ss. 13 and 22\u2014Regulation of Trade and Commerce\u2014Criminal law\u2014Peace, order and good government.\nA case stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 32 of the Board of Commerce Act should not submit abstract questions but should state the facts of some matter pending before the Board and submit questions of law or jurisdiction arising when considering the same. In re Cardigan County Council, (54 J.P. 792), appl.\nBy sec. 18 of The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, the Board of Commerce is empowered to inquire into and prohibit the making of unfair profits on the holding or disposition of necessaries of life, and practices with respect to such holding or disposition calculated to unfairly enhance the cost of such necessaries. The Board made an order restraining and prohibiting certain manufacturers of clothing from omitting or refusing to offer for sale in the city of Ottawa their commodities at prices not higher than are reasonable and just; offering the same for sale at prices higher than are reasonable and just; and marking for sale by retail said commodities at prices ascertained by the addition to cost of fifty per cent or more or made up of cost plus a gross profit of a percentage greater than by the order recognized as fair or a percentage indicated as unfair.\nHeld, per Davies C.J., Anglin and Mignault JJ., Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra, that the Board had authority to make the order; that Parliament had power to confer the authority on the Board by its jurisdiction to make laws for \"the regulation of Trade and Commerce\" and for \"the peace, order and good government of Canada\" and possibly, except as to the power of the Board to inquire into trade matters, by its jurisdiction to legislate on \"Criminal Law.\" By sec. 38 of the Board of Commerce Act the Board is authorized to require that any order it issues shall be made a rule of the Exchequer Court or of any superior court of a province.\nHeld, per Davies C.J., Anglin and Mignault JJ., Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ. expressing no opinion, that Parliament may, in passing legislation within its jurisdiction, impose duties upon any subjects of the Dominion including officials of provincial courts and that the Board could validly exercise the power so conferred.\nCase stated by the Board of Commerce for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe provisions of the Acts in question on this appeal and the order of the Board are set out in the reasons for judgment. The questions submitted is whether or not the Board had jurisdiction to make the order and to require that it be made a rule of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nW. F. O'Connor K.C., and Duncan, appeared for the Attorney General of Canada.\nLafleur K.C., for the Attorney General of Alberta.\nTilley K.C., for Manufacturing Associations interested.\nThe opinions of the Chief Justice and of Anglin a.nd Mignault JJ. were written by:\u2014\nAnglin J.\u2014In this case I am to deliver the judgment of my Lord, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Mignault and myself.\nThe Board of Commerce, constituted under the authority of c. 37 of the Dominion Statutes of 1919, is by s. 32 of that Act empowered to\nstate a case in writing for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada upon any question which, in the opinion of the Board, is a question of law or of jurisdiction. Purporting to proceed under this provision the Board presented for determination by this court a series of six questions\u2014three of them directed to the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Combines and Fair Prices Act (c. 45 of the statutes of 1919) and the other three to the construction of certain sections of the same statute. With a view to meeting a suggestion that Parliament had not intended to authorize the submission of abstract questions for the opinion of the court, the Board amended the case by adding to it a statement that the questions submitted had arisen in the consideration of certain matters actually pending before it. Glasgow Navigation Co. v. Iron Ore Co.[1]. After hearing argument during the winter term, however, the court was of the opinion that the case as presented was not a \"stated case\" within the contemplation of s. 32 of the Board of Commerce Act inasmuch as it did not contain any statement of concrete facts out of which the questions formulated arose; Re County Council of Cardigan[2]; compare the English O.34, r. 1 and Bulkeley v. Hope[3]; but was rather, under the guise of a stated case, an unintentional assumption of the power conferred on the Governor-General-in-Council by s. 60 of the Supreme Court Act, to refer to this court for hearing and consideration important questions of law or fact touching (a) the interpretation of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, or (b) the constitutionality or interpretation of any Dominion or provincial legislation.\nThe attention of counsel having been drawn to this aspect of the matter it was arranged that the case as originally submitted should be superseded by a new case which should contain a statement of facts in some matter or matters pending before the Board and formulate questions of law or jurisdiction which had actually arisen in their consideration, indicating how such questions arose. Such a case was accordingly filed and supplemental argument upon it was recently heard. I am of opinion that inasmuch as by s. 33 (3) of the Board of Commerce Act the finding or determination of the Board on any question of fact within its jurisdiction is made binding and conclusive, the case as now submitted falls within the intendment of s. 32 of that statute. It states that the Board proposes to make an order in which, after reciting that it has upon an oral investigation found that in some thirty-six shops in the city of Ottawa men's ready made and partly made suits and overcoats, purchased at a cost of $30 or under, have as a practice been sold at the same percentage of gross profit or margin to the retailers as commodities purchased by them at a greater cost and that unfair profits have been made on such sales and that the merchants concerned have not offered their stocks-in-trade of such commodities for sale at prices not higher than are reasonable and just, but that extenuating circumstances render a prosecution unnecessary, and that in the opinion of the Board fair profits on such commodities may be ascertained on a basis set forth, it will proceed to order that the individuals, firms, and corporations conducting such establishments, naming them, be, and each of them is, restrained and prohibited from\n(a) omitting or refusing to offer for sale within the city of Ottawa said commodities in accordance with the ordinary course of business at prices not higher than are reasonable and just;\n(b) offering for sale within the City of Ottawa said commodities at prices higher than are reasonable and just; (c) making or taking upon dispositions within the city of Ottawa by way of sale of said commodities unfair profits being profits greater than those hereinbefore indicated as fair profits;\n(d) instituting, continuing or repeating the practice of marking for sale by retail within the City of Ottawa either the said commodities or stocks-in-trade of clothing of which said commodities form part at prices calculated or ascertained by the addition to cost of fifty per cent or more of cost or at prices made up of cost plus a margin or gross profit of (a) a percentage greater than by this order recognized as fair, or (b) a percentage by this order indicated as unfair, whether or not sales are intended to be actually made at lower prices and in conformity with this order, such practices being in the opinion of the Board designed or calculated to unfairly enhance the price realized upon dispositions by sale of said commodities.\nAt bar Mr. O'Connor, representing the Attorney General, very properly conceded that clauses (a) and (b) of the proposed order would be merely repetitions of the general statutory prohibition implied in s. 17 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act and are not in a defensible form, and he accordingly abandoned them. As to the remaining clauses (c) and (d), the stated case submits two questions:\n\"(1) Has the Board lawful authority to make the order?\n\"(2) Has the Board lawful authority to require the Registrar or other proper officer of the Supreme Court of Ontario to cause the order when issued to be made a rule of said Court?\"\nSec. 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act purports in explicit terms to confer the authority to make such a restraining or prohibitive order, and s. 38 of the Board of Commerce Act likewise purports in explicit terms to enable the Board to require that any order made by it shall be made a rule, order or decree of the Exchequer Court or of any superior court of any province of Canada. The questions presented are, therefore, in reality whether these particular provisions are within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament. They may be more conveniently considered separately.\nUpon the policy, efficacy or desirability of such legislation it should be unnecessary to state that an opinion is neither sought nor expressed.\nCould Parliament empower the Board to make the order?\nCounsel representing the Attorney General maintains that it could by virtue of its legislative jurisdiction (a) over \"The Criminal Law,\" (b) in regard to \"The Regulation of Trade and Commerce,\" and (c) \"To make Laws for the Peace, Order and Good Government of Canada\" (B.N.A. Act, s. 91).\nSec. 17 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act prohibiting the unreasonable accumulation or withholding of \"necessaries of life\" defined by s. 18 (recently construed by this court in the case of Price Bros. Limited), and requiring that any excess of necessaries of life and all stocks in trade of such necessaries shall be offered for sale at reasonable and fair prices, and s. 22, which imposes penalties, inter alia, for contraventions of s. 17, may, I think, be held valid (the latter pro tanto) as criminal legislation. The provision of s. 18 authorizing the Board to make the inquiries therein provided for and to determine what shall constitute unfair profits may possibly be supported as ancillary criminal legislation, as well as for the purposes of s. 24.\nBut I think it is not possible to support, as necessarily incidental to the efficient exercise of plenary legislative jurisdiction over \"the criminal law,\" the further provision of s. 18 purporting to empower the court to restrain prospective breaches of the statute, the making or taking of unfair profits, and practices calculated unfairly to enhance costs or prices, or the provisions of s. 38 of the Board of Commerce Act for making decisions or orders of the Board rules or decrees of the Exchequer Court or of any provincial superior court. The exception at the end of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, although applicable to all the enumerated heads of s. 92,\nwas not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by these sixteen subsections, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local and private in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative heads of s. 91.\nAttorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[4], at page 360; Montreal v. Montreal Street Rly, Co.[5].\nIn so far as the provisions of s. 18 immediately under consideration may involve an invasion of the field of property and civil rights assigned to provincial legislative jurisdiction by s. 92 (12), in my opinion they cannot be supported under s. 91 (27).\nThe jurisdiction of Parliament over \"The Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" (s. 91 (2)) has frequently been invoked\u2014usually without success\u2014either in supporting federal legislation alleged to invade the provincial field or in attacking the validity of provincial legislation claimed to fall under one of the enumerated heads of s. 92, In Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[6], at page 112, the Judicial Committee first points out that these words are not used in an unlimited sense as is apparent from their collocation and from the specific enumeration of several subjects which in their broadest sense the words \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" would include. Their Lordships suggest that regulations relating to general trade and commerce were in the mind of the legislature,\nand that these words (p. 113)\nwould include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of Parliament, regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern and it may be that they would include general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion; (but) their Lordships abstain * * from any attempt to define the limits of the authority of the Dominion Parliament in this direction.\nIn Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[7], it was held that an attempt to make the expression, \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" cover direct taxation of banks so as to exclude provincial power to impose such taxation would unduly strain it. What was said in the Parsons Case[8], was impliedly approved in The Local Prohibition Case[9]. In Montreal v. Montreal Street Rly. Co.[10], Lord Atkinson, after setting out some propositions which The Local Prohibition Case (1) should be taken to have established with regard to the purview of the exception to the provincial legislative authority contained in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act at its end and the restrictions which must be imposed on the legislative powers of the Dominion over unenumerated subjects exercisable under its jurisdiction\nto make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada,\nsays, at p. 344, that\nthese enactments, secs. 91 and 92, indicate that the exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada in regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91 ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92, * * * and that if the Parliament of Canada had authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject upon which it, might not legislate to the exclusion of provincial legislation. The same considerations appear to their Lordships to apply to two of the matters enumerated in s. 91, viz., the regulation of trade and commerce.\nEx facie the last sentence would almost seem to import that legislation properly held to fall within sec. 91 (2) of the B.N.A. Act must not trench upon the provincial field\u2014that Parliament cannot in an otherwise legitimate attempt \"to regulate trade and commerce\" legislate so as to affect matters with which a provincial legislature might deal in some other aspect as falling within \"property and civil rights.\" In The Insurance Act Reference[11], at page 309, I was disposed so to interpret his Lordship's language. But if that be its real meaning \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" would cease to be effective as an enumerated head of federal legislative jurisdiction. In the more recent decision of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[12], the partial interpretation put on head No. 2 of sec. 91 in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[13], was again approved and, while it was pointed out that the exclusive power to regulate trade and commerce thereby conferred must, like the expression\nproperty and civil rights in the province\nin sec. 92, receive a limited construction, it was held to\nenable the Parliament of Canada to prescribe to what extent the powers of companies the objects of which extend to the whole Dominion should be exercisable and what limitation should be placed on such powers. For if it be established that the Dominion Parliament can create such companies then it becomes a question of general interest throughout the Dominion in what fashion they should be permitted to trade. The clear effect of this last decision, I take it, is that s. 91 (2) retains its place and office as an enumerative head of federal legislative jurisdiction and that legislation authorized by its terms, properly construed, is not subject to the restrictions imposed on Dominion legislation that depends solely on the general \"peace, order and good government\" clause, but, on the contrary, is effective although it invades some field of jurisdiction conferred on the provinces by an enumerated head of s. 92.\nProbably the test by which it must be determined whether a given subject matter of legislation, prim\u00e2 facie ascribable to either, properly falls under s. 91 (2) or s. 92 (13) is this:\u2014Is it as primarily dealt with, in its true nature and character, in its pith and substance, (in the language of Viscount Haldane's judgment just quoted)\na question of general interest throughout the Dominion\nor is it (in Lord Watson's words in the Local Prohibition Case)\nfrom a provincial point of view of a local or private nature?\nIn order to be proper subjects of Dominion legislation under \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" it may well be that the matters dealt with must not only be such as would ordinarily fall within that description, but, if the legislation would otherwise invade the provincial field, must also be\nof general interest throughout the Dominion,\nor, in the language used by Lord Watson in The Local Prohibition Case (p. 361) in regard to legislation under the peace, order and good government clause upon matters not enumerated in s. 91, must be\nunquestionably of Canadian interest and importance. Mr. Justice Clement suggests this view in his valuable work on the Canadian Constitution (3 ed.), at pp. 448 and 688, and it may be that that was all Lord Atkinson intended when he said that the considerations applicable to the general powers of the Dominion Parliament supplementary to its enumerated powers apply also to the powers conferred on it under the head, \"The Regulation of Trade and Commerce.\" Otherwise I find it difficult to reconcile his views with those expressed in the Parsons Case[14], and in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[15].\nThe regulation of the quantities of \"necessaries of life\" that may be accumulated and withheld from sale and the compelling of the sale and disposition of them at reasonable prices throughout Canada is regulation of trade and commerce using those words in an ordinary sense. While the making of contracts for the sale and purchase of commodities is primarily purely a matter of \"property and civil rights,\" and legislation restricting or controlling it must necessarily affect matters ordinarily subject to provincial legislative jurisdiction, the regulation of prices of necessaries of life\u2014and to that the legislation under consideration is restricted\u2014may under certain circumstances well be a matter of national concern and importance\u2014may well affect the body politic of the entire Dominion. Moreover, \"necessaries of life\" may be produced in one province and sold in another. In the case of manufactured goods the raw material may be grown in or obtained from one province, may be manufactured in a second province and may be sold in several other provinces. Effective control and regulation of prices so as to meet and overcome in any one province what is generally recognized to be an evil\u2014\"profiteering\"\u2014an evil so prevalent and so insidious that in the opinion of many persons it threatens to-day the moral and social well-being of the Dominion\u2014may thus necessitate investigation, inquiry and control in other provinces. It may.be necessary to deal with the prices and the profits of the growers or other producers of raw material, the manufacturers, the middlemen and the retailers. No one provincial legislature could legislate so as to cope effectively with such a matter and concurrent legislation of all the provinces interested is fraught with so many difficulties in its enactment and in its administration and enforcement that to deal with the situation at all adequately by that means is, in my opinion, quite impracticable.\nViewed in this light it would seem that the impugned statutory provisions may be supported, without bringing them under any of the enumerative heads of s. 91, as laws made for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to matters not coming within any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, since, in so far as they deal with property and civil rights, they do so in an aspect which is not \"from a provincial point of view local or private\" and therefore not exclusively under provincial control.\n\"It must be borne in mind,\" says Lord Haldane in the recent case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[16], at page 339,\nin construing the two sections that matters which in a special aspect and for a particular purpose may fall within one of them may in a different aspect and for a different purpose fall within the other. In such cases the nature and scope of the legislative attempt of the Dominion or of the Province, as the case may be, have to be examined with reference to the actual facts if it is to be possible to determine under which set of powers it falls in substance and reality.\nThe legislation now under consideration must fall under the one set of powers or under the other, since\nthe powers distributed between the Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the other hand cover the whole area of self-government within the whole area of Canada. It would be subversive of the entire scheme and policy of the Act to assume that any point of internal self-government was withheld from Canada. Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[17], at page 581, per Loreburn L.C.\nAs put by Sir Montague Smith in Russell v. The Queen[18], at pages 839, 840:\nWhat Parliament is dealing with in legislation of this kind is not a matter in relation to property and its rights, but one relating to public order and safety. That is the primary matter dealt with, and though incidentally the free use of things in which men may have property is interfered with, that incidental interference does not alter the character of the law. Upon the same considerations, the Act in question cannot be regarded as legislation in relation to civil rights. In however large a sense these words are used, it could not have been intended to prevent the Parliament of Canada from declaring and enacting certain uses of property, and certain acts in relation to property, to be criminal and wrongful.\nAfter giving illustrations of laws designed for the promotion of public order, safety or morals which, nevertheless, prohibit certain uses of, and certain acts in relation to, property, his Lordship proceeds:\nFew, if any, laws could be made by Parliament for the peace, order and good government of Canada which did not in some incidental way affect property and civil rights; and it could not have been intended when assuring to the provinces exclusive legislative authority on the subjects of property and civil rights, to exclude the Parliament from the exercise of this general power whenever any such incidental interference would result from it. The true nature and character of the legislation in the particular instance under discussion must always be determined, in order to ascertain the class of subject to which it really belongs. Lord Fitzgerald in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Hodge v. The Queen[19], quoted extensively and with approval from the Russell judgment and referring to it and also to Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[20], said\nthat the principle which these cases illustrate is, that subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within sect. 92 may, in another aspect and for another purpose fall within sect. 91,\nand this is said, as the passages cited shew, in relation to the general Dominion power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada as well as in relation to matters falling clearly within some one of the enumerated heads of s. 91. Reference may also be made to Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[21], at page 587, and to the oft quoted language of Lord Watson in the Local Prohibition Case[22], at page 361.\nTheir Lordships do not doubt that some matters, in their origin local and provincial, might attain such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, and to justify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation or abolition in the interest of the Dominion.\nI ventured in the Insurance Act Reference[23], at page 310, to state what I conceive to be the result of the authorities on this particular point in these words:\nWhen a matter primarily of civil rights has attained such dimensions that it affects the body politic of the Dominion and has become of national concern it has in that aspect of it, not only ceased to be \"local and provincial\" but has also lost its character as a matter of \"civil rights in the province\" and has thus so far ceased to be subject to provincial jurisdiction that Dominion legislation upon it under the \"peace, order and good government\" provision does not trench upon the exclusive provincial field and is, therefore, valid and paramount.\nIn the judgment of the Privy Council on the same Reference[24], Lord Haldane said, at page 595: There is only one case, outside the heads enumerated in s. 91, in which the Dominion Parliament can legislate effectively as regards a province, and that is when the subject matter lies outside all the subject matters enumeratively entrusted to the province under sect. 92. Russell v. The Queen[25] is an instance of such a case.\nIt may be said that if the subject matter of the Dominion legislation here in question, when its true aspect and real purpose are considered, relates to public order, safety or morals, affects the body politic of the Dominion and is a matter of national concern, so that it can be supported under the general peace, order and good government provision of s. 91 without recourse to any of the enumerated heads, it is unnecessary and inadvisable to attempt to bring it under head No. 2. But while, as Lord Haldane said in The Insurance Case[26] at page 596, great caution must always be exercised in applying the well established principle that\nsubjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within Dominion legislative jurisdiction,\nhaving regard to the warning of Lord Watson in the Local Prohibition Case[27], at pages 360-1, that\nthe exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada, in regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91, ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92. To attach any other construction to the general power which, in supplement of its enumerated powers, is conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91 would, in their Lordships' opinion, not only be contrary to the intendment of the Act, but would practically destroy the autonomy of the provinces. If it were once conceded that the Parliament of Canada has authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion, in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject enumerated in s. 92 upon which it might not legislate to the exclusion of the provincial legislatures, I think it is better that legislation such as that with which we are now dealing, which undoubtedly affects what would ordinarily be subject matters of provincial jurisdiction, should, if possible, be ascribed to one of the enumerated heads of s. 91. I prefer, therefore, to rest my opinion upholding its constitutional validity on the power of the Dominion Parliament to legislate for \"the Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" as well as on its power\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada\nin regard to matters which, though not referable to any of the enumerated heads of s. 91, should, having regard to the aspect in which and the purpose for which they are dealt with, properly be held not to fall within any of the enumerated heads of s. 92\u2014to \"lie outside all the subject matters\" thereby \"entrusted to the province.\"\nThe carrying out of the Act now in question, as I have endeavoured to point out, will, in some of its phases, affect the inter-provincial trade and the foreign trade of Canada. It has to do with the general regulation of trade in necessaries of life throughout the Dominion. It would therefore seem to fall within the jurisdiction conferred by Head No. 2 as indicated in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[28], at pages 112-113.\nNo objection can successfully be founded upon the fact that the Board must exercise its powers from time to time in a particular province. Colonial Building Association v. Attorney General of Quebec[29]. The necessity of such local action and regulation is perhaps the chief justification for the delegation to a Board or Commission of the power to define what shall be unfair profits and unreasonable, and unjust prices. The unfairness of profits and the unreasonableness and injustice of prices, depends so largely on local conditions which vary from day to day and from place to place that Parliament could not itself deal with them by general legislation. Effective regulation of such matters can be accomplished only by some body such as the Board of Commerce endowed with the powers bestowed upon it and ready from time to time to deal promptly with the problems involved as they arise. Yet the power of Parliament to delegate its functions to the limited extent for which the Combines and Fair Prices Act provides has been challenged. We had occasion comparatively recently to consider and overrule a similar objection in Re Gray[30], at pp. 170, 175. Dealing with the power of a provincial legislature to confer on bodies of its own creation authority to make by-laws and regulations upon specific subjects and with the object of carrying an enactment of the legislature into effect, their Lordships of the Privy Council said in Hodge v. The Queen[31], at page 132:\nIt is obvious that such an authority is ancillary to legislation, and without it an attempt to provide for varying details and machinery to carry them out might become oppressive, or absolutely fail. The very full and very elaborate judgment of the Court of Appeal contains abundance of precedents for this legislation entrusting a limited discretionary authority to others, and has many illustrations of its necessity and convenience. It was argued at the bar that a legislature committing important regulations to agents or delegates effaces itself. That is not so. It retains its powers intact, and can, whenever it pleases, destroy the agency it has created and set up another, or take the matter directly into its own hands. How far it shall seek the aid of subordinate agencies, and how long it shall continue them, arc matters for each legislature, and not for courts of law, to decide. The Acts now under consideration involve no such abdication of legislative jurisdiction\u2014no such abrogation of the power of one of the integral constituents of the legislature as was attempted in recent Manitoba legislation held ultra vires by the Judicial Committee in Re the Initiative and Referendum Act[32], where such a limited delegation of legislative functions as was sanctioned in the Hodge Case[33] again received their Lordships' approval.\nHowever formidable may be the obstacles to the creation of a Dominion court of criminal jurisdiction presented by clause 27 of section 91 and clause 14 of section 92, of the B.N.A. Act, I see no valid objection to the constitution by our Parliament under s. 101 of a court to carry out the provisions of the Acts now before us designed for the regulation of trade and commerce; and the power to make an order such as that now under consideration, eliminating from it clauses (a) and (b) of the paragraph numbered 1, which are not supported, seems a reasonable and necessary jurisdiction to vest in such a body, in order that its administration may be effective. At all events, if Parliament is endowed with legislative jurisdiction to deal with the subject of profiteering under the head of \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" as a matter not substantially of local or provincial interest but affecting the well being, social, moral and economic, of the Dominion at large, there appears to be no tenable objection to its jurisdiction to confer on a court of its own creation power to restrain and prohibit contraventions of such regulations and restrictions, general or particular, within the purview of the statute, as it may be found necessary or proper to impose. Again it is objected that the proposed order is rather a local regulation than a restraining order. I think not. It will impose a behest nominatim on a number of individuals, firms and corporations who were first cited to appear before the Board and whose dealings with the subject matter of such behest were investigated by the Board. It is just as much an order within the contemplation of s. 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act as it would be if it were one of several similar documents dealing separately with each of the parties to be enjoined.\nNo valid objection to the provision for making such an order a rule, order or decree of a provincial superior court has, in my opinion, been presented. The machinery of the provincial court is to be utilized for a Dominion purpose. The power of Parliament to require this to be done is distinctly affirmed in Valin v. Langlois[34], and the express approval by this court of the following passage from the work of the late Mr. Lefroy on Legislative Powers in Canada, at page 510, in Re Vancini[35], at page 626, puts it beyond questionhere.\nThe Dominion Parliament can, in matters within its sphere, impose duties upon any subjects of the Dominion whether they be officials of provincial courts, other officials, or private citizens; and there is nothing in the British North America Act to raise a doubt about the power of the Dominion Parliament to impose new duties upon the existing provincial courts, or to give them new powers as to matters which do not come within the subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, or to deprive them of jurisdiction over such matters.\nThe authorities on this feature of the case are collected and discussed in Mr. Justice Clement's work, at p. 531.\nWe are for these reasons of the opinion that the power of Parliament to confer the authority, to the existence of which the questions in the stated case are directed, has not been successfully impugned and that the right of the Board of Commerce to make the proposed order, eliminating from it clauses (a) and (b) of the operative paragraph numbered 1, may be upheld as an exercise of authority validly bestowed under the jurisdiction of Parliament to make laws for \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" and for \"the peace, order and good government of Canada,\" and, in so far as the findings in its recitals are concerned, possibly also under Dominion legislative jurisdiction over \"The Criminal Law,\" although the investigation and the findings made thereon for the purpose of determining what are reasonable and just prices and of affording a foundation for an order prohibiting the making or taking of unfair profits and practices calculated to unfairly enhance costs or prices may not form part of a criminal cause or matter. Rex v. Manchester Profiteering Committee[36].\nWe would therefore answer both the questions of the stated case in the affirmative.\nIdington J.\u2014This is claimed to be a stated case pursuant to section 32 of the Board of Commerce Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n32. (1) The Board may, of its own notion, or upon the application of any party, and upon such security being given as it directs, or at the request of the Governor-in-Council, state a case, in writing, for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada upon any question which in the opinion of the Board, is a question of law or of jurisdiction.\n(2) The Supreme Court of Canada shall hear and determine such question or questions of law arising thereon, and remit the matter to the Board with the opinion of the Court thereon. This section is in substance the same as that appearing in the Railway Act as section 55 thereof and is evidently taken therefrom.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners in practice formulate a statement of facts which of course is binding upon us, and then submit the questions of law which they desire answered.\nThe party then appealing has charge of the conduct of the appeal, and same is argued out in a due and orderly manner, first by counsel for appellant and then by the counsel for respondent, as all appeals on a stated or special case submitted to this or any other appellate court have been heretofore treated.\nThe origin of such a mode of appeal need not be traced for many illustrations are to be found in various branches of both civil and criminal, and quasi-criminal, law.\nThe necessity for the statement of a concrete case seems to me to be almost self-evident, and at all events all relevant precedents I can find establish that.\nIt so happened that the Board of Commerce got seized of the idea that all it had to do was to submit questions to this court for its opinion relative to mere abstract points raised upon the construction of some sections of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, without stating any concrete case. And half a dozen such were presented.\nI was applied to as. Judge in Chambers and refused to recognize such right by making any formal order but suggested to the Registrar that he had better set the matter down to be brought under the notice of the full court at its then approaching sittings, and he did so. Upon its coming up there, it developed that there had been a number of questions raised by parties who had been before the Board.\nI insisted, for my part, that unless and until a stated concrete case was made in accord with the settled practice of the Railway Board, there should not be a hearing granted.\nThere appeared counsel for the Board of Commerce, which surprised me somewhat, and for the Attorney General for Canada and for a number of the parties concerned.\nA long discussion ensued resulting in the matter being left to all those so concerned to try and agree upon the selection of a case upon which argument could properly take place.\nThe case of the Ottawa Clothiers had been mentioned in the course of said discussion, as one in which all the questions desired to be raised had been therein raised before the Board, and another was suggested as equally important.\nPreviously to said sitting of this court, I had given leave to appeal in a concrete case from Winnipeg which I suggested might bring up much that it was desired to have this court pass upon.\nThe net result of the foregoing attempt to frame a suitable case, consisted of the so-called stated case submitted by the Board in the first place, with a brief typewritten memo, which was inserted therein, and after elaborate argument of counsel for all parties appearing before us, and due consideration of the non-observance of our demand, for a concrete case, it was determined by us to insist thereon. The decision in Re the County Council of Cardigan[37], was pointed to as a guide. The result is now before us in an alleged stated case in which instead of half a dozen questions as previously of a purely abstract character, we have presented to us to be answered, two questions relative to the jurisdiction to make a proposed order based upon what is alleged to be the finding of facts.\nThe latter are referred to as follows:\u2014\nAll evidence elicited was given subject to the jurisdiction of the Board to make any order consequent upon the inquiry and to the power of the Parliament of Canada to enact the legislation under which the inquiry was proceeding, counsel for the clothiers having formally protested such jurisdiction. At the conclusion of the sittings argument was heard on behalf of the clothiers and as well on behalf of the public, whereafter the Board took into consideration all matters, including the protest as to jurisdiction. The Board, upon the evidence before it, found as matters of fact the matters set forth in the recitals to the draft order which is Schedule \"B.\"\nThe recital thus referred to is as follows:\u2014\nIt appearing that heretofore and since the 7th day of July, 1919, sales by retail of the commodities Men's Ready-Made and Partly Ready-Made Suits and Overcoats (hereinafter referred to as \"commodities\") purchased by the retailer thereof at a cost of thirty dollars or under have, as a practice, been made within the city of Ottawa by the respective persons, firms and corporations hereinafter named (all being retailers of clothing within said city) at the same percentage of gross profit or margin to the retailer as the commodities purchased by him or them at a greater cost than thirty dollars, and that said persons, firms and corporations respectively have, since said 7th day of July, 1919, made and taken unfair profits upon sales of such commodities so purchased at a cost of thirty dollars or under and have not offered their respective stocks-in-trade of such immediately hereinbefore mentioned commodities (the same being necessaries of life as defined by section 16 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919), at prices not higher than were reasonable and just, the said unfair profits being profits greater than those hereinafter indicated as fair profits; and it further appearing that the conditions mentioned are not such as to call for prosecution, because the making or taking of such unfair profits was not in deliberate breach of or non-compliance with section 17 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, but was the result of the existence of a long standing practice of marking selling prices upon the basis of addition of arbitrary percentages for gross profit or margin to cost, which practice has been almost universal throughout Canada, was fair at the time of instituting it, but has become unfair and ought to have been varied by reduction of such percentages in consequence of continued substantial increases in basic costs causing an increased yield of profit, in terms of money, net as well as gross or margin; wherefrom the hereinbefore indicated offences against said section 17 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, resulted.\nThen follows the opinion of the Board thereon.\nI do not consider this, which deals with or is made to represent the result of an inquiry by the Board into the respective courses of business pursued by thirty-six different persons or firms or corporate companies carrying on business in Ottawa and are grouped together in one order, is either such a concrete case as was demanded or presented by way of an appeal as such a case should be.\nThe Board frames and presents the order.\nBy section 3 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, it is declared that the Board\nshall have the general administration of this Act which shall be read and constructed as one with The Board of Commerce Act.\nSection 18 of the same Act, which is the immediate authority upon which the proposed order must rest, if at all valid, by subsection (1) thereof provides as follows:\u2014\n18. (1) The Board is empowered and directed to inquire into and to restrain and prohibit,\u2014\n(a) any breach or non-observance of any provision of this Act;\n(b) the making or taking of unfair profits for or upon the holding or disposition of necessaries of life;\n(c) all such practices with respect to the holding or disposition of necessaries of life, as, in the opinion of the Board are designed or calculated to unfairly enhance the cost or price of such necessaries of life.\nThe only concrete facts presented to us are those above recited, presumably the result of the exercise of the powers and discharge of duties above set forth. There is no appellant named or indicated unless from the fact that a member of the Board appeared as counsel for the Attorney General for the Dominion, and opened the argument before us supporting the action of the Board.\nOn the application I have referred to, first coming before us, the Board was specifically represented by counsel for it; but none appeared on the last argument herein though the Board of Commerce Act, by subsection 7 specially provides for the Board being heard by counsel or otherwise on appeals such as this. Presumably this provision was made to overcome the possible effect of the case of Smith v. Butler[38], where the court held that the justices could not be heard in support of an appeal stated by them.\nSuch a case so presented without an appellant, I respectfully submit, should be dismissed.\nThe majority of the court hold that notwithstanding all the foregoing peculiar features of this case, as an appeal on a stated case, we must answer the questions submitted.\nTherefore, bowing to their opinion, I will proceed to deal therewith.\nOn the first argument the leading counsel who presented the case in its then condition seemed to rest the exercise of power in question as based upon the power of the Dominion Parliament over criminal law, and his junior as if based upon its power over trade and commerce.\nCounsel respectively for the firms or parties then concerned in the exercise of the power and for the Province of Alberta, each denying its existence, argued ably that we must look at the general purview of the whole Act to determine its character and by doing so urged that it could not be called legislation within the powers assigned Parliament relative to criminal law and hence must be held as an Act dealing with property and civil rights.\nThe elimination from the case, as first stated, of four of the questions thereby submitted has rendered much of the argument then considered necessary inapplicable to the case as it now stands before us.\nThe proposed order rests, upon subsections 1 and 2 of section 18, of which subsection 1 is above quoted, and the said subsection 2 is as follows:\u2014\n(2) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, an unfair profit shall be deemed to have been made when, pursuant to and after the exercise of its powers by this Act conferred, the Board shall declare an unfair profit to have been made, and an unfair enhancement of cost or price shall be such enhancement as has resulted from the making of an unfair profit.\nIndeed this sub-section (2) in the last analysis is that upon which it must rest.\nAssuming the ancient laws against forestalling, regrating and engrossing, which had long been treated as obsolete, and, being considered unsuited to a free people, were finally repealed in England by 7 & 8 Vict., ch. 24, yet may be existent in older parts of Canada or re-enacted as part of our criminal law, how can that help to maintain said section as being within the power of the Dominion Parliament which for its legislative authority must act within the power conferred by the British North America Act?\nIt seems to me that the enactment of section 22 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, coupled with much else therein, must have been passed by reason of an oversight of the limitations in the British North America Act, otherwise we would not be confronted with so much therein as seems, to say the least, of very questionable authority.\nI cannot imagine that Parliament really intended to invade the rights secured to the provinces to the extent that some of these enactments (of which section 18 is one) clearly do.\nSection 91 of the British North America Act provided as follows:\u2014\n91. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say:\u2014\nItem 27 of the enumeration reads as follows:\u2014\n27. The Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters.\nBy section 92 it is enacted as follows:\u2014\n92. In each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say,\u2014\nItem 14 of this enumeration reads as follows:\u2014\n14. The administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance, and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nThe Board is constituted a court of record. Its acts must be taken to be those of a court.\nHow can such a court, declared by the above quoted section 3 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act to have the general administration of that Act which is now in question, be held not to offend against these items, 27 of section 91, and 14 of section 92?\nThe constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction\nis expressly excluded by said item 27, and\nthe administration of justice in the province\nis, by the enacting part of section 92 and said item 14 thereof handed over exclusively to the legislature thereof.\nHow can the Board claim in face thereof any right to administer what it urges is criminal law?\nThe administration of procedure in criminal law is not by a single line or letter assigned to the Dominion.\nAll the power that is conferred on Parliament relative to procedure is to define the mode of procedure to be followed by the provincial courts in the administration of criminal law.\nIncluded in procedure, as heretofore interpreted, is the law of evidence which Parliament may declare.\nIt has never occurred to any one hitherto, that the conception of what would constitute relevant evidence should be something evolved by a court, constituted by Parliament first to inquire and declare what was a reasonable course of conduct on the part of any one of the classes of business men falling within the provisions of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, and then to warn, by virtue of section 18 thereof, those concerned where and how the line to regulate such course of conduct should be drawn in future; and then to inquire, after such warning had been given, whether any of those so warned had transgressed; and then, if any one found by the inquisition of the Board or its appointed examiners under section 19, by means of examining the accused, his employees and books, to have transgressed, the offender so found guilty may he handed over to the consideration of the Attorney General for the Province who, as well as the offenders, would be bound in duty duly to observe, under section 33 of the Board of Commerce Act, such findings of fact.\nThat section by sub-section 3 thereof provides as follows:\u2014\nThe finding or determination of the Board upon any question of fact within its jurisdiction shall be binding and conclusive.\nSuch is a fair outline of this new method of defining what may become evidence, and hence legislation within the meaning of item 27 of section 91 of the British North America Act relative to what is covered by the phrase therein\nbut including the procedure in criminal matters.\nThere is no other ground upon which, in a strictly legal sense, such provision can be upheld, than as falling within this reservation relative to matters of procedure.\nI submit respectfully that the closest examination, or most liberal interpretation, of these two items, 27 in section 91, and its counterpart in item 14 in section 92, of the British North America Act, preclude the possibility of making out of them anything which can maintain such a mixture of substantive \"criminal law,\" and law including the procedure in criminal matters, consistent with a due observance of the exclusion of power over\nthe constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction\ngiven by item 14 of section 92 to the provincial legislatures, or in any way to support or justify such legislation as in said section 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, on which ultimately the proposed order must rest. To do it justice the Board, or counsel for the Attorney General, failed to attempt to put forward such a direct method of dealing with the matter, though the section on which its proposed order must rest, for a basis, necessarily involves all I have set forth in light of the whole of the legislation in question.\nThe method of meeting so obvious a difficulty was to suggest that as relative to criminal law it was maintainable as ancillary thereto.\nThe British North America Act leave no room for any such distinction. And the same sort of argument was put forward in the case of Montreal Street Railway Co. v. Montreal[39], but rejected by a majority of this court, and we were upheld by the court above in the appeal taken therefrom by the decision in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Rly. Co.[40].\nThat decision, of course, stands as a declaration of principle for much more than is merely relative to what was directly involved therein. I, therefore, rely upon its adoption of a principle applicable in other regards, as well as upon its apt disposition of the ancillary argument for which there was much more reason for its application therein than there is herein.\nIn default of that argument maintaining the jurisdiction of the Board, counsel falls back upon the provision in section 101 of the British North America Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance, and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada. By virtue of that section this court was constituted; and, by virtue of the last part thereof, the Court of Exchequer and the Board of Railway Commissioners were created.\nEach of these lastly mentioned courts was constituted as an additional court for the better administration of the laws of Canada, and in no way, in actual practice, did they interfere with provincial rights save when straining the power given, as in the Montreal case just cited.\nIt is conceivable that within the powers thus assigned the Dominion Parliament, it might\nfor the better administration of the laws of Canada\ni.e., laws enacted by that Parliament, create many such courts.\nIt is inconceivable to me how, when the relative powers of Parliament and provincial legislatures are so tersely dealt with and definitely expressed, as they are by the items of sections 91 and 92 which I have already quoted, Parliament can properly constitute any additional courts for the purpose in question herein.\nIn relation to many of the subjects enumerated in section 91 over which the Dominion Parliament is given plenary powers, the constitution by it of additional courts is quite conceivable, as within the scope of section 101, and is also clearly necessarily so, in relation to the government of territories not given a provincial legislature or the status of a province, and all implied therein.\nBut whilst the administration of justice thereunder may rest with the Dominion Parliament, how can the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction or any part of the administration of justice relative thereto be assigned by Parliament in anything relative to the criminal law when so expressly excluded on the one hand regarding the constitution of courts, and all that which is relative to the administration of justice, so far as regards the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction is, on the other hand, so expressly assigned to the respective provincial legislatures.\nYet these enactments now in question, presume to hand over the greater part of the administration of what is claimed to be criminal law to the Board of Commerce. Not only that but do it in such a manner as is quite repugnant to the ideals of British law and justice, as well exemplified in the recent case of Law v. Chartered Institute[41].\nThis enactment which we have under consideration constitutes the Board of Commerce the sole investigator, the sole prosecutor, and the judge to determine the facts it has discovered, or imagines it has discovered, and only when the Board deems proper accused is to be handed over to have the formal part of rendering judgment duly executed. And, as if to let nothing escape its grasp, the Board has delegated to it the power to make further regulations as set forth below.\nI suspect that the clear separation of the legislative power from the administration of its products in relation to criminal law was not born of accident but design, on the part of the astute men who framed the British North America Act. Many obvious reasons existed for doing so. The substantial racial differences between Upper and Lower Canada (now respectively Ontario and Quebec) must never be forgotten if justice is to be done in operating the British North America Act. Then failing to find that source of jurisdiction available, the argument in support of the proposed order fell back upon the old forlorn hope, so many times tried, unsuccessfully, upon this court and the court above, of item 2 of section 91 of the British North America Act, which empowers Parliament to deal with \"the regulation of trade and commerce.\"\nThe scope and purpose of this power has so often been referred to in numerous cases, that I hardly think it necessary to repeat what has so often been said in that regard.\nI doubt if it has ever been heretofore relied upon in support of such an extravagant claim as this put forward herein.\nTo regulate the prices charged in the tailor shop, or the corner grocery, needs a power which has not only the limited powers of Parliament but also all that is comprehended in the item 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act, which gives exclusively to provincial legislatures the power to make laws in relation to \"property and civil rights in the province.\"\nWhat is this power so assigned to each of the provincial legislatures worth, if it can be effectually wiped out by the Dominion Parliament enacting a so-called criminal law and supplementing it by such legislation as before us, including the large delegation of legislative power given by section 39 of the Board of Commerce Act which reads as follows:\u2014\n39. Any rule, regulation, order or decision of the Board shall, when published by the Board, or by the leave of the Board, for three weeks in the Canada Gazette, and while the same remains in force, have the like effect as if enacted in this Act, and all courts shall take judicial notice thereof. Is there any sumptuary law or socialistic conception of organized society which could not be made to fall within the power of Parliament, by the same process of reasoning as must be resorted to, in order to maintain the right of the Board to make the proposed order?\nOur Confederation Act was not intended to be a mere sham, but an instrument of government intended to assign to the provincial legislatures some absolute rights, and of these none were supposed to be more precious than those over property and civil rights.\nThe case of Citizen's Ins. Co. v. Parsons[42], at an early date in our system of Federal Government decided in effect, by the principle expressly and impliedly adopted therein, much more than appears on the superficial aspects thereof relative to the contractual powers falling within civil rights. Its implications have been maintained in many well known ways by numerous decisions needless to cite.\nThe case of Vancini v. The King[43], so much relied on, not only binds us but in the result reached I fully agree; yet I fail to see how that or any of the decisions in the cases cited on behalf of the Board's power, at all help to support its pretension in question herein; unless that in the case of Getter v. Loughrin[44], which does not bind us. If there was much resemblance between the legislation in question in that case and this, I might find it necessary to say something, but I fail to find any close resemblance.\nIndeed there is, I venture to say, no judicial authority maintaining such legislation. The counsel for the Attorney General of the Dominion in his opening on the first argument, referred to certain remarks made by me in the case of Weidman v. Schragg[45], at page 22, and repeats the reference in his supplemental factum as if supporting his contention. I was therein attempting to properly appreciate the scope of section 498 of the Criminal Code as then in force. I still adhere to all I therein expressed, not only in its immediate bearing upon the issue presented for consideration therein, but, if I may be permitted to say so, in a much wider sense lying within the power of Parliament to deal effectively with, not only by way of the criminal law but also that bearing upon its power over patents and of incorporating companies and the limitations it can impose relative to their operative results.\nI fail to see, however, that what I had there in mind (and beyond, relative to which I did not give expression of judicial opinion) can in any way help to maintain such legislation as before use.\nParliament has, in its residual power for the \"peace, order and good government of Canada,\" both legislatively and administratively, a plenary power over territory not yet given the status of a province.\nYet default satisfactory authority for the maintenance of the remarkable legislation, now in question in relation to those dwelling in one of the provinces, the residual power of Parliament was invoked.\nWhatever may be said and must be admitted, relative to the proper exercise of any of the enumerated powers conferred on Parliament being likely to touch incidentally and necessarily upon property and civil rights within a province, there the power to do so ends. I deny its existence in the residual power of Parliament, save in the extreme necessity begotten of war conditions, or in manifold ways that do not touch provincial rights.\nThe war had ended when the legislation now in question was enacted.\nIt is one of the many curious things relative to these Acts that there seems so much difficulty on the part of those who ought to know in assigning them, or parts of them, to the exact power that is sought to be exercised thereby.\nIt generally happens that amendments to the criminal law are presented as such and the clear purposes and powers had in view are, therefore, thereby well understood.\nIn this instance, if so designed, those sections which form Part 2 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, save section 20 expressly excluded, I respectfully submit should have found a place in the chapter of important amendments to the Criminal Code passed in the same session, assented to same day, and forming the very next chapter of the statutes. And, not having done so, coupled with the curious blending of that which is intra vires with what is ultra vires of Parliament, gives rise to many questions we have not to answer, yet renders any consideration of these we are asked to answer rather confusing.\nCounsel for Alberta submits a recent decision in Rex v. Manchester Profiteering Committee[46], upon an analogous statute in England, where it was held that the legislation there in question, though dealing with the fixing of prices and affixing penalties for breaches of the order determining same, was not criminal law, is a very important one when we apply it to what may be possible for provincial legislatures to enact within their powers over property and civil rights.\nIn that connection it tends to demonstrate that all that is proposed by the form of order presented herein is quite within the powers of the provincial legislatures to enact and hence not within any of the powers assigned to the Dominion.\nHowever that may be we are confronted with section 22 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act which enacts as follows:\u2014\n22. (1) Any person who contravenes or fails to observe any of the provisions of this Part of this Act other than section twenty shall be guilty of an indictable offence and liable upon indictment or upon summary conviction under Part XV of the Criminal Code to a penalty not exceeding five thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years or to both fine and imprisonment as specified, and any director or officer of any company or corporation who assents to or acquiesces in the contravention or non-observance by such company or corporation of any of the said provisions shall be guilty of such offence personally and cumulatively with his company or corporation and with his co-directors or associate officers.\n(2) For the purposes of the trial of any indictment for any offence against this part of this Act, section five hundred and eighty-one of the Criminal Code, authorizing speedy trials without juries, shall apply.\nThere cannot be a doubt surely of the intention that this enactment should be held part of the criminal law however absurd some of the consequences may be.\nFor example, under section 18, if the Board failed to observe any of its provisions, it must be held liable to be indicted and punished according to the terms of the enactment.\nSuch like complications may arise in applying section 22 to other sections, save section 20, in same part 2 of the Act. This sort of legislation is characteristic of much more in these two Acts to be administered by the Board of Commerce.\nFortunately we have only to pass upon section 18 and answer one question, if concluding, as I do, for the reasons assigned above, that it is ultra vires the Dominion Parliament and infringes upon the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial legislatures, over property and civil rights, and over the administration of justice in the province including\nthe constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction\nas above set forth.\nHence I say \"No\" in answer to the first question Has the Board lawful authority to make the order?\nAnd, as an obvious consequence of that answer, the second needs no answer.\nAs I am unable to find an appellant who has prosecuted this so-called appeal, I cannot suggest imperatively who should pay the costs.\nThe Attorney General for the Dominion had the same right, as of course, to intervene and be heard in argument on so grave a constitutional question, as has always been accorded by this court, in the like cases, to him and provincial attorneys general.\nBut I cannot in the case before us hold him to have been the appellant.\nThis is another illustration of how futile this whole proceeding has been, and how far it has fallen short of what is required in a stated case. To illustrate further what I have advanced I imagine the order proposed might be held quite valid if dealing with traders in Dawson City in the Yukon, over which Parliament has plenary power, but not when dealing with traders in Ottawa, which is part of the Province of Ontario.\nDuff J;\u2014The scope of the authority arising under sec. 91-(2) of the B.N.A. Act has been much discussed. No precise definition of that authority has of course been given or even attempted; nevertheless, it has for 40 years been a settled doctrine that the words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" as they appear in that item cannot be read in the sense which would be ordinarily ascribed to them if they appeared alone and unaffected by a qualifying context. To adopt the language of Lord Hobhouse in the case of The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[47] at page 586.\nit has been found absolutely necessary that the literal meaning of the words should be restricted in order to afford scope for powers which are given exclusively to the provincial legislatures,\nand some definite limiting rules are deducible from the decided cases.\nIn the Parsons Case[48], it was held that\nthis authority does not comprehend the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade in a single province\nthe particular business or trade there under consideration being the business of fire insurance.\nIn Hodge v. The Queen[49], the authority given to the Provinces by item 9 of sec. 92 to make laws with respect to licenses for raising a revenue for provincial purposes was considered sufficient to enable a province to regulate within its own boundaries the manner in which a particular trade is to be carried on and in the judgment delivered upon the reference touching the validity of the Liquor License Act of 1883, commonly known as the McCarthy Act, it was held that the authority of the Dominion in relation to trade and commerce did not include authority to regulate a particular trade by a licensing system applicable to the whole Dominion. And again on the reference upon the subject of the Dominion Insurance Act in 1916, Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta[50], this decision was affirmed and it was decided that the Dominion Insurance Act professing to regulate the business of insurance by a single system of licensing governing the whole of Canada could not be supported as an exercise of the Dominion legislative power in relation to trade and commerce.\nThe decisions of the Judicial Committee in the two last-mentioned cases appear to have been the logical result of the decision in Hodge's Case[51], for although it is quite true that after all proper modifications of the natural meaning of the words used in the respective enumerations in secs. 91 and 92 have been made (by a comparison of the enumerations with each other in accordance with the well known doctrine in Parson's Case[52] at pages 108-9, there must still be considerable overlapping of the domains ascribed to the Dominion and the Provinces respectively by these enumerations; this is not because the provinces are authorized by sec. 92 to trench upon the subject matters strictly comprised within the enumerated items of sec. 91 (to pass laws for example which could be described as \"railway legislation strictly so called,\" Canadian Pacific Rly. Co. v. Bonsecours[53], or legislation dealing with the subject matter of fisheries or a bankruptcy law or a copyright law, Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Ontario[54]), but because the Dominion for the purpose of giving effect to a legislative scheme properly failing within the authority of one or more of the enumerated heads of sec. 91 may in order to prevent the defeat of the scheme enact proper ancillary provisions upon matters falling under some of the heads of sec. 92, Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General of Ontario54.\nIt is, of course, an important principle that legislation which for one aspect and for one purpose falls within the authority conferred by sec. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within the authority conferred by sec. 91, but where the question concerns the scope of the enumerated heads of sec. 91 it is in the sense just indicated that this principle must be understood. It cannot be applied in such a way, as Lord Herschell said in the decision in the Fisheries case just referred to, as to enable a provincial legislature to legislate in respect of the matters which fall strictly within one of the specified classes enumerated in sec. 91. Therefore the decision in Hodge's Case[55], appears to have involved the conclusion that the kind of regulation which the Judicial Committee there held to be competent to a provincial legislature, was not the kind of regulation which is exclusively committed to the Dominion Parliament by the second enumerated head of sec. 91; and it would only be a corrollary of this to hold that the Dominion could not by enacting a law professing to put into effect the same kind of regulation in each province, legitimately appropriate a field belonging to one of the enumerated specific classes of sec. 92; and this is what was decided upon the Reference touching the validity of the McCarthy Act. In Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta[56], Lord Haldane speaking for the Judicial Committee said:\u2014\nBut in Hodge v. The Queen[57], the Judicial Committee had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the local licensing system which the Ontario statute sought to set up was within provincial powers. It was only the converse of this proposition to hold, as was done subsequently by this Board though without giving reasons, that the Dominion licensing statute known as the McCarthy Act, which sought to establish a local licensing system for the liquor traffic throughout Canada, was beyond the powers conferred on the Dominion Parliament by s. 91.\nBy parity of reasoning it seems to follow as a result of Parson's Case[58] that legislation regulating the contracts of a particular business or trade is not the kind of regulation which is exclusively committed to Parliament by that provision of sec. 91 now under discussion and consequently that it is not competent to the Dominion to regulate such contracts in each Province by legislation applicable to all of the provinces.\nAgain in the Montreal Street Railway Case[59], a Dominion enactment purporting to regulate local railways in respect of through traffic, that is to say traffic passing from a Dominion to a local line and vice versa, was held to be ultra vires and it was decided that the authority conferred by item No. 2 of sec. 91 could not be legitimately exercised in regulating the management of \"local works or undertakings\" of the kind committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the province by item No. 10 of sec. 92. In Parson's Case[60], at pages 112 and 113 appears the well known elucidation of the language of No. 2 of sec. 91 by Sir Montague Smith. In the Montreal Street Railway Case[61] at page 344, the substance of this passage is adopted by the Judicial Committee; and again in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[62], at page 340, Lord Haldane speaking for the Judicial Committee said:\u2014\nTheir Lordships find themselves in agreement with the interpretation put by the Judicial Committee in Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons60, at pages 112 and 113, on head 2 of s. 91, which confers exclusive power on the Dominion Parliament to make laws regulating trade.\nTurning then to the exposition in Parson's Case60, thus adopted in 1912 and 1915, we find (in addition to the negative proposition that the authority in question does not comprehend the power to enact minute regulations in respect of a particular trade), 1st that the context affords an indication that \"regulations relating to general trade and commerce\" were in the mind of the legislature, and 2nd that matters embraced by these words would include\npolitical, arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of Parliament; regulation of trade in matters of interprovincial concern\nand possibly\ngeneral regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion.\nIt is not easy to ascribe a precise meaning to the words \"general trade and commerce\" but the passage seems to imply that the words \"trade and commerce\" are to be read conjunctively or at all events that the word \"trade\" takes on a special colour and significance from its association with the word \"commerce\"; and whatever be the precise significance of the word \"general\" we are at least able to affirm in consequence of the decisions already mentioned that it excludes regulations such as those which were in question in Hodge's Case[63], in the McCarthy Act reference, in Parson's Case[64], and in the Montreal Street Railway Case[65]. To borrow a phrase used arguendo on the Liquor License appeal, Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada \"general\" in this passage means\ngeneral not as including all particulars but general as distinguished from some particulars.\nIn the Montreal Street Railway Case65, at page 344, it was laid down in effect that the authority to deal with trade and commerce ought not to be so construed and applied as to enable the Parliament of Canada to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest and in particular in relation to matters which in each province are comprehended within the subject matters assigned to the province by No. 10 of sec. 92, viz., \"local works and undertakings.\"\nIn addition to these negative and limiting rules a recent decision, Wharton's Case[66], affords an illuminating example of the application of the considerations mentioned in Parson's Case64. It was there held that companies incorporated under the residuary power arising under sec. 91, having the status of corporations throughout the Dominion generally might properly be subjects of regulation under No. 2 of sec. 91 in the sense that Parliament in the exercise of the authority thereby conferred might prescribe the extent to which such companies should be entitled to trade in any of the provinces. That is entirely consistent with the proposition laid down in Parson's Case[67], that the authority of Parliament under the heading mentioned is an authority to pass regulations in relation to \"general\" trade and commerce. For the regulation in question in Wharton's Case[68], was not a regulation relating to any particular kind of trade or business, but a regulation touching the trading powers of all Dominion Companies engaged in any kind of business and applying to all such companies alike and thus at least potentially affecting Dominion trade and commerce in general through one of its most important instrumentalities.\nComing to the consideration of the Combines and Fair Prices Act; and particularly section 18 of that Act under which the order in dispute has been made. The jurisdiction of the Board under this section falls broadly into two sub-divisions, first the jurisdiction to make orders prohibiting the accumulation of articles to which the statute applies or the withholding from sale at reasonable prices of any such articles in excess of the amount reasonably required for domestic purposes, or for the ordinary purposes of business, and secondly the jurisdiction to regulate profits; that is to say to declare what constitutes an unfair profit upon the holding or disposition of such articles, to prohibit the making or taking of such profits and to prohibit any practice which in the opinion of the Board has a tendency to enhance the cost of such articles, or the profits rising from the holding or the disposition of them, or the price of them. As regards the first head of jurisdiction, the authority of the Board extends to traders and non-traders alike, to persons accumulating by means of purchase or by means of production, to articles accumulated whether by means of production or otherwise, for domestic use or for use for the ordinary purposes of business. For example it applies to accumulations by the house-holder of articles of food produced by the house-holder himself, the small farmer's pork and butter, as well as to his cordwood. It applies to the stock of coal accumulated by a railway or shipping company, or of coal or coke by a gas company or a smelting company, as well as to the coal accumulated by a coal mining company or the gas produced by a gas company; to the dairyman's as well as to the rancher's herd.\nIn so far as the Act authorizes the Board of Commerce to compel persons who are not engaged in trade to dispose of their property subject to conditions fixed by the Board and persons who are traders to dispose of property in respect of which they are not engaged in trade, (the coal of the railway company or of the gas company, the dairyman's herd for example), I have not a little difficulty in classifying it as an enactment relating to the matters comprised within section 91-(2), upon any fair construction of the words \"regulation of Trade and Commerce.\" It is legislation effecting trade and commerce no doubt, but I am unable to distinguish such an enactment from an enactment authorizing a Board established by Parliament to take over such property on terms to be fixed by the Board and to dispose of it itself. Such compulsory enactments seem to be enactments on the subject of the rights of property, 92-(13) and \"local undertakings,\" 92-(10) rather than enactments in regulation of trade and commerce.\nTurning now to the authority vested in the Board by section 18, in relation to profits and prices. The provisions of section 18 on this subject appear to be obnoxious to the principles laid down in the passages referred to in Parson's Case[69], the Montreal Street Railway Case[70], and the Wharton Case[71]. The authority given to the Board is an authority to prohibit the making or taking of unfair profits upon the holding or disposition of any articles to which the statute applies, and the section provides,\nthat an unfair profit shall be deemed to have been made, when the Board shall declare an unfair profit to be made.\nIt is thus left to the Board to make orders affecting individual holders or traders, to fix the terms upon which they are required to dispose of articles withheld from disposition or held for disposition, and such terms the Board is not required to fix by any general regulation, but may, and in the normal course would, fix them with reference to the circumstances of a particular case. The fixing of the terms of disposition by reference to the prohibition against unfair profits might well result in great disparity between the prices charged for the same article by different traders. The creation of an authority endowed with such powers of fixing the terms of contracts in relation to specific articles appears to involve an interpretation of the words, \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" much more comprehensive than anything contemplated by the decisions and judgments referred to above. I have indicated the principle which in my opinion is deducible from Parson's Case[72], namely that section 91-(2) does not authorize an enactment by the Dominion Parliament regulating in each of the provinces the terms of the contracts of a particular business or trade, for the reason (put very broadly) that such legislation involves an interposition in the transactions of individuals in the provinces, within the sphere of\nproperty and civil rights and local undertakings\nnot contemplated by section 91-(2). Legislation, for example, imposing upon the trade in ready-made clothing throughout Canada, the prohibitions put into force by the order out of which this reference arises would, if my view of the effect of Parson's Case72 be the right view, pass beyond the scope of the authority given in 91-(2); an enactment, that is to say, by the Dominion Parliament in the precise words of the order now in question could not be supported under that head. I cannot discover any principle consistent with these conclusions, upon which an enactment delegating to a commission the authority to regulate the terms of particular contracts of individual traders in a specified commodity according to the views of the Board as to what may be fair between the individual trader and the public in each transaction, can be sustained as an exercise of that power; and if such legislation could not be supported when the subject dealt with is a single commodity, or the trade in a single commodity, or a single group of commodities, how can jurisdiction be acquired so to legislate by extending the scope of the legislation and bringing a large number of specified trades or commodities within its sweep? Every consideration which can be invoked in support of the view that the authority to regulate by general regulations of uniform application the contracts of a trade in one commodity, does not fall within section 91-(2), can properly be brought to bear with I think increased force in impeaching legislation of the character now in question.\nThe point may be illustrated by reference to the provincial jurisdiction concerning Local Works and Undertakings. The power given to the Board by section 18, is a power to interfere with the management of local undertakings in respect of all the matters mentioned, accumulation, withholding from sale, making and taking profits, from holding or selling, prices, cost, and practices affecting prices and cost. The authority extends to such undertakings for example, as coal mines and gas works. Electricity does not fall within the definition of section 16, but could I think be brought within the jurisdiction of the Board by a regulation passed under that section. Section 19 shows that such undertakings are within the contemplation of section 18, and in Union Colliery Co. v. Brydon[73], at page 585, it was laid down that coal mines are local undertakings within 92-(10).\nIt is necessary to observe that we are not dealing with a statute clearly within one of the enumerated heads of section 91, and only incidentally affecting local undertakings, or other matters committed to the province. The normal operation of section 18, being such as I have pointed out, namely through the instrumentality of orders made by the Board directly against individuals and particular undertakings, and based upon conclusions derived from a consideration of the circumstances of each particular case, it becomes plain that what is contemplated is a direct interference by the Board, in respect of the matters committed to its jurisdiction, in the management of such undertakings, the property held in connection with them and the contracts made by their proprietors. Let us take as instances, coal mines and gas works. The authority given to the Board to fix the rate of profit, to prohibit accumulation beyond the amount which in the opinion of the Board may reasonably be required for the purposes of the business, to prohibit practices which in the opinion of the Board enhances costs or profits, is essentially an authority to interfere with the management of undertaking A, undertaking B, and undertaking C, notwithstanding that the authority is given in general terms, and therefore the legislation creating that authority is not legislation merely affecting such undertakings but legislation in relation to such undertakings; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Bonescours[74], at page 372; Montreal v. Montreal Street Ry. Co.[75] at page 346.\nIt may be conceded that while section 18 could in its very terms be validly enacted by a provincial legislature, the authority reposed in a Commission created by such a legislature, would not of course extend beyond the ambit of authority committed to the legislature itself and consequently such a Commission would not acquire power to deal with matters belonging to the subjects of foreign trade, inter-provincial trade, and the regulating of the management of Dominion undertakings and beyond the legitimate scope of the legislative activities of the province; but it does not follow because the Dominion could alone deal with these last mentioned matters it is itself authorized to enter upon fields exclusively reserved for the provinces, in order to carry out a legislative design necessarily incomplete without legislation on matters so exclusively reserved; co-operation between the Dominion and the provinces may be necessary to attain the ends desired by the legislators and such co-operation is of course not unknown and has indeed in some cases been expressly provided for in Dominion legislation, see for example 9 & 10 Geo. V., chapter 68, section 373, sub-section 6.\nHaving regard then to the scope of section 18, the authority conferred upon the Board to interfere with the proprietary rights of producers, holders and consumers of any of the articles to which the Act applies, and the authority to interfere with the management of local works and undertakings, and to prescribe the conditions of contracts relating to such articles and to the manner in which the Act takes effect, I conclude that it is not an enactment in relation to trade and commerce within section 91-(2).\nThe second question is whether section 18 can be sustained as an exercise of the power of the Dominion under the introductory clause of section 91 to\nmake laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nTwo conditions govern the legitimate exercise of this power. First\u2014it is essential that the matter dealt with shall be one of unquestioned Canadian interest and importance as distinguished from matters merely local in one of the provinces; and, secondly, that the legislation shall not trench upon the authority of the province in respect of the matters enumerated in section 92. Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[76], Montreal v. Montreal Street Ry. Co.[77], at pages 343 and 344; Wharton's Case[78], at page 337. I have already pointed out that section 18 does profess to deal with matters which in each province are, from the provincial standpoint, rights of property and civil rights there and matters which, in each province, are comprehended within the subject matter \"local undertakings.\"\nIt is true that in Russell v. The Queen[79], the Canada Temperance Act was held to be validly enacted under this general power and that in Local Option Reference (1), and in the Manitoba License Holders' Case[80], the enactment of similar legislation was held to be competent to a local legislature, the legislation being, of course, limited in its operation, to the province; but it is I think impossible to draw from these authorities on the \"drink\" legislation any general principle which can serve as a guide in passing upon the validity of the statute before us.\nRussell's Case79 was accepted by the Judicial Committee in 1896, as decisively determining the validity of the Canada Temperance Act and to that extent it was treated as a binding authority.\nBut it must be remembered that Russell's Case79, was in great part an unargued case. Mr. Benjamin who appeared for the appellant\u2014the provinces were not represented upon the argument\u2014conceded the authority of Parliament to enact legislation containing the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act to come into force at the same time throughout the whole of Canada and this Lord H\u00e9rschell said in a subsequent case, was a \"very large admission.\" The Judicial Committee proceeded upon the view that legislation containing the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act was not, from a provincial point of view, legislation relating to \"property and civil rights\" within the province; it was, they said, legislation dealing rather with public wrongs, having a close relation to criminal law and on this ground they held that the subject matter of it did not fall within the exceptions to the introductory clause.\nThe subsequent judgments of the Judicial Committee in the Local Option Reference of 1896[81] and in the Manitoba License Holders' Case[82] show that consistently with the validity of the Canada Temperance Act similar legislation by the provinces limited in its operation to the province, can be supported as being from a provincial point of view legislation dealing with matters merely local. In the last mentioned case Lord Macnaghten said it might be doubtful whether if such legislation were from the provincial point of view properly classified as legislation upon the subjects denoted by \"property and civil rights,\" general legislation by the Dominion such as the Canada Temperance Act could be sustained.\nThere is no case of which I am aware in which a Dominion statute not referable to one of the classes of legislation included in the enumerated heads of sec. 91 and being of such a character that from a provincial point of view, it should be considered legislation dealing with \"property and civil rights,\" has been held competent to the Dominion under the introductory clause; and the effect of decisions in the Mont- real Street Railway case, or the McCarthy Act Reference and in the Insurance Act Reference, Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta[83], is that legislation by the Dominion applying to the whole of Canada dealing with matters which from a provincial point of view fall within No. 9 or No. 10 of sec. 92, is not a competent exercise of this general power.\n\"Property and civil rights,\" of course, taken in the most comprehensive sense, is a phrase of very wide application and like the words \"Trade and Commerce,\" it must be restricted by reference to the context and the other provisions of sections 91 and 92. But my view is that where a subject matter is from a provincial point of view comprehended within the class of subjects falling under \"property and civil rights,\" properly construed (ex hypothesi such matter could not fall strictly within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 91) it is incompetent to the Dominion in exercise of the authority given by the introductory clause to legislate upon that matter either alone or together with subjects over which the Dominion has undoubted jurisdiction as falling neither within sec. 92 nor within the enumerated heads of sec. 91; and legislation which in effect has this operation cannot be legitimised by framing it in comprehensive terms embracing matters over which the Dominion has jurisdiction as well as matters in which the jurisdiction is committed exclusively to the provinces.\nNor do I think it matters in the least that the legislation is enacted with the view of providing a remedy uniformly applicable to the whole of Canada in relation to a situation of general importance to the Dominion. The ultimate social economic or political aims of the legislator cannot I think determine the category into which the matters dealt with fall in order to determine the question whether the jurisdiction to enact it is given by sec. 91 or sec. 92. The immediate operation and effect of the legislation, or the effect the legislation is calculated immediately to produce must alone, I think, be considered. I repeat that if, tested by reference to such operation and effect, the legislation does deal with matters which from a provincial point of view are within any of the first fifteen heads of section 92, it is incompetent to the Dominion unless it can be supported as ancillary to legislation under one of the enumerated heads of section 91.\nThis view may be supported by contrasting the decision of the Judicial Committee in Russell's Case[84], with its decision on the McCarthy Act reference. The Canada Temperance Act was an attempt on the part of the Parliament of Canada to cope with the evils arising from the sale of intoxicating liquor, and that Act as already mentioned was held to be within the power of Parliament as dealing not with civil rights and property but with public wrongs, and being legislation analogous in character to the statute restricting the sale of explosives and poisons and having a close relation to the criminal law. The McCarthy Act which was passed shortly after the decision in Russell's Case84, recited that it was expedient to regulate the traffic in intoxicating liquors by a system uniform throughout Canada for the purpose of preserving public order, and then proceeded to regulate the liquor trade by a system of licensing. This decision, as already mentioned, was a logical consequence of the preceding decision of the Board in Hodge's Case[85], to the effect that from a provincial point of view such a system of licensing fell within number 9 of section 92. The combined effect of these decisions seems clearly to be that while for the purpose of dealing with a matter of interest to the whole Dominion in the sense of being a matter affecting and pertaining to the public order and good government of the whole Dominion (the evils of the liquor trade), Parliament may legislate so long as its enactments are of such a character that they do not deal with matters from a provincial point of view within the specific classes of subjects enumerated in section 92, (that is, the first fifteen heads) it is not within its power under the residuary clause to enact legislation which from the provincial point of view falls within any one of such classes. It is quite true that the McCarthy Act Reference principally involved a consideration of only one of the enumerated heads, No. 9, but it is difficult to find any satisfactory relevant distinction between No. 9 and No. 10 (as regards matters falling under this head, the Montreal Street Railway Case[86], seems to be conclusive), or between No. 9 and No. 13, although as regards the last mentioned head, caution must be used in observing the limits necessarily imposed by the context in the two sections upon the scope of their application.\nThe argument based upon the residuary clause rests upon the principles supposed to be deducible from the decisions upon the liquor legislation. The result of the decisions of the Judicial Committee in Russell's Case[87], on the Local Option Reference in 1896, and the Manitoba License Holders Case, in 1902 (1), is that while the restriction or prohibition of the liquor traffic in the manner effected by the Canada Temperance Act within a single province, may from a provincial point of view fall within No. 16, it may also fall within the ambit of the residuary clause as subject matter of legislation; but there is in my judgment no justification for applying the reasoning of their Lordships in their judgments in the Local Option Reference, in support of the proposition that matters falling within any of the other heads of section 92 as subject matter of legislation can be dealt with by the Dominion under a general law passed under the authority of the residuary clause, and the doubt expressed by Lord Macnaghten in the Manitoba License Holders Case[88] affords very weighty argument against such an interpretation of Lord Watson's judgment on the Local Option Reference.\nThe consequences of this proposed view of the residuary clause, can be illustrated by the present legislation. The scarcity of necessaries of life, the high cost of them, the evils of excessive profit taking, are matters affecting nearly every individual in the community and affecting the inhabitants of every locality and every province collectively as well as the Dominion as a whole. The legislative remedy attempted by section 18 is one of many remedies which might be suggested. One could conceive, for example, a proposal that there should be a general restriction of credits, and that the business of money lending should be regulated by a commission appointed by the Dominion Government with powers conferred by Parliament. Measures to increase production might conceivably be proposed and to that end nationalization of certain industries and even compulsory allotment of labour. In truth if this legislation can be sustained under the residuary clause, it is not easy to put a limit to the extent to which Parliament through the instrumentality of commissions (having a large discretion in assigning the limits of their own jurisdiction, see sec. 16), may from time to time in the vicissitudes of national trade, times of high prices, times of stagnation and low prices and so on, supersede the authority of the provincial legislatures. I am not convinced that it is a proper application of the reasoning to be found in the judgments on the subject of the drink legislation, to draw from it conclusions which would justify Parliament in any conceivable circumstance forcing upon a province a system of nationalization of industry.\nMr. O'Connor's chief contention was that the enactments of section 17 are enactments upon the subject of criminal law, within the meaning of that phrase as used in section 91 and that the provisions of section 18 can be supported as provisions ancillary to these enactments. I think it is open to doubt whether the enactments in section 17 can be supported as enactments upon the subject of \"the criminal law.\" Section 22 it is true makes infractions of section 17 punishable as therein provided, but the penal sanctions provided by section 22, apply clearly to any contravention of any provisions of Part 2 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, and it is not easy to believe that every such infraction (for example, subsection 3, sec. 19) was intended by the legislature to be classed as a crime in the strict sense. Moreover having regard to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Board (by sec. 16) to enlarge the application of the statute, it seems very doubtful indeed if such could have been the object of the legislature. But assuming this view of section 17 to be the right view, I cannot agree that the enactments of section 18 are in any proper sense ancillary to the enactments of section 17. Sections 17 and 22 are quite complete in themselves, and while I think the legislature might very well have provided as ancillary to these enactments special administrative machinery for the investigation of questions of fact pertaining to the matters dealt with in these two sections, and have reformed the criminal procedure for the purpose of meeting the difficulties of enforcing section 17, the authority conferred upon the Board by section 18 is not in my opinion in any way necessary in order to give complete effect to sections 17 and 22.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The Board of Commerce had, on the 9th of January, 1920, under section 32 of the Board of Commerce Act (9 & 10 George V, ch. 37) stated a case for the opinion of this court upon several questions which, in the opinion of the Board, were questions of law.\nThe specific facts which had arisen and the decision arrived at on these facts had not been mentioned in the stated case and it could hardly be considered that the questions were properly submitted. In re Cardigan County Council[89]. It was found advisable, at the suggestion of the Court, that a new case should be submitted. The Board then stated a new case with regard to the retail clothiers of the City of Ottawa, in which it is alleged that the Board had made of its own motion an inquiry under the provisions of section 18 of The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919 (ch. 45, 9 & 10 Geo. V.) and that it was found that those merchants had made unfair profits on the sales of men's clothing and that after a certain date an order would issue restraining them from selling these goods, except at a certain margin of profit. We are asked to determine whether or not the Board has the authority to make such an order and to require the Registrar or other proper authority of the Supreme Court of Ontario to cause the order to be made a rule of said court.\nThis new stated case supersedes the question formerly submitted. It is made with the evident intention of testing the validity of section 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act. There was at first some uncertainty as to whether the proposed order was issued under sections 17 and 18; but at the argument it was stated as a common ground that the only section of the Act applicable to the facts of the case is section 18. This section 18 declares that the Board is empowered to inquire into and to prohibit any breach of any provision of the Act, the making of unfair profits upon necessaries of life and all practices calculated to unfairly enhance their cost.\nThe Attorney General of Alberta, who had appeared by counsel on the first stated case which covered the validity of the whole Act, has also appeared on this amended issue to contest the validity of the order. He does not desire to question the wisdom of any proper legislative attempts to regulate prices in the interest of the consumers, but he claims that such a legislation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislature. The retail clothiers specifically named in the proposed order are being defended by the association of which they are members, the Retail Merchants Association of Canada, and this association, as well as some other associations and organizations which are interested in the proceedings instituted before the Board of Commerce, have also appeared and have asked us to declare ultra vires the legislation on which the order is based.\nThe Attorney General of Canada upholds the constitutionality of the said order, his main ground being that section 18 is legislation ancillary to criminal legislation viz., to section 17 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act. The first question then is as to whether or not section 17 is criminal legislation.\nSection 17 prohibits undue accumulation of necessaries of life and forces the accumulators to dispose of these necessaries at fair prices.\nIn other words, it is an enactment relating to the quantity of goods which a person may possess and determines the conditions at which they should be sold. Prim\u00e2 facie it is legislation affecting property and civil rights and would fall within provincial and not federal jurisdiction. Sec. 92, s.s. 13.\nIt is true that penalties are imposed on those who contravene or fail to observe any provisions of the Act and even these contraventions are indictable offences; (sect. 22). But the imposition of penalties would not by itself give the Federal Parliament power to legislate. As it was declared by the Privy Council in The Insurance Reference[90], such penalty is an ancillary enactment. We must ascertain the class to which the operative enactment really belongs, the primary matter dealt with, the true nature and character of the legislation, its leading features, its pith and substance. Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[91].\nWhat is the object of the legislation at issue in this case? It is to investigate and restrain the withholding and enhancement of the price of commodities. A Board is created for that purpose with very extensive powers. If the intention of Parliament was to enact criminal legislation, it would likely have been embodied in an amendment to the Criminal Code, as they have done by the following chapter, chapter 46 of the statutes passed in the same year.\nSimilar provisions had to be construed in the Insurance Reference (ss. 4 and 70 of the Insurance Act)[92]. Penalties and imprisonment were enacted for the contravention; but it was mildly contended it could be considered as criminal legislation before this court (2); it was not mentioned before the Privy Council[93].\nLegislation similar to the one we have to construe in this case was passed last year in England and was called \"The Profiteering Act\". Under that Act the Board of Trade has power to investigate prices, profits, etc., and for that purpose to require any person to appear before them, and on any such investigation they may by order fix maximum prices and declare the price which would give a reasonable profit. By subsection 2 of section 1 of the Act it was declared:\nIf as the result of any investigation undertaken on their own initiative or on complaint made to them, it appears to the Board of Trade that the circumstances so require, the Board shall take proceedings against the seller before a court of summary jurisdiction, and if in such proceedings it is found that the price charged or sought about which the complaint was made, or the price discovered at the investigation to have been charged or sought, was such as to yield a profit which is, in view of all the circumstances, unreasonable, the seller shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding \u00a3200 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such imprisonment and fine.\nBy section 2 of the same Act, the Board of Trade has power to establish local committees to whom the Board may delegate any of their powers.\nThe Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway were charged before the Manchester Profiteering Committee for charging at their restaurant exorbitant prices. The railway company applied for a writ of prohibition and the court, on the 15th March, decided that\na prosecution under s. 1, sub-s. 2, of the Act is a separate and independent proceeding from the investigation with a view to declaring a price and ordering repayment of any amount in excess of that price under s. 1, sub-s. 1, and that the investigation was not a criminal cause or matter.\nEven if section 17 were criminal legislation, it could not be claimed that the order is valid because it is ancillary to criminal legislation.\nThe power to pass criminal laws belongs to the Federal Parliament (B.N.A. Act, s. 91, s.s. 27). In its ordinary sense, the words criminal law would cover not only the definition and punishment of crime, but also the procedure and the courts for the trial of persons accused of crime. But section 92, s.s. 4, gives to the provincial legislatures the legislative control over the constitution of the courts of criminal jurisdiction, and, besides, subsection 27 of section 91, in giving legislative power to the Federal Parliament on the criminal law, excepts formally the constitution of the courts of criminal jurisdiction.\nIt is such a formal enactment that I cannot accept the proposition that the creation of a court like the Board of Commerce could be validly constituted as a court of criminal jurisdiction. Section 101, which is invoked also in that respect, could not alter the formal provisions of section 91 which should stand \"notwithstanding anything in this Act,\" as it is declared therein.\nI admit that intra vires federal legislation will override inconsistent provincial legislation and that the widest discretion must be allowed to the federal Parliament in the moulding of its legislation, but at the same time no usurpation should be made under the guise of so-called ancillary legislation. Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[94].\nIt could not be considered as essential to the exercise of the Dominion legislative authority that section 18 of the Fair Prices Act should have been passed, and I understand this as the test which should be adopted to determine the validity of any ancillary legislation.\nThe Board in exercising its powers under section 18 exercises independent civil powers and the order we have to examine is made for the purpose of forcing the merchants to sell their goods at a certain price.\nIt is contended also that this can be dealt with by the Federal Parliament as a regulation of Trade and Commerce.\nThe words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" may cover a very large field of possible legislation and there has been much discussion as to their limits. They were first considered in the Parsons Case[95], in 1881, and there it was stated that these words in their unlimited sense would include every regulation of trade ranging from commercial treaties with foreign governments down to minute rules for regulating particular trades, but a consideration of the context and of other parts shows that these words should not be used in this unlimited sense. The collocation of the regulation of trade and commerce with classes of subjects of national and general concern affords an indication that regulations relating to general trade and commerce were in the minds of the fathers of Confederation when they gave the Federal Parliament the power to deal with it.\nViews to the same effect have been expressed by the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[96], and in Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[97].\nThe last case where this power of regulating trade and commerce has been considered by the Privy Council is the Insurance Reference[98], and it was held there that\nthe regulation of trade and commerce does not extend to the regulation of a particular trade.\nIn the Combines and Fair Prices Act, there is an attempt to regulate the trade of those who are engaged in dealing with necessaries of life, as there was an attempt in the Insurance Legislation to regulate the trade of those engaged in the insurance business.\nThen the contention is made that this legislation is valid in the exercise by the Federal Parliament of its power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. According to the principle of construction adopted in the Parsons Case[99], the first question to be determined with regard to the distribution of legislative powers is whether section 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act falls within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92 and assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. If it does, then the further question would arise whether the subject of the Act does not also fall within one of the enumerated classes of section 91 and so does not still belong to the Dominion Parliament.\nPrim\u00e2 facie section 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act is legislation affecting property and civil rights and would fall within provincial control and not federal control (s. 92, s.s. 13) and, as I have shown above also, the subject of the Act does not fall within the regulation of trade and commerce or criminal law.\nThere may be matters not included in the enumeration of section 91 upon which the Parliament of Canada has power to legislate, because they concern the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, but if they are enumerated in sec. 92, then the Dominion Parliament has no authority to encroach upon these subjects. It is not claimed that the order in question is of Canadian interest or importance, because this order has reference to merchants of a certain city and the provincial authorities could certainly pass the necessary legislation to carry out such an order. Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[100]. I do not then hesitate to say that section 18 of the Combines and Fair Prices Act could not be considered as valid under the exercise by the Federal Parliament of its power to legislate concerning peace, order and good government. The legislation in question is then ultra vires and should be declared unconstitutional.\nFor these reasons the answer to the first question submitted should be in the negative. As to the second question, it is not then necessary for me to deal with it.\n[1] [1910] A.C. 293.\n[2] 54 J.P. 792.\n[3] 8 DeG.M. & G. 36, 37.\n[4] [1896] A.C. 348.\n[5] [1912] A.C. 333, 343.\n[6] 7 App. Cas. 96.\n[7] 12 App. Cas. 575.\n[8] 7 App. Cas. 96.\n[9] [1896] A.C. 348.\n[10] [1912] A.C. 333, 343.\n[11] 48 Can.

These two actions were consolidated for purposes of trial; they were both maintained by the judgment of the trial judge, and both dismissed by the Court of King's Bench, the first by a majority judgment and the second unanimously. The appellant took one appeal to the Supreme Court, and the respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction as to the first action.\nHeld, that there was no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal in the first action, which had not lost its identity through the consolidation of the two actions.\nOn the merits of the second action:\nPer Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The respondent should have provided the instalment of \"suitable automatic safety valves at connection in sewerage\" as enacted by its charter.

Vandry, (36 Times L.R. 296) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, and dismissing the appellant's, plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nWainwright K.C. and Elder for the appellant.\nLaurendeau K.C. and St Pierre for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant herein brought two actions to recover from respondent damages suffered by reason of water flowing from a sewer of respondent into the cellar of appellant connected therewith.\nThe first was in respect of damages, not amounting to $2,000, for an occurrence of that nature in March, 1917. The second arose out of an overflow on the night of 29th, and morning of 30th July, 1917.\nAn order was made for the consolidation, so called, of the two actions after issues had been joined.\nThe result was the trial of both actions together and a judgment of the learned trial judge which, after the recital of the pleadings in each case respectively awarded separate damages in respect of each cause of action namely the sum of $1,178.83 arising out of the occurrence in March, and the sum of $3,015.23 for that arising out of the occurrence in July.\nThe appeal from that judgment to the Court of King's Bench was prosecuted by a like preservation of distinction between the two causes of action and the determinate result.\nThere was never an amendment of the pleadings such as to produce any other result.\nHence on the appeal here we cannot say as to the result founded on the March occurrence there is a matter in controversy which can be said to involve at least $2,000.\nAnd if we turn to the pleadings and the amount claimed thereby which often has to be, and here must be, our guide, we find nothing but the claim for $1,178.83.\nIt was therefore decided during the course of the argument herein that we had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal relative to the claim for damages in March, 1917. That branch of this appeal being thus eliminated, we must confine our attention to the alleged damages suffered in July, 1917.\nThe respondent is a municipal corporation created and operated by virtue of a special charter which enabled it to construct sewers and pursuant thereto it constructed in 1887 a main sewer, known as the \"Commissioners Street Sewer\" furnishing an outlet for the drainage through numerous other sewers draining an area of over thirty-eight acres in said city.\nIn 1896 the owners of the property, of which the appellant later, on the 1st of January, 1913, became tenants, obtained permission to make the necessary connections between said property and the sewer in question.\nThe respondent's engineer in charge of the sewer pumping station, testifies as follows as to that:\u2014\nQ.\u2014First of all, Mr. Dowd, have you got with you the records of the Sewer Department of the city of Montreal shewing the permit issued by the city for the private drain from the premises at the north west corner of St. Gabriel street and Commissioners street, connecting with the Commissioner street sewer?\nA.\u2014Yes, it is in the book that I shewed you the other day.\nQ.\u2014So that here is a permit for a private drain from these premises to connect with the Commissioners street sewer?\nA.\u2014Yes, there is a permit; it is in book No. 10, page 40, permit No. 206, issued on the fourteenth of October eighteen hundred and ninety-six.\nQ.\u2014Does your record in reference to this permit show the particulars as to the location and size of the drain?\nA.\u2014Yes, they are all shown in the book, which I did not bring with me.\nQ.\u2014Then, there is no dispute between us on that point that there is a private drain from these premises to connect with the Commissioners street sewer?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014There is no dispute as to that?\nA.\u2014Oh no, there is a private drain.\nQ.\u2014If I remember rightly, your records shew the location of the drain, its size and grade?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And you say you have not got that particular book with you?\nA.\u2014No, I did not bring it; I forget to bring it.\nThere seems to be no doubt of the power controlling all incidental thereto being with the respondent as appears by section 42 of its charter as it existed at that time, which is as follows:\u2014 42. To regulate the sewerage of the city, and to assess proprietors of real estate to such amount as may be necessary to defray the expenses of making any common sewer in any street of the city, in which such proprietors own property, and for regulating the mode in which such assessment shall be made, collected and paid\nand which was expanded in the charter as renewed in 1899 by 62 Vict. ch. 58, for which expansion see sections 94, 96 and 97 of Art. 300.\nPursuant thereto by-laws were enacted as follows:\u2014\nBy-law No. 239.\nSec. 1. The city, by resolution of its council, is authorized to place automatic safety valves at the connection of sewers for the drainage of any land situated within limits of its territory. This work, however, shall not be commenced before it has been declared necessary by a report of the Road Committee, accompanied by a detailed statement from the city surveyor, containing the name of the proprietor, the lot or cadastral subdivision, the name of the street, the probable cost of the work to be performed, and by a certificate to the effect that such work is necessary in order to prevent the floods resulting from the public sewer existing in any street where such land is situated.\nSec. 2. The expenditure to be incurred for the manufacture and putting in of said safety valves shall be borne and paid one half by the city, and the other half by the proprietors of such lands.\n* * * *\nSec. 6. The cost of repairing and maintaining said safety valves shall be payable by the City, which is hereby authorized to appoint any persons or officials of the Road Department to do the work required for that purpose on said lands.\nIt became, I submit, the respondent's duty to see that due care was taken in executing the purposes of these provisions.\nSection 95 of the later enactment provided as follows:\u2014\n95. To permit the city to provide, where it may be necessary, suitable automatic safety valves at connections in sewerage for the drainage of any lands, the expense thereof to be borne one half by the city and one half by the owner of the property, and such cost shall be recovered according to the statement prepared by the officer designated for that purpose by the board of commissioners and approved by the latter and to provide for the inspection of the same by the city; but for all other buildings the expense shall be borne entirely by the city. There is most emphatic evidence by an engineer in the employment of the city and, I think, others, that the instalment of such automatic valves is the efficient remedy.\nVanier, an engineer employed by the city, speaks as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014D'apr\u00e8s votre exp\u00e9rience, des valves, des trappes dont vous avez parl\u00e9 tout-\u00e0-1'heure, croyez-vous que s'il y en eut chez les demandeurs de telles valves d'install\u00e9es convenablement, comme il se fait dans la pratique, \u00e7'aurait eu pour r\u00e9sultat de pr\u00e9venir ces inondations?\nR.\u2014Je le crois, j'en suis convaincu.\nQ.\u2014Est-ce que de semblables trappes ou valves, \u00e0 votre connaissance, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9venu des inondations ailleurs?\nR.\u2014Certainement.\nQ.\u2014Il y en a beaucoup d'install\u00e9es \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al?\nR.\u2014Vous en avez d'install\u00e9es un peu dans tous les quartiers ici.\nAnd he testifies as to the practice relevant to private drains, as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Vous savez que la ville de Montr\u00e9al a approuv\u00e9 la connection de l'\u00e9gout priv\u00e9 de la demanderesse avec l'\u00e9gout de la rue des Commissaires?\nR.\u2014Parfaitment. C'ela, c'est pour la partie franchement priv\u00e9e, qui se trouve de la b\u00e2tisse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gout de la rue. Mais je ne sache pas qu'elle ait approuv\u00e9, au moins d'apr\u00e8s la preuve que j'ai entendue ici, de dispositions int\u00e9rieures du drainage dans la maison de la demanderesse.\nQ.\u2014C'est la ville de Montr\u00e9al qui installe la connection entre l'\u00e9gout priv\u00e9 et l'\u00e9gout de la rue?\nR.\u2014Entre la maison et l'\u00e9gout de la rue.\nQ.\u2014C'est la ville qui fait cela?\nR.\u2014Il me semble.\nQ.\u2014Et la ville a approuv\u00e9 la connection qu'elle a faite elle-rn\u00eame dans cette cause entre l'\u00e9gout priv\u00e9 de la demanderesse et l'\u00e9gout de la rue des Commissaires\nR.\u2014Oui. Dans ce cas-ci \u00e7a n'a pas d'importance du tout.\nQ.\u2014Mais cela se fait\nR.\u2014Cela se fait; je sais que c'est la pratique suivie \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al depuis quelques ann\u00e9es.\nWe heard a great deal in argument about force majeure as if to pronounce these words should charm away any common sense method of looking at the real questions involved therein. The exaggerated demands made on the one side thus met by the other, do not seem to me to furnish the way to the solution of the real problems presented.\nThe city had, seven years before the building of this sewer, a storm which I suspect was much more severe than that of July, 1914, now in question. That was followed later and meantime by very severe storms in July, 1906, June, 1907, and June, 1911, which would suggest a much greater downpour of rain than this sewer could take absolute care of if we have regard to the evidence of Mr. Blanchard, one of the city's engineers, who testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Est-ce qu'il est pratique, au point de vue du g\u00e9nie civil, de construire des \u00e9gouts pouvant r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des besoins tels qu'il s'en est produit le 29 et le trente juillet mil neuf cent dix-sept (1917)\nR.\u2014Non, il est impossible.\nQ.\u2014Est-ce que \u00e7a se fait\nR.\u2014Pas \u00e0 ma connaissance.\nQ.\u2014Quelle est la capacit\u00e9 de l\u00e9gout de la rue des Commissaires, Monsieur Blanchard, en pouces, par heure\nR.\u2014Un pouce et quarante-deux centi\u00e8mes.\nQ.\u2014Au point de vue des capacit\u00e9s \"Standard,\" est-ce que c'est suffisant, cette capacit\u00e9, un pouce et quarante-deux centi\u00e8mes.\nR.\u2014Oui, dans un grand nombre de villes, on se contente d'un pouce seulement.\nQ.\u2014Quelle est la superficie que F\u00e9gout prend?\nR.\u2014C'est trente-huit acres et huit centi\u00e8mes.\nQ.\u2014Tel que d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sur le plan?\nR.\u2014Tel que d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sur le plan.\nQ.\u2014Quelle est la capacit\u00e9 du d\u00e9bit de cet \u00e9gout l\u00e0 par heure. Monsieur Blanchard?\nR.\u2014A l'heure,\u2014je peux le donner \u00e0 la seconde, c'est trente-six pieds et huit centi\u00e8mes par seconde, c'est-\u00e0-dire des pieds cubes.\nQ.\u2014Maintenant, Monsieur Blanchara, quoi qu'\u00e9tant un jeune homme vous connaissez bien Montr\u00e9al depuis assez longtemps\nR.\u2014Je suis n\u00e9 ici \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\nQ.\u2014Est-ce que le quartier o\u00f9 la superficie que cet \u00e9gout est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9goutter est un endroit o\u00f9 il s'est fait un tr\u00e8s grand nombre de changements depuis la construction de cet \u00e9gout\nR.\u2014Seulement la rue St. Laurent qui s'est ouverte. To put beyond peradventure as it were there is set forth in the appellant's declaration an instance as follows:\u2014\n11. The defendant had previously recognized and admitted its liability for loss and damage occurring under circumstances such as those hereinabove mentioned, having previously compensated plaintiff on a previous occasion for loss suffered by it from the same cause and under similar circumstances, namely in the sum of $91.20 on the 24th day of July, 1913, the whole as is well known to defendant.\nThough denied in the respondent's plea, this was admitted on argument and no explantation why except for sake of peace. A mere surmise, I suspect, of counsel.\nThis last incident, to my mind, acts two ways.\nIt seems to deprive appellant of being entirely free from blame in failing to ask for the installation of the necessary valve. And at the same time robs respondent of any reasonable excuse for failing to point out, as was its duty, the true remedy.\nThat seems to me to present the common sense view. And it was within the power of the city alone to supply its application.\nI entirely disagree with the ground taken in respondent's factum that it cannot refuse a ratepayer to connect with the sewer. It not only can refuse, but it is its duty to refuse unless and until all reasonable conditions have been complied with and the measure of such presumably are those provided in its by-laws.\nI must also express my dissent from the misapplication sought to be made in same factum of the decision in the case of Roy v. City of Montreal[2],\nThe by-laws in question herein are of an entirely different character from that in question therein, and deal with the subject matters of the relations between the city and those connecting their property with the city sewers, and are obligatory on both. Every brief storm such as those in question brings with it the risk of far more damage than the cost of these valves would be. And the brief storm if intense would leave on the streets and vacant places a temporary degree of discomfort which may have to be borne.\nHence I do not dwell on the issue of force majeure which from my point of view is besides the question at issue, or should be, if we apply common sense.\nThe primary duty rested on respondent which was in control of the works it had undertaken to construct, and did construct, and the responsibility devolved on it to see that they were so efficient in all, details as not to injure any one else either in relation to person or to property.\nThe respondent did not exercise that due care which it was bound to have exercised.\nExhibit P2 filed herein as the permit given the owner in 1896 to make the connection is not very illuminating. Resort must be had to the by-laws for any delimitation of the respective rights and obligations of the parties concerned. The citizen who is presented with the due consideration of such a problem is not faultless if he fails to remonstrate when having occasion to complain.\nI would, therefore, allow this appeal with costs, but divide the damages, four-fifths to be borne by respondent and one-fifth by appellant, and award it judgment accordingly with costs in the court below on the Superior Court scale throughout against respondent.\nThe appeal as to the other case having been quashed we ought not to interfere with anything relative to same beyond the costs of motion to quash. Duff J.\u2014I concur with Idington J.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with my brother Mignault.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014L' appelante par deux poursuites distinctes a poursuivi la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al en dommages pour l'inondation de ses caves en mars 1917 et en juillet de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Elle all\u00e8gue que ces inondations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par l'insuffisance de l'\u00e9gout collecteur construit par la ville.\nLa premi\u00e8re poursuite pour l'inondation de mars \u00e9tait pour un montant de $1,178.83 et la seconde \u00e9tait pour un montant de $3,015.23. Comme ces deux poursuites soulevaient des questions qui \u00e9taient sous certains rapports substantiellement les m\u00eames, la cour a ordonn\u00e9 qu'elles soient instruites et jug\u00e9es sur la m\u00eame preuve (arts. 291 & 292 C.P.C.).\nPar le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure les deux actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenues et la ville a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable de n\u00e9gligence pour les deux inondations. En cour d'appel ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9.\nLa compagnie Watt & Scott porte les deux poursuites en appel devant cette cour.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se pose est de savoir si nous avons juridiction pour juger la premi\u00e8re poursuite, c'est-\u00e0-dire celle o\u00f9 le montant en litige est de moins de $2,000.\nLes jonctions d'instances pour les fins de la preuve se font dans le but d'\u00e9viter des frais et n'ont pas pour effet de constituer une seule action. Les poursuites, apr\u00e8s qu'elles sont r\u00e9unies, ne perdent pas leur identit\u00e9, et il arrive souvent que l'une d'elles soit maintenue et que l'autre soit renvoy\u00e9e. Ainsi dans le cas actuel nous voyons que la cour d'appel, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse dans la seconde action, s'est divis\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re. Il y avait dans la consid\u00e9ration de ces deux causes des circonstances qui pouvaient \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es dans un cas et ne pouvaient pas l'\u00eatre dans l'autre.\nFuzier-Herman dans son R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Jonction d'instances, nous d\u00e9clare dans les termes suivants les effets de la r\u00e9union de deux poursuites:\nNo. 77. On doit d'ailleurs admettre que le jugement de jonction des deux instances qui ne peuvent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme n'en formant qu'une seule laisse \u00e0 chaque action son caract\u00e8re primitif, ses r\u00e8gles propres de juridiction et n'alt\u00e9rant ni la nature ni les effets de chaque demande, chaque cause doit \u00eatre' \u00e9valu\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment pour la fixation du dernier ressort.\nNo. 83. La jonction de deux demandes form\u00e9es par exploit s\u00e9par\u00e9, n'a pas pour effet de modifier leur nature propre, de leur faire perdre leur individualit\u00e9 et de les fondre dans une instance unique. Chacune des actions conserve apr\u00e8s le jugement de jonction son caract\u00e8re primitif et ses r\u00e8gles propres de juridiction.\nPour d\u00e9terminer la juridiction de cette cour, il faut donc voir quel est le montant des deux actions.\nDans une cause jug\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment par cette cour, L' Autorit\u00e9 v. Ibbotson[3] nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que si onze personnes se r\u00e9unissent dans une seule poursuite pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages au montant de $22,000 payables $2,000 en faveur de chacune d'elles, il faut traiter cette poursuite comme s'il y e\u00fbt eu onze poursuites diff\u00e9rentes.\nLes d\u00e9cisions suivantes de cette cour sont au m\u00eame effet: Hearn v. Nelson & Fort Sheppard Ry. Co.[4], Glen Falls Ins. Co. v. Adams[5], Ontario Bank v. McAllister[6]. On a dit que ces articles 291 et 292 du code de proc\u00e9dure \u00e9taient de droit nouveau et \u00e9taient tir\u00e9s des R\u00e8gles de la Cour d'Echiquier du Canada dans les causes maritimes. Je dois dire cependant \u00e0 ce sujet que cette pratique de r\u00e9unir les instances a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue dans la doctrine et la jurisprudence. (1865) Foley v. Tarratt[7], (1866) H\u00e9bert v. Quesnel[8], (1882) Chr\u00e9tien v. Crowley[9], (1882) Larivi\u00e8re v. Choquet[10], (1891) D\u00e9patie v. Gibb[11], Guyot, R\u00e9pertoire, vbo. Connexit\u00e9, p. 480; Ferri\u00e8re, Introduction \u00e0 la pratique, p. 91, vbo. Jonction; Rolland de Villargues, vbo. Connexit\u00e9, p. 100.\nPour ces raisons je suis donc d'opinion que nous n'avons pas juridiction dans la premi\u00e8re poursuite et que l'appel quant \u00e0 elle doit \u00eatre cass\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nQuant au m\u00e9rite de la seconde poursuite, je suis d'opinion que le jugement de la cour d'appel est bien fond\u00e9.\nIl s'agirait de savoir si l'inondation du mois de juillet 1917 est due \u00e0 une cause fortuite qui ne pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9vue, ou s'il y a eu force majeure. La faute ne peut se concevoir chez celui qui subit l'empire d'un cas fortuit ou d'une force majeure. Lorsqu'il y a cas fortuit ou force majeure, il n'y a pas de responsabilit\u00e9 pour le dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose dont une personne a la garde.\nIl est incontestable que les accidents de la nature proviennent d'une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 l'oblig\u00e9 et constituent des cas fortuits, mais ils n'\u00e9cartent pas la responsabilit\u00e9 dans tous les cas. Il faut qu'ils se produisent dans des conditions que la sagesse commune n'a pas pr\u00e9vues. Ainsi des pluies sont bien l'acte de la nature, mais comme elles se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent fr\u00e9quemment, on doit remplir ses obligations de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger contre elles. Cependant si ces pluies se d\u00e9chainent en temp\u00eates, si elles d\u00e9passent les pr\u00e9visions de la sagesse commune, alors elles tombent dans la cat\u00e9gorie des cas fortuits qui enl\u00e8vent toute responsabilit\u00e9. (Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, nos. 644-645. Toullier, vol. 2, p. 223. Mignault, vol. 6, p. 362. Sawyer v. Ives[12].\nDans le cas actuel, il y a eu dans la nuit du 30 juillet 1917 une pluie torrentielle. Quant \u00e0 son intensit\u00e9 et \u00e0 sa dur\u00e9e, il n'y aurait jamais eu, de m\u00e9moire d'homme, un orage aussi consid\u00e9rable, except\u00e9 37 ans auparavant. Et encore, quant \u00e0 ce dernier orage, le syst\u00e8me de mesurage alors en usage n'avait pas la pr\u00e9cision des instruments dont on se servait au 30 juillet 1917.\nOn a examin\u00e9 sur ce point l'officier, M. Weir, qui a charge de l'observatoire de l'universit\u00e9 McGill et qui a la garde de ses registres et il nous parle d'abord de la temp\u00eate en question en la pr\u00e9sente cause. L'orage aurait dur\u00e9 78 minutes et il serait tomb\u00e9 pendant ce temps 1\u00b751 pouce d'eau. L'intensit\u00e9 n'aurait pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame. Ainsi, par exemple, il donne la p\u00e9riode de cinq minutes o\u00f9 l'intensit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus grande et pendant laquelle il aurait trouv\u00e9 une chut\u00e9 d'eau de 0\u00b726 pouce. Si cette intensit\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait continu\u00e9e pendant tout le temps de l'orage on aurait eu alors pour les 78 minutes 4\u00b705 pouces et pour une heure 3\u00b712 pouces. Aussi ce m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiste n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire:\nI should say that as regards the intensities they are extraordinary, that is the shortest period of intensities are not extraordinary, but the amount of water during the duration of the downfall is extraordinary. Il prouve par les registres du McGill que nous avons eu dans les ann\u00e9es qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la temp\u00eate en question trois gros orages :\nMaximum de l'intensit\u00e9 5 minutes.\nIntensit\u00e9 pendant la dur\u00e9e de l'orage\nDur\u00e9e\n1\u00b0 le 30 juillet 1906\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026..\n0\u00b735\n0\u00b778\n60 min.\n2\u00b0 le 26 juin 1907 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\n0\u00b735\n0\u00b759\n60 \"\n3\u00b0 le 11 juin 1911 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n0\u00b735\n0\u00b777\n60 \"\n4\u00b0 le 29 juillet 1917 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n0\u00b726\n1\u00b751\n78 \"\nM. Weir nous dit qu'on ne devrait pas comparer les' orages de 30 juillet 1906 et du 29 juillet 1917. Quoique l'intensit\u00e9 pour cinq minutes dans le premier cas f\u00fbt plus consid\u00e9rable que dans le dernier cas, ce dernier doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 bien plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re \u00e0 cause de sa dur\u00e9e. La dur\u00e9e d'un orage, pour en d\u00e9terminer la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pour un \u00e9gout, doit donc \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration, et c'est bien naturel. En effet, si un orage ne dure que quelques minutes, l'\u00e9gout peut en recevoir toute l'eau et sans crainte d'inondation. Mais si l'orage dure longtemps, alors l'\u00e9gout se remplit, il devient insuffisant et 1' inondation se produit. Il ne faut donc pas regarder au maximum d'intensit\u00e9 pour quelques minutes mais \u00e0 la quantit\u00e9 d'eau qui tombe pendant tout le temps de l'orage.\nM. Weir nous dit alors que le seul orage qui puisse se comparer avec celui qui a caus\u00e9 l'inondation est celui du 11 juin 1911 qui a eu une intensit\u00e9 de 0\u00b735 dans cinq minutes, de 0\u00b777 dans une heure et de 1\u00b798 dans les onze heures que l'orage a dur\u00e9. Si nous examinons soigneusement ces chiffres, nous voyons que pendant une heure il y a eu une chute d'eau de 0\u00b777 tandis que dans l'orage de juillet 1917 il est tomb\u00e9 dans une heure et dix-huit minutes 1\u00b751. Ce dernier me para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Le chiffre de 1\u00b798 couvre 11 heures et par cons\u00e9quent donne \u00e0 l'\u00e9gout, qui est d'ordinaire suppos\u00e9 avoir une chute d'eau d'environ 1\u00b750 de l'heure, amplement le temps de transporter toute l'eau qui s'y jette.\nD'apr\u00e8s M. Weir, l'orage le plus s\u00e9rieux qu'on aurait eu est celui de 1880; mais il d\u00e9clare que le mesurage qui se faisait alors n'avait pas la m\u00eame pr\u00e9cision que celui qui peut se faire avec des instruments modernes.\nToute cette preuve n'est pas contredite et le t\u00e9moignage de ce m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiste est accept\u00e9 par les deux parties. Nous ne nous trouvons donc pas en pr\u00e9sence de faits plus ou moins certains, comme dans le cas de la cause de Sawyer v. Ives[13], mais en pr\u00e9sence de faits incontestables.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je vois que la temp\u00eate qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l'inondation n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 surpass\u00e9e de m\u00e9moire d'homme, except\u00e9 par celui de 1880; et encore il n'y avait pas \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque d'instruments bien pr\u00e9cis. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement on aurait pass\u00e9 37 ans sans avoir de temp\u00eate semblable.\nM. St. George, l'expert des demandeurs, qui a construit lui-m\u00eame le canal d'\u00e9gout en question lorsqu'il \u00e9tait l'ing\u00e9nieur de la d\u00e9fenderesse, nous dit qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art et qu'il \u00e9tait suffisant pour \u00e9goutter les terrains qui s'y d\u00e9versaient. Il a tent\u00e9, il est vrai, de trouver en faute la d\u00e9fenderesse par certains changements qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, mais il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 convaincre les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs du bien fond\u00e9 de ses pr\u00e9tentions sous ce dernier rapport.\nCe canal d'\u00e9gout a la capacit\u00e9 d'une chute d'eau de 1\u00b742 pouce par heure. Or cette cour, dans une cause de Faulkner v. City of Ottawa[14], a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, sur la preuve qui y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite that a fall of 1\u00bd inch of water per hour is considered as meeting the requirements of good engineering and is the standard adopted by all the cities of Canada and the northern states.\nLa l\u00e9g\u00e8re difference de 8-100 d'un pouce ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant suffisante pour engager la responsabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse, d'autant plus que dans la cause actuelle la m\u00eame preuve que dans la cause de Faulkner n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et qu'au contraire les experts de la poursuite et de la d\u00e9fense sont d'opinion que le canal \u00e9tait fait suivant les r\u00e8gies de l'art et \u00e9tait suffisant.\nPour que la corporation intim\u00e9e f\u00fbt responsable, il aurait fallu qu'elle e\u00fbt concouru au dommage qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9. Il n'y a pas de doute que Pinondation a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la pluie torrentielle qui est tomb\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire par une force \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la, volont\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Cette derni\u00e8re a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par l'Etat et dans un but de salubrit\u00e9 publique, de construire des \u00e9gouts. Il \u00e9tait de son devoir de les construire assez spacieux pour la quantit\u00e9 d'eau que, dans les pr\u00e9visions de la sagesse humaine, elle devait raisonnablement pr\u00e9sumer devoir tomber. Or voici un orage qui de m\u00e9moire d'homme n'aurait eu lieu qu'une fois. Cet orage d\u00e9joue les calculs des hommes de l'art. Peut-il y avoir responsabilit\u00e9? Je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que cela constitue un cas de force majeure et que la d\u00e9fenderesse n'a pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nNous avons eu d'ailleurs r\u00e9cemment dans une cause de B\u00e9nard v. Hingston[15], \u00e0 examiner cette question de force majeure et l'honorable juge-en-chef d\u00e9clarait:\nThe damages were caused by a combination of a very heavy rainfall and an abnormal overflow of the River St. Lawrence. It is not necessary to bring such an event within the scope and meaning of the words vis major or the act of God that such an event should never have happened before: it is sufficient that its happening could not have been reasonably expected.\nL'honorable juge Anglin, dans la m\u00eame cause, disait que si l'inondation \u00e9tait si extraordinaire qu'elle n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre anticip\u00e9e, alors il y aurait force majeure.\nLes inondations dont il \u00e9tait question dans la cause de B\u00e9nard v. Hingston[16] \u00e9taient bien plus fr\u00e9quentes que cet orage qui a eu lieu en juillet 1917, vu que de m\u00e9moire d'homme il n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 surpass\u00e9 en intensit\u00e9 et en dur\u00e9e que 37 ans auparavant.\nLa jurisprudence para\u00eet bien \u00e9tablie dans Qu\u00e9bec qu'une corporation municipale n'est pas responsable pour l'inondation des caves si elle a construit son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9gout suivant les plans d'ing\u00e9nieurs d'exp\u00e9rience et si elle en prend bien soin.

Ce dernier jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 en appel.\nAlors il me semble que nous ne devons pas h\u00e9siter \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que dans la cause actuelle il y a eu cas fortuit et force majeure et que la corporation n'a pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l'appel devrait \u00eatre cass\u00e9 et renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant company took two actions against the city of Montreal for damages caused by two floodings of its cellar on Commissioners street through the insufficiency of the civic sewer on that street to carry off the drainage and surface waters, so that the water of the sewer backed into the appellant's cellar which was used for purposes of storage in connection with its business. The first flooding occurred in March, 1917, and the appellant in the first action claimed $1,178.83. The second flooding was during the night of the 29th and 30th July, 1917, and for this flooding the appellant sued for $3,015.23 by a second action against the city. These two actions were consolidated for purposes of trial, and were both maintained by the Superior Court, Weir J., for the full amount, no contradiction of the appellant's proof of damages having been made. On appeal, both actions were dismissed by the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, the first by a majority judgment, the second unanimously.\nThe appellant took one appeal to this court as to the two actions, and the respondent having moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction as to the first action, the motion was reserved for hearing at the same time as the merits. At the hearing the court intimated that it had not jurisdiction in so far as the appeal in the first action was concerned, which appeal is quashed, and the appeal was restricted to the second action for $3,015.23 for the July flooding, which is the only one to be considered.\nI have carefully read the voluminous evidence. The sewer in question was built in 1887 and runs along Commissioners street, emptying into a main sewer which itself discharges into Elgin Basin in the Montreal harbour, some distance to the west. The Commissioners street sewer drains a drainage area of 38 8-100 acres, and has a capacity of 1\u00b742 inches per hour. Its size is 4 by 2\u00b78 feet. The main sewer carries the sewage and surface waters from the western part of the city, the volume of the sewage and surface waters thus carried being very considerable, and in comparison with it the sewage drained by the Commissioners street sewer is, according to the expression of one of the witnesses, a mere bucketful. Some years after the construction of the latter sewer, the city decided to install a pumping station at Youville Square, the object of which was to divert the sewage coming from the west by way of St. Sulpice street into the Craig street sewer, and for the purposes of the pumping station a small dam was built in the main sewer so as to have sufficient water to work the pumps. However the pumps when constructed were found not to have been properly built and the city refused to accept them as satisfying the contract for their construction and they were never put in operation. It is pretended by Mr. St. George, expert witness for the appellant, that this dam obstructed the flow of sewerage from the Commissioners street sewer, but this is denied by the respondent's experts, and the learned trial judge did not find that this dam contributed to the flooding complained of.\nThe appellant's cellar was connected with the Commissioners street sewer by a private drain constructed under the inspection of the respondent's officers and must be taken to have been a proper connection. For this reason I do not think that the respondent can claim that the appellant's cellar was too low for efficient drainage. It is common ground, however, that no automatic safety valve was placed by the appellant or the respondent in the appellant's connecting drain, and the respondent's evidence shews that had such a valve been installed it would have been closed by the overflow from the street sewer and no flooding would have occurred.\nThe July flooding was caused by a very heavy rainstorm, and the evidence is that the water backed up from the street sewer into the appellant's premises. The question under these circumstances is whether the respondent is liable for the appellant's damages. The Court of King's Bench, referring to the two floodings held that it was not because the appellant had not proved that the respondent's sewers were defectively constructed or were insufficient, and because\nles inondations dont se plaigent les demandeurs intim\u00e9s sont dues \u00e0 des causes fortuites ne pouvant \u00eatre pr\u00e9vues et constituant des causes de force majeure.\nIf this latter consid\u00e9rant of the judgment is well founded it disposes of the appellant's action.\nIn the Superior Court the learned trial judge held the respondent liable for three reasons:\n1. The sewer on Commissioners street was not of sufficient capacity to drain the surface area in times of exceptional rainstorms which have been proved to have fallen on the locality at various times from the year 1880 onwards, and the damages were caused by such a storm.\n2. The sewer was insufficient for the further reason that the flooding through the private drain could have been prevented by the defendant if it had equipped the sewer at its connection with the private drain with automatically closing and opening valves as described in its plea.\n3. The defendant, knowing the possibility of such rainstorms occurring in the summer months, should have equipped and operated the Youville pumping station in such manner as to have aided the functions of the Commissioners street sewer in carrying off the unusual water flow, which it neglected to do.\nThe learned trial judge treats the rainstorm in question has having been \"exceptional\" or \"unusual,\" but finds expressly that such storms have fallen on this locality at various times; and, in his reasons for judgment, he instances a rainstorm of greater intensity and quantity on the 9th of August of the same year, when the appellant's cellar was again flooded, another on June 11, 1911, comparable to the one in question, and a heavier one\u2014the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in Montreal\u2014on July 20, 1880, when 1\u00b758 inches of rain fell in 46 minutes, as opposed to 1\u00b751 inches in 78 minutes during the storm in question. He, therefore, holds that the rain in question was not unprecedented. In 1895, the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench in Sawyer v. Ives[19] held that a rainstorm extraordinary but not unprecedented, nor of such violence that it could not reasonably have been anticipated, does not constitute vis major, I must accept this holding as being in conformity with the definition of force majeure or of cas fortuit, as\ntout \u00e9v\u00e8nement que la prudence humaine ne peut pr\u00e9voir et auquel on ne peut r\u00e9sister quand on i'a pr\u00e9vu.\" (Pandectes fran\u00e7aises, vo. Obligations, no. 1774.)\nMy opinion is, therefore, that the plea of force majeure is not made out, and I may add that the position taken by the respondent is that Commissioners street sewer was sufficient for ordinary needs, the inference being that it is not obliged to provide a sewer which can take care of extraordinary rainstorms, though not unprecedented or unforseeable. I will examine whether this pretension is founded in law, for I am of opinion that the respondent cannot rely on its plea of force majeure.\nThere remains therefore the question whether the respondent having constructed a sewer sufficient for the ordinary requirements of the population of the district to be drained, is liable for a flooding caused by an exceptional or unusual rainstorm not coming within the definition of a cas fortuit or a force majeure.\nBesides citing several decisions of the Quebec courts which are not binding on us, and of which some support the respondent's position, while others were influenced by the fact that the flooded premises were built after the construction of the sewer (a number of these decisions favourable or unfavourable to the respondent, may be found in Beauchamp's Repertoire, vo. Responsabilit\u00e9, nos. 407 and following), the respondent relies on the judgment of this court in Faulkner v. City of Ottawa[20], by which it was decided that where a city has constructed a sewer capable of carrying off 1\u00bd inches of water per hour, which is considered as meeting the requirements of good engineering and which is the standard adopted by all the cities of Canada and the Northern States, the city is not liable for a flooding caused by a rainstorm which during nine minutes fell at an intensity of 3 inches per hour and was one which could not reasonably be expected.\nJudging by the evidence in this case, the rainstorm was not as violent as the one in Faulkner v. The City of Ottawa20. Moreover the liability of the respondent must be determined according to the rules laid down by the Quebec Civil Code (Arts. 1053, 1054), so I do not think that the matter would necessarily be concluded by the decision of this court in the Faulkner case (1), were it on all fours with the case at bar.\nThe respondent also cited the judgment of this court in B\u00e9nard v. Hingston, a Quebec case[21]. I do not think that this decision helps the respondent, for the litigation arose between a tenant and a landlord, and the latter, after having been condemned to pay damages to her tenant for a previous flooding, had adopted the very measure of precaution indicated by the tenant's experts and the best possible professional advice, which she herself had obtained. Moreover the flooding there was caused by an ice shove in the river St. Lawrence, coinciding with a very heavy rainstorm, which might reasonably be considered as a cas fortuit, and the question was as to the contractual liability of the landlord under article 1614 of the Quebec Civil Code. As I have said, the question of liability or nonliability of the respondent must be determined according to articles 1053 and 1054 of the Quebec Civil Code, and as to the construction of the latter article we are bound by the recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Quebec Railway, Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Vandry[22].\nIn that case the Judicial Committee held that the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C. stating that\nhe (i.e. every person capable of distinguishing right from wrong) is responsible not only for the damage caused by his own fault, but also for that caused by the fault of persons under his control and by things which he has under his care,\ndoes not, in the case of damage caused by a thing which a person has under his care\nraise a mere presumption of faute, which the defendant may rebut by proving affirmatively that he was guilty of no faute. It establishes a liability, unless, in cases where the exculpatory paragraph applies, the defendant brings himself within its terms. There is a difference, slight in fact but clear in law, between a rebuttable presumption of faute and a liability defeasable by proof of inability to prevent the damage.\nPerhaps I may be permitted to observe that holding that article 1054 C.C. establishes a legal liability does not entirely do away with the idea of fault, for this legal liability is evidently imposed because of a presumed fault, that is to say, a negligence in respect of the care of the thing which caused the damage. (Planiol, vol. 2, nos. 917 and 930, 7th edition).\nTheir Lordships also hold that by the \"exculpatory paragraph,\" the penultimate paragraph of article 1054 C.C.\nthe responsibility attaches in the above cases only when the person subject to it fails to establish that he was unable to prevent the act which has caused the damage, applies to the first paragraph of the article as well as to the four next succeeding paragraphs concerning the vicarious liability of fathers and mothers, tutors, curators, school masters and artisans. This is an absolutely new construction, and in adopting it preference was given to the French version of article 1054 C.C. without apparently considering the rule of construction laid down by article 2615 C.C. that when a difference exists between the English and French texts of any article of the code,\nthat version shall prevail which is most consistent with the provisions of the existing laws on which the article is founded.\nHitherto it had always been considered that the exculpatory paragraph\" of article 1054 C.C. referred merely to the specific cases mentioned in the four preceding paragraphs, this being more consistent with the provisions of the existing laws (see Pothier, Obligations, Bugnet ed. no. 121), while a similar excuse was not open to masters and employers when held liable for the damage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work for which they were employed. The extension of the \"exculpatory clause\" to the first paragraph of article 1054 may now give rise to new questions of construction.\nDeferring to the Privy Council decision in Quebec Railway, Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Vandry[23], I must hold that the inquiry in this case should be whether the appellant's damage was caused by a thing which the respondent had under its care, and whether the respondent has failed to establish that it was unable to prevent the act (emp\u00eacher le fait) which has caused the damage. The respondent undoubtedly had the Commissioners street sewer under its care, and this sewer collected the rain water of the area drained by it. The damage was caused by the water from this sewer backing into the appellant's cellar, which was the act (le fait) which caused the damage. This establishes against the respondent a liability defeasable only by proof of its inability to prevent the damage.\nHas the respondent established this inability? Its own plea states that had an automatic valve been placed in the appellant's private drain connecting with the street sewer, the water would not have backed into the cellar, and the respondent's own evidence establishes this fact. Could not the respondent have installed such a valve and thus prevented the damage?\nThe City Charter, 62 Vict. ch. 58, sect. 300, subsection 95, gives the city council the power\nto permit the city to provide, where it may be necessary, suitable automatic safety valves at connections in sewerage for the drainage of any lands, the expense thereof to be borne one-half by the city, and the other half by the owner of the property, and said cost shall be recovered as per statement prepared by the city surveyor, and to provide for the inspection of the same by the city; but for all other buildings, the expense shall be borne entirely by the city.\nThe city passed a by-law in 1899, numbered 239, section 1 of which provides that\nthe city, by resolution of its council, is authorized to place automatic safety valves at the connection of sewers for the drainage of any land situated within limits of its territory. This work, however, shall not be commenced before it has been declared necessary by a report of the Road Committee, accompanied by a detailed statement from the City Surveyor, containing the name of the proprietor, the lot or cadastral subdivision, the name of the street, the probable cost of the work to be performed, and by a certificate to the effect that such work is necessary in order to prevent the floods resulting from the public sewer existing in any street where such land is situated. The words \"any lands\" and \"all other buildings\" in subsection 95 are very vague, but the respondent did not contend that it could not have placed an automatic safety valve in the appellant's private drain, but merely that it was discretionary on its part to do so.\nIf, therefore, the installation of such a valve would have prevented the act which has caused the damage, the respondent has not brought itself within the \"exculpatory paragraph\" of article 1054 C.C., and is liable under paragraph one of this article.\nThe respondent contended that, under the statute and by-law, it could only install an automatic safety valve at the connection of the appellant's private drain with the street sewer, and not in the appellant's cellar, and that had it installed such a valve at the sewer connection, the filling up of the sewer would have closed the valve and the rain water from the appellant's roof (which drains by means of a pipe inside the building into the private drain and thence into the sewer) would have been unable to get into the sewer and would have flooded the appellant's cellar. The answer is that so long as the sewer was not filled the rain water from the roof would freely flow into it, and that if it could not get away and backed into the cellar, it would not be on account of the valve but because the sewer was filled and, valve or no valve, the rain water could not have gone into the sewer and must have backed into the cellar. It follows therefore that the flooding of the cellar by the rain water would be caused not by the valve, but because the sewer was completely full, and could carry no more water. And because the valve was not there, not only the rain water from the roof but the sewer water as well backed into the appellant's cellar. It may be useful to add that under articles 1382-1384 of the Code Napoleon, similar to our own articles as to damages caused by things, the liability of a commune for the flooding of a house connected with a public sewer, through the insufficiency of the public sewer, is fully recognized. Thus the Conseil d'Etat decided in 1895, in a case of Ville de Paris c. Nissou[24] that\nl'inondation des caves d'une maison par suite du d\u00e9bordement des eaux d'un \u00e9gout dont la capacit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante, constitue un dommage provenant de l'ex\u00e9cution d'un travail public, et dont la ville, qui a construit l'\u00e9gout, doit r\u00e9paration au propri\u00e9taire (L. 28 pluv. an 8, art. 4.\nSee also the note appended to this decision.\nThe law referred to (loi du 29 pluviose, an 8, 17 f\u00e9vrier, 1800) has no bearing on the question of liability for flooding, but merely determines the jurisdiction of the conseil de pr\u00e9fecture to pronounce on questions arising as to damages caused by the construction of public works.\nAnd in another case, Deloison c. Ville de Paris[25] it was also held by the Conseil d'Etat that\nla commune est responsable des dommage caus\u00e9s par une inondation survenue dans les caves d'un immeuble et provenant du refoulement des eaux de l'\u00e9gout public qui ont d\u00e9bord\u00e9 par le manchon des tinettes filtrantes plac\u00e9es dans ces caves, alors cette inondation a eu pour cause, d'une part, l'insuffisance de l'\u00e9gout, et, d'autre part, les conditions dans lesquelles la commune a autoris\u00e9 la pose des tinettes et dans lesquelles elle a contract\u00e9 \u00e0 leur sujet un abonnement.\nSee also Fabreguettes, Trait\u00e9 des eaux publiques et des eaux priv\u00e9es, vol. 2, p. 394, note 1.\nI take it therefore that the liability of the respondent for the July flooding admits of no doubt. The only question is whether the respondent is alone answerable for the whole amount of the damages suffered by the appellant. If the latter contributed to these damages, if it neglected any precaution which it should have taken to avoid the flooding of its cellar by an overflow from the street sewer, the rule of the civil law is that there being common fault, the injured party should bear a share of the damages proportionate to its own fault,\nSee Price v. Roy[26], also Planiol, Droit Civil, 7th ed. vol. 2, no. 899, and, as having a bearing on cases of flooding, Epoux Laugier c. Delarbre, Cassation, 11 novembre, 1896[27].\nThe evidence shows that automatic safety valves are in common use in Montreal and are installed by the owners of buildings with deep cellars so as to prevent an overflow from the street sewers. The appellant well knew that its deep cellar rendered a flooding probable in case of heavy rains, for it alleges that its cellar had previously been flooded, and after its experience in the previous March, it acted most imprudently in storing thousands of dollars worth of perishable goods in its cellar and in not resorting to the simple device of placing an automatic safety valve on the sewer connection. I do not think that the appellant was justified in thus neglecting to adopt a well-known precautionary measure and in expecting at the same time to be fully compensated by the city for any damage caused to its goods. To my mind, the rule is well stated by Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, 6th ed., vol. 1, no. 660, as follows:\nSi la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e a elle-m\u00eame offert occasion au dommage par une faute personnelle, est-elle recevable \u00e0 s'en plaindre?\nLa Cour de Cassation d\u00e9cide que cette circonstance ne fait pas dispara\u00eetre la responsabilit\u00e9, mais a seulement pour effet de l'att\u00e9nuer. Nous pensons, pour notre part, qu'il ne peut y avoir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de r\u00e8gle absolue. Il n'en est plus ici comme dans l'hypoth\u00e8se d'un d\u00e9lit. Celui qui, dans une intention malveillante, commet un acte de nature \u00e0 nuire \u00e0 autrui, en est responsable alors m\u00eame que la victime du dommage y aurait contribu\u00e9 par sa faute. Mais les cons\u00e9quences d'une simple imprudence, d'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re inattention, peuvent \u00eatre absorb\u00e9es compl\u00e8tement par celles de 1'imprudence plus grave, de la faute lourde, et surtout du d\u00e9lit commis par la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e. C'est aux tribunaux \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier si la faute imputable au plaignant est seulement de nature \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur, ou si elle est assez grave pour rendre la personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e compl\u00e8tement irrecevable \u00e0 se plaindre du pr\u00e9judice \u00e9prouv\u00e9.\nEven accepting the doctrine of the Judicial Committee that the liability here is one imposed by the law irrespective of any presumption of fault, I cannot think that the conduct of the injured party, in so far as it may have contributed to the damage, should be disregarded. It is no doubt difficult in a case like this to divide the damages so that each party shall bear a share exactly proportioned to its own fault or imprudence, but I am convinced that here the appellant should assume a substantial part of the damages it could easily have prevented. After due consideration, I think that justice will be done to both parties if the liability for the damages caused by the July flooding is equally divided between them.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and condemn the respondent to pay to the appellant $1,507.61 with interest and the costs of an action for that amount in the Superior Court, except the cost of evidence. The action for the March flooding was dismissed with costs by the Court of King's Bench and the appeal to this court is quashed for lack of jurisdiction, so that this part of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench stands. The evidence dealt with both floodings, and I think in view of the result that each party should bear the expense of its own evidence. As but one appeal was taken in the Court of King's Bench and in this court, and as one action stands dismissed and the other is partially maintained, my opinion is that each party should bear its own costs both in this court and in the Court of King's Bench.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davidson, Wainwright, Alexander & Elder.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laurendeau, Archambault, Damphousse, Jarry, Butler & St. Pierre.\n[1] Q.R. 29 K.B. 338.\n[2] Q.R. 2 S.C. 305.\n[3] 57 Can.

Boivin (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1920 : March 12; 1920 :May 4.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nSale\u2014Rescission\u2014Defective goods\u2014Redhibitory action\u2014Part of the goods sold\u2014Tender\u2014Arts. 1152, 1162, 1164, 1496, 1526, 1644 C.C.\nThe respondent brought an action for rescission of the sale of 1214 cases of matches alleged to have been defective, out of a total sale of 5,115 cases; and he declared, in his statement of claim, that he was ready to deliver up the defective cases on being recouped their cost. During the trial, the respondent sold 57 cases and the trial court ordered the rescission of the sale as to the remaining 1,157 cases.\nHeld, that the action was redhibitory in character, and that such an action is maintainable as to any part of the goods sold which is proved to have been defective.\nHeld, also, that, notwithstanding the sale of part of the cases pending the action, and the consequent inability to return them, the respondent can still recover the price of the remaining 1,157 cases, which he is ready to return to the appellant upon the reimbursement of the price of sale.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 28 K.B. 486) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge[2] and maintaining the respondent's, plaintiff's, action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. E. Perreault K.C. and Napol\u00e9on Garceau K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. and Morin for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion for the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge (1) and the learned Justices Carroll and Martin in the Court of King's Bench (2), to which I can add nothing useful, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal, I think, fails.\nAnglin J.\u2014So well does the evidence support the plaintiff's contention that the defects in the 1,157 cases of matches, in respect of which he has judgment for repayment by the appellants of $5,133.52, were such as to justify their rejection that the attempt to secure a reversal of the finding to that effect, confirmed by the Court of King's Bench, is quite hopeless.\nOn the questions raised as to the nature of the action and as to the right of the plaintiff to sue for rescission in respect of only a part of the goods purchased and as to the effect of inability to return 57 of the 1,214 cases, to recover the price of which he originally sued, I have had the advantage of reading the judgments prepared by my brothers Brodeur and Mignault and I concur in their conclusions. For the reasons stated by them I am of the opinion that the action is redhibitory in character, that the sales were severable, that an action for rescission is maintainable as to any number of cases proved to have been defective, and that, notwithstanding the sale of the 57 cases pending the action and his consequent inability to return them, the plaintiff may recover the price of the remaining 1,157 cases, which he is prepared to deliver to the defendants on being recouped their cost.\nBrodeur, J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action r\u00e9dhibitoire institu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 qui demande l'annulation de la vente de 1,214 caisses d'allumettes qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9es par l'appelante. Plusieurs moyens de d\u00e9fense avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s par l'appelante. Le seul qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement discut\u00e9 \u00e0 l'argument devant nous est que le demandeur n'a pas fait d'offres l\u00e9gales. D'autres sont mentionn\u00e9s au factum de l'appelante, mais comme la plupart d'entre eux reposent sur des questions de fait et que les cours inf\u00e9rieures se sont prononc\u00e9es contre l'appelante, cette derni\u00e8re n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos, et ce avec raison, d'insister sur ces moyens de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la plaidoirie orale.\nLa quantit\u00e9 d'allumettes vendues et livr\u00e9es \u00e9tait bien plus consid\u00e9rable que celle mentionn\u00e9e dans l'action. En effet, la d\u00e9fenderesse avait livr\u00e9 5,115 caisses au d\u00e9fendeur, tandis que la poursuite n'est que pour 1214.\nDans sa d\u00e9claration le demandeur se d\u00e9clare pr\u00eat \u00e0 remettre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse ces 1214 caisses de marchandises sur remboursement du prix qu'il a pay\u00e9.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure[3] a prononc\u00e9 la r\u00e9siliation de la vente de 1157 caisses, vu que pendant l'instance le demandeur avait dispos\u00e9 de 57 caisses. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en outre que le demandeur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu d'offrir autrement qu'il ne l'avait fait la marchandise en question et elle a condamn\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 en payer au demandeur la valeur quand ce dernier lui livrera ces 1,157 caisses.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel[4].\nEn cour sup\u00e9rieure, on s'est demand\u00e9 si lorsque plusieurs choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 comprises dans la m\u00eame vente le vice r\u00e9dhibitoire de l'une donnait lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du march\u00e9 pour le tout ou seulement pour cette chose. Dans le cas actuel le demandeur, qui avait achet\u00e9 5,115 caisses d'allumettes pouvait-il porter son action en rescission que pour 1,214 caisses? Ou encore, ayant poursuivi pour 1,214 caisses, pouvait-il vendre 57 caisses pendant l'instance et obtenir par le jugement la r\u00e9solution de la vente pour la diff\u00e9rence, soit 1,157 caisses? En d'autres termes, l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire est-elle divisible?\nLa vente et la livraison de ces marchandises se sont faites \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques. Le prix stipul\u00e9 \u00e9tait de tant par caisse et il variait selon la marque de la marchandise de $5.75 \u00e0 $7.20 la caisse.\nQuelques marques paraissent meilleures les unes que les autres; alors je crois que l'on pouvait l\u00e9galement r\u00e9clamer la r\u00e9solution de la vente que pour les caisses qui contenaient des marchandises d\u00e9fectueuses et que le demandeur pouvait maintenir la vente pour les bonnes caisses et ne demander l'annulation que pour les autres.\nPothier, dans son trait\u00e9 de la Vente, aux nos. 226 et suivants, discute cette question et nous dit d'abord que si la chose qui a le vice r\u00e9dhibitoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 seule l'objet principal de la vente et que les autres n'aient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues que comme les accessoires, la r\u00e9dhibition de la chose principale entra\u00eene celle de toutes les accessoires: mais, ajoute-t-il\nQuand les choses vendues sont \u00e9galement principales il faut examiner si elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues comme faisant ensemble un tout et comme \u00e9tant telles que l'une n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue sans l'autre, comme lorsqu'on a vendu deux chevaux de carosse, une couple de b\u0153ufs, etc.: en ce cas, le vice r\u00e9dhibitoire de l'une de ces choses donne lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9dhibition de tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu et l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire ne peut en ce cas s'exercer que pour partie. Mais si les choses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues \u00e9taient ind\u00e9pendantes les unes des autres, l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire n'aura lieu que pour celle qui a un vice, quand m\u00eame toutes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues pour un m\u00eame prix: car encore que cette circonstance jointe \u00e0 d'autres serve \u00e0 faire pr\u00e9sumer que les unes n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues sans les autres, elle n'est pas n\u00e9anmoins seule d\u00e9cisive. C'est pourquoi l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire pourra avoir lieu pour cette seule chose et le vendeur sera tenu de restituer le prix de cette chose suivant la ventilation qui sera faite sur le total du prix.\nCes principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par Pothier nous permettent de dire que dans le cas actuel o\u00f9 les allumettes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues pour des prix diff\u00e9rents suivant l'\u00e9tiquette de chaque caisse, rien n'emp\u00eache de r\u00e9clamer l'annulation que pour un certain nombre de caisses et maintenir la vente pour les autres. Si pendant l'instance le demandeur a trouv\u00e9 aussi que certaines caisses dont il avait originairement demand\u00e9 l'annulation de la vente n'\u00e9taient pas entach\u00e9es de vices, ou si pour d'autres raisons il en a dispos\u00e9, rien n'emp\u00eache le tribunal, dans ce cas, de maintenir l'action pour les autres. Il n'y a pas de doute, comme le dit l'honorable juge-en-chef Lamothe, que dans ce cas l'action quanti minoris peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ancier: mais vu l'opinion de Pothier que je viens de citer, il me semble que l'acheteur peut \u00e9galement exercer l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire pour les caisses qui \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es de vices. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la cour de cassation que la r\u00e9siliation de la chose vendue peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e pour partie seulement lorsque la chose vendue est susceptible de livraisons partielles. Dalloz, 1871-1-11. En d'autres termes, je viens \u00e0 la conclusion que l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire dans ces circonstances est divisible.\nL'action doit-elle \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d'offres r\u00e9elles? Je comprends que s'il s'agissait d'un paiement on ne pourrait se lib\u00e9rer de son obligation qu'en faisant des offres conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions des articles 1162 et suivants du code civil qui nous indiquent comment les offres peuvent \u00e9quivaloir, quant au d\u00e9biteur, \u00e0 un paiement. Mais quand il s'agit d'une action r\u00e9dhibitoire, l'acheteur est-il oblig\u00e9 de se d\u00e9poss\u00e9der de la chose avant qu'on lui en restitue le prix ou peut-il simplement demander aux tribunaux de d\u00e9clarer que la chose vendue \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d'un vice qui en rend la vente annulable ?\nDans le cas actuel il se d\u00e9clare pr\u00eat, dans son action, \u00e0 remettre les marchandises vici\u00e9es. Il demande par ses conclusions \u00e0 ce que la vente soit annul\u00e9e et \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse soit tenu de lui rembourser le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9.\nLa cour a annul\u00e9 le contrat: mais elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'aurait droit de recouvrer le prix qu'il avait pay\u00e9 qu'en livrant les marchandises. C'est \u00e0 lui maintenant de s'ex\u00e9cuter s'il veut recouvrer son argent. Il lui faut faire des offres.\nD'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la d\u00e9fenderesse peut revendiquer les marchandises dont la vente est annul\u00e9e en offrant de rembourser ce qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9.\nVoil\u00e0 la situation l\u00e9gale qui est faite aux parties par le jugement. L'appelante invoque l\u2019article 1526 du code civil qui dit que\nl'acheteur a le choix de rendre la chose et de se faire restituer le prix, ou de garder la chose et de se faire rendre une partie du prix suivant \u00e9valuation.\nCet article \u00e9nonce seulement les droits d'action que l'acheteur tromp\u00e9 peut exercer. Il a le choix de l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire ou de l'action quanti minoris selon qu'il veuille garder la chose ou non. S'il veut remettre la chose et obtenir la restitution du prix, il prend l'action en r\u00e9dhibition. Alors il sera bien oblig\u00e9 de rendre la chose si l'acheteur lui rembourse le prix. Mais tant que l'argent qu'il a vers\u00e9 ne lui est pas rembours\u00e9 il se trouve dans la position du vendeur non pay\u00e9, qui n'est pas tenu, nous dit l'art. 1496 C.C. de d\u00e9livrer la chose tant qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9.\nComment la d\u00e9fenderesse peut-elle se plaindre qu'il n'y a pas eu d'offres plus formelles que celles mentionn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9claration? Car elle contestait le droit du demandeur de faire r\u00e9silier la vente, et alors, tant que ce d\u00e9bat n'\u00e9tait pas vid\u00e9, quel int\u00e9r\u00eat avait-elle de se plaindre que la marchandise ne lui e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement offerte?\nFuzier Herman sous l'article 1644 du code civil dit que\nsi l'acheteur opte pour l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire et triomphe dans ses pr\u00e9tentions, il doit rendre au vendeur la chose vendue.\nIl ne fait pas de cette obligation de rendre la chose une condition pr\u00e9alable de l'exercice du droit d'action.\nL'obligation qui est impos\u00e9e au demandeur sur l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire est de remettre la chose. Cette obligation ou ce paiement doit s'ex\u00e9cuter \u00e0 son domicile, nous dit l'article 1152 du code civil. Et s'il d\u00e9sire recouvrer le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9, il peut alors faire des offres suivant les articles 1164 et 1165 C.C. et obtenir un jugement de condamnation formelle contre la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nJ'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion cependant que les offres faites par l'action, quoiqu'elles ne fussent pas tr\u00e8s explicites, eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes. Mais comme la cour sup\u00e9rieure n'a condamn\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer que sur livraison et que le demandeur s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 satisfait de cette condamnation conditionnelle, je dois n\u00e9cessairement en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appel est mal fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014La seule difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9elle en cette cause est au sujet de 57 caisses d'allumettes (sur une quantit\u00e9 totale de 1214 caisses) que le demandeur a vendues au cours de l'instance et que partant il ne peut rendre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse. Il avait achet\u00e9 en tout 5,115 caisses, et il ne demandait l'annulation de la vente que pour 1,214 caisses. Dans les jugements a quo on a discut\u00e9 \u00e9galement la nature de l'action m\u00eame, soit r\u00e9dhibitoire, soit quanti minoris, mais la d\u00e9claration conclut \u00e0 l'annulation des achats faits par le demandeur de la d\u00e9fenderesse, ce qui d\u00e9montre que l'action est r\u00e9dhibitoire et non quanti minoris.\nQuelle que soit sa nature du reste, l'action est r\u00e9gie par l'article 1526 du code civil qui dit que\nl'acheteur a le choix de rendre la chose et de se faire restituer le prix, ou de garder la chose et se faire rendre une partie du prix suivant \u00e9valuation,\net ici, je suis d'avis que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une action r\u00e9dhibitoire.\nIl importe aussi de constater que les ventes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 tant la caisse, on peut consid\u00e9rer qu'il y a eu autant de ventes distinctes qu'il y a eu de caisses de vendues, de telle sorte que l'acheteur pouvait, si une partie seulement des caisses contenaient des marchandises d\u00e9fectueuses, demander l'annulation pour ces caisses, et garder les autres. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nMais en prenant son action r\u00e9dhibitoire, le demandeur devait rendre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse les caisses dont il demandait l'annulation de la vente. C'est la condition m\u00eame de son action d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1526 C.C. Le demandeur para\u00eet s'en \u00eatre rendu compte, car le paragraphe 7 de sa d\u00e9claration disait :\n7. Le demandeur a tojuours \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat et est encore pr\u00eat \u00e0 remettre la marchandise contre remboursement du prix qu'il a pay\u00e9.\nCe ne sont pas des offres bien formelles, mais la cour sup\u00e9rieure les a envisag\u00e9es comme telles, car elle a condamn\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer au demandeur $5,133.52, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de la signification de l'action et les d\u00e9pens,\nsur livraison par le demandeur des 1157 caisses d'allumettes qui restent de 1214 caisses mentionn\u00e9es dans son action.\nLa difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9elle est celle-ci. Le demandeur a opt\u00e9 pour l'annulation de la vente quant \u00e0 1214 caisses et il se d\u00e9clare pr\u00eat \u00e0 les remettre sur remboursement du prix qu'il avait pay\u00e9. Il devait donc, dit-on, conserver toutes ces caisses, c'\u00e9tait l'obligation qu'il avait assum\u00e9e par ses offres, pour les remettre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse. En disposant de ces 57 caisses, il a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette obligation et \u00e0 la condition \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e son action en l'envisageant comme action r\u00e9dhibitoire, et il a accept\u00e9 la vente et il ne peut maintenant r\u00e9ussir dans sa demande. Tel est le motif qui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le dissentiment de l'honorable juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. L'honorable juge Pelletier, \u00e9galement dissident, aurait trait\u00e9 l'action comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement l'action quanti minoris, et envisageant la totalit\u00e9 des ventes, n'aurait accord\u00e9 au demandeur que sept \u00e0 huit cents piastres, il ne pr\u00e9cise pas autrement le montant.\nEn pr\u00e9sence des deux jugements qui ont trouv\u00e9 la marchandise d\u00e9fecteuse, je ne serais pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter ce point. Je ne crois pas non plus devoir me rendre \u00e0 l'opinion de l'honorable juge Pelletier, et je ne discuterai que le motif du dissentiment de l'honorable juge-en-chef Lamothe.\nApr\u00e8s y avoir s\u00e9rieusement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, je crois qu'on peut voir, dans la vente par le demandeur de 57 caisses d'allumettes, un d\u00e9sistement partiel tacite de l'action qu'il avait intent\u00e9e. Il n'est pas douteux que le d\u00e9sistement peut n'\u00eatre que partiel, et comporter renonciation \u00e0 certains chefs seulement, ou \u00e0 une partie distincte d'une demande divisible, et la demande ici me para\u00eet clairement divisible. On appelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ce d\u00e9sistement partiel un retraxit, mais le nom' qu'on lui donne est assez indiff\u00e9rent, car il est certain que le droit de se d\u00e9sister partiellement, quand la demande est divisible, existe dans notre droit.\nOr le d\u00e9sistement peut \u00eatre tacite. Garsonnet, Proc\u00e9dure, tome 5, n\u00b0. 1179, p. 792, dit:\nOn distingue, quant \u00e0 la forme, trois esp\u00e8ces de d\u00e9sistement: 1\u00b0 le d\u00e9sistement amiable qui se fait dans la forme convenue entre les parties et sans nulle formalit\u00e9 si elles en sont tomb\u00e9es d'accord; 2\u00b0 le d\u00e9sistement tacite qui r\u00e9sulte d'une attitude incompatible avec le maintien d'une demande ant\u00e9rieurement form\u00e9e (d\u00e9saveu de l'action intent\u00e9e par un avou\u00e9 sans mandat sp\u00e9cial, poursuites \u00e0 fin d'ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement dont on a ant\u00e9rieurement appel\u00e9, second appel se substituant \u00e0 celui qu'on a d'abord interjet\u00e9, cession de biens offerte par un failli qui avait d'abord demand\u00e9 l'homologation de son concordat) : il ne se pr\u00e9sume pas, mais il n'exige aucune formalit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re et se fait ou se prouve comme tout autre contrat; 3\u00b0 le d\u00e9sistement judiciaire qui ne suppose pas l'accord des parties et exige deux ou m\u00eame trois formalit\u00e9s. Il est clair que les exemples de d\u00e9sistement tacite que Garsonnet donne ne sont pas limitatifs, car, comme il le dit lui-m\u00eame, le d\u00e9sistement tacite r\u00e9sulte d'une attitude incompatible avec le maintien d'une demande. Or ici le demandeur ayant pendant l'instance dispos\u00e9 de 57 caisses, et son action \u00e9tant une action divisible, il renon\u00e7ait tacitement par l\u00e0 \u00e0 sa demande pour l'annulation de la vente de ces caisses, car le fait de disposer de ces caisses \u00e9tait incompatible avec le maintien de la demande d'annulation en tant que ces caisses \u00e9taient concern\u00e9es.

Pourquoi alors dire que le fait de disposer de quelques caisses pendant l'instance enl\u00e8ve \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 son recours pour l'annulation des autres ventes? Tout ce que cela prouve, c'est que le demandeur n'avait pas raison de se plaindre de ces 57 caisses; cela ne d\u00e9montre nullement que les autres caisses \u00e9taient bonnes ou que le demandeur renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 s'en plaindre.\nL'objection que soul\u00e8ve la d\u00e9fenderesse me para\u00eet manquer de base.

Art. 7328.\u2014(Que.) 8 Geo. V., c. 71, s. 4.\nThe respondent had been in the appellant company's employment from the 5th of January, 1918 to the 1st of April, 1918, as a machinist helper at 32\u00bd cents an hour and from the 1st to the 19th of April, 1918 as an \"operator\" in munitions work being paid 15c. per shell, a somewhat higher rate of pay. During these periods the respondent's earnings amounted to $295.60. On the 19th of April, 1918, he was injured. He is debarred from recovery under the ''Workmen's Compensation Act\" if his yearly remuneration, calculated as contemplated by the statute, exceeded $1,200. Article 7328 R.S.Q. provides that \"in the case of workmen employed less than twelve months before the accident, such wages shall be the actual remuneration which they have received since they were employed in the business, plus the average remuneration received by workmen of the same class during the time necessary to complete the twelve months.\" The trial judge found the respondent entitled to a rent based on an annual remuneration of $960; and the Court of King's Bench, though finding the respondent not entitled to relief under the statute, awarded him $1,825 as damages at common law. Held that an action brought under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" and conducted to judgment as such cannot be converted on appeal into an action for damages under the common law.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The legislature, in adopting in 1909 as part of the law of Quebec the French Act upon workmen's compensation as enacted in 1898, may well be taken to have intended that the same construction should be placed upon article 7328 R.S.Q. as had been sanctioned in France by the Cour de Cassation in 1906.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The \"class\" intended by the statute is that in which the injured man was first employed.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014When there are other workmen of the same class as the injured man in the establishment to which he belonged, it is the average earnings of those workmen on which his complementary hypothetical remuneration should be computed; and it is only where there are not such workmen that the average earnings of outside workmen should be resorted to.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014In order to ascertain the \"average remuneration\" of the injured man, evidence must be adduced (and the trial judge's findings on these points are entitled to the greatest weight) 1st, of the period during which the injured man was employed; 2nd, of the workmen doing the same class of work in the establishment daring that period irrespective of their salary; 3rd, of the respective periods of employment of each of such workmen (per Anglin J. making deduction from the number of days comprised therein for loss of time which is exceptional and involuntary, whether ascribable to a cause personal to the employee or to non-operation of the establishment); 4th, of the total amount of the earnings of each of such workmen during the period. By adding together the earnings of all these workmen and dividing the total by the sum of the number of days included in their respective terms of employment added together, the average daily wage of the workmen during the period in question will be ascertained. If the quotient thus obtained be multiplied by 261 (the number of days comprised between the 19th April, 1917, and the 5th of January, 1918) the product will be the average total earnings during that period of a workman of the category to which the injured man belonged; and, this average added to the sum of $295.60 earned by the injured man during his actual employment will be the basic annual remuneration on which his right to recover will depend and his annual rent must be computed.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The manner of computing compensation is as follows: the average of aggregate earnings of employees of the class to which the injured man belonged at the time of the accident for each week during the statutory period preceding the accident should be taken and these averages averaged; and there is sufficient proof that upon this basis, the respondent is not entitled to relief under the statute. Per Anglin, Brodeur and Mignaulb, J.J.\u2014Counsel for the respondent in no event, will be entitled to his costs of factum, because in transcribing a passage from an author he had omitted a material part of the same passage which was against his pretentions.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, modifying the judgment of the trial court and maintaining the respondent's, plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and De Witt for the appellant.\nAudet and Sauv\u00e9 for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The enactment R.S.Q. 7328, by which in the last analysis the rights of appellant are to be determined under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" reads as follows:\u2014\nThe wages upon which the rent is based shall be, in the case of a workman engaged in the business during the twelve months next before the accident, the actual remuneration allowed him during such time, whether in money or in kind.\nIn the case of workmen employed less than twelve months before the accident, such wages shall be the actual remuneration which they have received since they were in the business, plus the average remuneration received by workmen of the same class during the time necessary to complete the twelve months.\nIf the work is not continuous the year's wages shall be calculated both according to the remuneration received while the work went on, and according to the workman's earnings during the rest of the year.\nIf the computation designed by this reaches a result whereby it becomes clear that the injured workman has been earning over $1,200 for the year, then he does not fall within the class which the Act was designed to protect according to the scale in force when the accident here in question occurred. The above quoted section in the first sentence thereof does not directly touch upon what we have to deal with but incidentally both it and the third sentence help to illuminate what the draftsman had in view and gives room for a consideration of the total possible earnings of respondent in both classes of work and a comparison of the totals in both classes of work in trying to reach a conclusion as to the average wage that is to be had in view to apply to the remainder of the twelve months. But that will not help respondent unless we go a step further and unsettle things by discarding the rule the court below in previous ones had settled.\nI regret to say that I am unable to put upon the above quoted part of said Act any such interpretation and construction as will when applied to the relevant facts bring the respondent within the provisions of the Act. And such seems to have been also the unanimous opinion of the Court of King's Bench.\nA majority of that court saw its way to give relief independently of the said Act, although the prayer of the declaration is exclusively confined to the claim made in virtue of said Act.\nI should not feel much difficulty if the case had clearly been fought out upon all the facts relative to either alternative as the legal basis for recovery, and been heard by a tribunal that the parties had clearly adopted as competent and satisfactory to them for such purpose.\nBut for the purposes of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" there can be no trial by jury.\nHow can I say that appellant by silence or conduct waived in any way that right, when it was thus bound by the provisions of the Act to a trial without a jury of the case made by the declaration and confined by the conclusions thereto so made?\nWe are told by counsel for appellant that there is no possibility of two such claims being joined according to Quebec law, and I can find nothing in respondent's argument to the contrary except the citation of the provision of the Act properly reserving the rights of the workman to fall back on his other legal grounds if need be.\nThat does not seem to allow the trial of the two alternative claims in one action.\nI agree with the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Carroll.\nAnd though driven to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs if appellant insists thereon, I hope it will not insist on costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The appeal, I think, should be allowed.\nThe manner of compensation in my judgment is this. The average of aggregate earnings of employees of the class to which the respondent belonged at the time of the accident for each week during the statutory period preceding the accident should be taken and these averages averaged.\nThe evidence is not specifically pointed to this; but I think there is sufficient in the record to shew that upon this basis the appeal must succeed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The questions for determination on this appeal are whether the Court of King's Bench properly held the appellants liable at common law in this action for damages for personal injuries sustained by the respondent on the 19th of April, 1918, while in their employment, and, if not, whether the respondent, as he claimed and as was held by the learned trial judge (Mr. Justice Guerin), is entitled to recover under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of Quebec (R.S.Q., 1909, Arts. 7321 et seq., as amended), and, if so, on what basis.\nThe action was brought and relief claimed distinctly and solely under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The trial was conducted on that footing. Liability at common law does not appear to have entered the mind of either party. That issue was not tried. No evidence was directed to it. The trial judge found the plaintiff entitled to a rent under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" based on an annual remuneration of $960, but his judgment unfortunately leaves us in the dark as to the means or method by which he computed the hypothetical earnings under paragraph 2 of Art. 7328, R.S.Q. for the portion of the twelve months mentioned therein during which the plaintiff was not in the defendant's employment. Barret c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, etc.[1] (49e esp\u00e8ce). Not only is the judgment of the Court of King's Bench awarding $1,825 as damages at common law ultra petita, but it condemns the appellants upon a claim never presented, which they have had no opportunity to meet, and which, if presented, might have been tried by a different tribunal.\nWith respect, I entirely concur in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Carroll on this branch of the case. The judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench cannot stand. Indeed, the principle of the recent dismissal of the plaintiff's action by that court in Canadian Steel Foundries v. Stychlinsky[2] (the converse case) appears to be opposed to it. But should the plaintiff recover under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act?'' That depends on whether his yearly remuneration, calculated as contemplated by that statute, exceeded $1,200 (8 Geo. V., c. 71, s. 4). If not, his right to compensation under the statute is reasonably clear. The difficulty in the case arises from the facts that the plaintiff had been in the defendant's employment only a little over three months (5th of January to 19th of April) when injured, and that between the 5th of January and the 1st of April he had been employed as a machinist helper, at 32\u00bd cts. an hour, and from the 1st to the 19th of April as an \"operator,\" being paid in that capacity 15 cts. per shell\u2014a somewhat higher rate of pay.\nArt. 7328 of the statute reads as follows:\u2014\nThe wages upon which the rent is based shall be, in the case of a workman engaged in the business during the twelve months next before the accident, the actual remuneration allowed him during such time, whether in money or in kind.\nIn the case of workmen employed less than twelve months before the accident, such wages shall be the actual remuneration which they have received since they were employed in the business, plus the average remuneration received by workmen of the same class during the time necessary to complete the twelve months.\nIf the work is not continuous the year's wages shall be calculated both according to the remuneration received while the work went on, and according to the workman's earnings during the rest of the year.\nThe plaintiff's work having been continuous, the case falls within the second paragraph of the articles.\nThe ascertainment of the plaintiff's actual earnings from the 5th of January to the 19th of April presents no difficulty. They amount to $295.60. Whether\nthe average remuneration received by workmen of the same class during the time necessary to complete the twelve months\nexceeded $904.40 (the balance of $1,200) is the problem presented. What is the proper construction of the statutory language just quoted ? A comparison of their provisions shews that the French Act of the 9th of April, 1898, and the statute first passed in Quebec in 1909 (c. 66) are couched in substantially the same terms. The latter was, no doubt, taken from the former. In the particular clause under consideration, just quoted, the language of both Acts is identical. The phrase\nqu'ont re\u00e7ue * * * les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie\nof the second paragraph of Art. 10 of the French Act of 1898 is reproduced verbatim in the French version of Art. 7328 of the Quebec Revised Statutes. That phrase was replaced in France, in 1905, by the words\nqu'ils auraient pu recevoir * * * d'apr\u00e8s la remuneration moyenne des ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie * * *\nAlthough Loubat says\nle nouveau texte du second alin\u00e9a de l'art 10 ne diff\u00e8re de l'ancien que dans la forme (\"Risque professional\" 3e \u00e9d. No 665),\nit seems to me that the average earnings actually received by a group of workmen during a given period may differ materially from the average earnings that the same group might have received in the same period. In the one case time lost through causes attributable to the workmen themselves and not to their employer is included in the number of hours, days, or weeks on which the average is computed. In the other it may not be. But, however that may be, subject to allowances for exceptional and involuntary loss of time, as hereinafter explained, it is actual earnings\u2014not possible earnings\u2014that the Quebec statute prescribes as the basis of computation.\nThe text of the statute does not explicitly require that the category of workmen whose average wages or earnings is to serve as the basis of calculation should be confined to employees of the establishment in which the injured workman was employed. (Loubat, No. 668). In many cases\u2014for instance, where an industry has been recently started, or where there is no other workman of the same class employed in the establishment\u2014that basis is not available and resort must be had to the earnings of workmen of the same class in other establishments. (ibid). Indeed there is not a little to be said for the view that the hypothetical remuneration of the injured man \"for the time necessary to complete the twelve months\" should be computed upon the average earnings of all workmen of a similar class in the community during that period. But the French commentators\u2014Loubat, in the work cited No. 668, and Sachet (L\u00e9gislation sur les Accidents du Travail, 5e \u00e9d. No 854)\u2014seem to make it clear that the contrary view had been well established in France before the Quebec statute was passed\u2014that where there were other workmen of the same class as the injured man in the establishment to which he belonged it was the average earnings of those workmen on which his complementary hypothetical remuneration should be computed and that it is only where there are not such earnings available that the average earnings of outside workmen should be resorted to. In adopting the French Act as part of the law of Quebec the legislature may well be taken to have intended that the construction so placed upon it in France should likewise be adopted. I had occasion recently, in Arnold v. Dominion Trust Co.[3], to refer to the authorities bearing on this aspect of the case.\nNor is it unreasonable that an employer should be in a position to ascertain from his own records the basis on which the compensation of an injured workman should be calculated. Moreover, it is that workman's probable earnings which have to be established and it is not unlikely that what the legislators had in mind was what he would have earned had he been in the same establishment during the period for which the estimate is to be made.\nAnother question, which has been somewhat debated, is whether the class or category intended is that to which the workman belonged at the time he sustained his injuries, or that in which he was placed when he first entered the establishment, or some average of any two or more classes in which he may have worked while there. But when it is borne in mind that the matter to be estimated is the average earnings of workmen of the same class during the period necessary to complete \"the twelve months next before the accident\"\u2014that the statute is merely intended to provide an artificial rule for cases in which during a part of the twelve months' period the facts necessary to bring the plaintiff within the first paragraph of the article do not exist\u2014it seems fairly clear that resort should be had to the average earnings of workmen of the class in which the injured man was first employed. The law would seem to contemplate it to be probable that had he spent the preceding three, six or nine months (or whatever the time may be) necessary to complete the twelve months' period in the establishment in which he was injured, he would have been employed in that class, though it may well be that if engaged sooner his advance to a higher grade of employment would have come earlier. The view that the original class of employment determines the category is taken by Cabouat (\"Accidents du Travail, Vol. 2, No 581\") and has the sanction of a decision of the Cour de Cassation, Bourdis c. Villard[4] The Court of Review in Pelletier v. Montreal Locomotive Works[5], took the same view. A contrary opinion of the Court of Appeal at Dijon in Compagnie des Mines de Blanzy c. Rose[6], is adversely criticised by the reporter (n. 1) although favourably received by Sachet (Nos. 847 and 856). Mr. Justice Pelletier who delivered the opinion of the majority of the Court of King's Bench also adopted it. He says:\nIl faut prendre, comme je l'ai dit tant\u00f4t, la moyenne de ce qu'ont gagn\u00e9 les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, c'est-\u00e0-dire la cab\u00e9gorie dans laquelle se trouvait l'ouvrier lorsque l'accident est arriv\u00e9.\nWith respect, in this particular, I prefer the interpretation of M. Cabouat and the Cour de Cassation and in regard to this matter also it may fairly be said that the legislature in adopting the French statute intended that the same interpretation should be placed upon it as had already been sanctioned by the highest court of France.\nThere remains the question how the average remuneration of workmen in the defendant's establishment in the same category with the plaintiff during the required period (i.e., from 19th of April, 1917, to the 5th of January, 1918) is to be computed.\nThe Court of King's Bench followed the method which it had itself formulated in St Maurice Paper Co. v. Marcotte[7], stated in the headnote of that case as follows:\nCe salaire moyen se compute, quand les ouvriers sont pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'heure, en divisant le montant total qu'ils ont re\u00e7u durant la p\u00e9riode compl\u00e9mentaire par le nombre d'heures qu'ils ont travaill\u00e9 durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. This mode of calculation was again approved by the same court in Canadian Steel Foundries Co. v. Stychlinsky[8]. With great respect, I cannot think it is correct. By making the divisor the number of hours during which the men actually worked, the element of lost time being entirely ignored, the result attained is not the actual average earnings of the workmen during the entire period but what they might have earned, had there been no loss of time. The court would appear to have read \"qu'ils ont re\u00e7ue\" as the equivalent of \"qu'ils auraient pu recevoir.\" The divisor should have been not the number of hours during which the men actually worked but the number of working hours during the period in question, assuming that all the men were in the defendants' employment for the entire period.\nThe method prescribed by Sachet (No. 854) is to add together the earnings of the workmen of the same class during the complementary period and divide the total by the number of men engaged. Where all these men have been in the employment of the establishment during the entire period this method would be absolutely fair and would carry out the intent of the statute. Cabouat (Vol. 2, No. 580) prescribes the same method, adding, however, that the earnings of the workmen should be calculated\nsuivant les r\u00e8gies combin\u00e9es des articles 10, par. 1, et 10, par. 4, c'est-\u00e0-dire en tenant compte des p\u00e9riodes de ch\u00f4mage exceptionnel et involontaire.\" See too Sachet, Nos. 869 and 878.\nBut it cannot be used where the workmen have been employed, some for shorter, some for longer portions of the period in question. That would seem to be the case here as the following table (prepared by Francis Dockrili, the defendant's accountant) of the earnings of each of fifteen men employed by the defendant company at the rate of 32\u00bd cents an hour as machinist helpers during the period from the 19th of April, 1917, to the 5th of January, 1918, would indicate.\n$211.50\n$ 85.95\n$247.30\n247.90\n140.25\n77.90\n238.65\n244.65\n157.20\n108.85\n160.55\n380.90\n102.50\n216.95\n226.55\nIt may be that all the machinist helpers in the defendants' employment who could fairly be held to be in the same category as the plaintiff were paid 32\u00bd cents an hour. Sachet defines the category as including\nceux qui dans un \u00e9tablissement industriel ont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame emploi et touchent le m\u00eame salaire que la victime.\nLoubat's definition ignores the element of equality in wages. It is:\u2014\nCeux qui font le m\u00eame travail ou un travail analogue. No 667.\nM. Louis Sarrut in a copious note in D. 1917.1.5. says:\nLes ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, ce sont ceux qui exercent le m\u00eame m\u00e9tier, la m\u00eame profession que l'ouvrier victime de l'accident.\nCabouat, Vol. 2, No. 581, says:\nDes explications donn\u00e9es par M. Poirier, il r\u00e9sulte que l'on doit entendre par ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie que la victime, ceux qui exercent une fonction correspondante \u00e0 la sienne ou ex\u00e9cutent un m\u00eame travail sans tenir compte d'ailleurs des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s d'aptitude professionnelle susceptibles d'entra\u00eener des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s de salaire * * *\nOn this point I respectfully agree in the interpretation of the three last mentioned authors adopted by the late Chief Justice of Quebec in St. Maurice Paper Co. v. Marcotte[9]. If it might be assumed that the fifteen men whose gross earnings Dockrili gives were the only employees of the defendant company in the same category with the plaintiff during the period in question it would still be necessary to have information as to how long each of them remained in the company's employment as a machinist helper.\nUnfortunately the record does not contain that information. Moreover, Mr. Dockrill states that there were quite a number of other machinist helpers engaged at different rates of pay. His computations of averages are all based on the erroneous view that to ascertain the actual average earnings per hour of a class of workmen during a given period it is only necessary to divide their total earnings during the period by the number of hours of work which they have actually put in, instead of by the number of hours which they might have put in had there been no involuntary and exceptional loss of time.\nThe burden was on the plaintiff to furnish to the court the information necessary to enable it to determine the average salary of workmen of his class during the period necessary to complete the twelve months. Pelletier v. Montreal Locomotive Works[10]. He has not done so.\nThere is nothing to shew that the lacking information cannot readily be obtained. On the contrary Mr. Dockrill's testimony rather indicates that it can. There is in my opinion no justification for taking either the wages earned by the plaintiff himself while engaged with the defendants as machinist helper or his earnings in other employment during the rest of the twelve months' period as the basis on which to compute his hypothetical earnings for that time. I agree with Mr. Loubat when he says (No. 666): 666. La loi n'admet aucun \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 cette seconde partie du salaire annuel. D\u00e8s lors, sous aucun pr\u00e9texte, les tribunaux ne sauraient lui substituer un autre terme de comparaison, par exemple, le salaire que l'ouvrier aurait re\u00e7u pendant le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois, \u00e9valu\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective depuis son entr\u00e9e dans l'entreprise (contra, Alais, 5 Janv. 1900. Gaz. Pal. 1900.1. 230). Ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9, du reste, condamn\u00e9 par le rejet d'un amendement dans ce sens, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. F\u00e9lix Martin au S\u00e9nat (S\u00e9n., 28 oct. 1895; J. off., p. 870). Le salaire que l'ouvrier aurait gagn\u00e9 doit donc \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 uniquement d'apr\u00e8s le salaire moyen des ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'apr\u00e8s la moyenne des salaires des ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie pendant la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois.\nCabouat, (Vol. 2, No. 575) clearly expresses the same opinion. The case must therefore be remitted to the Superior Court to obtain the information necessary to permit of the requirements of the statute being complied with.\nIn computing the period of service of each workman deduction must be made for loss of time by him which is exceptional and involuntary\u2014\"ch\u00f4mages exceptionels non-volontaires\"\u2014whether ascribable to a cause personal to him or to non-operation of the establishment. Thus absence due to serious illness, injury or military service should be allowed for, but not absence attributable to laziness or caprice or to mere casual indisposition such as ordinarily befalls workmen from time to time. So allowance must be made for loss of time occasioned by extensive repairs, (grosses r\u00e9parations) destruction of premises by fire, total or partial, and unusual depression in business, or any other abnormal cause.\nThese allowances are specifically provided for by paragraph 4 of Art. 10 of the French Act of 1905, stated by Sachet (No. 869) merely to embody the effect of decisions on the French law of 1898, which, like the Quebec Act, did not specifically provide for them. An admirable note of M. Planiol, (D.1904.1.289), deals with this subject. The determination of the trial judge as to the deductions to be made for loss of time, and likewise his finding as to what workmen should be classed as belonging to the same category as the plaintiff will be entitled to the greatest weight. Under the French system such matters \"appartiennent au juge du fait souverainement.\" D. 1903.1.572.\nIn the Superior Court proof must be adduced\n(1) to establish what persons engaged as machinist helpers by the defendants during the period from the 19th of April, 1917, to the 5th of January, 1918, were in the same category as the plaintiff, i.e., doing the same class of work, unless the evidence of Mr. Dockrill should be accepted as sufficient proof that it comprised the 27 men of whom he speaks and no others;\n(2) the number of days during that period for which each of these workmen was in the defendants' employment as a machinist helper, i.e., from the commencement of the period or the later date at which he entered the establishment or was put in that class until he left it or was discharged or the period expired. (From the period of his employment, however, must be deducted any exceptional and involuntary loss of time of the workman as above indicated); and\n(3) the total amount of his earnings while so employed. By adding together the earnings of all these workmen\nand dividing the total by the sum of the number of days included in their respective terms of employment (computed as aforesaid) added together, the average daily, wages of the workmen during the period in question will be ascertained. If the quotient thus obtained be multiplied by 261 (the number of days comprised in the period between the 19th of April, 1917, and the 5th of January, 1918) the product will be the average earnings during that period of a workman of the category to which the plaintiff belonged. The result will be practically the same as if working days merely had been made the basis of computation in both cases, and the method adopted has the advantage of simplicity. The sum of the amount thus ascertained and the $295.64 earned by the plaintiff between the 5th of January and the 19th of April, 1918, will be the basic annual remuneration on which, if less than $1200 (as I incline to think it will turn out to be), the rent to which the plaintiff is entitled under the provisions of Arts. 7322 and 7326 of the Workmen's Compensation Act must be computed.\nIn the result the defendants' appeal must be allowed. While the plaintiff cannot have the restoration of the judgment of the Superior Court sought by his cross-appeal, because it is impossible to tell whether in computing the basic annual remuneration at $960 the learned trial judge proceeded as I understand the statute to require (the respondent suggests in his factum that for the complementary period he took the plaintiff's earnings in other employment\u2014but I find nothing in the record to warrant the statement that a course so contrary to the provisions of the statute was in fact adopted), his action should not be dismissed, as the appellants ask, but will be referred back to the Superior Court to permit of the additional facts being established, knowledge of which is necessary to ascertain, in the manner indicated above, the basic annual remuneration on which the plaintiff's rights must be determined.\nShould such annual remuneration be found to exceed $1,200 the action must be dismissed with costs throughout. Should it be found not to exceed $1,200, the plaintiff should have judgment for such amount as the Superior Court may thereupon find him entitled to, with costs of an action in that court. If the amount of the judgment ultimately entered should not be less than that of Mr. Justice Guerin's former judgment, inasmuch as the plaintiff has been needlessly put to all the subsequent costs\u2014those of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court\u2014he should also recover these costs in addition as well as any extra costs in the Superior Court occasioned by the second enqu\u00eate now directed which that court may allow him. In no event, however, for the reasons indicated by my brother Brodeur, can the respondent have any costs of his factum on the cross-appeal to this court. Should the ultimate recovery, however, be of an amount less than that originally awarded there should be no costs to either party of any of the proceedings subsequent to the judgment of Mr. Justice Guerin.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La pr\u00e9sente poursuite a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e en vertu de la \"Loi des accidents du travail\" (arts 7321 et suivants, S.R.P.Q.). Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u00e9 demandeur intim\u00e9 avait un salaire de plus de $1,200, car s'il avait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e il tomberait sous le coup de la loi commune et ne pourrait pas invoquer la loi des accidents du travail. Il nous faut \u00e0 cette fin interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions de Particle 7328 qui se lit comme suit:\nLe salaire servant de base \u00e0 la fixation des rentes s'entend pour l'ouvrier occup\u00e9 dans l'entreprise pendant les douze mois \u00e9coul\u00e9s avant l'accident, de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 allou\u00e9e pendant ce temps soit en argent, soit en nature.\nPour les ouvriers occup\u00e9s pendant moins de douze mois avant l'accident, il doit s'entendre de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective qu'ils ont re\u00e7ue depuis leur entr\u00e9e dans l'entreprise, augment\u00e9e de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moyenne qu'ont re\u00e7ue pendant la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois, les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie. Si le travail n'est pas continu, le salaire annuel est calcul\u00e9 tant d'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue pendant la p\u00e9riode d'activit\u00e9 que d'apr\u00e8s le gain de l'ouvrier pendant le reste de l'ann\u00e9e.\nLa partie que j'ai soulign\u00e9e est celle qu'il nous faut particuli\u00e8rement examiner.\nJe dois ajouter que cet article 7328 est la reproduction textuelle de l'article 10 de la loi fran\u00e7aise de 1898 et qu'en cons\u00e9quence la jurisprudence et la doctrine fran\u00e7aise peuvent nous guider dans l'interpr\u00e9tation de notre texte.\nLes faits sont les suivants:\nDans l'ann\u00e9e qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'accident, le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'abord environ neuf mois occup\u00e9 comme d\u00e9bardeur dans le port de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 raison de 35 cents de l'heure. Ensuite il a travaill\u00e9 du 5 janvier au 1er avril 1918 comme aide-machiniste dans l'usine de la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 raison de 32\u00bd cents de l'heure; et enfin pendant 19 jours il a travaill\u00e9 comme tourneur \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, ce qui lui rapportait environ $26 par semaine. Il y a donc eu trois p\u00e9riodes diff\u00e9rentes qu'il s'agit de consid\u00e9rer: 1\u00b0 celle du 19 avril 1917 au 15 janvier 1918; 2\u00b0 celle du 5 janvier 1918 au 1er avril 1918; et enfin 3\u00b0 celle du ler avril 1918 au 19 avril de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\nLes deux derni\u00e8res p\u00e9riodes qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis le 5 janvier au 19 avril n'offrent pas de difficult\u00e9s. La loi (art. 7328) nous dit que le salaire qui sert de base est celui que l'ouvrier a effectivement re\u00e7u depuis son entr\u00e9e dans l'entreprise. Or, comme Lewis a re\u00e7u pendant cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0 $295.60, il n'y a pas de contestation et ce chiffre est accept\u00e9 par les deux parties. Toute la difficult\u00e9 est de d\u00e9terminer le salaire de base pour la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode, c'est-\u00e0-dire du 19 avril 1917 au 5 janvier 1918, environ neuf mois. Est-ce le salaire que le demandeur a eu comme d\u00e9bardeur c'est-\u00e0-dire le salaire qu'il avait retir\u00e9 en dehors de l'entreprise o\u00f9 l'accident a eu lieu ? En d'autres termes, devrions-nous appliquer les dispositions du 3\u00e8me paragraphe de l'art. 7328 qui dit que si le travail n'est pas continu, le salaire annuel est bas\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue pendant la p\u00e9riode d'activit\u00e9 et sur le gain de l'ouvrier pendant le reste de l'ann\u00e9e ?\nL'appelante dans son factum nous dit que l'honorable juge de la cour sup\u00e9rieure\ncalculated the wage basis as though the employment was a non-continuous operation.\nIl est possible que cette affirmation soit exacte mais malheureusement nous n'avons pas de notes de l'honorable juge, et dans le jugement nous voyons simplement sur ce sujet le motif suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur a suffisamment prouv\u00e9 que le salaire qui doit servir de base \u00e0 la fixation de la rente sous l'empire de l'art. 7328, S.R.P.Q., est $960.\nIl est assez difficile alors pour moi de dire quelle est la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dont il s'est servi pour arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, je suis d'opinion que le cas actuel est l'un de ceux o\u00f9 nous ne devons pas appliquer le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 7328. Un examen des trois paragraphes de cet article me confirme dans cette opinion.\nLe premier paragraphe, il est bien \u00e9vident, r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'ouvrier qui a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement travaill\u00e9 toute l'ann\u00e9e dans l'entreprise; car il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 positivement que le salaire est celui effectivement pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouvrier qui\nest occup\u00e9 dans l'entreprise pendant les douze mois \u00e9coul\u00e9es. Ce premier paragraphe ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 dans la cause actuelle, parce que Lewis n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 qu'environ trois mois dans l'entreprise.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article parle des ouvriers \"occup\u00e9s pendant moins de douze mois\" dans l'entreprise. C'est bien le cas de Lewis, vu qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'entreprise que quelques mois. Alors le salaire de base doit comprendre, outre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective qu'il a re\u00e7ue depuis son entr\u00e9e, une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire qui est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moyenne qu'ont re\u00e7ue dans la m\u00eame entreprise pendant la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie.\nLe troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article pourvoit au cas o\u00f9 le travail n'est pas continu; et alors il permet d'ajouter \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue par l'ouvrier dans l'entreprise les gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par lui dans l'ann\u00e9e. Or cette disposition vise exclusivement les ouvriers occup\u00e9s dans l'entreprise depuis plus d'un an mais d'une fa\u00e7on intermittente. (Dalloz, 1903-1-598; Sachet, \u00e9dition de 1909, vol. ler, n\u00b0 862; Loubat, \u00e9d. 1906, nos 673 et suivants). Ce troisi\u00e8me paragraphe, par cons\u00e9quent, ne couvre pas notre cas.\nC'est donc le second paragraphe qui s'applique \u00e0 notre cas, alors la premi\u00e8re question qui se pose est de savoir \u00e0 quelle cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s il faut avoir recours pour fixer le salaire de base. Est-ce la cat\u00e9gorie des tourneurs \u00e0 laquelle Lewis appartenait lors de l'accident, ou bien celle des aides-machinistes dont il faisait partie \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e dans l'usine. La solution de cette question est des plus importantes, car si c'est le salaire des tourneurs qui doit servir de base, alors le montant sera plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la somme permise pour se pr\u00e9valoir de la loi des accidents du travail. Si, au contraire, c'est le salaire desaides-machinistes, Lewis peut probablement r\u00e9clamer. Les auteurs sont divis\u00e9s sur ce point. Quelques-uns disent que si l'indemnitaire a appartenu successivement \u00e0 plusieurs cat\u00e9gories distinctes, c'est d'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la cat\u00e9gorie dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rang\u00e9 \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e dans l'\u00e9tablissement et non d'apr\u00e8s la cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 laquelle il appartenait au moment de l'accident (Cabouat, Accidents du Travail, vol. 2, n\u00b0 581 : Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 21, n\u00b0 2090).\nSachet, au contraire, pr\u00e9tend que le salaire gagn\u00e9 au moment de l'accident doit servir de base. (Sachet, \u00e9dition de 1909, nos 847-856). Sirey, 1901-2-293.\nIl y a cependant un jugement de la Cour de Cassation qui tranche la question. Ce jugement est rapport\u00e9 dans la Gazette du Palais[11] et d\u00e9cide que\nLorsque l'ouvrier accident\u00e9 employ\u00e9 depuis moins d'un an a dans cette p\u00e9riode successivement occup\u00e9 dans l'entreprise des emplois diff\u00e9rents in\u00e9galement r\u00e9tribu\u00e9s, il y a Heu, pour compl\u00e9ter fictivement les douze mois de travail devant concourir \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du salaire de base, de prendre en consid\u00e9ration le salaire aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie d'ouvriers dans laquelle le demandeur avait tout d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 admis lors de son embauchage et non celui qu'il touchait en dernier lieu lors de l'accident.\nLa Cour de Revision, dans une cause de Pelletier v. Montreal Locomotive Works[12], a jug\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens.\nCes jugements me paraissent bien fond\u00e9s. En effet, pour d\u00e9terminer la rente annuelle due \u00e0 la victime, on recherche le salaire gagn\u00e9 par lui dans l'ann\u00e9e qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'accident. Il avait n\u00e9cessairement espoir qu'\u00e0 l'avenir il continuerait \u00e0 toucher, s'il restait dans l'entreprise, un salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 et correspondant \u00e0 celui qu'il avait lors de l'accident. Cependant les salaires de base ne sont pas la r\u00e9alisation des projets d'avenir, mais la repr\u00e9sentation des salaires pay\u00e9s dans le pass\u00e9, soit \u00e0 l'ouvrier lui-m\u00eame, soit \u00e0 ses compagnons de travail. Dans le cas actuel si Lewis avait travaill\u00e9 pendant tout le temps pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, il aurait re\u00e7u comme aide-machiniste pendant onze mois et dix jours 32\u00bd cents de l'heure. Pendant les derniers 20 jours, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 comme tourneur \u00e0 raison de 15 cents la pi\u00e8ce. Il aurait certainement gagn\u00e9 dans son ann\u00e9e moins de $1,200, en tenant compte des ch\u00f4mages ordinaires et l\u00e9gaux. Alors ces jugements de la Cour de Cassation et de la Cour de Revision ne font que mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution le principe qui doit servir de base \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du salaire effectivement pay\u00e9. Il me semble juste qu'on alloue \u00e0 Lewis le salaire des aides-machinistes et non pas le salaire des tourneurs avec qui il a travaill\u00e9 dans les derniers vingt jours.\nJe suis oblig\u00e9 alors de diff\u00e9rer d'opinion avec la Cour d'Appel qui, par l'entremise de l'honorable juge Pelletier, a dit que pour d\u00e9terminer le salaire de base\nil faut prendre la moyenne de ce qu'ont les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, c'est-\u00e0-dire la cat\u00e9gorie dans laquelle se trouvait l'ouvrier lorsque l'accident est arriv\u00e9.\nLe jugement de la Cour d'Appel a donc fait erreur en appliquant ce principe.\nMaintenant la cat\u00e9gorie d'aides-machinistes doit-elle comprendre, en outre des quinze personnes gagnant le m\u00eame salaire que Lewis, c'est-\u00e0-dire 32\u00bd cents de l'heure, aussi les aides-machinistes gagnant un salaire diff\u00e9rent? Si nous consultons la discussion qui s'est faite sur ce point au s\u00e9nat fran\u00e7ais, et que nous retrouvons dans Dalloz, 1898-4-74, note 12, il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie s'entendent de ceux qui ont le m\u00eame salaire, car le s\u00e9nateur Scheurer-Kestner, qui est industriel, dit, en parlant des tourneurs qu'il prit pour exemple, qu'il y a plusieurs cat\u00e9gories et que cette expression se comprend bien facilement par ceux qui sont dans l'industrie et que ce sera facile \u00e0 appliquer. Ce qui fut dit ensuite par le rapporteur sur le sujet \u00e9lucide la question. En effet, il a clos la discussion en disant:\nCela signifie, comme le disait tout \u00e0 l'heure notre coll\u00e8gue, M. Scheurer-Kestner, que s'il s'agit par exemple de tourneurs ayant gagn\u00e9 tel salaire on doit appliquer \u00e0 un ouvrier de cette cat\u00e9gorie le salaire correspondant.\nSachet, au n\u00b0 854 de son ouvrage, \u00e9dition de 1909, rapporte cette discussion du s\u00e9nat et ajoute:\nDe cette discussion il semble r\u00e9sulter que l'on doit entendre par ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie ceux qui dans un \u00e9tablissement industriel ont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame emploi et touchent le m\u00eame salaire que la victime.\nJe croirais donc que dans le cas actuel la moyenne du salaire des ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie serait celui des quinze aides-machinistes qui recevaient le m\u00eame salaire que Lewis.\nMaintenant quelle est la moyenne des salaires pay\u00e9s dans l'usine de la d\u00e9fenderesse aux aides-machinistes appartenant \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie du demandeur depuis le 1er avril 1917 au 5 janvier 1918?\nLa preuve \u00e0 ce sujet n'est pas tr\u00e8s satisfaisante. Tous les aides-machinistes \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'heure; et il me semble que la d\u00e9fenderesse aurait d\u00fb avoir en sa possession le nombre d'heures que chaque employ\u00e9 avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'usine, afin d'\u00e9tablir une moyenne de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue par chacun d'eux. Mais le comptable de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse nous informe qu'il lui est impossible de fournir cet \u00e9tat.\nIl a bien cependant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans une autre partie de son t\u00e9moignage que la moyenne que tous les aides-machinistes avaient re\u00e7ue \u00e9tait de $25.85 par semaine et que des tourneurs avaient eu $32.64 par semaine. Comment en est-il arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat? Je ne puis pas facilement m'en rendre compte et ce n'est pas clair dans son t\u00e9moignage. D'abord qu'entend-il par semaine? Est-ce 6 jours ou 5\u00bd jours? Chaque jour comprend-il dix heures, neuf heures ou huit heures? Il ne nous le dit pas.\nS'il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9, comme je le crois, \u00e0 prendre le temps de chaque homme puis \u00e0 additionner tout ce temps pour dire: Cela constitue tant de semaines; c'est l\u00e0 une base de calcul erron\u00e9e, car ce n'est pas la moyenne de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu'il nous donne. D'ailleurs ce calcul demanderait plus de renseignements qu'il nous en a donn\u00e9s. De plus, il est assez \u00e9tonnant, s'il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re que je le suppose, qu'il n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de dire le nombre d'heures que chacun a travaill\u00e9. Son calcul ne me para\u00eet pas suffisant pour asseoir un jugement. Il se trouverait alors \u00e0 \u00e9liminer tout ch\u00f4mage. (Dalloz, 1901-2-178; Sachet, 5\u00e8me \u00e9d. nos 853-868). Cependant les ouvriers dans cette entreprise ont d\u00fb avoir des interruptions de travail, car il nous donne le salaire pay\u00e9 aux quinze ouvriers aides-machinistes et aucun n'a re\u00e7u plus de $380.90. Or par sa m\u00e9thode de calcul cet ouvrier aurait d\u00fb recevoir le double de cela.\nComme la d\u00e9fenderesse n'est pas en position de fournir des renseignements pr\u00e9cis sur la moyenne de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dans son entreprise, nous devons avoir recours aux pr\u00e9somptions qui peuvent nous guider dans un cas de cette nature. Je serais dispos\u00e9, pour ma part, \u00e0 suivre la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation qui, en examinant un cas semblable, c'est-\u00e0-dire un cas o\u00f9 on a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir avec pr\u00e9cision le total r\u00e9el des salaires de tous les jours de travail, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'on pourrait prendre pour base le salaire que le demandeur a gagn\u00e9 dans l'entreprise. Dalloz, 19021-381. Le salaire gagn\u00e9 par le demandeur comme aide-machiniste du 5 janvier 1918 au 23 mars 1918 (nous n'avons pas son salaire comme tel du 23 mars au ler avril 1918) a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 197.20. Cette p\u00e9riode repr\u00e9sente pour les soixante-dix-huit jours qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s un salaire de $2.53 par jour. Voil\u00e0 la moyenne de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pendant qu'il travaillait. Maintenant il y a 260 jours du 19 avril 1917 au 5 janvier 1918. En multipliant ces 260 jours par $2.53 nous arrivons \u00e0 $657.80.\nEn ajoutant \u00e0 ces $657.80 le salaire gagn\u00e9 par le demandeur du 5 janvier 1918 au 19 avril 1919, soit $295.60, nous arrivons \u00e0 un total de $953.40, c'est-\u00e0-dire pratiquement au m\u00eame montant que celui de $960 trouv\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLa Cour d'Appel avait trouv\u00e9, au contraire, que le montant aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre de plus de $1,200; et, par cons\u00e9quent, le demandeur, suivant elle, n'aurait pas eu le droit de poursuite sous \"l'acte des accidents du travail\" (art. 7326); mais tout de m\u00eame elle aurait donn\u00e9 jugement pour le demandeur en se basant sur le droit commun. Le demandeur a fait un contre-appel et a demand\u00e9 le r\u00e9tablissement du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 et le contre-appel maintenu, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli et celui de la Cour d'Appel modifi\u00e9 et rendu conforme \u00e0 celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. L'appelante devra payer les frais dans toutes les cours, moins les frais de factum sur le contre-appel devant cette Cour.\nVoici pourquoi les frais de ce factum ne devraient pas \u00eatre tax\u00e9s: J'ai remarqu\u00e9 durant l'argument que les avocats de l'intim\u00e9 avaient cit\u00e9 Sachet comme \u00e9tant favorable \u00e0 leurs pr\u00e9tentions, et ils avaient \u00e0 cette fin donn\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re partie du n\u00b0 856 de l'ouvrage de cet auteur o\u00f9 il donnait un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du jugement ci-haut mentionn\u00e9 et rapport\u00e9 dans la Gazette du Palais (1906-1-437); mais en v\u00e9rifiant j'ai trouv\u00e9 que cette citation \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te et que de fait Sachet, \u00e0 la fin du n\u00b0 856 d\u00e9clarait que cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation devait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e avec r\u00e9serve, et virtuellement il la combattait dans un autre paragraphe.\nDans ces circonstances, je suis d'opinion que les avocats de l'intim\u00e9 n'auront pas le droit de r\u00e9clamer de frais ou d'honoraires pour ce factum.\nJ'avais \u00e9crit l'opinion ci-dessus quand j'ai vu que deux de mes coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient d'avis que le demandeur devait \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de son action et que mes deux autres coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient d'opinion que la cause devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour faire compl\u00e9ter l'enqu\u00eate et \u00e9lucider certains faits qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre clairement prouv\u00e9s. Comme l'opinion de ces derniers est plus conforme \u00e0 mes vues, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 m'y rallier afin qu'un jugement final puisse \u00eatre rendu. Sans approuver enti\u00e8rement l'opinion de mon coll\u00e8gue Anglin, je suis dispos\u00e9 cependant \u00e0 adopter pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente cause les conclusions de son jugement. Le dossier devra donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e dans son opinion.\nMignault J.\u2014Les opinions tr\u00e8s travaill\u00e9es de mes honorables coll\u00e8gues, MM. les juges Anglin et Brodeur, me permettront de m'exprimer avec quelque bri\u00e8vet\u00e9. La \"loi des accidents du travail\" de Qu\u00e9bec (art. 7321 et suiv. S.R.Q., 1909) est presque la copie de la loi fran\u00e7aise du 9 avril 1898. Il y a cependant une diff\u00e9rence notable entre les deux lois, car la loi fran\u00e7aise r\u00e9git tout ouvrier dans ses rapports avec son patron, quelque \u00e9lev\u00e9, d'ailleurs que soit son salaire (art. 2), tandis que la loi de Qu\u00e9bec, telle qu'elle se lisait lors de l'accident en question, ne s'applique pas \u00e0 un ouvrier dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle d\u00e9passe $1,200 (art. 7326). Ainsi la loi fran\u00e7aise exclut absolument l'action de droit commun contre le patron, quelque soit le salaire de l'ouvrier, alors que cette action n'\u00e9tait \u00e9cart\u00e9e, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, que pour les salaires ne d\u00e9passant pas $1,200, et ce chiffre, cette ann\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 $1,500.\nQu'entend-on par \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle\" dans le dernier alin\u00e9a de l'article 7326? Est-ce la m\u00eame chose que le salaire dont parle l'article 7328, et qui, selon le mode de calcul que cet article impose, est soit la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective re\u00e7ue par l'ouvrier pour douze mois de travail continu dans l'entreprise, soit, quand l'ouvrier n'y a \u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9 que pendant un terme plus court, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective qu'il a re\u00e7ue, plus la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moyenne pay\u00e9e aux ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie pendant la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois, soit, quand le travail n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 continu, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue par l'ouvrier pendant la p\u00e9riode d'activit\u00e9 et son gain ailleurs durant le reste de l'ann\u00e9e?\nNous ne pouvons nous aider ici de la loi fran\u00e7aise, car elle ne contient pas une disposition semblable \u00e0 celle du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 7326. Cependant je ne puis croire que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle dont parlent les deux alin\u00e9as de l'article 7326 soit une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration autre que celle qui sert \u00e0 la fixation des rentes. Donc s'agit-il de savoir quelle r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle \u00e9carte l'application de la loi des accidents du travail, ou quelle r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration forme la base du calcul des rentes, il faut s'en rapporter \u00e0 l'article 7328 pour la d\u00e9terminer.\nAutre question. Quelle est la \"cat\u00e9gorie\" dont parle le deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 7328? Je n'ai pu me d\u00e9fendre d'une certaine h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais en vue de l'interpr\u00e9tation que la cour de cassation (Gazette du Palais, 1906, 1er semestre, p. 437) donnait \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 2 de l'article 10 de la loi fran\u00e7aise; lors de l'adoption de cette disposition par la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, je crois que la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation s'impose ici. Lors donc, pour citer presque textuellement cette d\u00e9cision, que l'ouvrier accident\u00e9, employ\u00e9 depuis moins d'un an, a, dans cette p\u00e9riode, occup\u00e9 dans l'entreprise des emplois in\u00e9galement r\u00e9tribu\u00e9s, on doit, pour compl\u00e9ter fictivement les douze mois de travail, prendre en consid\u00e9ration le salaire aff\u00e9rant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie d'ouvriers dans laquelle le demandeur avait, tout d'abord, \u00e9t\u00e9 admis, lors de son embauchage, et non celui qu'il touchait au jour de l'accident.\nReste le mode de calculer le salaire de l'ouvrier dans les cas d'application du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 7328. J'adopte ici le mode indiqu\u00e9 dans l'opinion de mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin. On prend d'abord le nombre total de jours de l'engagement (pendant la p\u00e9riode d'emploi du demandeur) de tous les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie que le demandeur\u2014et j'entends par l\u00e0 les ouvriers faisant un travail similaire, sans exiger que leur salaire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 absolument identique \u00e0 celui per\u00e7u par le demandeur\u2014et ensuite le montant total qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pendant le temps de leur engagement. En divisant le deuxi\u00e8me chiffre par le premier on obtient le salaire moyen par jour, lequel, multipli\u00e9 par le nombre total de jours de la p\u00e9riode requise pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois, donne le salaire que l'article 7328, al. 2; pr\u00e9sume que la victime aurait re\u00e7u dans l'entreprise pendant cette p\u00e9riode. On tient ainsi n\u00e9cessairement compte du temps perdu par les ouvriers, et il importe peu que les dimanches et jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s soient compris dans le chiffre total repr\u00e9sentant la dur\u00e9e de l'engagement de tous les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, car ils sont aussi compt\u00e9s dans le chiffre repr\u00e9sentant la p\u00e9riode requise pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois, et le calcul se fait sur la m\u00eame base.\nIl suffit d'indiquer ce mode de calcul pour les besoins de cette cause. Il y a bien la question du ch\u00f4mage extraordinaire ou forc\u00e9 que traite mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin. Je reconnais bien qu'il peut y avoir, dans chacun des cas vis\u00e9s par l'article 7328, des ch\u00f4mage extraordinaires et nullement voulus par les ouvriers, et qu'il ne serait pas juste, dans l'\u00e9valuation du salaire de l'ouvrier accident\u00e9, de tenir compte de ces ch\u00f4mages pour r\u00e9duire d'autant le salaire qui sert de base \u00e0 la fixation des rentes. Je ne veux pas aller plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, car je ne vois au dossier aucun indice que de tels ch\u00f4mages aient exist\u00e9, et, tout en concourant dans les instruction que mon coll\u00e8gue croit que nous devrions donner \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure au sujet de ces ch\u00f4mages, je ne le fais que pour les besoins de cette cause et pour permettre qu'elle soit finalement jug\u00e9e sans autres appels, et je me r\u00e9serve la plus enti\u00e8re libert\u00e9 d'appr\u00e9ciation, si le d\u00e9bat se renouvelle devant nous, dans une autre cause, de tout cette question des ch\u00f4mages forc\u00e9s ou involontaires. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que nous trouvons au dossier ne nous permettent pas de faire le calcul du salaire d'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e8gle du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 7328. Il y avait quinze employ\u00e9s, aides-machinistes, qui recevaient le m\u00eame salaire que le demandeur, mais il y avait en tout vingt-sept aides-machinistes qui \u00e9taient in\u00e9galement r\u00e9tribu\u00e9s. Il aurait fallu tenir compte de tous les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, sans s'arr\u00eater rigoureusement \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 de salaire. Nous n'avons nulle part le terme de l'engagement de ces aides-machinistes, bien que nous ayons le chiffre total qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. Du reste, Dockrill, dans sa liste des quinze ouvriers qui recevaient 32\u00bd cents de l'heure, fait voir de telles in\u00e9galit\u00e9s, qu'il est \u00e9vident que certains de ces quinze ouvriers ont d\u00fb \u00eatre employ\u00e9s un temps beaucoup moins long que les autres. Dans ces circonstances, et vu que l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'a pas indiqu\u00e9 la base de son calcul, nous n'avons d'autre alternative que de renvoyer la cause \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 confom\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles indiqu\u00e9es plus haut.\nJe puis ajouter que le jugement de la Cour d'Appel ne peut \u00eatre soutenu, car l'action, \u00e9tant clairement intent\u00e9e sous l'empire de la loi des accidents du travail, ne pouvait \u00eatre transform\u00e9e en une action de droit commun. Je favorise les amendements autant que possible, mais un tel amendement ne pourrait \u00eatre permis, car il changerait la nature de l'action (art. 552 C.P.C.). La loi des accidents du travail fait voir que le recours en vertu de cette loi et le recours sous le droit commun ne peuvent coexister entre les m\u00eames personnes, patron et ouvrier. Ils sont inconciliables, et si on les incluait dans une m\u00eame action contre le patron, le demandeur serait forc\u00e9 d'opter entre eux (C.P.C. art. 177, paragraphe 6). L'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu et la cause renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 suivant les instructions contenues dans l'opinion de M. le juge Anglin.

When repairing its lines, he met with a serious accident resulting from an electric current coming from the line of another company, both wires being attached to the same pole. The accident occurred on the 17th of August, 1917. The petition for authorization to sue under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" was presented and granted on the 30th of July, 1918. A first action for compensation was taken by respondent on the 5th of August, 1918, and was dismissed on the 23rd of December, 1918, on the ground that the statement of claim did not disclose that such petition had been granted and that the respondent was proceeding udder the ''Workmen's Compensation Act\". Article 7345 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, enacts that any action under the Act shall be instituted before the expiration of one year after the accident. The respondent then took a second action on the 25th of February, 1919, using the same authorization to sue as granted for the issuing of the first action.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal presents a number of curious points for our consideration. Some of them suggest the reflection that a plaintiff having a rather difficult problem for solution in order to found his action, might, by a little care, have avoided the needless complications that have ensued.\nThe important question raised is whether or not a lineman, engaged by a telegraph company, as the appellant is, in repairing its lines, when meeting with a serious accident resulting from an electric current, is entitled to claim relief under the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" The electric current which produced the injury was that from another line than the one belonging to appellant.\nHowever both that wire and that of the appellant on which respondent was engaged, were attached to the same poles.\nThese facts need not be considered further than to illustrate the nature of the service which respondent was engaged in and the risks attendant thereon.\nThe statute relied upon is rather curiously worded. And to interpret its language, said facts, and possibly many others of a like nature which may exist in carrying on the business of a telegraph company, suggest that the legislature, in framing an Act designed to protect workmen engaged in employments of a rather more hazardous character than those of mere mercantile enterprises, could hardly be supposed to have intentionally left workmen so engaged as respondent was, outside such protection.\nThe section 7321 defines the industries covered by the Act.\n7321. Accidents happening by reason of or in the course of their work, to workmen, apprentices and employees engaged in the work of building, or in factories, manufactories or workshops: or in stone, wood or coal yards: * * * or in any gas or electrical business * * or in any industrial enterprise, in which explosives are manufactured or prepared, or in which machinery is used, moved by power other than that of men or of animals, shall entitle the person injured, etc., etc.\nIf the fact that the basis of the telegraph business is the application and use of electric force and necessarily implies the use of the mechanical contrivances adapted for its control, and in turn the application of means such as wires and poles for conducting it, do not constitute the business an electrical business, I fail to see how it can be classified. It is quite beside the question to say that it is a commercial enterprise or business. It would be hard to conceive of anything in the way of business which in one sense is not commercial.\nNor does the innocent minded argument demonstrating how little risk is run from the very moderate current ordinarily used in the actual operation of the line to produce the mechanical results needed, seem to me a very convincing reason for holding that it cannot be designated as essentially an electrical business.\nAnd it is none the less so because by reason of commercial and other necessities, it is being forced to keep the company of other electrical businesses, using the same poles to carry wires charged with a heavier current and possibly neither being proof against the induction we sometimes hear of.\nI am of the opinion that the telegraph business falls within the very language of the statute above quoted.\nPassing to the legal curiosities which respondent's stumbling efforts to claim the benefit of the Act have developed, I do not think that the production of an abortive declaration which failed to disclose or allege the existence of the essential factors of the claim being within the Act, can be said to have been any proper exercise of the permission that was given, not to proceed to produce an abortive but a real and valid assertion of claims within the scope of the permission given.\nThe resultant judgment given, on that abortive declaration, can neither be set up as an exercise of the permission given, nor as a res judicata to answer the declaration herein upon which the court below has given relief by the judgment appealed from. The other point raised that the action is prescribed might have been fairly arguable before the jurisprudence of Quebec had established that the application for permission having been heard in presence of all those concerned, and the order made therefor, suspends the operation of the prescription relied upon, but in face of such a jurisprudence so well established, does not seem to me now arguable.\nSince writing the foregoing I have read the opinions of my brothers Brodeur and Mignault holding that the Quebec jurisprudence relative to prescription has not been definitely settled and in deference thereto I, somewhat hesitatingly, assent to their view relative to a point in which local opinion should govern.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The appeal in my judgment fails on all points and should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinions to be delivered by my brothers Brodeur and Mignault. I entirely concur in their conclusion and in the reasons on which they base it.\nThe terms of Art. 7347 R.S.Q. make it clear that the petition for authorization to sue, which it prescribes, is not a part of the action which, under Art. 7345, is \"subject to a prescription of one year.\" The petition is a proceeding which the plaintiff is obliged to take \"before having recourse to the provisions of this Act\"\u2014a preliminary step requisite to qualify him or give him a status to bring the action. On the other hand if it had been an integral part of the first action, as held by Mr. Justice Gibsone, it must have fallen with it and the plaintiff would lack the authorization necessary to maintain the present action. In the absence of special provision in the statute, any question of interruption of the prescription which it imposes must be determined by reference to the articles of the Civil Code dealing with that subject. In answer to the plea of prescription the respondent relies upon Arts. 2224 and 2227 C.C., which he successfully invoked in the Court of King's Bench. The Quebec Civil Code has not reproduced Art.2245 of the Code Napoleon.\nAs to Art. 2224 C.C., my brother Brodeur has fully stated the reasons why the petition for authority to sue cannot be regarded as \"a judicial demand\" within its purview. An additional ground for that view is afforded by the express enumeration in its second paragraph of \"seizures, set-off, interventions and oppositions.\" The plaintiff's first action having been dismissed cannot serve as an interruption of prescription. Art. 2226 C.C.\nAs to the payments made by the appellants to the respondent, those prior to the month of May would rather seem to have been compassionate in their character and the subsequent payments were merely of wages earned by the respondent after his re-engagement by the appellants. The burden is on the respondent to establish an interruption of prescription. In order that payments made by the appellants may avail him for that purpose he must adduce evidence of circumstances warranting an inference that they implied recognition by the appellants of a legal obligation, either under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" or at common law, to compensate him for his injuries. Unless that inference can properly be drawn payments made to the respondent cannot be successfully invoked by him. Hall v. Devany[2]. There are no circumstances in evidence, in my opinion, which would justify the conclusion that in making the payments in question the appellants acknowledged any legal obligation to compensate the respondent. On the contrary from the first they appear to have challenged his legal right to claim compensation from them and from that position they never varied.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel d'un jugement de la Cour de Banc du Roi qui a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la cour sup\u00e9rieure[3].\nLa pr\u00e9sente action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelante sous la loi des accidents du travail (arts. 7321 et suivants des S.R.P.Q.).\nL'accident pour lequel l'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 avait eu lieu le 17 ao\u00fbt 1917.\nLe 30 juillet 1918 l'intim\u00e9 avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate au juge suivant les dispositions de l'art. 7347 S.R.P.Q. pour obtenir l'autorisation de poursuivre l'appelante. Le dossier ne nous fait pas voir si le juge qui avait eu \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer cette requ\u00eate avait tent\u00e9 de concilier les parties et \u00e9viter un proc\u00e8s ainsi que la loi l'autorisait; mais il n'y a pas de doute que le juge a d\u00fb s'autoriser des dispositions de cet article 7347 pour amener les parties \u00e0 faire un compromis, que ses efforts n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s; et alors il a simplement accord\u00e9 la requ\u00eate autorisant la poursuite.\nLe 5 ao\u00fbt 1918, une premi\u00e8re action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e, mais le demandeur ayant omis d'all\u00e9guer dans sa d\u00e9claration que la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait assujettie \u00e0 la loi des accidents du travail, cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1918 sur le motif que le demandeur n'avait pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 les faits et les conditions qui pouvaient donner au demandeur le droit de poursuivre sous la loi des accidents du travail. La cour, au lieu de renvoyer l'action, aurait pu, ce me semble, permettre d'amender la d\u00e9claration et d'y all\u00e9guer que la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait bien assujettie \u00e0 la loi des accidents du travail, et \u00e9viter par l\u00e0 m\u00eame les frais d'une nouvelle poursuite et surtout exposer la nouvelle action \u00e0 \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e sur le principe que le droit d'action \u00e9tait prescrit. En effet, la loi prescrit que les actions en recouvrement des indemnit\u00e9s se prescrivent par un an (art. 7345, S.R.P. Q.) et comme l'accident avait eu lieu en ao\u00fbt 1917, il pouvait \u00eatre trop tard en d\u00e9cembre 1918 pour instituer une nouvelle action.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, une nouvelle action, qui est la pr\u00e9sente, a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1919, et la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse, parmi ses moyens de d\u00e9fense, a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il y avait prescription.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9galement plaid\u00e9: 1\u00b0 que les compagnies de t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe ne sont pas assujetties \u00e0 la loi des accidents du travail; 2\u00b0 qu'il y avait eu chose jug\u00e9e; 3\u00b0 que le demandeur aurait d\u00fb se faire autoriser \u00e0 prendre la pr\u00e9sente poursuite.\nVu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en suis arriv\u00e9 sur la question de prescription, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour moi d'examiner ces derniers moyens de d\u00e9fense.\nLe demandeur pr\u00e9tend que la prescription a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue par la requ\u00eate en autorisation et en conciliation qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au juge sous l'art. 7347 des Statuts Refondus de 1909.\nVoici ce que dit cet article:\nAvant d'avoir recours aux dispositions du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe, l'ouvrier doit y \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 par un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, sur requ\u00eate signifi\u00e9e au patron. Le juge, sans enqu\u00eate ni affidavit, doit accorder cette requ\u00eate, mais peut auparavant employer tels moyens qu'il croit utiles pour amener une entente entre les parties. Si elles s'accordent, il peut rendre jugement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette entente, sur la requ\u00eate m\u00eame, et ce jugement a le m\u00eame effet qu'un jugement final de la cour de juridiction comp\u00e9tente. L'article du code civil qui se rapporte \u00e0 cette question d'interruption de prescription est l'article 2224, qui est dans les termes suivants :\nUne demande en justice suffisamment libell\u00e9e signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qui veut emp\u00eacher de prescrire ou produite et signifi\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile, lorsque la signification personnelle n'est pas requise forme une interruption civile.\nLa saisie, la reconvention, l'intervention, l'opposition comportent la demande.\nL'interpellation extra-judiciaire m\u00eame par notaire ou huissier et accompagn\u00e9e de titres et m\u00eame sign\u00e9e de la partie interpell\u00e9e n'op\u00e8re pas l'interruption s'il n'y a eu reconnaissance du droit.\nCet article 2224 du code civil est la reproduction des articles 2211 et 2244 du code Napol\u00e9on.\nIl y a cependant dans le code Napol\u00e9on un autre article sur cette mati\u00e8re d'interruption de prescription mais qui n'est pas reproduit dans le code de Qu\u00e9bec, c'est l'article 2245 qui d\u00e9clare que la citation en conciliation interrompt la prescription.\nLes proc\u00e9dures en conciliation du droit civil fran\u00e7ais n'ont jamais fait partie de l'ancien droit canadien. Elles n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9es en France qu'au 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle; il n'en \u00e9tait pas question dans l'ordonnance de 1667 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec jusqu'\u00e0 la codification de nos lois de proc\u00e9dure en 1867.\nQuand les lois civiles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9es en 1866, il n'y a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question de la citation en conciliation comme pouvant interrompre la prescription pour la bonne raison qu'elle \u00e9tait inconnue dans nos lois de Qu\u00e9bec.\nEn 1909 la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur les accidents du travail et elle s'est \u00e9videmment inspir\u00e9e de la loi qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en France en 1898 sur la m\u00eame mati\u00e8re. Nous retrouvons dans la loi de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames dispositions que celles que nous lisons dans la loi fran\u00e7aise de 1898, m\u00eames \u00e9tablissements industriels, m\u00eame base de salaire et d'indemnit\u00e9, m\u00eame prescription et m\u00eame requ\u00eate en autorisation et citation en conciliation. Mais on a omis au sujet de la citation en conciliation de d\u00e9clarer qu'elle serait interruptive de prescription. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de le d\u00e9clarer dans la loi fran\u00e7aise pour la bonne raison qu'il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le code civil, \u00e0 l'article 2245, une disposition \u00e0 cet effet.\nAussi quand les tribunaux en France ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 examiner la port\u00e9e de la requ\u00eate en autorisation ou en conciliation de la loi des accidents du travail, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle interrompait la prescription. Sirey, 1907-1-183-416. Sachet, vol. 2, n. 1299.\nIl s'agissait pour eux, en France, de d\u00e9cider si la convocation en conciliation devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l'avertissement \u00e0 compara\u00eetre devant le juge de paix, aux termes d'une loi de 1855, et qui n'\u00e9tait pas interruptive de prescription, ou bien comme une citation en conciliation qui, aux termes de l'article 2245 du code Napol\u00e9on, interrompt la prescription. Les tribunaux, comme je viens de le dire, ont conclu que c'\u00e9tait une proc\u00e9dure en conciliation.\nJe suis d'opinion que notre article 7347 est une proc\u00e9dure en conciliation. Or, comme nous n'avons pas dans le code civil une disposition d\u00e9clarant que cette proc\u00e9dure interrompt la prescription comme en France, ces d\u00e9cisions ou ces opinions des tribunaux et des auteurs fran\u00e7ais ne sauraient \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es.\nEst-ce que l'on ne pourrait pas dire cependant que la requ\u00eate en question constitue la demande en justice dont parle l'article 2224 du code civil? Qu'est-ce qu'une demande en justice? C'est, nous dit Pigeau, l'exercice d'une action, c'est-\u00e0-dire du droit de poursuivre en justice ce qui nous est d\u00fb ou la r\u00e9paration du tort qui nous est fait. Mais avant de former une demande il faut d'abord consid\u00e9rer ce qui doit \u00eatre fait pour parvenir \u00e0 l'exercice de l'action. Parmi les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'institution de l'action sont les requ\u00eates en autorisation de justice que les femmes et certaines autres personnes sont oblig\u00e9es d'obtenir. Garsonnet, dans son Pr\u00e9cis de Proc\u00e9dure civile, \u00e9d. 1885, pp. 391-392, dit:\nLe but de la proc\u00e9dure est d'obtenir un jugement et le moyen de l'obtenir, c'est de le demander; mais la demande en justice, par o\u00f9 d\u00e9butent toutes les instances, peut elle-m\u00eame \u00eatre pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e de certaines formalit\u00e9s\u2026\u20262\u00b0 Certaines demandes ne peuvent \u00eatre introduites sans autorisation de justice; telles sont.\u2026les demandes de s\u00e9paration de biens\u2026\u2026les demandes en s\u00e9paration de corps\u2026\u20264\u00b0 les demandes introductives d'instances et susceptibles de transaction subissent au bureau de paix ou de conciliation, avant d'arriver devant les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance, un essai, tentative ou pr\u00e9liminaire de conciliation, institu\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur dans une vue de concorde et de philanthropie, d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public et d'utilit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e\u2026\u2026\nCe dernier cas est bien celui dont parle notre article 7347 de la loi des accidents du travail. Avant d'aller devant la cour, la victime de l'accident est tenue de se pr\u00e9senter devant le juge en chambre pour avoir l'autorisation de poursuivre et pour donner en m\u00eame temps l'occasion de faire faire un accord entre les parties. Naturellement si cette proc\u00e9dure en conciliation ne r\u00e9ussit pas, alors le demandeur devra instituer sa demande au moyen d'un bref d'assignation (art. 117 C.P.C.). C'est la demande judiciaire elle-m\u00eame d\u00fbment signifi\u00e9e qui interrompt la prescription, suivant l'article 2224 du code civil. Une demande d'assistance judiciaire pour engager une instance n'interrompt pas la prescription. Laurent, vol. 32, nos 87 et 92; Huc, vol. 14, n\u00b0 385; Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 25, n\u00b0 479; Dupuis v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4]. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause il n'y a donc pas eu d'interruption de prescription par la simple pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate parce que celle-ci ne constituait pas la demande en justice, mais \u00e9tait simplement une formalit\u00e9 qui devait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der la poursuite elle-m\u00eame. Et l'action qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e d'abord par le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment libell\u00e9e (art. 2224 C.C.).\nLa jurisprudence dans Qu\u00e9bec sur cette question a vari\u00e9. D'abord dans une cause de Ruffinen v. Quebec and St. Maurice Industrial Co.[5] il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate n'interrompait pas la prescription. Plus tard, la cour sup\u00e9rieure dans la cause de Franc\u0153ur v. Cairnie[6], la cour de revision dans les causes de Fontaine v. Cabana[7], et de Squizzato v. Brennan[8] ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire. Cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue il y a environ deux ans. Je vois qu'on s'y est bas\u00e9 principalement sur l'opinion de Sachet, vol. 2, n\u00b0 1299. Mais cet auteur s'appuyait sur l'article 2245 du code Napol\u00e9on qui n'est pas reproduit dans notre code civil de Qu\u00e9bec. Cette opinion de Sachet ne saurait donc \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour disposer de la question dans notre droit.\nLe demandeur invoque aussi comme interruption de prescription le fait que la compagnie appelante aurait, pendant que le demandeur \u00e9tait incapable de travailler, pay\u00e9 son salaire. Il est possible que dans certains cas ces paiements de salaire pourraient constituer une reconnaissance de l'obligation, mais on devrait d'ordinaire les consid\u00e9rer comme de simples actes de charit\u00e9. Dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause, je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que ces paiements ne constituent pas une reconnaissance suffisante pour interrompre la prescription.\nJ'en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le jugement a quo devrait \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel. Je r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, mais je ne pourrais approuver les consid\u00e9rants de ce jugement o\u00f9 il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate en autorisation et en conciliation peut interrompre la prescription et forme une partie int\u00e9grante de l'action originaire.\nMignault J.\u2014Je partage enti\u00e8rement l'avis de mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Brodeur, que l'action de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait prescrite longtemps avant son institution. Je suis \u00e9galement d'opinion, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, que la requ\u00eate pour autorisation de poursuivre n'a pas interrompu la prescription de l'action intent\u00e9e plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s que cette autorisation e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 avait intent\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re action contre l'appelante sans all\u00e9guer l'autorisation de poursuivre qu'il avait obtenue et qui devait appara\u00eetre au dossier, et sans aussi all\u00e9guer que l'appelante \u00e9tait sujette \u00e0 la loi des accidents du travail. Cette premi\u00e8re action a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par M. le juge Belleau dix-sept mois apr\u00e8s l'accident, pour la raison que les all\u00e9gations du demandeur \u00e9taient insuffisantes pour lui donner droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 contre son patron en vertu des dispositions de la loi concernant les accidents du travail. A la date de ce jugement le droit d'action du demandeur \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 prescrit, et, par le jugement de renvoi, le demandeur perdait le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de sa premi\u00e8re action comme interruption de la prescription. Il me semble respectueusement que dans ces circonstances l'honorable juge, puisqu'il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il y avait insuffisance d'all\u00e9gations, aurait d\u00fb, avant de renvoyer l'action, donner au demandeur l'opportunit\u00e9 d'amender sa d\u00e9claration, et, si le demandeur avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de risquer son action sans amendement, constater son offre au jugement. Si le demandeur avait appel\u00e9 du jugement de l'honorable juge Belleau, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis\u2014car l'article 54 de la loi de la cour supr\u00eame nous le permet\u2014d'ordonner tout amendement n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre justice au demandeur. Et le code de proc\u00e9dure civile devrait donner le m\u00eame pouvoir \u00e0 la cour d'appel, afin d'\u00e9viter le renvoi inutile d'une cause \u00e0 la cour de premi\u00e8re instance. Malheureusement nous ne pouvons rien faire pour venir au secours du demandeur, car la seule action qui soit devant nous est une action qui \u00e9tait prescrite quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d'avis que les paiements que la d\u00e9fenderesse a faits au demandeur ne sont pas une reconnaissance de la dette et partant interruptifs de prescription. La seule preuve de ces paiments se trouve dans la d\u00e9position du demandeur qui dit que pendant le temps qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital la d\u00e9fenderesse lui a pay\u00e9 tout son salaire et \u00e0 partir du mois de d\u00e9cembre la moiti\u00e9 de ce salaire. Au mois de mai le demandeur est entr\u00e9 de nouveau \u00e0 l'emploi de la d\u00e9fenderesse et en a re\u00e7u des gages plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux qu'il recevait lors de l'accident. Il est \u00e9vident que les paiements faits au demandeur jusqu'au mois de mai lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s par motif d'humanit\u00e9, car la d\u00e9fenderesse a toujours pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas sujette \u00e0 la loi des accidents du travail, et il ne pouvait \u00eatre dans sa pens\u00e9e de reconna\u00eetre une obligation qu'elle contestait absolument. D'ailleurs les montants pay\u00e9s au demandeur exc\u00e8deraient de beaucoup ce que la loi des accidents du travail lui donnait. Depuis le mois de mai le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour son travail, voil\u00e0 tout. Il me para\u00eet clair, dans ces circonstances, que la prescription n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue par ces paiements.\nJe suis, non sans regret, d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et que le dispositif du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli, avec d\u00e9pens contre le demandeur devant cette cour et devant la cour d'appel.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, Parent & Casgrain.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taschereau & Mayrand.\n[1] Q.R. 57 S.C. 168.\n[2] 3 R.L. 453.\n[3] Q.R. 57 S.C. 168.\n[4] Q.R. 12 S.C. 193.\n[5] 20 R.L.N.S. 85.\n[6] 16 Que.

Ord., (1905) c. 70, s. 87\u2014Alta. S. (1907), c. 37, s. 20. The appellant was injured by his horse running into an unguarded guy wire supporting an electric light pole erected by the municipality respondent within the road allowance.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the accident was not a case of nonrepair within section 87 of \"The Municipal Ordinance,\" but was a case of failure to construct a public work \"so as not to endanger the public health or safety\" within section 20 of chapter 37 of the Alberta statutes of 1907, and therefore, the appellant's claim was not barred by the limitation of six months provided by section 87. Judgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 31) reversed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge Stuart J.[2], which maintained the appellant's action. The appellant was driving cattle over the bridge at Cardston crossing, Lee Creek, which bridge occupies a portion of the road allowance, and some of the cattle having left the approach to the bridge and taken the roadway leading to the creek, the appellant rode his horse down the embankment. The horse ran into a guy wire, unprotected by any guard, supporting an electric light pole erected by the respondent as a part of its electric lighting system. The respondent's incorporating ordinance comprised the provisions of \"The Municipal Ordinance,\" of which section 87 provides that the municipality shall keep in repair \"all sidewalks, crossings, sewers, culverts and approaches, grades and other works made or done by its council\" and on default, the municipality is liable but the action must be brought within six months after the damages have occurred. The appellant took his action after that delay, but he based his claim on the ground that the electric light system had been constructed under the authority of chapter 37 of the Alberta statutes of 1907, section 20 of which provides that \"the town shall construct all public works and all apparatus or appurtenances * * * wheresoever situated, so as not to endanger the public health or safety.\"\nEng. Lafleur K.C. and C.F. Jamieson for the appellant.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014While, in my opinion, the damages assessed in this case are somewhat larger than I should have awarded and especially so in allowing the expenses of the wife and daughter in their trip to California with the appellant, I do not think that on this ground alone I should allow an appeal. I am of the opinion that, on the main question, the decision of the court appealed from was wrong and that the failure of the respondent to construct the work in question in a proper manner, which was the cause of the accident, did not come within section 87 of the statute invoked and that the limitation therein for bringing an action was, therefore, not applicable.\nI concur, therefore, in allowing the appeal with costs and restoring the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The learned trial judge found respondent municipal corporation liable for damages sustained by appellant by reason of the guy wire placed upon the road allowance to support a pole carrying wire for the use of an electric system of lighting.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed his judgment solely upon the ground that the cause of action was barred by section 87 of \"The Municipal Ordinance\" Act, which reads as follows:\nSec. 87. Every municipality shall keep in repair all sidewalks, crossings, sewers, culverts and approaches, grades, and other works made or done by its council, and on default so to keep in repair shall be responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default, but the action must be brought within six months after the damages have been sustained.\nHe applied, in my opinion correctly, to the construction of this section the ejusdem generis rule, relative to the interpretation and construction of statutes.\nThe express language of the statute in question seems clearly to relate only to the liabilities incidental to the works relative to the maintenance of the high- way and clearly does not extend to any of the other manifold businesses which such corporations are in these latter days empowered to carry on, besides the exercise of ordinary municipal jurisdiction over highways.\nWhat the respondent did in its capacity of a corporate company, as it were, to carry on the business of electric lighting, had no necessary relation to its maintenance of the highway in a proper state of repair, or to the specified works of\nsidewalks, crossings, sewers, culverts and approaches or grades.\nThese specified undertakings have each as a rule a necessarily close relation with the maintenance of the highway.\nThe carrying on of any system of electric lighting has no such necessary relation with the obstruction of any part of the highway and should not, I respectfully submit, be tolerated further than absolutely necessary.\nWhen the municipal corporation sees fit to exercise the power conferred upon it to carry on an electric lighting system, it enters upon a business enterprise which has no implied right to obstruct the road allowance any more than another corporation duly authorized to carry on same.\nAnd I much doubt if section 8 in the 1907 enactment which is relied upon to justify the erection complained of, can, upon a close examination of its express terms, carry any one acting thereon further than absolutely necessary for the execution of such a work as contemplated therein.\nMoreover it is left on the evidence very doubtful if the structure in question was not erected before this enactment. Be all that as it may, section 20 of same statute provides as follows:\nSection 20. The town shall construct all public works and apparatus and appurtenances thereunto belonging or appertaining or therewith connected and wheresoever situated so as not to endanger the public health or safety.\nIt is upon this that the appellant's action rests and not upon any neglect of duty relative to the maintenance of the highway.\nAnd that an action will lie for breach of obligations thus imposed I have no manner of doubt.\nWe are not referred to any sanction in the way of penalty imposed for the non-observance of such obligations nor can I find any such, or any other reason, why it must not be presumed to be one of those enactments which, in such circumstances, are presumed to carry in or with them a right of action to those suffering from a breach of the observation of the obligations imposed.\nThere is no express limitation in \"The Municipal Ordinances\" applicable determining the time within which the action can be brought.\nThe only statutory limitation therefor is the general one applicable to the like torts.\nAs to the damages I do not think we should interfere though possibly they are more than I would have assessed and in regard thereto the Appellate Division below might have been entitled to do so.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the learned judge of the court below failed to appreciate the exact significance of section 20 of the Act of 1917. It imposes, I think, a substantive obligation upon the municipality and its office is not restricted to limiting the protection which the town would derive from the statutes affecting it in respect of the construction of public works. The scope of the obligation I shall speak of presently.\nMr. Clark's argument based on section 87 fails, I think, for this reason, that although the subject matters of the two sections may in some slight degree overlap, I think it is quite clear that the conclusion of the trial judge that what is complained of here was done in the course of construction is a conclusion which is unassailable.\nAs to the scope of the obligation imposed by section 20, I think the effect of the section is that where public works are constructed in such a manner as to endanger, in fact, the public health and safety, the town is prima facie responsible for any injuries arising from this circumstance; but in accordance with the long series of decisions relating to provisions expressed in similarly unqualified language, the town may escape liability in such cases by shewing that it has done everything possible for the protection of the public health or safety in view of all reasonably likely contingencies. I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Not without some misgivings I have reached the conclusion that the failure to place a guard on the guy wire, which was the cause of the plaintiff being injured, was not a case of non-repair within s. 87 of \"The Municipal Ordinance\" (c. 70 of Con. Ord. N.W.T., 1905), but was a case of failure to construct a public work \"so as not to endanger the public health or safety\" within s. 20 of c. 37 of the Alberta statutes of 1907, and, as such, gave rise to a cause of action when injury resulted therefrom quite distinct from the default to keep in repair dealt with in s. 87 of the Consolidated Ordinance. With Mr. Justice Stuart I also incline to think that the electric light line in question was not one of the \"other works made or done by (the) council,\" with which s. 87 deals.\nNo case of contributory negligence was established. The learned trial judge so found and it would not be possible on the evidence to reverse his finding.\nI am also of opinion that there should be no reduction in the sum of $10,000 awarded by Mr. Justice Stuart as damages. He tells us that he thought that this sum was not excessive but that \"it probably errs on the other side.\" The allowance of $2,500 in respect of travelling expenses, etc., is no doubt in great part very questionable for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice McCarthy. But I am not prepared to say that the whole sum awarded is too large.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting): We are asked to decide whether or not the defendant municipal corporation was negligent in erecting the guy wire which caused the accident.\nThe law provided (sect. 20, ch. 37 of 1907) that the town in constructing all public works and all appurtenances thereto should make them \"so as not to endanger the public safety.\"\nNobody disputes the power of the municipality to erect the pole which was necessary for its lighting system, and it was necessary also that a guy wire should be erected in order to strengthen the poles. If the pole had been erected in the travelling part of the roadway, I could very well realize how dangerous the guy wire, as built, would have been. But the pole and guy wire in question were erected on a part of the roadway which was not used by the public.\nI will not say that the plaintiff could not go down the embankment in order to get his cattle back on the travelling road, but in doing so he was bound to exercise the greatest care because he knew that he was not riding on the highway which was kept for travellers, and the municipal corporation, in erecting the pole and the guy wire at the place where they were installed, could not be considered as negligent in constructing them as they have done, because it was not to be expected that the public would go there.\nAs to the question of limitation. Section 87 of \"The Municipal Ordinance\" imposes the duty upon the municipal corporation to keep in repair all works erected by a municipality, and provided so that in default, the municipality should be responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default, but in such case the action must be brought within six months after the damages have been sustained.\nThe electric system which has been adopted by the municipality is, to my mind, one of the works contemplated by \"The Municipal Ordinance,\" since it is especially provided in section 95 of the same Act that the municipality is authorized to pass by-laws for the erection of such works. If the guy wire in question was not properly kept, the municipality has failed in its obligation to keep the highway or the works in proper repairs. Howse v. Township of Southwold[3], In such a case any action instituted by reason of its default must be instituted within six months after the damages have been sustained. The present action was instituted long after the period mentioned in the statute.\nFor these two reasons, it seems to me that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In my opinion the liability of the respondent for the injuries suffered by the appellant rests on section 20 of chapter 37 of the Alberta Statutes for 1907, being an amendment of the charter of the town of Cardston, which says that\nthe town shall construct all public works and all apparatus or appurtenances thereunto belonging or appertaining or therewith connected, and wheresoever situated, so as not to endanger the public health or safety.\nI do not think that this is a case where section 87 of The Municipal Ordinance of Alberta, with its limitation of six months for right of recovery, applies. The respondent, as a part of its electric lighting system, had erected poles within the road allowance and one of these poles was supported by a guy wire unprotected by any guard. The appellant was driving cattle over the bridge at Cardston crossing Lee Creek, which bridge occupies a portion of the road allowance, and some of the cattle having left the approach to the bridge and taken the roadway leading to the creek, the appellant rode his horse down the embankment and started after the steers. It was then almost dusk and the appellant's horse ran astride the guy wire which without any guard was practically invisible at that hour, and the appellant was thrown to the ground and very seriously injured. Under these circumstances I do not think the accident was caused by a want of repair of the highway, but by reason of a defect of construction of the electric light system, so that the limitation of six months provided by section 87 of the ordinance does not apply to the appellant's action which was taken after six months.\nThe question was discussed at bar whether, assuming that section 87 did not apply, the appellant could, in the absence of proof of negligence, succeed against the respondent which, in constructing its electric light line, had exercised a power granted it by statute.\nSuch a defence is often made, and I may perhaps refer to the recent decision of the Judicial Committee in Quebec Railway, Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Vandry[4], where their Lordships state on what grounds immunity from liability by reason of the exercise of a statutory power may be claimed:\nThe application of enactments of this kind is familiar and well settled. Such powers are not in themselves charters to commit torts and to damage third parties at large, but that which is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the statutory authority is held to have been authorized by implication and therefore is not the foundation of a cause of action in favour of strangers, since otherwise the application of the general law would defeat the purpose of the enactment. The Legislature, which could have excepted the application of the general law in express terms, must be deemed to have done so in such cases.\nThe case made by the respondent does not come within the rule so stated. The damage here was caused by reason of the fact that the respondent improperly exercised its statutory authority, in other words, because, in supporting by a guy wire the pole erected by it on a part of the highway, the respondent neglected to protect the guy wire by a guard which would have rendered it easily visible. If the statute be relied on as a defence the respondent does not come within its terms, for it did not construct the line so as not to endanger the public safety. The learned trial judge stated that he had no doubt that had a board guard been placed on the wire, the accident would not have occurred. The evidence shows that it is customary to place guards over guy wires in places where the public may come in contact with them. Such an accident and the causes that brought it about could, I think, have easily been foreseen. I therefore think that the respondent is liable for the appellant's damages.\nIn the appellate division Mr. Justice McCarthy, who held that the respondent was liable, would have reduced the amount of damages granted by the learned trial judge for necessary expenses of the appellant. It is now well settled that where the jury, or the judge acting as a jury, has not taken into consideration matters which should not have been considered, 'the verdict ought not to be set aside or a new trial directed simply because the amount of damages may seem excessive to an appellate court. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Jackson[5]. Here the learned trial judge undoubtedly could consider the expenses to which the appellant was put by reason of this accident. Even if he granted him some expenses which I would be inclined to think were not reasonably connected with the accident, still I feel that I should not interfere with his decision and substitute my estimate of the necessity of the expenses for the one which he formed at the trial.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the appellate division and restore the judgment of the trial court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 15 Alta.

G. gave S. an option to purchase certain land. G. however, on payment of $300, could withdraw the option and sell the property but without any advertisement or the services of an agent. S. could exercise his option before the 1st of March, 1917, and would then have to pay half of the purchase price. Before expiry of the time limit, G. advised S. that he had sold the property. Later on, S., having satisfied himself that the sale had been effected through an agent, filed a caveat and brought an action in damages.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division, that S. had the right to claim immediately the damages suffered by him on account of the breach of the contract of option by G., without being obliged to make a tender to G., before the expiry of the time limit, of the amount payable in cash on account of the purchase price.\nHeld, also, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division, that S., although he had agreed to assign to one M. a one-half interest in the option, was entitled to recover not only one-half, but the entire damages, the apportionment of the amount received being a question of settlement of account between S. and M.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1919] 3 W.W.R. 503), affirmed in part.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Stuart J.[2]and maintaining the respondent's action.

McCaul K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the reasons stated by my brother Mignault for dismissing the appeal with costs and the cross-appeal with costs, subject, however, as to the latter, to a reference as stated by him to determine respondent's damages if either party so desires.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant and respondent executed the following contract:\nThis agreement made and entered into this thirteenth day of November, A.D. 1916, by and between R. G. Gold of Minneapolis, Minnesota, party of the first part, and C. C. Stover of Milk River, Alberta, party of the second part, witnesseth:\nThe first party in consideration of one hundred dollars ($100) in hand paid by the second party, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, agrees and covenants with the second party to sell him the option to purchase the following described lands, the North West Quarter (N.W. \u00bc), of Section Four (4); all of section five (5); the north half (\u00bd), of section six (6), and the east half of section seven (7), all in township three (3), range fifteen (15), west of the fourth principal meridian, containing fourteen hundred and forty (1,440), acres more or less according to Government survey thereof for the sum of twenty-one thousand six hundred and ninety dollars ($21,690).\nThe second party shall have until March 1st, 1917, to pay the first half of the above, and in case he fails to do so shall forfeit all money paid down and this agreement shall become null and void.\nThe first party may have the right to sell the above property himself, without advertising same or through other agents, and in case he does sell at not less than sixteen dollars ($16), per acre, and in such case shall pay the second party three hundred dollars ($300), for such privilege.\n(Sgd.) R. F. GOLD.\n(Sgd.) C. C. STOVER. The appellant on the 11th January, 1917, wrote the respondent as follows:\nMinneapolis, Minn.\nMr. C. C. Stover,\nMilk River, Alberta.\nDear Mr. Stover:\u2014\nAs per my telegram to you, I herewith enclose you my check for $300 to take up the option which I gave you on the Countryman property. I have sold it to a pretty good man, who expects to handle it himself. You will have to buy me a dinner on this. Please return option to me.\nYours very truly,\nR. F. GOLD,\nTreasurer.\nJan. 11th, 1917.\nThe foregoing contract though presenting some unusual features clearly was made for a valuable consideration and hence valid, and binding the appellant to the due observance of all its terms. He chose to disregard the due observance of the term contained in the last clause thereof by selling through another agent than the respondent, and to improperly announce to him by the foregoing letter the sale of the property, as if made within the literal terms of the right reserved.\nUpon the receipt of the said letter there enured to the respondent a right of action for damages arising from said breach.\nAnd as an outcome thereof there seems to have arisen, I most respectfully submit, an unfortunate misapprehension of the legal results.\nThe learned trial judge, after reciting the salient facts in the story, seems to have overlooked the nature of the contract, and reached the conclusion that there could be no damages for such a breach of contract, unless and until the respondent had tendered the part of the purchase money, which was to have become payable on the 1st of March, 1917. The case of Hochster v. De la Tour[3], and many decisions in cases since, founded thereon, seem to have been overlooked.\nThe cause of action arose for breach of said contract within the principle upon which these cases proceeded, long before the 1st of March, 1917, and has been open to the respondent to pursue ever since.\nThe Appellate Division properly set aside the judgment of the learned trial judge but unfortunately seems to have approached the assessment of the damages which the respondent was entitled to, as if to be assessed upon the same basis as if the option had been effectively exercised.\nAnd, in doing so, it allowed only the measure of damages which the respondent could have in fact received, because he had, before the breach, sold part of his chances of success to another party who had validly bargained with him for half the prospective profits and thus became entitled to half the fruits of the adventure, which, in the legal result, means, of course, though obviously not so intended, half the sum receivable herein by respondent under the assessment of damages allowed.\nIn so doing, in my opinion, the Court of Appeal erred gravely.\nIt is not what the personal results to the estate of the respondent alone or his personal profits might develop by reason of his calling in the assistance of partners but what, on such a contract, he was entitled to recover for the obvious breach thereof that should have been the guide to the assessment of damages. And that seems to have been proceeded upon by assuming that, as a certainty, the respondent could have reaped in profits the same sum as if he had in fact completed the anticipated contract of purchase.\nCertainly that was an erroneous way of viewing the matter, for to complete the contract he must have raised half the purchase price named in the option and thereby, and in many other incidental ways, have incurred some expense of which he was relieved by the breach.\nAnd again, he stood to have run the risk for two and a half months of the appellant selling by his own unaided efforts without advertising any price he was at liberty to receive, of not less than sixteen dollars an acre.\nAll these and the like considerations render it very difficult to say that the sum at which the damages were assessed is correct.\nIt may well be that even if the proper principles upon which the assessment of damages should have proceeded had been observed, the result would have been about the same, but how can we say so?\nThe misapprehension of the nature of the claim seemed to mislead also appellant's counsel into contending that, unless and until the respondent had tendered the price named in the option, he had no right to relief and no right to damages because he had not assented to the repudiation of the contract by the appellant.\nI submit there is no foundation for such a contention and certainly nothing in Roots v. Carey[4], to uphold it. That was a case of specific performance in which this court held that as there had been no binding acceptance of the proposal, or option given, there could be no such relief granted, and all said therein by the majority so holding must be read in view of that aspect of the case.\nCounsel for appellant relied upon the conduct of respondent in filing a caveat early in February, 1917, following the above quoted letter of the appellant.\nNo copy thereof appears in the case, but assuming it claimed an interest in the lands in question, how can that in law affect the actual outstanding liability of the appellant for breach of his contract? Or the rights of respondent resting thereon?\nThe respondent seems to have had the impression that the appellant had played him false in securing a purchaser by means against which he had contracted, and to have assumed that thereby the necessity for a tender was waived.\nCertainly that would have been a contention much more arguable than many of the several misapprehensions of the nature of the contract, and the legal results flowing from the breach thereof, which have been presented.\nThe respondent also seems to have supposed that in some way, not very clear, he had by virtue of the breach become entitled to an interest in the land by way of recovering damages.\nAre we to deprive a man of his legal rights because he has pursued an erroneous view of the method and means by which they are to be enforced? I submit not.\nAnd the only result of all that so transpired which we ought to consider is that the parties, after pursuing such erroneous paths and contentions, agreed that the claims for specific performance should be abandoned, and respondent's claims and contention be reduced to the claim for damages and rely upon the bond of suretyship given to answer same.\nIn conclusion, if the parties wish, or either of them respectively think, that the amount awarded by the Appellate Division is too much or too little to be allowed for such a breach of contract as I have outlined, within the ordinary principles upon which damages are assessable for breach of contract, such as I have indicated this is, and desire a reference to proceed upon such principles instead of the erroneous basis upon which the Appellate Division proceeded, I would allow such a reference at the risk to either so contending of costs following the result.\nPossibly the parties may shrink, as counsel seemed to do, from the suggestion when made by me in course of the argument, and feel that they have had enough of the game of chance involved in a lawsuit.\nThe assessment of damages upon such a repudiation of the contract by way of anticipatory breach has always been recognized as raising a difficult problem for those called upon to assess damages for such breach.\nIn the event of neither of the parties desiring such reference as suggested, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIn the event of either, or both, of them desiring a reference, the costs of this appeal should await the result thereof. And, if resulting in a substantial increase or diminution of the amount found by the Appellate Division, costs thereof and of the appeal should be awarded accordingly. DUFF J.\u2014I concur with Idington J.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant, appellant, comes into this court conceding the anticipatory breach or repudiation of contract alleged by the plaintiff, which he had stoutly contested in the provincial courts. He seeks to avoid consequential liability on a ground which appears not to have been taken below\u2014viz., that the plaintiff elected not to treat the defendant's repudiation as a breach entitling him to bring action, but to maintain the contract\u2014thus keeping it alive for both parties and for all purposes\u2014and that he failed to take up the option before its expiry by effluxion of time and had therefore no ground of action for breach at that time.\nI incline to think that such a volte face should not be permitted. But if it be open to the defendant to take that position, in my opinion it does not help him. Citing the judgment of Cockburn C. J., in Frost v. Knight[5], he treats the case as if it were one of breach of contract for sale and purchase. But it was not that. The defendant's contractual obligation was to keep an offer of sale open for a definite period, subject to its earlier termination on a condition which did not arise. He broke that contract and put it out of his power ever to fulfil it by selling the property to another. Thereupon a cause of action for damages\u2014the only cause of action he ever would have, as I view the matter\u2014vested in the plaintiff. He may have mistaken his rights and sought relief to which he was not entitled, but he did not forego the right to recover whatever damages the defendant's breach of contract entitled him to. That breach was permanent in its effects and, once committed, the contract was at an end and could not be revived at the election of the \"optionee.\" The case was not one for election at all.\nMoreover, pending the action, some arrangement was made whereby the claim for specific performance put forward by the plaintiff was abandoned and a caveat which he had lodged to protect any interest that he might have acquired in the property was vacated in consideration of the defendant giving security for such damages as the court might find the plaintiff entitled to recover. I rather incline to think that the basis of that arrangement must have been that the plaintiff's right to maintain his action for damages, if he could establish the breach of contract (which he averred and the defendant denied), should be recognized, and that if the defence now raised had been advanced at the trial that understanding would have been proved.\nIn any event the defendant's appeal in my opinion should not succeed and must be dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff cross-appeals claiming that the damages awarded should be increased from $3,335 to $6,910, The Appellate Division found that the damage caused by the defendant was the difference between the sale price mentioned in the plaintiff's option and the actual value of the land. That difference it found amounted to $7,110. But, because the plaintiff had agreed to assign a one-half interest in the option to one Madge, he was held entitled to recover only one-half of the amount of the damages so ascertained, less $200 which he had already received from the defendant. With great respect I think the plaintiff was entitled to recover the entire damages\u2014whatever they were. The option held by him was not assign- able at law and no right of action against the defendant was vested in Madge. Whatever equitable interest he may have acquired in the option, or in the plaintiff's rights under it, and whatever right he may have as between himself and the plaintiff to require the latter to account for the proceeds of any judgment he may recover, the plaintiff alone was entitled to maintain an action for damages for the breach committed by Gold and is entitled in that action to recover the entire damages arising therefrom. The authorities cited by Mr. McCaul are conclusive on that point. From those damages, however, there should be deducted not merely the $200 for which credit was given by the Appellate Division, but $300, which was the sum actually received by the plaintiff from the defendant at the time of the repudiation of the option.\nBut, again with profound respect, there would seem to have been a misapprehension as to the measure of damages. The option was treated as unconditional and damages were assessed as for the breach of a firm contract of sale. Now the option was on its face subject to the condition that, at any time before Stover had taken it up, Gold might sell the property at a price not less than $16 per acre, provided he did so without the intervention of an agent and without advertising, on paying to Stover $300 as compensation for his loss in being deprived of the option. Since the property has been found to have been actually worth $20 an acre the chance of this condition being fulfilled was by no means negligible and an option subject to it was obviously of less value than an unconditional contract of sale. It may well be that the damages for loss of such an option would fall short of the $3,335 for which the plaintiff has judgment. But, inasmuch as the defendant has not appealed in regard to the quantum of the recovery, I would be disposed not to disturb the present judgment unless the plaintiff insists on our doing so. If he is satisfied to accept it, I would dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.\nBut, although I understand that two of my colleagues share this view we do not constitute a majority. With some reluctance, because the appellant will hereby obtain relief which he has not sought, in order that an effective judgment may be pronounced I concur in the following disposition of the appeal and cross-appeal which, as I understand it, will meet the approval of my brothers Idington and Brodeur.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs. Upon the cross-appeal the question of damages will be referred to the proper local officer should either party so desire and within one month file an election to take such reference. If a reference is not so taken the cross-appeal will be dismissed with costs. If a reference is taken and results in the damages being assessed at more than $3,335 the defendant will pay to the plaintiff his costs of the cross-appeal and of the reference; if the damages be assessed at $3,335 or less the plaintiff will pay to the defendant his costs of the cross-appeal and reference.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action in damages arising out of an option agreement by which Gold agreed to sell to Stover a property for a price of about $20,000. Gold, however, on the payment of $300 could withdraw this option and sell the property to some other person, provided he would not utilize the services of an agent. Stover could exercise his option on or before the 1st March, 1917, and would then have to pay half of the purchase price. But before Stover exercised his option, Gold advised him on the 11th January, 1917, that he had sold the property to another person and enclosed with the letter a cheque for $300 payable under the terms of the option agreement.\nAs Stover had satisfied himself later on that the sale had not been made in accordance with the terms of the option and that Gold had utilized the services of a real estate agent to carry it through, he filed a caveat to protect his interest in the lands in February, 1917, and in October, 1917, he instituted the present action in damages.\nThis action was dismissed by the trial judge on the ground, that Stover should have accepted the option and tendered the money.\nThis judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division. Gold now appeals.\nThere was some question as to the construction of the agreement but this point was not pressed before us. It seems to me very plain that the agreement means that Stover could not sell the property through agents; and it has been found by the two courts below that Gold sold the property through an agent, and in that respect the findings of this fact by two courts below should not be disturbed. The point which is now raised by Gold is that Stover, instead of considering the agreement as terminated by the repudiation, elected to have it specifically performed and filed a caveat.\nThis point has not been raised by the pleadings nor in the courts below. It may be that if this issue had been tried circumstances might have been adduced which would have set aside this contention. The respondent Stover cross appeals on the ground that he should receive not merely half of the damages found by the court below but all the damages. The damages seem to have been ascertained as if the contract was a contract of sale between the parties and not a contract of option agreement. Both parties are willing that this question of damages should be referred to the Master to be fully inquired into.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs with a proviso that the whole question of damages be referred to the Master.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In this case both courts were of opinion, on the construction of the option to purchase granted by Gold to Stover, that the former, during the interval of time given by him to the latter to pay the first half of the purchase price, to wit until March 1st, 1917, could sell the property provided he did so without any advertising and without the services of any agent, and for a price of not less than $16.00 per acre. I accept this construction of the contract of option which does not appear to be open to reasonable doubt.\nI also agree with the two courts in holding that, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, Gold committed a breach of his contract by selling the farm to Ponsford, inasmuch as, although the price was for more than $16.00 per acre, the sale was effected through an agent.\nSo far I am in agreement with the learned trial judge and with the learned Chief Justice of Alberta. I respectfully however differ from the former as to the effect of the breach by Gold of the contract of option he had given to Stover. The learned trial judge dismissed Stover's action because he had not, on or before March 1st, tendered to Gold the amount payable in cash on account of the purchase of the farm. In my opinion no such obligation was incumbent on Stover, for Gold, by his sale to Ponsford, had put it out of his power to sell to Stover, or, to the same effect, had definitely repudiated his obligation to sell to Stover if the latter carried out the conditions of the option. It does not appear to be open to Gold to answer that before he had actually made a transfer of the land to Ponsford in the land titles office, Stover had ample time to take proceedings under his option to force a sale to him and to file, as he actually did, a caveat to protect his right to a transfer of the land. The breach by Gold of the option and his sale to a third party gave Stover the right to claim immediately the damages suffered by him in consequence of this breach, and, in my opinion, he was not obliged to make a tender to Gold, when the latter had sold the property to a stranger. (Anson, Law of contract, 14th ed., p. 350).\nThere is therefore only a question of damages at issue, and although Stover unnecessarily alleged that he was still ready to carry out the option and to fulfil all its conditions, his action against Gold was for damages. It is true that Stover asked for a lien against the land for the amount of the damages, but, at least since a bond was furnished him, the question is reduced to one of damages, and no such lien has been granted him.\nThe Appellate Division found that Stover could have sold the land for $20 per acre, making a profit of $7,110, but inasmuch as one Madge had promised to furnish him the money to purchase the land on condition of obtaining a half interest therein, Stover only obtained a judgment for one half of the above sum, to wit, $3,355, as being the amount of his share in the profit to be made on a resale, and now Stover demands the whole $7,110 by his cross-appeal.\nVery respectfully, I cannot agree with the view adopted by the Appellate Division, It may well be that Stover would have had to pay Madge one half of the profit made by a resale, or of any damages recovered by him from Gold, but this is on account of an agreement between him and Madge, to which Gold was no party. As between Stover and Gold, I think the latter is not entitled to any deduction by reason of the agreement between Stover and Madge. I dis-discussed a somewhat similar situation recently in Bainton v. John Hallam, Limited[6].\nThis however does not mean that Stover is entitled to the same amount of damages as if he had made with Gold an agreement of sale which Gold had refused to carry out. He had only an option, under which Gold could sell if he obtained an offer of at least $16 per acre, without any advertising or the services of any agent, and then Stover was only entitled to $300 which Gold actually paid to him and which he has not returned.\nThe acceptance by Stover of Gold's cheque for $300 does not prevent the former from claiming full damages for the breach of the option, for this acceptance was induced by Gold's assurance that the sale to Ponsford had not been made through an agent, but clearly the only damages which Stover can obtain is for the breach of an option which reserved a right of sale to Gold until Stover took up the option by paying on or before March 1st half of the purchase price. Under these circumstances the measure of damages is the value of Stover's right to purchase, qualified as it was by Gold's right to sell to a stranger, provided the sale was not advertised or made through an agent. On the construction of the option, it looks as though Stover himself had in view the sale of the property as agent for Gold, his commission being the excess of the sale price over and above the price mentioned in the option, and this construction is fortified by the words \"or through other agents\" in the last paragraph of the option, but be that as it may, the right of Gold to sell himself must be regarded as substantially diminishing the value of the option acquired by Stover and of which he was deprived by the latter's sale to Ponsford.\nIn this view of the case, the position taken by the parties before this court must be considered. Gold contended that Stover by his caveat and subsequent conduct had insisted on the agreement being specifically performed, and was deprived of any right of recovery inasmuch as he had not tendered half of the purchase price before March 1st. Stover considered the measure of his damages as being the same as if he had obtained a firm contract for the purchase of the property instead of a restricted and qualified option. Both parties have therefore misconceived their legal position. Under these circumstances, I think Gold's appeal is clearly unfounded and should be dismissed with costs.\nStover's cross-appeal involves the question whether, having been deprived of a restricted and qualified right of purchase\u2014which he might have lost in case of a sale by Gold in accordance with the option, and then his damages were fixed at $300\u2014he is really entitled to more than he obtained in the appellate division on a basis which I respectfully think was erroneous. After full consideration, I have come to the conclusion that, if either party desires, there should be a reference to the proper local officer to determine the amount of damages to which Stover is entitled, the whole as stated in the judgment of my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1919] 3 W.W.R. 503.\n[2] [1919] 1 W.W.R. 882.\n[3] 2 E.

[1914] Ch. 195, sec. 40 (6).\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (47 Ont. L.R. 1) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Railway and Municipal Board which upheld the assessment on the income from appellant\u2019s oil and gas wells.\nThe head\u2011note states the question raised for decision.\nTilley K.C. and K.G. Kerr for the appellant.\nPike K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the result which each of the courts below arrived at, is in accord with the correct interpretation and construction of the Assessment Act in question herein. To depart therefrom and attempt to apply the views maintained by appellant would lead to much confusion in many conceivable cases, as, for example, the case of a company doing business in two different municipalities.\nIf, as is quite conceivable, the section does an injustice and happens to produce results out of harmony with the general principles possibly supposed to be underlying the definition of \u201cincome\u201d in the Assessment Act, or in the legislation set forth in the Mining Act, it is not for us to interfere.\nThe language used is definite and express and is not, as I read it, in conflict with the literal definition as given of the word \u201cincome\u201d though it may be a limitation thereof as to a specified case and a departure from the supposed principles had in mind by the draftsman of the definition.\nThere is nothing remarkable in that, when the subject matter of any legislation in any place happens to be taxation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Subsection 3 of section 36 of the Ontario Assessment Act, of 1904, c. 23, reads as follows:\u2014\n(3) In estimating the value of mineral lands, such lands and the buildings thereon shall be valued and estimated at the value of other lands in the neighbourhood for agricultural purposes, but the income derived from any mine or mineral work shall be subject to taxation in the same manner as other incomes under this Act. By sec. 4 of c. 41 of the statutes of 1907 the following words were added to s.s. 3:\u2014\nAnd the assessment on such income shall be made by, and the tax leviable thereon shall be paid to, the municipality in which such mine or mineral work is situate. Provided, however, that the assessment for income from each oil or gas well operated at any time during the year shall be at least twenty dollars.\nAs consolidated in the Revision of 1914 (c. 195, s. 40 (6)) these provisions now read:\u2014\n(6) The income tax from a mine or mineral work shall be assessed by, and the tax leviable thereon shall be paid to, the municipality in which such mine or mineral work is situate. Provided that the assessment on income from each oil or gas well operated at any time during the year shall be at least $20.\nAn exemption for buildings, plant and machinery is provided by s.s. 4, and by s.s. 5 it is provided that mineral land is in no case to be assessed at less than the value of other land in the neighbourhood used for agricultural purposes.\nHaving regard to the history of this legislation I am, with great respect, unable to accept the view of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that in the case of oil and gas properties each well operated is to be deemed a distinct \u201cmine or mineral work\u201d and that the income therefrom must be assessed separately. I cannot regard the amendment made in 1907 as intended to do more, in addition to providing for the localization of the assessment, than to provide that the minimum tax on any gas and oil producing property shall be $20 for each well in operation at any time during the year on such property.\nThe expression \u201cmine or mineral work\u201d is not defined in the statute and what it may include must, I think, in every case depend on the circumstances. In the case at bar there is no evidence to enable us to determine whether each of the two wells assessed is in itself, or forms part of, a distinct mine or mineral working, or whether the two wells assessed are parts of the same \u201cmine or mineral working.\u201d\nBut, however that may be, I agree with the view of the learned Chief Justice that expenditure on the sinking of new wells or the deepening of existing wells, whether productive or dry, is expenditure on capital account and is not deductible from earnings for the purpose of arriving at the \u201cincome\u201d of the mine or mineral working assessable under s.s. 6 of s. 40 of the Revised Statutes of 1914.\nI am quite unable to appreciate the grounds on which the appellant contends that an adverse difference between receipts and expenditure in one year, (the latter in this case including capital outlay) should be taken into account and deducted from earnings of a succeeding year in order to arrive at the \u201cincome\u201d for the latter year. The definition of \u201cincome\u201d in s. 2 (2) as\nthe annual profit or gain derived (inter alia)\nfrom any business in my opinion excludes any such deduction.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014On the ground that the expenditure incurred by the appellant in drilling wells where no mineral oil or natural gas was obtained, and which expenditure the appellant states was money totally lost, was properly capital expenditure for the development of the oil field, and not expenses which should be charged against the revenue derived from productive wells, I am of opinion that the appeal fails. With great deference, I cannot concur in the view of the Appellate Division that the proviso added in 1907 to subsection 6 of section 40 of the Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 195) governs the construction of the first part of the subsection which was enacted in 1904. This proviso merely determined a minimum amount for the assessment on the income from each oil or gas well operated at any time during the year, but, in my opinion, did not make it obligatory to consider each productive gas or oil well as a separate entity the income of which should be separately assessed. Whether it should be so considered is a question to be determined according to the circumstances of each case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kerr, McNevin & Kerr.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wilson, Pike & Stewart.\n[1] 47 Ont.

The appellant guaranteed payment of moneys owing by J. After payment was due, the debt and covenant of guarantee were assigned to the respondent. A notice of the assignment was given to the appellant, the guarantor, but not to J., the primary debtor. The trial court and the Court of Appeal both held that this notice was sufficient to enable recovery against the appellant. But the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the trial judge, finding that the moneys advanced to J. by E. (to whom the guarantee was given) were really the moneys of the respondent and not of the estate of which E. was trustee and the respondent administratrix; and hence on the assignment to respondent the debt was hers in her own right; and the respondent was entitled to a judgment on her action.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel and reserving judgment, dismissed the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAlfred Bull for the appellant.\nF.H.

Anglin and Mignault JJ., while not reversing the finding of facts of the trial judge, held that, in view of all the circumstances in evidence, the oral condition, to which the respondent deposes, was not a condition precedent to the use of his guarantee, but was rather a term of the guarantee, at the highest of the nature of a condition subsequent, and consequently that it could not be proved by parol evidence.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division,[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Scott J., who had dismissed the respondent's action and ordering a new trial.\nThe respondent, plaintiff, and the appellant, defendant, were carrying on business in partnership as farmers, ranchers and general dealers in cattle. The respondent alleged that the appellant orally agreed to buy out the respondent's interest in the partnership on certain terms and sued for the price agreed. The appellant denied this, pleaded the statute of Frauds and counterclaimed for an order dissolving the partnership and for an accounting. Upon the case coming on for trial, the respondent admitted that among the assets of the partnership was a leasehold interest in some real estate. The trial judge then dismissed the respondent's action holding that such an agreement as the one in the present case was within the statute of Frauds and must be in writing. The Appellate Division held that such an oral agreement was not within the statute, where there is nothing in the partnership agreement to show that \"contrary intention\" referred to in sec. 24 of \"The Partnership Ordinance,\" which provides that unless such intention appears land which has become partnership property shall be treated as between the partners as personal estate.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for both parties, reserved judgment, and, at a subsequent date, dismissed the appeal with costs, Duff J. dissenting.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nA.

The Appellate Division disallowed the claim for freight and reduced the damages to $1,500; Ives J. dissenting, held that the judgment below should be varied by ordering the return to the respondent of the machines in respect to which the trial judge had awarded the whole purchase price as damages. The Supreme Court of Canada, Sir Louis Davies C.J. dissenting, allowed the appeal taken to this court. It affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division as to the second and third items of the first judgment but it increased the damages to the sum of $4,910.20.

Judgment was given for the plaintiff on both grounds. The judgment was not satisfied and a second action was instituted in Saskatchewan against the respondent, then resident there, which was based principally on the respondent's personal obligation on his covenant for payment in the agreement of sale.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the obtaining of the judgment in British Columbia amounted to an election on the part of the vendor for cancellation of the agreement of sale and that he was no longer at liberty to sue upon the covenant.\nJudgment of the Appeal Court (12 Sask. L.R. 183) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] affirming the judgment of the trial court,[2] which dismissed the appellant's action. By an agreement in writing dated February 4, 1913, the appellant sold to the respondent certain land in British Columbia for $24,500, payable in instalments. The respondent paid $5,500 cash but made default in paying the first instalment due. The appellant then took an action in British Columbia against the respondent then living in Ontario, asking for an account to be taken of the amount due under the agreement, and for payment of that amount within a time to be fixed, and, in default of payment, that the contract be cancelled and the moneys paid be forfeited to the appellant. The British Columbia court made the order as asked and fixed two months as the delay during which the respondent should pay. The respondent failed to pay, and the appellant entered judgment for the amount due. Later on, the appellant brought the present action in Saskatchewan on the judgment obtained in British Columbia and, in the alternative, on the personal covenant to pay in the agreement. The action on the judgment failed before all the courts because the respondent was not a resident of British Columbia at the time of the institution of the first action.\nSchull, for the appellant.\nGregory K.C., for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting.)\u2014The appellant, by an agreement dated 4th February, 1913, sold, and respondent agreed to buy, certain lands in British Columbia for the sum of $24,500, of which $5,500 was paid in cash and the balance was to be paid in instalments which the respondent covenanted to pay appellant.\nThe agreement provided that time was to be of the essence of the contract and that as often as default should happen in making the payments the vendor (the appellant) might give the vendee (the respondent) thirty days' notice in writing demanding payment thereof and that in case such default should continue the agreement should, at the expiration of such notice, be null and void and the vendor have the right to re-enter upon said lands, and any payments theretofore made might be retained by the vendor as liquidated damages and the vendor be entitled to re-sell said lands.\nIt was further provided that this notice should be well and sufficiently given if given the vendee, or mailed at Vancouver post office in British Columbia under registered cover addressed to George B. C. Sharpe, Oak Bay, B.C.\nThe further payments besides the cash payment fell far short of the requirements of the agreement.\nNo such notice as thus provided for was ever given.\nThe respondent left British Columbia without actually moving his household effects into the dwelling house on said lands. The premises were unoccupied by either party thenceforward.\nOn the 26th October, 1916, the appellant issued a writ of summons from the Supreme Court of British Columbia to recover from respondent the sums then due. And in the special indorsement set forth her claim as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff's claim is to have an account taken of what is due to the plaintiff for interest, cost, charges and expenses under and by virtue of the covenants contained in certain articles of agreement dated the fourth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell to the defendant and the defendant agreed to purchase from the plaintiff that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the district of Victoria, in the Province of British Columbia, and known and described as lots 45 and 46 and the south half of lot 41 in 'Block' numbered \"D,\" being subdivision of Block D, section 22, in said Victoria District at the price of $24,500, payable with interest as therein mentioned and for an order that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff the amount so found due, together with the plaintiff's costs, to be taxed within such time as this court may order.\nAnd for an order that in default of payment of the amount so found due within such time that the agreement be declared null and void and cancelled.\nAnd that all moneys paid thereunder be forfeited to the plaintiff and that the said defendant do stand absolutely barred and foreclosed of all right, title and interest of in and to the said lands and agreement.\nAnd also in the event of such default, for such damages as the plaintiff may have suffered by reason of the defendant's failure to perform the said agreement.\nThat writ of summons was duly served by personal service on respondent in Toronto in Ontario.\nThere was no appearance entered by the respondent.\nAn exemplification of judgment was got and admitted as evidence herein at the trial hereof which is an action in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan to recover on said judgment the amount thereof or alternatively to recover on the said agreement the amount due for unpaid instalments. Omitting the formal parts of the exemplification that judgment is expressed in the following terms:\u2014\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nBetween:\nJOSEPHINE JULIE DAVIDSON,\nWIFE OF JOHN L. DAVIDSON,\nPlaintiff,\nand\nGEORGE B. SHARPS,\nof the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario.\nDefendant.\nB.C. L.S.\n$1.00.\nDated the 15th day of June, A.D. 1915.\nIn pursuance of the Order of the Honourable the Chief Justice made the 1st day of February, 1915, and in pursuance of the Registrar's Certificate herein dated the 4th day of March, 1915. IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the plaintiff do recover against the defendant the sum of $14,185.15, together with costs taxed at the sum of $131.95.\nBy the Court,\nA. B. POTTINGER,\nDistrict Registrar.\nUpon that judgment I respectfully submit that the appellant was entitled to recover in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan judgment herein.\nIt is urged by respondent that the court in British Columbia so entering judgment had no jurisdiction by reason of the respondent having left the province of British Columbia at the time of service of said writ.\nInasmuch as the parties hereto were in British Columbia when the contract was made and was to be performed and hence breach there and that it was made in respect of land there, I have no doubt of the jurisdiction or of the right to assert it by service of writ beyond the jurisdiction.\nI should have preferred in such a case, however, to have evidence that Order XI of the Rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia had been duly complied with by leave of a judge of that court having been duly obtained.\nHowever, I think that the presumption exists and must prevail that all that was duly complied with and none the less so, because the objection, as presented here, was not relative to any defect in that regard but upon broader grounds which I hold untenable in this case.\nThe more serious question raised is that upon which the courts below proceeded in dismissing the action.\nIt is this, that upon an application, in course of the proceedings, to the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia he made an order of reference to the registrar of the court to take the accounts between the parties and directed that judgment might be entered against the defendant for the amount so certified to be due to the plaintiff\u2014and then proceeded to declare as follows:\u2014\nAnd this court doth further order that upon the defendant paying to the plaintiff what shall be certified to be due to her as aforesaid within two months after the date of the Registrar's Certificate at such time and place as shall thereby be appointed the plaintiff do convey the lands, hereditaments and premises comprised in the said Agreement for sale free and clear of and from all encumbrances done by her or any persons claiming by, from or under her and deliver up all deeds, writings, in her custody or power relating thereto, to the defendant or to whom he shall appoint;\nBut in default of the defendant paying to the plaintiff what shall be certified to be due to her as aforesaid by the time aforesaid that the defendant thenceforth do stand absolutely barred and foreclosed of and from all right, title, interest and equity of redemption, of in and to the said agreement and of, in and to the said lands, hereditaments and premises, and that the said agreement be thereupon cancelled and ended and all moneys paid thereunder forfeited to the plaintiff and that the defendant do deliver to the plaintiff possession of the said lands, hereditaments and premises which are set out and described in the said agreement.\nIt is to be observed that the certificate of the registrar fixing the amount due was dated, as appears from the recital in the judgment of which exemplification is adduced in evidence, on the 4th of March, 1915, and that the judgment sued upon is entered the 15th June, 1915, a month or six weeks after this declaratory order of the Chief Justice, if adhered to and operative, must have put an end to any further right to proceed.\nHow can we say that this latter judgment sued upon was a nullity as in effect the courts below have done?\nWhat right have we to impose, without an appeal in due course, our notions of law and fact, upon the appellant and his judgment and declare it was and is a mere nullity? How do we know that nothing was done in the meantime to rectify the possible mistake of such an alleged election or that the purpose of the appellant was to elect to rescind the agreement?\nHad there been evidence adduced of the entry having been, according to the practice recognized by the courts there, (or argument adduced herein to shew that as matter of law it was) a mere error on the part of those concerned, the way might have been made open to us to apply our view of the election alleged to have been made, as a final determination of the matter.\nThat however could not enable us to be quite sure of the facts as to whether or not there had been any amendment to the original order of reference enabling the plaintiff to revoke the alleged election. It would have been quite competent for the court there, for any good reason, to have made such an amendment.\nCan there be a doubt that the judgment sued upon stands in full force and is exigible in British Columbia?\nI respectfully submit that, so long as it is so, it seems to me absurd to hold that upon the production of an exemplification thereof it cannot be recoverable in other provinces.\nI am unable to understand how we can herein declare that the provision for rescission of purchase stood valid and conclusive despite the later record of the court quite inconsistent therewith if we have regard to the maxim of omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite et solenniter esse acta.\nMoreover the parties chose by their agreement expressly to provide a mode by which it should become null and the consequence thereof, and that mode was not followed or anything like it which we should be able to say was a substantial compliance therewith. The decision of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in the case of Standard Trust v. Little[3] relied upon below does not seem in this regard to be in point.\nWhether there was in fact incorporated in the agreement of purchase there in question a specific mode as here existed of terminating the vendee's rights, does not appear. For all that appears the court had to proceed upon the relative rights of the vendor and purchaser, before the court, when default made and that the court adopted the not unusual mode of dealing with a defaulting purchaser according to general principles of law. Moreover the order or judgment was one consistent complete whole not leaving it open to surmise of what the court had determined. Here the alleged intention has to be gathered from the separate and inconsistent pieces of judicial proceedings of which the latest is a complete judgment which does not put appellant to an election.\nAgain there is much reason for saying that a lien such as a vendor's lien might be looked upon as a mortgage has been by courts of equity, and therefore, a charge of that kind which might be foreclosed and that a decree nisi of foreclosure was what was intended.\nIf that was the conception of the court in using the word \"foreclosed\" in the order above quoted, then there was no final order and there remained the option of the plaintiff prosecuting a foreclosure suit to abandon his proceedings therefor and follow his remedy on the personal obligation.\nThese are only surmises of what may have developed as law in the local court.\nI prefer assuming some such kind of development to that of construing this foreclosure judgment as a final rescission of the agreement and especially so when we find the same court ignoring what had transpired and pronouncing the complete, self-contained, comprehensive judgment herein sued upon, which was recovered after the lapse of time given by the earlier order had expired.\nThe cases cited are beside the question.\nI prefer holding that the court which, after all that it had declared was to take place in two months and which if effective could not permit of a judgment such as sued on being entered over three months later, has in doing so found good reason, either on new facts presented or something otherwise said or done which, within its practice, enabled it, if it saw fit, to proceed to enter judgment, and that its doing so was deliberate.\nThere is nothing in the evidence to warrant any one in holding otherwise and the presumption is in favour of the judgment being duly entered and meaning what it says.\nI therefore conclude that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment be entered accordingly.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Practically conceding that the personal judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, on default of appearance against the defendant, who appeared on the face of the proceedings in that court to have been a resident of Ontario and was served there with process, is of no avail outside of British Columbia, counsel for the appellant rested his appeal on the ground that his alternative cause of action\u2014the defendant's personal obligation on his covenant for payment in the agreement for sale\u2014is open to him in Saskatchewan. I agree that merger cannot be pleaded as a defence; Smith v. Nicolls;[4] Bank of Australasia v. Harding[5]. But the appellant is met by the order of the Chief Justice of British Columbia, pronounced in the action brought in that province granting the relief there sought by him, viz., the taking of accounts, a personal judgment for the amount to be certified thereon as due by the defendant, an order for conveyance by the plaintiff on payment thereof within two months, and in default foreclosure absolute and cancellation of the agreement. It has been held by the courts of Saskatchewan that by accepting this order the appellant elected to take the remedy of cancellation in the event of default of payment within the time fixed by the order and that he thereby relinquished all right thereafter to recover any part of the purchase money. Counsel for the appellant on the other hand contends that the order taken in the Supreme Court of British Columbia was in the nature of an order nisi, similar in its effect to the ordinary judgment granted in a suit for foreclosure of a mortgage after trial to be followed by a final order before the equity of redemption is extinguished. This latter view however seems to ignore the essential difference between a judgment for foreclosure in a mortgage action and an order or judgment for cancellation of an agreement for sale due to the difference between a mortgage and such an agreement.\nThe trial judge after the conclusion of the trial offered the plaintiff an opportunity to obtain evidence on commission. to ascertain the law in British Columbia as to whether the order or judgment cancelled or has the effect of cancelling the agreement therein referred to or does such an order or judgment preclude the plaintiff from enforcing her judgment or suing for the purchase money under the said agreement, default having been made by the defendant in the payment of the amount found due.\nThe plaintiff declined to take advantage of the indulgence thus extended. The learned judge was therefore justified in assuming that the order of the Chief Justice of British Columbia would have the same effect in that province as the like order made by an Alberta Court would have within its jurisdiction. Nothing has been brought to our attention, nor am I aware of anything, that indicates a difference in this respect between the law which obtains in British Columbia or the practice of its courts and the law and practice of the English courts or of the courts of other provinces of Canada whose juridical systems are based on English law.\nThe relations of mortgagor and mortgagee in English courts of equity are anomalous. Platt v. Ashbridge[6]. \"Once a mortgage always a mortgage\" is a doctrine so deeply rooted in our system of equity that after the period for redemption fixed by an ordinary judgment for foreclosure has expired the mortgagor's right to redeem de piano still subsists until a further and final order of foreclosure has been obtained. Even after such final order has been made our courts of equity regard the mortgage as still unextinguished and unsatisfied so long as the mortgagee retains the land. He may at any time enforce the personal obligation of the mortgagor on his covenant, thereby opening the foreclosure and revesting in the mortgagor his right to redemption as it was before the judgment; and the courts maintain a corresponding jurisdiction to allow the mortgagor after final order, under exceptional circumstances raising an equity in his favour, to redeem on proper terms. When the mortgagee in any way as owner alters his relation to the land he elects to take it and foregoes his debt\u2014but not until then. Sir George Jessel states the doctrine very clearly in Campbell v. Holyland[7]; see too Trinity College v. Hill[8]. Mutual Life v. Douglas[9], is a recent instance of the mortgagee's right after foreclosure to enforce the covenant being upheld. The development of the equity jurisdiction in regard to the foreclosure of mortgages is outlined by Griffith C.J. in Fink v. Robertson[10].\nBy taking a foreclosure judgment the mortgagee does not take the property for his debt. The judgment, notwithstanding its absolute form, is construed as merely authorizing him to do so. The foreclosure judgment in the mortgage action is merely a means of enforcing the mortgage contract, which it deals with as subsisting; whereas the judgment for rescission or cancellation of a contract between vendor and purchaser is a judgment not for the enforcement but for the extinguishment of the contract. When the vendor sought and obtained a judgment fixing a period for payment and providing that on default\nthe agreement shall be cancelled and at an end and all moneys paid thereunder forfeited to the plaintiff,\nhe elected in my opinion, on that event happening, to take the property in satisfaction of so much of the purchase money as then remained unpaid. If he had intended to reserve his right of election until after default had been made, his proper course would have been to ask, in lieu of the relief granted by the order in that event, for a reservation of liberty to apply for further relief. (Seton on Decrees.(7 ed) pp. 2171 and 2220-1).\nInstead of waiting until default had occurred under the judgment ordering the defendant to perform his contract and then applying for its rescission the plaintiff sought and obtained in advance the order usually made after such default\u2014which may be for immediate rescission, Clark v. Wallis[11], or for rescission after the lapse of a further short period and may in the latter event apparently issue at the time of the application, Simpson v. Terry[12], or only on the expiry of the further time so allowed. Foligno v. Martin[13]. The order in the case at bar, although issued in the first instance instead of after default in payment under a judgment of the court, is similar in form to that pronounced in Simpson v. Terry12, and I cannot doubt that, on default happening under it, it operated to put an end to the agreement just as the order in Simpson v. Terry12 did.\nMr. Justice Lamont states the law very clearly and accurately, if I may say so, in delivering the judgment of the Court en Banc in Standard Trust v. Little[14].\nThe anomalies introduced by courts of equity in regard to the relations between mortgagor and mortgagee do not exist in regard to vendor and purchaser. A judgment or order declaring that on the happening of a certain event an agreement for sale shall be cancelled and at an end means precisely what it says and not merely that the plaintiff shall thereupon be entitled to have it cancelled and put an end to. When the purchaser under the order of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia made default the agreement ceased to exist and the foundation for any right of personal recovery from the purchaser (except for costs) was gone. The purchaser thereafter had no further right to the land and the court has no jurisdiction to restore him to his former position. The vendor has the land. He cannot have the purchase money also.\nShould the plaintiff attempt to recover under the personal judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia which he issued after default in payment under the Chief Justice's order, I have little doubt that the defendant could on application have his right to do so restricted to the costs of the action. Jackson v. Scott[15]. Indeed it would seem to be altogether probable that what was intended by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia was that personal judgment against the defendant should issue forthwith upon the amount due being ascertained and certified and should be enforceable as to the debt and interest during the two months allowed for payment by the purchaser, and that if the matter had been brought to his attention he would not have sanctioned the issue of the judgment taken out from the Registrar's office after the two months allowed for payment had expired and purporting to be in pursuance of his order.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs. Brodeur J.\u2014An action had been instituted in British Columbia by a vendor against a purchaser for the balance of the purchase price and for cancellation of the deed of sale in case of default of payment.\nA decree was pronounced by the British Columbia courts declaring that the judgment should be entered against the purchaser for a certain amount which he should pay within two months and that\nin default of the defendant paying to the plaintiff what shall be certified to be due to her as aforesaid by the time aforesaid that the defendant thenceforth do stand absolutely debarred and foreclosed of and from all right, title, interest and equity of redemption of in and to the said agreement and of in and to the said lands, hereditaments and premises and that the said agreement be thereupon cancelled and ended and all moneys paid thereunder forfeited to the plaintiff and that the defendant do deliver to the plaintiff possession of the said lands, hereditaments and premises which are set out and described in the said agreement.\nThe purchaser has made default in payment.\nA new action, which is the present one, has been instituted on the covenant, in Saskatchewan, and it is contested by the purchaser on the ground that, the agreement having been cancelled by the British Columbia judgment, no claim can be made by the plaintiff for the payment of the purchase price.\nOn the other hand it is contended by the vendor that the judgment was not a final order or foreclosure but rather an order nisi.\nThe Saskatchewan courts held that the British Columbia judgment amounted to an election on the part of the plaintiff to take cancellation or to a rescission in the event of default in payment.\nThe decree is absolute in its terms. It provides that the deed is cancelled if within two months the purchaser does not pay the amount due.\nThe original action might have demanded only the amount due without asking for cancellation and if the plaintiff had been unable to recover his debt then he could have asked for the cancellation of the agreement. But his action, as instituted before the British Columbia Courts looks to me as an election on his part to take back the property sold, unless the defendant pays the purchase price.\nThe authorities say that if a contract provides that on the happening of a certain event it shall be void and that it may be rescinded by the party injured, that the contract is not void for both parties, but simply voidable at the request of the party that suffers. Fry, Specific Performance, (5th ed.,) sec. 1046.\nThe stipulation in a contract of sale that the deed would become null and void if the buyer failed to make any payment is exclusively in the interest of the seller, who has a right to choose between the rescission of the contract and its execution.\nBut when a judgment has been rendered on such a clause pronouncing that the failure to pay within two months would bring about the rescission of the contract; and when such a decree has been taken by the vendor himself it seems to me that it constitutes on his part an election of his right to cancel. He could not then later on proceed to collect the amount which had been originally promised to him by the covenant, since he has agreed that the agreement was cancelled.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The whole question is as to the effect of a judgment obtained in British Columbia by the appellant against the respondent.\nThe appellant had made an agreement with the respondent for the sale of certain lands in British Columbia, and on this agreement, in October, 1914, the appellant took against the respondent, who then lived in Ontario and made default, an action in British Columbia, in which her claim is stated as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff's claim is to have an account taken of what is due to the plaintiff for interest, cost, charges and expenses, under and by virtue of the covenants contained in certain articles of agreement dated the fourth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell to the defendant and the defendant agreed to purchase from the plaintiff that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the District of Victoria in the Province of British Columbia and known and described as lots 45 and 46 and the south half of lot 41 in Block numbered D, being Subdivision of Block D, section 22, in said Victoria District, a the price of $24,500, payable with interest as therein mentioned; and for an order that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff the amount so found due together with the plaintiff's costs to be taxed within such time as this court may order.\nAnd for an order that in default of payment of the amount so found due within such time that the agreement be declared null and void and cancelled.\nAnd that all moneys paid thereunder be forfeited to the plaintiff and that the said defendant do stand absolutely barred and foreclosed of all right, title and interest of in and to the said lands and agreement.\nAnd also in the event of such default, for such damages as the plaintiff may have suffered by reason of the defendant's failure to perform the said agreement.:\nOn this action the following order was made on the first of February, 1915, which in every respect agrees with the claim stated by the appellant:\nUpon the application of the plaintiff herein and upon hearing counsel in support of the application and upon hearing read the affidavit of Mr. M. C. Caple sworn and filed herein:\nThis court doth order that the following accounts be taken by the Registrar of this court namely:\u2014\n1. An account of what is due to the plaintiff under and by virtue of the agreement for sale in the pleadings mentioned and for her costs in this action, such costs to be taxed by the taxing Master.\n2. An account of the rents and profits of the hereditaments comprised in the said agreement for sale received by the plaintiff or by any other person or persons by the order of or for the use of the plaintiff or which without the wilful default of the plaintiff might have been so received. And let what shall appear to be due on taking account No. 2 be deducted from what shall appear to be due to the plaintiff on account No. 1 and let the balance be certified by the said Registrar, and let judgment be entered against the defendant for the amount so certified to be due to the plaintiff.\nAnd this court doth further order that upon the defendant paying to the plaintiff what shall be certified to be due to her as aforesaid within two months after the date of the Registrar's certificate at such time and place as shall thereby be appointed the plaintiff do convey the lands, hereditaments and premises comprised in the said agreement for sale free and clear of and from all incumbrances done by her or any person claiming by, from, or under her, and deliver up all deeds or writings in her custody or power relating thereto to the defendant or to whom he shall appoint.\nBut in default of the defendant paying to the plaintiff what shall be certified to be due to her as aforesaid, by the time aforesaid, that the defendant thenceforth do stand absolutely debarred and foreclosed of and from all right, title, interest and equity of redemption of, in and to the said agreement, and of, in and to the said lands and hereditaments and premises, and that the said agreement be thereupon cancelled and ended, and all moneys paid thereunder forfeited to the plaintiff and that the defendant do deliver to the plaintiff possession of the said lands, hereditaments and premises which are set out and described in the said agreement.\nAn account of moneys due by the respondent to the appellant having been taken, the appellant obtained on the 15th June, 1915, a judgment against the respondent for $14,185.15 and costs, which judgment was rendered in pursuance of the order of the 1st February, 1915.\nThe respondent did not pay this amount to the appellant within the two months mentioned in the order, nor at any time since, and the appellant now sues the respondent in Saskatchewan, where he resides, claiming the amount of the judgment of the 15th June, 1915, and in the alternative sues on the agreement for sale for the amount due thereunder. The respondent claims that no action lies for the purchase price, because the agreement is now cancelled by virtue of the order of the 1st February, 1915, the appellant having elected to have the agreement cancelled in default of payment. Looking at the matter from every possible angle, I fail to see how the appellant can escape from the effect of the order she obtained and of her election for cancellation of the agreement in default of payment. I do not think that she can answer the contention of the respondent by referring to the effect which is given to a covenant for cancellation inserted in an agreement for sale when the purchaser fails to pay the purchase price. Such a covenant in an agreement for sale, I take it, gives the vendor the right to elect either to claim cancellation of the agreement or the payment of the purchase price, but until the vendor has elected to have the agreement cancelled, his right to claim the price is not taken away. Here, on the contrary, the appellant elected to have the agreement cancelled by her action and by the order she obtained from the British Columbia Court, should the respondent not pay the amount found to be due to the appellant within two months from the date of the registrar's certificate. The rule una via electa non datur regressus ad alteram, sometimes expressed as follows: quod semel placuit in electionibus amplius displicere non potest, which is the principle contended for by the respondent, precludes the appellant from now obtaining judgment for the purchase price.\nThe appellant argues that the order she obtained is no more than a rule nisi, calling upon the respondent to shew cause why the agreement should not be cancelled should he fail to pay within two months. I do not think this construction can be placed on the order, for by its very wording the agreement is thereupon (that is to say on the default of the respondent) cancelled and ended.\nI may add that in so far as the appellant's action upon the personal condemnation she obtained against the respondent in British Columbia is concerned, she cannot enforce this condemnation against the respondent in Saskatchewan inasmuch as the respondent was not domiciled in nor a resident of British Columbia when the action was taken there, and did not appear therein or in any way acquiesce in the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Court. See Halsbury, Laws of England, Vo. Conflict of Laws, No. 422.\nIn my opinion, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Christie & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Seaborn, Pope, Gregory & Kent.\n[1] 12 Sask.

(1909) c. 51, s. 4\u2014\"An Act respecting Conditional Sales of Goods,\" R.S. Sask. (1909), c. 145.\nThe appellant held an unpaid vendor's lien on certain chattel property in a theatre occupied by F. as tenant of the respondent R. The lien was invalid as against execution creditors of F. because of a defect in the affidavit of bona fides. These goods were first de-strained under a distress warrant, issued out of the Police Magistrate's Court, to satisfy claims for wages. Later on the same day, the respondent R. issued a distress warrant for rent to the respondent D., who seized the same chattels. A few days later and before the first seizure was abandoned, the appellant asked the respondent D. to deliver up possession of the goods, which demand was refused. After the police seizure was abandoned, the appellant took this action in damages for conversion of its property, alleging that if it had been able to obtain possession prior to execution the defect in its Hen would have been cured.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that under the circumstances, the refusal of D. to surrender the goods did not amount to conversion.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The evidence does not establish that the respondents were in a position to give possession of the goods at the time the only demand for possession was made by the appellant.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Sask. L.R. 174) affirmed, Duff J. dissenting. Appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge[2] and dismissing the appellant's action.

Indeed enough to pay the rent.\nThe appellant claimed from said bailiff after said seizure possession of said goods and, because the goods were not delivered over to him, brings this action claiming there was a conversion thereof by virtue of the demand and refusal.\nAt common law he could not have a shadow of ground for making such claim. For not only were the goods of strangers liable to distress but the retention of the possession by the landlord when destrained was his only security and, so far as not modified by statute, is the law yet.\nNeedless to refer in detail to all the changes and modifications for none of them dispense with the necessity for continuation of possession by the landlord till his seizure has been prosecuted or abandoned or the goods replevied.\nAnd under and by virtue of the statutory provision of the legislature of Saskatchewan, where all this took place, the respective rights of the landlord and such a vendor are expressly provided for by section 4 of the \"act respecting distress for rent, &c.,\" as follows:\u2014\nA landlord shall not distrain for rent on the goods and chattels the property of any person except the tenant, or person who is liable for the rent, although the same are found on the premises; but this restriction shall not apply * * * to the interest of the tenant in any goods on the premises in the possession of the tenant under a contract for purchase, or by which he may or is to become the owner thereof upon the performance of any condition * * *\nAs I understand this section, the landlord had a perfectly legal right to seize and enforce by sale all the interest the tenant had which is thus made answerable for the rent due and would have sufficed to pay same.\nUnfortunately for appellant, its hen or rights of property in the goods was not such as protected it against other creditors because not verified by the necessary affidavit in its behalf when registering it. And the sheriff for other creditors seized the goods which were afterwards duly sold thereunder, and the respondent Reid as landlord was satisfied thereout as the law provides.\nThe appellant conceived the idea that in law the landlord was bound to abandon the goods to it; and its assumption and claim is that if he had done so the creditors could not have succeeded.\nIts duty, seeing there was enough in the tenant's interest in the goods to satisfy the rent, was to have tendered the rent and then got possession and it might have held as against the creditors for both rent and amount of lien or balance or price.\nIt was so ill advised, as to imagine it could get the goods despite the above quoted statute, and perhaps defeat the landlord's claim. It has thereby lost its only chance.\nThe action is one only for conversion based only on said demand and refusal.\nIn my opinion, the judgment appealed from should stand and this appeal be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The questions raised by this appeal are accurately stated in Mr. Gregory's factum filed on behalf of the respondent; they are:\u2014(a). Had the defendant Reid a right to seize Findlay's interest in the chattels for rent? (b). If he had that right, was he bound to deliver up possession to the plaintiff, assuming the plaintiff's interest was greater than, or paramount to his interest? (c). If he had the right to seize, is he liable to damages?\nBefore proceeding to discuss these questions it is desirable to point out that a point somewhat discussed upon the argument, namely, whether the defendant's dealings with the goods amounted to conversion is entirely disposed of by the concession made at the trial and the findings of the learned trail judge and that no such point could properly be raised either in this court or in the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. Mr. Gregory, at the trial, states the issues as follows:\u2014\nI think, perhaps, my Lord, if Mr. Schull and I discuss the issue before your Lordship it will save a little time. I understand the only issue that is raised in the case is whether when we had an interest in those goods, when we went in there and seized, whether we were guilty of conversion or trespass which will entitle them to damages simply because they also had an interest in the goods; that is the whole issue of the case. It may be so or not that their interest may be paramount to ours; the full bench has decided we have an interest in these goods and having that interest, the whole question for you to decide is whether that interest\u2014whether their interest being larger than ours, we are bound to give up at their demand our possession in the goods, and having not done so, whether we are liable for damages.\nAnd the finding of the learned trial judge[3] is as follows:\nI find from the evidence, that the defendant Drackett was in possession under defendant Reid's warrant, of the goods and chattels in question therein at the time Bourdon, the plaintiff's bailiff, demanded possession thereof, and that Drackett refused to give up possession or surrender the said goods to Bourdon, and I also find from the evidence that the defendant Reid approved of and confirmed the action of his bailiff and agent, Drackett.\nThe subsidiary question as to possession under a police warrant was raised at the trial as affecting the amount of damages. That point I will discuss when dealing with the third point.\nComing then to question A as stated above, in my judgment, the Saskatchewan statute is clear upon that and that the respondent had undoubtedly the right to seize Findlay's interest. The point of substance in the case arises upon question B. With great respect, I am unable to agree with the view of the courts below as to the construction of sec. 4 of ch. 51, R.S. Sask. (1909). I think the interest which may be seized and held or sold under that section is only the interest of the tenant and that the purchaser of the interest takes it subject to all its infirmities and if the interest is of such a character as to enable the owner of some paramount interest to take possession of the chattel out of his hands in given circumstances then the purchaser takes subject to that infirmity as well as others. This, it appears to me, must equally apply where the landlord, instead of selling, exercises his right to hold the goods distrained as his pledge for rent. He is of course not obliged to sell. If the landlord sees fit to hold, that which he is entitled to hold is the interest of the tenant subject, as in the case of the purchase, to all the infirmities of that interest, subject that is to say, to any paramount interest or right of possession.\nIt is not a very convincing suggestion that the landlord who has initiated proceedings looking towards a sale is entitled to retain possession until the sale takes place. The landlord is pledgee with a statutory right of sale. His right to retain possession of the goods can be no greater and no less after he has decided to sell than during the period, which may be an indefinite one, when he is handling the goods as pledgee merely.\nThis brings us to question C, the question of damages. The first point to consider is the point argued in the appellant's factum; that at the time of the demand the goods were under seizure under police court warrant. The evidence upon this point is extremely meagre and I think it is much open to question whether the possession of the respondent was ever interrupted. However that may be, the learned trial judge finds, and the evidence amply supports his finding, that the police seizure was abandoned before the 1st Oct., 1917, the day on which the appellant's action was commenced. There can be no doubt that at the time the action was commenced the respondents were holding possession under a claim of right and denying the appellant's right of possession. That is amply proved by the letter written by the respondent's solicitor on the 29th Sept., and by the concession made at the trial by Mr. Gregory in the passage already quoted.\nThe next point, on the question of damages, arises in this way. The sheriff having taken possession of the goods on the 3rd of Oct. under a writ of execution and the right of the execution creditor under that writ having been held to be paramount to that of the appellant company under their unregistered lien note, the appellant now contends that this result is owing to the fact that by resisting them in the exercise of their rights the respondent prevented them getting possession of the goods and thus curing the defect in their security arising from the non-registration of the lien note.\nI think this contention is well founded. In my judgment, the \"Act respecting Conditional Sale of Goods,\" (R.S. Sask. [1909] ch. 145) would not have operated to prejudice the common law right of the appellant company if the respondent had given up possession of the goods before or at the time of the issue of the appellant company's writ. The legal position then is this: The respondent, having wrongfully converted the appellant's goods is prima facie responsible for the value of those goods at the time of the conversion. Moreover, the seizure by the sheriff was, in the circumstances actually existing, the direct and immediate consequence of the respondent's wrong.\nAnglin J.\u2014Under a registered agreement in writing the plaintiff held an unpaid vendor's lien on certain chattel property in a theatre occupied by one Findlay (the purchaser of the chattels) as tenant of the defendant Reid. It is res judicata that the plaintiff's lien was invalid as against execution creditors of Findlay because of a defect in the affidavit of bona fides required by section 2 (3) of ch. 145 R.S. Sask. The plaintiff alleges that if it had been able to obtain possession of the chattels by seizure prior to their being taken in execution the defect in its lien note would have been cured and its title perfected and that such possession was wrongfully withheld from it by the defendants and an execution creditor was thus enabled to seize and defeat its claim to the goods pro tanto. It accordingly sues for damages for conversion of its property by the defendants, the landlord and his bailiff.\nAssuming, but without so deciding, that the plaintiff, under its lien note had a paramount right which, notwithstanding the exception in favour of landlords made by the proviso to section 4 of the \"Act respecting Distress for Rent and Extra-judicial Seizures\" (R.S. Sask. c. 51), would have entitled it to possession of the goods although held by the defendants under a lawful distress for rent due by Findlay, that the bailiff Drackett was in error in refusing to recognize such paramount right of the plaintiff, and that actual possession, if obtained when the plaintiff's bailiff demanded it, would have enabled it to hold the goods against creditors of Findlay who might subsequently obtain judgments (but see Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. v. Dearborn)[4], I am nevertheless of the opinion that the plaintiff cannot succeed in its claim for damages for conversion of them by the defendants, because the evidence does not establish that at the time of the only demand for possession made on its behalf the defendants were in possession of the goods, or that a withdrawal of the landlord's claim would have enabled the plaintiff to obtain possession.\nThe facts on this aspect of the case are in a narrow compass. On the 24th or 25th of September a constable acting under a distress warrant issued out of the Police Magistrate's Court of the city of Moosejaw distrained the chattels in question to satisfy claims for wages prosecuted in that court. An inventory of the goods was made and signed by the distraining constable and by one Lucien Plisson, who was the caretaker of the theatre. The police, I infer from Plisson's evidence, did not think it necessary to shut down the theatre and therefore allowed Plisson to keep the keys and left him in charge, apparently without taking from him anything (except his signature to the inventory) in the nature of an attornment or formally appointing him their representative in possession. Later on the same day the landlord's bailiff came to distrain. He found Plisson in apparent possession and upon being informed by him of the earlier police seizure and being shewn the notice of seizure and inventory, he told Plisson that the priority of the police claim would be considered later. He did not ask for the keys of the theatre. He made an inventory however, prepared a notice of distress addressed to Findlay, and took from Plisson an undertaking in writing to \"look after\" and \"conduct\" the premises \"as heretofore * * * at the usual rate of pay.\" On the 27th of September Plisson locked up the theatre, held the keys for a short time and then handed them over the police\u2014he says \"as a matter of protection.\" After the police had been given the keys the plaintiff's bailiff, Burdon, on the 29th of September demanded them from Plisson, but of course he did not obtain them. Burdon then saw the landlord's bailiff, Drackett, not at the theatre but at his office, informed him that he had a warrant and lien and demanded possession of the goods in the theatre. Drackett said \"We don't recognize your claim.\" Burdon made no further effort to secure possession of the goods. The police held the keys until the second of October when the solicitor for the wage-earners appears to have concluded, for reasons not stated, that the Police Court distress could not be maintained against the plaintiff's lien and he instructed the police to abandon the seizure. They thereupon notified Drackett that he could have the keys and he then got them for the first time. On the following day he handed them over to the sheriff on his demand for possession under a writ of execution obtained in the meantime by the wage-earners in a civil action. For what it may be worth Plisson deposes that\nDrackett never got possession (of the theatre) as far as I can see;\nand Drackett says that when Burdon was demanding possession of the goods from him\nthey were under seizure by both the police and myself.\nOn the foregoing facts I am of the opinion that it has not been shewn that the defendants had possession of the goods when Burdon made his demand on the 29th of September or that they could then have given him actual possession such as the plaintiff claims would have cured the defect in its title under its lien note and that therefore, however mistaken or even wrongful may have been Drackett's refusal to recognize the plaintiff's claim, it cannot be held either that it amounted to a conversion of the goods or that it was the cause of the plaintiff's failing to obtain such possession as it now asserts would have enabled it to defeat the execution under which the sheriff obtained possession.\nSolely on this ground, the appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action in damages by the appellant against the respondent for conversion.\nA man named Findlay was the lessee of a theatre in Moosejaw and Reid, the respondent, was the lessor. The theatre furnishings had been purchased from the appellant by Findlay who had given the latter a lien note.\nOn or previous to the 24th of September, 1917, a police constable, acting under distress warrant issued out of the Police Magistrate's Court, seized and took possession of those furnishings.\nOn the same day, Reid, the lessor, issued a distress warrant to his co-respondent Drackett who went on the premises and apparently seized and took possession of the same chattels. A few days later, the appellant company, the holder of the lien on the goods, asked the respondent, the lessor, to deliver up possession to him of the goods. This was refused and the present action in damages for conversion was instituted.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, when a person detains goods so as to deprive the person entitled to the possession of them of his dominion over them, it is a conversion. Burroughes v. Bayne[5]. But in this case the claim is made by the respondent that as lessor he had the right to seize the interest of Findlay in those chattels. The evidence shows that the goods had been sold to Findlay for $3,450 by the appellant, that a sum of $1,650 cash had been paid and that the lien note had been given for the balance $1,800. By a judicial sale of this equitable interest of Findlay there might be realized a sum sufficient to cover the rent due, about $900.\nAccording to the provisions of the common law a landlord could distrain for arrears of rent upon all goods found upon the premises. By statutory provisions, ch. 51 R.S. Sask., section 4, it was provided that the landlord could not distrain on goods which did not belong to the lessee, though they were found on the premises; but the statute declared that this restriction should not apply to\nthe interest of the tenant in any goods on the premises in the possession of the tenant, under contract for purchase or by which he may or is to become the owner thereof upon performance.\nThere is no doubt that under the provisions of this statute, Reid, as landlord, could seize the interest of his tenant, Findlay, in the chattels in question and have it sold. This is not a case of taking a person's goods wrongfully in execution. Under the statute he could exercise some rights in regard to those goods. If the landlord had the right to seize and sell Findlay's interest in the goods, he could take possession of them to exercise his right of restraint. How could he sell the equitable interest of Findlay without shewing the goods at the judicial sale?\nBesides, in order to make a demand and refusal sufficient evidence of conversion, the party who refuses must, at the time of the demand, have it in his power to deliver up the article demanded in the condition in which the delivery is demanded. Latter v. White[6].\nThe previous seizure had been made by a wage earner and, in execution of a judgment of the Police Magistrate's Court, the fact that a police constable had possession of these same goods by virtue of the writ of execution of this latter court would not have given Reid the absolute right of handing over the chattels to the appellant. Suppose Reid had handed possession as far as he was concerned, that would not have given the possession to the appellant company and prevent it from suffering the damages they claim having suffered. These wage earners had a superior right to the one which the appellant seeks to exercise as it was decided in a former trial.\nFor all these reasons I am of the opinion that the; appellant is not entitled to recover damages from the respondent. His appeal should be dismissed with cost.\nMignault J.\u2014In my opinion, this appeal fails because it has not been shewn that Drackett, Reid's bailiff, had possession of, and could have delivered to the appellant, the goods covered by the latter's hen note when the appellant demanded possession of the same. I do not think it necessary to express any opinion on the question whether, under the Saskatchewan Statute, R.S. Sask. ch. 51, section 4, the respondents could have withheld possession of the goods as against the appellant, in order to distrain and sell the interest of the tenant therein.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Schull & Schull.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Seaborn, Pope & Gregory\n[1] 12 Sask.

In course of time, the respondent obtained foreclosure under the first mortgage and sold the land. The appellant then claimed a discharge of the collateral mortgage.\nHeld that, notwithstanding the foreclosure of the first mortgage and the sale of the foreclosed property, the respondent could still recover under the appellant's covenant for payment contained in the third mortgage and the appellant was not entitled to the discharge of the collateral mortgage until the payment of the third mortgage.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Sask. L.R. 445; [1919] 3 W.W.R. 719) varied. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge[2] and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAug. Lemieux K.C. and V. R. Smith for the appellant.\nC. H. Locke for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant bought, on the 16th April, 1914, property in Kamsack, Saskatchewan, for $60,000, which consideration was made up largely of other properties taken in part exchange\u2014with which we are not concerned.\n$8,150 of the consideration was made up of the balance due on two mortgages, a first for $7,000 and a third for $2,150, made by one Yandt on other property.\nBut to secure the due payment thereof to the extent of $8,150, the appellant was to give a mortgage on the property he was buying from respondent, payable according to or corresponding with the respective due dates of said two mortgages.\nSaid mortgages were duly assigned to respondent and the promised collateral mortgage of 8,150 was duly given. In course of time Yandt made default and respondent took proceedings upon the first of said mortgages for sale and purchase. Said proceedings ended in a final order of foreclosure which vested the property in respondent and had as an incidental, necessary result, according to the system of land titles in force, the barring of the charge upon the land which had been created by the third mortgage.\nThe respondent thereafter sold the property thus vested in him for less than the amount which was found to be due under and by virtue of the said first mortgage.\nAll these proceedings were brought under the notice of appellant and he was expressly given the opportunity of redeeming said mortgage on payment of the sum due and which his collateral mortgage to respondent stood as a guarantee for, but he did nothing either towards making such payment or objecting to the said sale of the property.\nLater on he conceived the happy thought that he was released entirely by virtue of said purchase and sale from all liability in respect of either mortgage and instituted this suit to have it declared that the said first and third mortgages had been fully paid and satisfied, and that the said collateral mortgage he had given to secure the due payment was duly paid and satisfied, and for an order directing the respondent to discharge the latter.\nThe appellant succeeded at the trial by reason of the learned trial judge[3] holding erroneously, as I respectfully submit, that the later sale of the foreclosed property by respondent discharged the mortgagor's covenant.\nThe Court of Appeal[4] set that judgment aside and dismissed the action. I so fully agree with the main reasoning of the learned judges in that court upon which they reach that result, that I need not repeat the same here, or trouble explaining minor differences I entertain as to one or two expressions therein that in no way affect the result reached.\nThe historical development of the equitable doctrines upon which our judgment in the Mutual Life Assurance Co. v. Douglas[5] case was founded, in no way justifies such contentions as relied upon by appellant herein.\nAnd whatever possible difficulties might have arisen upon a like case in England where the doctrine of tacking prevails, or even in Ontario or where by reason of the procedure in the Master's office requiring, and often getting, proof made of subsequent encumbrances there is no room for doubt or difficulty under the system prevailing in Saskatchewan as explained by appellant's counsel and assented to by respondents.\nIn other words under the old system of pursuing the remedy of foreclosure the respondent might have been induced to offer proof not only of the amount due under his first mortgage but also that under his subsequent mortgage and thereby given arguable ground for the contention that he was claiming foreclosure of both mortgages and when he got his final order of foreclosure stood bound by the usual rule relative thereto.\nIt is, however, to be observed that the mortgage under the \"Land Titles Act\" is only a charge on the land and does not vest, as in England and Ontario, any title in the land and that each is independent of the other and dependent upon the terms of said Act. I have examined all the cases cited in the appellant's factum on this branch of the argument, in the hope of finding something analogous to that thus presented, to have been dealt with by the courts either in England or Ontario calling for the application of the principles relied upon, but only to meet with disappointments.\nThe case of Walker v. Jones[6], presents a series of complicated facts which in the ultimate result might have developed such a case as presented herein, or somewhat resembling the same.\nBut all that was involved therein to be decided was the validity of an interim injunction.\nThe court was particularly careful to avoid determining anything involved, or likely to be, in the possible ultimate result.\nThe case of Dyson v. Morris[7], is, so far as it goes, helpful to respondent rather than appellant.\nThe case of Rudge v. Richens[8], effectually disposes of the contention sometimes set up that a party cannot sell part of his security under a power of sale and proceed for the balance, and is also as helpful in principle to respondent as appellant.\nAll the other cases relied upon in this connection are each in the last analysis but the application of the elementary principle that after foreclosure the mortgagor followed upon his covenant or something analogous thereto is entitled to say to the mortgagee, give me back my property and here is your money and default that claim he is no longer liable.\nThe appellant seeks to apply that to a case of two different mortgages never consolidated or used jointly in the foreclosure proceedings and having no connection either with each other or with securing the same debt but in the ultimate result as a necessity of getting a final order conformable with the Lands Titles Act,\" wipes out the charge made by the third mortgage.\nIf the argument is good for anything then on the issue of that order and its registration and without waiting for a sale by the mortgagee, the mortgagor is discharged from liability on his covenant in the later mortgage.\nThat is not the true application of the old well-known principle relied upon, but an extension of it by a metaphysical process of reasoning for which there is no precedent.\nThere are precedents cited by the respondent which shew how little foundation there is for extending the principle in that way.\nSee, especially, the case of Worthington v. Abbott[9].\nThe statute in Alberta which was in question in the Douglas. Case[10] preserved, by the use of the word \"foreclosure,\" much of the law incidental thereto, when used in the way it is therein.\nAnd in the mortgage therein in question the parties specifically contracted for observance of Ontario law so far as possible.\nAt the close of the argument herein I had the impression that possibly the appellant was entitled to relief to the extent of such effect as might be given to the ordinary application of the principles of foreclosure in respect of that part of the indebtedness covered by the first mortgage. An examination of the pleadings and facts including the nature of the transactions upon which the collateral mortgage was founded, renders that impossible.\nNo such case is made by the appellant's pleading.\nAnd without presuming to express any definite opinion I would suggest that the equitable doctrine that \"he who seeks equity in a court of equity must do equity,\" might be found a rather formidable obstacle in appellant's way for even such measure of relief.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with Anglin J.\nAnglin J.\u2014I was at first inclined to the view that, inasmuch as the defendant had by his own acts in foreclosing the first mortgage and subsequently selling the Redvers Hotel property put it out of his power, on payment of the third mortgage, to reconvey that property to the mortgagor, subject to the first and second mortgages, he had relinquished his right to recover on the mortgagor's covenant in the third mortgage and that that mortgage as well as the first should therefore be deemed satisfied and paid for the purpose of entitling the mortgagor to the discharge of the collateral mortgage on the Kamsack Hotel, which he claims. But on further consideration I think that position cannot be maintained.\nAs Mr. Locke pointed out in his admirable argument after the foreclosure of the first mortgage all that the mortgagor could claim on payment of the amount of the third mortgage would have been a release of his covenant in that mortgage. By the foreclosure brought about by the mortgagor's own default any equitable interest of the respondent as third mortgagee as well as the mortgagor's own interest in the land had been foreclosed. There was nothing left to a reconveyance of which the mortgagor would be entitled on payment of the amount of the third mortgage. But that foreclosure did not extinguish the mortgagor's liability on his covenant in the third mortgage any more than it did his liability on his covenant in the first mortgage. It was the subsequent sale that prevented the mortgagee from reconveying the mortgaged property to the mortgagor on payment of the amount due on the first mortgage and thus precluded recovery on the covenant in that mortgage. If it did not actually extinguish the debt, that was practically the result. But it was not the sale that prevented the mortgagor from obtaining anything which, but for it, he might have required the mortgagee to transfer to him on payment of the third mortgage. Any right he had to a reconveyance had already been effectually barred by the foreclosure of the first mortgage.\nThe theory on which an action by the mortgagee on the covenant is restrained after foreclosure and sale under the mortgage in which the covenant is contained proceeds is therefore not applicable. That theory I had occasion to consider fully in the recent case of Sayre v. The Securities Trust Co.[11]. The distinction between the effect of foreclosure of the first mortgage followed by sale on the mortgagor's liability on his covenant in that mortgage and its effect on his liability on the covenant in the third mortgage is no doubt subtle yet I think it is substantial. The mortgagor's position under the third mortgage was of course affected by the foreclosure. But it was not the foreclosure which had the practical effect of extinguishing his liability on the covenant under the first mortgage. It was the subsequent sale; and that, as already pointed out, had no effect whatever on the mortgagor's rights or position under the third mortgage.\nMoreover, the proviso for redemption of the Kamsack Hotel is that the mortgagor is to be entitled to a discharge of it on payment of the two mortgages on the Redvers Hotel to which it is collateral. Whatever may be said as to the debt under the first mortgage by reason of the plaintiff having taken the property in satisfaction thereof, there is no ground for maintaining that the third mortgage has been paid.\nHowever, I incline to the view that, having foreclosed the first mortgage on the Redvers Hotel and sold that property thereunder, the mortgagee took it in satisfaction of the entire debt due on that mortgage, that the amount thereof must therefore be deemed to have been fully paid and satisfied and that the mortgagor is entitled on the accounting with the mortgagee to credit for that amount and not merely for what was realized by the mortgagee on the sale. On the third mortgage covenant, however, the mortgagee is still entitled to recover the sum actually due and owing in respect of the debt by it secured and on payment of that amount the plaintiff will be entitled to a discharge of the Kamsack Hotel property from the collateral second mortgage upon it.\nIn lieu of a judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action, therefore, judgment should in my opinion be entered declaring that, on payment to the defendant of the amount due under the third mortgage on the Redvers Hotel property, the mortgage held by him on the Kamsack Hotel property will be satisfied and the plaintiff will be entitled to a discharge of it. Brodeur J.\u2014I would agree with the Court of Appeal[12] that the foreclosure proceedings on a first mortgage would not prevent the mortgagee, if he is the creditor of a third mortgage, from claiming on the covenant on this third mortgage if even he has bought the property on those foreclosure proceedings and has since disposed of it.\nBut at the same time there is no doubt that if the appellant could not succeed with regard to the third mortgage his indebtedness has disappeared as far as the first mortgage is concerned and he should succeed to the extent of the latter. This point, however, does not seem to have been strongly pressed in the courts below, though it has been mentioned.\nThe action should not be dismissed in toto but a judgment should be entered declaring that on payment of the third mortgage the plaintiff will be entitled to a discharge of the mortgage held by the defendant on the Redvers Hotel property.\nThere should be no costs on this appeal.\nMignault J.\u2014By the agreement of sale of certain hotel premises between the respondent (vendor) and the appellant (purchaser), what was termed a collateral mortgage on the hotel property was given by the appellant to the respondent, it being stipulated that this mortgage should be discharged when a first and third mortgage on another hotel property for $7,000 and $2,150 respectively, due to the appellant by one Yandt, and transferred by him to the respondent in part payment of the price, should be fully paid by Yandt. Yandt not having paid either mortgage, the respondent took foreclosure proceedings against him on the first mortgage after having vainly tried to bring the property to sale under a power of sale, and obtained a final order of foreclosure, subsequent to which he sold the property for $4,000.\nThe appellant now claims that he is entitled to a discharge of the collateral mortgage under the above mentioned stipulation of the agreement of sale.\nThe first objection to the appellant's contention is that Yandt has not fully paid the first and third mortgages due by him to the appellant and by the latter transferred to the respondent, and therefore the appellant is not entitled to a discharge of the collateral mortgage.\nThe second objection is that granting that the respondent could not sue Yandt on the covenant in the first mortgage without offering to reconvey him the mortgaged property, which he is not in position to do, his inability to reconvey does not stand in his way should he sue on the personal covenant contained in the third mortgage, for Yandt having lost his whole equitable right in the property by the final order of foreclosure on the first mortgage, cannot demand reconveyance as a condition of an action on the covenant in the third mortgage.\nI therefore think the appeal fails, and for the reasons fully stated by my brother Anglin I agree in his disposal of the matter.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPhee, Smith & O'Regan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Patrick, Doherty, Killam & Walton.\n[1] 12 Sask.

H. Bell K.C. for the appellant.\nA. W. Jones for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent, complaining of a nuisance created by the appellants inducing such an assemblage of persons on the sidewalk in front of its theatre and extending to the entrance of the respondent's adjoining grocery, applied for an injunction, and that application was by consent conducted without formal pleadings. After a trial lasting two days Mr. Justice Drysdale dismissed the application and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversed said judgment of dismissal and made instead thereof the following order:\u2014\nAnd it is further ordered that the defendant, Strand Theatre Company, Limited, its managers, servants and agents be and they are hereby restrained from unlawfully obstructing the free access to and egress from the premises of the plaintiff, Cahill & Company, at the southeast corner of the intersection of Sackville and Argyle streets in the city of Halifax by the collection of crowds of people or otherwise.\nFrom that, by leave of said court, the said defendant appeals to this court.\nThere appears herein some evidence which, within the doctrine relied upon in the case of Lyons v. Gulliver[2], might have justified a judgment for damages if that form of relief had been sought or an injunction restraining the repetition of the offences disclosed in the evidence I refer to.\nThe above quoted order being confined to the restraining feature \"unlawfully obstructing the free access to and egress from the premises of the plaintiff,\" &c., can result in nothing more than the trial of a specific complaint founded upon facts disclosing such an unlawful obstruction hereafter, and the payment of the costs as awarded.\nIn other words there seems to me nothing in fact or law involved in this appeal but a mere question of costs.\nThe uniform jurisprudence of this court has rightly been to refuse to interfere with a mere question of costs.\nWhat then is left for us to consider? If there occur any future like offences they must be decided upon the facts according to the relevant law applicable thereto. I am sorry to hear counsel suggest that the proof in such cases must depend solely upon that furnished by affidavits in support or denial of the allegations of any such offence, and that there can be no cross-examination.\nSuch a feature in the administration of justice I suspect must, if so, be confined to Nova Scotia, for elsewhere rules of practice generally provide for cross-examination of parties making affidavits.\nThat, of course, is not always so satisfactory as the cross-examination in an open trial, but if its operation does not exist in Nova Scotia I imagine some means can be devised by the courts there for overcoming such an unsatisfactory condition of affairs.\nI think that must be entrusted to the local courts.\nIf there had been pleadings, or the court had seen fit to permit of amendment to substitute them for the procedure adopted so as to allow a judgment for damages by way of remedying the undoubted wrong that has occasionally been suffered, coupled with costs of suit, it would, to my mind, have more appropriately met the necessities of the case than such an injunction as framed.\nOn the other hand I cannot say that there was no evidence of a cause of action and, as a result, hold the appellant at liberty to pursue a like course of conduct as it undoubtedly did.\nLawlessness is not to be encouraged by giving a license to repeat such offences as were committed.\nA little vigorous effort on the part of the local authorities, if invoked by appellant, should produce the result desired.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The form of the order may be open to objection, Parker v. First Ave. Hotel Co.[3], but the point was not clearly taken and the Court has full control on its own order. I think the appellant has not made out a case for interference.\nAnglin J.\u2014After considering all the evidence I find myself unable to say that the careful appreciation of it in Mr. Justice Mellish's judgment is not correct. It discloses, in my opinion, an unjustifiable interference (for which the defendants are clearly responsible) with the plaintiffs' undoubted right to the full enjoyment of their property. The defendants must find some means of putting a stop to the obstruction complained of, even if to do so should necessitate the incurring of additional expense or some curtailment of the profitable use to which they are now putting their own property. Lyons v. Gulliver[4]. Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas is an elementary principle in point. The evidence shews that the unlawful obstruction continued between the date of the writ and that of the trial.\nHad objection been clearly taken to the form of the order of injunction I am not entirely satisfied that it should not have been modified. An injunction against\nunlawfully obstructing free access to and egress from the plaintiffs' premises by the collection of crowds of people or otherwise\nis open to the objection that it merely expresses, and in terms no more precise, a general obligation which the law imposes. It leaves undecided and open for discussion on a motion to punish for breach of it what is prohibited. Cother v. Midland Ry. Co.[5]; Attorney General v. Staffordshire Co. Coun.[6]; Parker v. First Avenue Hotel Co.3. On the other hand, however, it may be that the view of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was that adequate protection could not be afforded to the plaintiffs by an order couched in less comprehensive terms. Elliott v. North Eastern Ry. Co.[7]. Vere v. Minter[8]. Moreover the defendants' contention has been that no injunction whatever should have been granted rather than that an order more definite and precise should have been made.\nOn the whole the appellants have, in my opinion, failed to make out a case for interference with the order against which they appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014It has been suggested that the control of crowds in a highway was a matter for police regulation and that the owner of a theatre was not responsible because persons collected before the hour at which it opened, formed a queue on the sidewalk and obstructed the access to the adjacent premises. But the Court of Appeal in England decided this question adversely to that suggestion and declared that if the natural and probable result of what a person is doing will be the collection of a crowd which will obstruct the highway, then the obstruction is an actionable nuisance and this person could be restrained. Lyons Sons v. Gulliver[9].\nIt does not seem that a theatre queue under all circumstances and in all conditions is an actionable nuisance. There must be some unreasonable use or obstruction of the highway so as to prevent the access to and egress from the neighbouring premises and that obstruction must be calculated to deter customers, to some extent, from resorting to those adjacent premises. Each case, however; should be governed by its own facts and an injunction should be issued only in circumstances which would amount to a nuisance.\nThe owner of the theater in the present case is alive to these exigencies of the law and claims that he had been doing everything in his power to minimize inconvenience to the plaintiff, his neighbour, and is willing to incur all necessary expenses arising out of a larger police force to control the crowd.\nThe evidence, however, shews that the plaintiffs' premises have been unduly obstructed and customers desiring to enter his premises unduly interfered with. The evidence given by the police authorities is generally favourable to the owner of the theatre; but there were facts and circumstances established by evidence, which was not contradicted, which shewed undue interference. I am inclined to think that the police protection was not sufficient; and as the appellant has assumed the onus of seeking and even paying for that police protection, he has then incurred liability. On the whole I agree with the judgment a quo.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The law governing a case of this description has been authoritively stated by the English Court of Appeal in Lyons, Sons & Co. v. Gulliver[10], also the case of queues formed by the patrons of a theatre waiting for admission, and obstructing the entrance to a neighbouring business establishment. The English case, however, differs from the present one in that, in the former, damages only, and not an injunction, were granted, in view of the undertaking given by the defendants to open their doors an hour before the performance, and it further differs in that the trial judge there found on the facts in favour of the plaintiffs, whereas here Mr. Justice Drysdale the trial judge said:\u2014\nI find these queues have been formed and kept, that is reasonably kept, on the outer side of the sidewalk with ample space for people to pass up and down the sidewalk between the queues and the buildings, for a long period before action. I find that plaintiff's shop has not been obstructed or customers desiring to enter interfered with; in short, so far as the entrance to plaintiff's shop is concerned, the plaintiff company has no reasonable cause of complaint. Plaintiff Cahill in describing conditions is somewhat in conflict with the testimony of the police. His statements are, however, I think, exaggerated and this perhaps owing more to his state of feelings than an intention to exaggerate, as conditions that now exist and for a long time previous have existed. I accept the testimony of the police. These men are truthful and I believe them and I do not think the Defendant Company had been so using its property as to interfere with plaintiff's business but reasonably and in a way as of right they might\u2026\nThis finding is my only difficulty, for my reading of the evidence would lead me to agree with Mr. Justice Mellish, and were the conditions described in the evidence to continue, I cannot doubt that the respondents would be greatly prejudiced thereby. I think, however, that the way the appellant carries on its business inevitably leads to the gathering of crowds in front of the theatre and of the neighbouring properties. It gives one performance in the afternoon and two in the evening. The greater crowds gather for the second evening performance, and the doors of the theatre are closed about 8.20 p.m., when the lobby is usually filled, and the practice being not to let the second audience in before the first has left the theatre by the side exits, the doors are opened only about 8.40 or 8.50 p.m., so that, during from twenty to thirty minutes at least, a crowd naturally gathers. At first this crowd obstructed the street, but the city police formed them into queues on the sidewalk, on one side those who already had tickets, and on the other those who had not secured them. That the queue thus formed in front of the respondent's premises obstructed the entrance thereto cannot be doubted on any reading of the evidence. It is true that the appellant carries on a legitimate business, but that is no excuse for the annoyance caused to the respondents and the interference with the free and unobstructed access to their place of business. The appellant, if it chooses to give two performances each evening, and to let one audience out before it admits the other, must not so use its right as to interfere with the equal rights of the respondents to carry on their business without any interference; sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas.\nThe form of injunction granted by the court below is not free from objection, for it states that the appellant must not unlawfully obstruct the free access to and egress from the premises of the respondents, and thus in effect orders the appellant not to violate the law, but the appellant's case is really that no injunction at all should have been granted. It is indeed very questionable whether such an injunction is in any way prejudical to the appellant, for the latter certainly cannot claim the right to unlawfully obstruct the respondent's premise; and if any one has an interest in having the injunction made more precise it is rather the respondents, for in any case where it is claimed that the injunction has been disobeyed the issue will be, as it was in this case, whether the appellant has unlawfully obstructed the free access to and egress from the respondents' premises. On the whole, I do not feel disposed to interfere with the judgment of the Supreme Court en banc and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

S. (1919) c. 37, s. 62b. An order by which a mortgagee becomes the owner of the mortgaged land as purchaser at a named price with leave to issue execution for the balance of his claim, is not an order for foreclosure operating as satisfaction of the debt under section 62 b. of \"The Land Titles Act\" as amended by chapter 37 of the Alberta Statutes, 1919.\nPer Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington and Brodeur JJ. (affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division).\u2014Though the order should have been set aside and a proceeding de novo directed, the decision of the Appellate Division that, notwithstanding the terms of the order, the mortgagee may still pursue his remedy for the balance of his claim should not be disturbed, the question involved being one of practice and procedure.\nPer Duff Anglin and Mignault JJ. (reversing said judgment) \u2014The order should be set aside as the doctrines of equity in regard to mortgages preclude the making of an order which purports uno flatu to vest the mortgaged property in the mortgagee as purchaser free from all equity of redemption and to enforce the personal liability of the mortgagor for some part of the mortgage debt. A mortgagee cannot have both the mortgaged property and the mortgage money.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The sale sanctioned by the order was not a sale of the land within the meaning of s.s. 2 of s. 62 of \"The Land Titles Act\" and the mortgagee is therefore prohibited by that section from issuing execution under his judgment on the covenant.\u2014The sale contemplated by the statute is a sale to a stranger, not to the mortgagee.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 17; [1919] 3 W.W. R. 634) affirmed on equal division of the court. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of Stuart J. at the trial[2] and dismissing an appeal by the appellants from an order of the master in chambers at Calgary.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the appellants.\nH. P. O. Savary K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons given by Chief Justice Harvey, of the Appellate Division of Alberta, in delivering the judgment of that court now in appeal in this action, and also for the reasons stated by my brother Idington, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nPersonally I should have preferred that the master's order in question herein should have been set aside altogether and a proceeding de novo directed. But, as I think the ends of justice can be fully worked out between the parties under the order as construed by the Appellate Division and the disposition they have made of the action, with which construction and disposition I am quite satisfied, I will not press this view, more especially as it relates largely to a matter of procedure and practice.\nAs to the limitation of time of two weeks, stated in the Chief Justice's reasons, within which the defendants might file a demand for an offer of the land for sale by tender, that limitation must, of course, be construed as running from the day of the judgment of this court and, I think, under the circumstances, might well be extended to four weeks.\nAs this court is equally divided in opinion as to allowing or dismissing the appeal, there will be no costs here.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The master's order in question herein cannot, in my opinion, be treated as an order of foreclosure.\nIt is, by its terms, though very inaptly using the word \"foreclosure\", clearly intended to be a vesting order carrying out the sale to the mortgagee, in like manner as if to a stranger, and permitting thereupon the mortgagee to proceed upon the covenant to realize the balance due after confirmation of said sale.\nWho has ever seen a foreclosure decree so framed? I venture to think that no one can produce such a precedent in a foreclosure proceeding.\nThe mortgagee has always had the right in such proceedings to abandon his foreclosure and proceed upon the covenant if ready and able to return to the mortgagor his property upon payment of the amount due.\nHence the legislation of the Alberta legislature of 1919, section 4 of chapter 37, must, by the express language using the word \"foreclosure\" be confined to the plain ordinary meaning that is well understood by those conversant with it as a legal term.\nI am sorry if any one has been misled by reference to a dictionary instead of the masters of the English law on whom I relied, and cited in the case of Mutual Life Assurance Company v. Douglas[3]. The amending statute I cite clearly obliterates that option of a mortgagee after a final order of foreclosure and possibly effects a needed reform in our law.\nBut the legislature does not touch, or pretend to touch, the undoubted power of the court, according to long standing jurisprudence, well expressed by that eminent judge, Lord Hatherly, in the case of Tennant v. Trenchard[4], to sanction a sale to a trustee which a mortgagee is in conducting a sale under a mortgage. Hence the exercise of that power in question herein, cannot properly be held to have been interfered with by the enactment above referred to. Such a sale, as made in the due exercise of such power cannot mean a foreclosure.\nThe things covered by the term \"foreclosure\" extending over the whole, and a sale possibly only of a part, are entirely different.\nIf the legislature intended to destroy the power of a court to sell to the mortgagee for part of the debt the land mortgagee, it should have said so.\nI am not concerned in that regard as to what is done.\nThere may be good reasons for its doing so. Indeed conceivably good reasons therefor might exist in one country and yet doing so be imprudent in another.\nI am unable, for the foregoing reasons, to maintain a reversal of the judgment appealed from.\nI should have preferred, partly in accord with Mr. Justice McCarthy's opinion, to have seen the whole order set aside and a proceeding de novo directed, within the undoubted rights of the court, to sell to a mortgagee. But for us to interfere therewith would savour too much of dictating in mere matters of procedure.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The question presented by this appeal is whether, in proceedings instituted to enforce a mortgage of property in that province, the law of Alberta enables its courts to order the sale of the mortgaged land to the mortgagee as absolute and irredeemable purchaser for a price less than the amount of his claim and at the same time that he be at liberty to issue an execution against the mortgagor for the amount by which the mortgage debt exceeds such purchase price. Such an order was made by the master in chambers in this action on the 28th of May, 1919.\nThe circumstances out of which the question above stated arises are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart[5], holding, on appeal from the master, that such an order cannot be made; that the master's order was a foreclosure within s. 62b of the \"Land Titles Act\" (enacted by c. 37 of the statutes of 1919); that the mortgage debt was thereby extinguished; and that the provision of the order permitting the, issue of execution must therefore be set aside and vacated\u2014with the result that the mortgagee would retain the property but his mortgage debt would be wholly extinguished. This judgment was reversed in the Appellate Division (Harvey C.J. and Simmons J.\u2014McCarthy J. dissenting)[6], and the master's order was restored, but with a provision for the taking of tenders for the purchase of the property and confirming the sale to the mortgagee if no higher tender than the price at which he was allowed to purchase under the master's order should be received and directing that, if a higher tender should be received and accepted and payment made in accordance therewith, the mortgagee should transfer the land to the person making such tender and should give credit for the amount thereof on his mortgage claim.\nWe are informed by Mr. Justice Stuart that the practice followed by the master has grown up and \"been in vogue for some time\" as the result of an amendment to s. 62 of \"The Land Titles Act,\" made in 1916 (c. 3, s. 15 (4) ), adding thereto the following as s.s. 2:\u2014\n(2) Where any action or proceeding has before the date of the passing of this subsection been taken or shall thereafter be taken in any court either under the provisions of this section or to enforce the observance of the covenants, agreements, stipulations or conditions contained in any agreement for the sale of any land, and personal judgment has been or shall be obtained therein, no execution shall issue thereon until sale of the land mortgaged or encumbered or agreed to be sold has been had or foreclosure ordered and levy shall then be made only for the amount of the judgment or mortgage debt remaining unsatisfied with costs.\nIt is not surprising that such a statutory provision should have led to some anomalies in practice. Just what is meant by\nthe amount of the judgment or mortgage debt remaining unsatisfied.\nafter foreclosure has been ordered it is a little difficult for the legal mind to appreciate. Sec. 62 was repealed in 1919 (c. 37, s. 1) and the following substituted:\u2014\n62. Proceedings for recovery of money secured by a mortgage or encumbrance, or to enforce any provision thereof, or sale, redemption or foreclosure proceedings with respect to mortgaged or encumbered land may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the existing practice and procedure thereof.\n(2) No execution to enforce a judgment upon the personal covenant contained in a mortgage encumbrance or agreement of sale on or of land or on any security therefor shall issue or be proceeded with until sale of land, and levy shall then only be made for the amount of the said moneys remaining unpaid after the due application of the purchase moneys received at the said sale. * * * The following section was also added (by sec. 4) as s. 62b:\u2014\n62b. The effect of an order for foreclosure of a mortgage or encumbrance heretofore or hereafter made by any court or judge or by any registrar shall be to vest the title of the land affected thereby in the mortgagee or encumbrancee free from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the owner, mortgagor or encumbrancer or any person claiming through or under him subsequently to the mortgage or encumbrance, and shall from and after the date of the passing of this section operate as full satisfaction of the debt secured by such mortgage or encumbrance.\nSuch mortgagee or encumbrancee shall be deemed a transferee of the land and become the owner thereof and be entitled to receive a certificate of title for the same.\nobviously, as Harvey G. J. points out, to meet the decision of this court in Mutual Life Assur. Co. v. Douglas[7].\nThese amendments became effective on the 17th of May, 1919, eleven days before the order of the master in chambers, which is attacked, was made.\nIt is of the essence of a completed foreclosure that the mortgagee cannot thereafter proceed to enforce the mortgagor's personal liability for the mortgage debt without opening the foreclosure, but that, so long as he is in a position to reconvey the mortgaged property on payment of his claim he may so proceed, thereby, however, automatically opening the foreclosure and affording the mortgagee an opportunity to redeem as of right; and courts of equity have maintained jurisdiction to grant the mortgagor a corresponding right, where special circumstances warrant such a course, on terms which would protect the mortgagee. \"Foreclosure\" under the Alberta \"Land Titles Act\" was subject to these incidents prior to 1919. Mutual Life Assur. Co. v. Douglas7. Under the amendment of that year, however, they are done away with and \"foreclosure\" in Alberta now completely extinguishes the mortgage debt and all rights of the mortgagor in the pledge. The order of the master in chambers in this case, on the contrary; purports in express terms to keep alive and enforce recovery of the greater part of the mortgage debt and at the same time to vest the mortgaged property in the mortgagee as absolute owner in satisfaction not of his entire claim but of less than one-third of it. I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Alberta and Mr. Justice Simmons that such an order was not, and was not intended to operate as, a \"foreclosure\" as that term must now be understood in Alberta and that it therefore did not operate to extinguish the personal liability of the mortgagor. Neither was it meant to have effect as a foreclosure as understood in English equity jurisprudence. Moreover; if the provision of the order directing a sale to the mortgagee as an irredeemable purchaser ait $6,500, and that directing the issue of execution for the balance of the mortgage debt are so incompatible one with the other that both cannot stand, the proper course to rectify the error committed in making such an order is, with respect, not to strike out one of its provisions and allow the other to stand. Inasmuch as the order approving of the sale to the mortgagee at the price fixed was sought and accepted only on the footing that it should contain the additional provision far the recovery of the balance of the mortgage debt and the master never intended to make an order in any other terms or on any other condition\u2014never intended that the mortgagee's claim should be extinguished except as to the $6,500 for which he had offered to take the land in satisfaction\u2014the order should be vacated as a whole unless it can be sustained as a whole. The mortgagor cannot insist on that part of it standing which suits his purposes minus the accompanying provision without which it was neither sought nor granted and would not have been taken. Grand Trunk Pacific Ely. v. Fort William Property Owners[8]. If not entitled to maintain the order as it stands the respondent asks that it should be set aside in toto and to that relief it is entitled.\nBut is the order as made sustainable? There are ho doubt authorities for the proposition that the court will under special circumstances sanction the mortgagee becoming the purchaser of the mortgaged premises at a court sale. In addition to Tennant v. Trenchard[9], and Hutton v. Justin[10], cited by the respondent, reference may be had to The Wilsons[11], and Ex parte Marsh[12], cited in Fisher on Mortgages (Can. ed. 1910) par No, 2020. When the mortgagee is allowed to bid the conduct of the sale is usually transferred to some other interested party. Domville v. Berrington[13]. Gowland v. Garbutt[14], cited by Mr. Clark, is also an instance where this was done. But in Ireland a contrary course has sometimes been taken and the mortgagee allowed to bid, though retaining the conduct of the sale, where the property was clearly insufficient to pay the debt. Steele v. Devonport[15]; Spaight v. Patterson[16]. These cases may be readily understood when it is borne in mind that foreclosure is the primary remedy which the law gives to the mortgagee, the right to a sale being statutory and the conduct of the sale discretionary. Hewitt v. Nanson[17]. Where a sale is ordered and the mortgagor is not financially good for any possible deficiency it is only reasonable to permit the mortgagee to protect himself as far as possible by giving him leave to bid at the sale, and, if necessary, to become a purchaser. But no case is reported, so far as I have been able to discover, where a mortgagee has been allowed to acquire an absolute title to the land as a purchaser and thereafter to maintain an action on the personal covenant of his mortgagor for the amount by which his mortgage claim exceeded the price at which he purchased. A passage in the judgment of Moss J. A., in Hutton v. Justin[18], may, however, be referred to.\nWhile the mortgagor's covenant for payment of the mortgage debt may be absolute at law, in equity the right to enforce it is subject to the condition that the mortgagee shall not be disabled through any act of his own (Ashburner on Mortgages (2 ed.) 683) not authorized by the mortgagor from restoring the estate. Palmer v. Hendrie[19]; Kinnaird v. Trollops[20]. A mortgagee asserting absolute ownership of the mortgaged property cannot sue on the mortgagor's covenant. In equity, speaking generally, the rights of payment and redemption are reciprocal.\nEven where the mortgagee claims to have acquired, in his character as such, absolute ownership of the property under a title paramount, he cannot enforce the mortgagor's covenant except on the terms that he should submit to redemption. An excellent illustration of this proposition is afforded by Parkinson v. Higgins[21], where it was held on demurrer that a mortgagee, who had purchased at a court sale, which would have conferred on a stranger so purchasing a paramount and absolute title,\ncould not sue for the mortgage money while asserting his right to the property mortgaged wholly independent of any title derived from the mortgagor and without any right to redeem,\nand Parkinson v. Higgins[22], where the same mortgagee on pleading by way of equitable replication that he had acquired title to the property solely to protect his interests and that he had offered and was always willing to submit to redemption on payment of the mortgage moneys and the sum he had been obliged to expend to save the property from sale to a stranger, who would acquire paramount title, was held entitled to maintain his action on the mortgagor's covenant.\nIn my opinion the doctrines of equity in regard to mortgages preclude the making of an order which purports uno flatu to vest the mortgaged property in the mortgagee as purchaser free from all equity of redemption and to enforce the personal liability of the mortgagor for some part of the mortgage debt. A mortgagee cannot have both the mortgaged property and the mortgage money.\nI find nothing in the Alberta statutory law which warrants ascribing to the legislature the intention of making such a substantial further inroad upon the system of mortgage law which has grown up under the fostering care of the chancery courts, as the order of the master in chambers implies. Moreover, that order seems to involve an evasion of s.s. 2 of s. 62 and probably also of s. 62 (b) of the Land Titles Act. For relief from whatever hardship is entailed by the undoubted deprivation of their contractual rights effected by the former subsection mortgagees must look to the legislature, not to the courts.\nThe appeal in my opinion should also succeed on the ground that there has not been \"a sale\" of the land within the meaning of s.s. 2 of s. 62 of the \"Land Titles Act\" and that the mortgagee is therefore prohibited by that subsection from issuing execution under his judgment on the covenant. Sale in English law generally imports an exchange of some article of property for money. J. & P. Coats Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[23]; Benjamin on Sale, 5 ed., pp. 2, 3. Here the transaction is not of that character. It is an exchange or barter of the mortgaged property for the release or extinguishment by the mortgagee of a portion of the debt owed him by the mortgagor That in my opinion is not a sale within the meaning of that word as used in s.s. 2 of s. 62. It is there used in its general meaning in English law. Moreover, I am satisfied that the sale contemplated by the statute is a sale to a stranger not to the mortgagee.\nFor these reasons I would allow this appeal and set aside the order of the master in chambers. The land titles register must be rectified so as to restore the title to the position in which it stood before the master's order was made, and the certificate of title issued to the respondent mortgagee must be delivered up to the registrar and cancelled.\nThe respondents were obliged to appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Stuart which cut off all remedy on the mortgagor's covenant. They may well therefore be entitled to add all their costs down to and exclusive of the judgment of the Appellate Division to the mortgage debt. But I think the appellant, in view of the respondent's denial of his right to redeem (Kinnaird v. Trollope)[24]; Hall v. Heward[25], is entitled to his costs of the appeal to this court which he was obliged to bring in order to have the order of the master in chambers, upheld by the Appellate Division, set aside. These latter costs should be set off against and deducted from the mortgage debt.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question involved in this appeal is largely a question of practice and procedure in a mortgage action. Mr. Justice Stuart, whose judgment the appellants seek to restore, declares himself that the practice which was followed by the master has been in vogue for some time in order to work out in some form the results which should follow upon the moratorium act of 1916 and that practice seemed to have been approved tacitly, if not formally, by judicial authority. Some questions of principle might incidentally be raised for the solution of this question of procedure or practice.\nAlthough we have an appellate jurisdiction, this court does not exercise it in matters relating to the practice and procedure of the courts below, except under special circumstances.\nThere is nothing which has been disclosed in this case which would justify us, in my mind, in interfering with the judgment appealed from. I am satisfied that under the order as framed by the Appellate Division the rights of the mortgagor will be duly safeguarded.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014The facts of this case are fully explained in the judgments of the courts below, and need not be repeated here. The question chiefly discussed in these judgments was whether the master's order was such an order for foreclosure as would, under the amendment to \"The Land Titles Act,\" assented to on the 17th April, 1919, and which became operative a month later (Alberta Statutes, 1919, ch. 37, sect. 4), deprive the respondent of its right to recover the balance of its claim, after deducting the sum for which the mortgaged property was sold to the respondent.\nThe material portion of the master's order, granted by him after hearing all the parties, and after proof by affidavit that the value of the mortgaged property did not exceed $6,500, is as follows:\nIt is ordered that the sale of the lands and premises mentioned in the Statements of Claim in the above actions to the plaintiffs for the price or sum of $6,500.00 be and the same is hereby approved and confirmed:\nIt is further ordered that the payment into court by the plaintiffs of the said sum of $6,500.00, the purchase price of the said lands, be and the same is hereby dispensed with:\nIt is further ordered that the above named defendants, and each of them, and all those claiming by, through or under the said defendants or either of them, do hereby stand absolutely and irrevocably barred and foreclosed of and from all right, title or equity of redemption in and to the said mortgaged lands in the pleadings mentioned, and hereinafter more particularly set forth:\nAnd it is further ordered that the said lands and premises, being: Lots Twenty-four (24) and Twenty-five (25) in Block Fifty-six (56) according to a plan of part of the City of Calgary of record in the Land Titles Office for the South Alberta Land Registration District as Plan \"A,\" Calgary, be vested in the plaintiffs The Security Trust Company, Limited, of the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, and William Murray Connacher, of the City of Calgary, aforesaid, for an estate in fee simple, subject to the reservations contained in the existing Certificate of Title, and that the Registrar of Land Titles for the South Alberta Land Registration District do upon production of this order or a certified copy hereof cancel the existing Certificate of Title and issue a new Certificate of Title in the name of the said The Security Trust Company, Limited, and William Murray Connacher, free and clear of all encumbrances subsequent to and inclusive of the plaintiff's mortgage sued on herein; And it appearing and having been proved from said affidavits filed that there is due and owing to the plaintiffs on account of the mortgage which forms the subject matter of the above actions the sum of $20,564.31, which amount exceeds the sum of $6,500, the amount for which the said lands have been purchased by the plaintiff, by the sum of $14,064.31.\nIt is further ordered that the plaintiffs have leave and liberty is hereby given to the plaintiffs to issue execution against the defendants for the said sum of $14,064.31, being the balance of their claim, and that judgment be entered accordingly for the said sum of $14,064.31 with interest and costs.\nThe amendment of 1919 referred to in the judgments below is in the following terms:\n62. Proceedings for recovery of money secured by a mortgage or encumbrance, or to enforce any provision thereof, or sale, redemption or foreclosure proceedings with respect to mortgaged or encumbered land may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance, with the existing practice and procedure thereof.\n(2) No execution to enforce a judgment upon the personal covenant contained in a mortgage, encumbrance or agreement of sale on or of land or on any security therefor shall issue or be proceeded with until sale of land, and levy shall then only be made for the amount of the said moneys remaining unpaid after the due application of the purchase moneys received at the said sale.\n* * * * * * * *\n62b. The effect of an order for foreclosure of a mortgage or encumbrance heretofore or hereafter made by any court or judge or by any registrar shall be to vest the title of the land affected thereby in the mortgagee or encumbrancee free from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the owner, mortgagor or encumbrancer or any person claiming through or under him subsequently to the mortgage or encumbrance, and shall from and after the date of the passing of this section operate as full satisfaction of the debt secured by such mortgage or encumbrance. Such mortgagee or encumbrancee shall be deemed a transferee of the land and become the owner thereof and be entitled to receive a certificate of title for the same.\nI cannot look on the master's order in this case as being purely and simply \"an order for foreclosure.\" It is much more than that. It provides for the sale of the mortgaged property to the respondent for $6,500.00, dispenses the respondent from paying the purchase price into court, for its mortgage debt exceeded $20,000.00, forecloses the appellant of all right, title or equity of redemption in and to the mortgaged lands, and gives leave to the respondent to issue execution against the appellant for the balance of its claim. The learned trial judge ordered that the part of the master's order permitting execution to issue be struck out and replaced by an order preventing execution. He thus applied section 62b to the order, as if this order had been an order for foreclosure pure and simple, with the effect that the respondent, which never intended to take the property in satisfaction of its claim, is now held to have done so.\nWith all possible deference, I cannot think that the learned trial judge should have disregarded, nay more, have struck out the provisions of the master's order which prevented it from being an order for foreclosure pure and simple, to which section 62b would apply.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Alberta shews what the purpose of, the amendment was. The Legislature was moved to adopt it by reason of the decision of this court in Mutual Life Assurance Co. v. Douglas [26] The Appellate Division of Alberta had held that a mortgagee who took a final order of foreclosure, lost his rights on the covenant and that the debt was extinguished. This court, on the contrary, decided that the mortgagee could sue on the covenant, notwithstanding the foreclosure, provided he was in position to reconvey the mortgaged property. The learned Chief Justice of Alberta says:\nIt seems abundantly clear that it was intended to declare the law for this Province to be henceforth what the Provincial Court had held it to be, and what the Supreme Court of Canada declared it was not.\nI certainly cannot say that the learned Chief Justice hate wrongly stated the intention of the 1919 amendment. But, on the construction of the amendment itself, my opinion is that it would, to say the least, be a misdescription to call the master's order, with its provisions for a sale to the respondent and for the latter's right to issue execution for the balance of its claim, a final order for foreclosure within the meaning of section 62b, notwithstanding that the appellant is in fact declared foreclosed of all right, title or equity of redemption. Subject to what I will say, as to the point raised by my brother Anglin, the effect of a sale of the mortgaged property under subsection 2 of section 62 would be to deprive the mortgagor of all right in the property, and he would still be liable for the moneys remaining unpaid after due application of the purchase price. Here the property was declared to be sold to the appellant and leave was granted him to issue execution for the balance of his claim, and looking at the whole order, I am of opinion that it is not the order for foreclosure contemplated by the amendment.\nI now come to the point raised by my brother Anglin, that the mortgagee, even under the special legislation of Alberta, cannot be authorized to purchase the property, and, while retaining it, to issue execution against the mortgagor for the balance of the mortgage debt, after deducting the price for which he has purchased the mortgaged property. For that reason, my learned brother concludes that the master's order should be entirely set aside as containing contradictory and irreconcilable provisions.\nAfter due consideration I think the point well taken, for it is an undoubted rule of equity that the mortgagee cannot have both the mortgaged property and the mortgage debt., While no doubt the mortgagee, in a proper case and with sufficient safeguards, may be allowed to bid at a court sale of the mortgaged property (Halsbury's Laws of England, vo. Mortgage, No. 458, note (e); Fisher, Law of Mortgages, 6th Canadian Edition, No. 2020), I can find no authority for the proposition that after buying in the property himself, he can, while retaining it, sue for the balance of the mortgage debt. There is authority to the contrary, in the judgment of Hagarty, C.J., in Parkinson v. Higgins[27], cited by my brother Anglin, where the learned Chief Justice says:\nOn the whole my conclusion is that the mortgagee cannot sue for his mortgage money, while in the same breath he asserts that the estate is wholly his own, and that he holds it by title paramount, and wholly independent of any title derived from the mortgagor.\nThe new legislation of Alberta does not, reasonably construed, contradict this statement of the law. On the contrary, section 62b shews that the mortgagee cannot sue on the covenant when he has obtained an order for foreclosure against the mortgagor, and this provision would be easily evaded if the mortgagee who has bought the property even with the leave of the court could retain it and sue for the balance of the mortgage debt. In the absence of any authority I would not now say that he can do so.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the master's order, with costs as stated in the opinion of my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\n[1] 15 Alta.

(1909.)\nJudgment of the Court of Review (Q.R. 57 S.C. 394) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Montreal, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial court and maintaining the respondent's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nArthur Vall\u00e9e K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Rivet K.C. for the respondent. Idington J.\u2014There is (at this stage) only one fairly arguable point open for appellant to take by this appeal, and that is whether or not the phrase \"accidents happening in the course of their work\" used in the first section of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Act, is to be construed as the equivalent of the phrase \"happening in the course of their employment\" in other Acts of a like kind, as, for example, in the English \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nIf so, then there is ample authority for holding that, under the circumstances in question, including the implied engagement of appellant to transport men in their employment to and from their respective places of abode free of charge on the occasion of going to or quitting work, the respondent, by reason of the accident in question, is entitled to recover.\nI cannot say that I have any very decided opinion on the question but in such an event I cannot properly reverse the unanimous judgments of the courts below. I therefore conclude that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014This action is brought under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of Quebec (R.S.Q. 1909, Arts. 7321 et seq. and amendments) and the plaintiff holds a judgment for $2,280, affirmed by the Court of Review, against which the defendant appeals.\nThese grounds of appeal are advanced:\n(1) that the plaintiff's disability is not due to the fall from which he avers it has resulted;\n(2) that the compensation awarded is excessive; and (3) that the injury was not suffered in the course of his work.\nThere is abundant evidence to sustain the finding in the plaintiff's favour on the first ground and no case has been made for interference with the amount of the compensation awarded.\nThe third ground of appeal presents the only debatable question, viz., whether the injury in respect of which the plaintiff claims compensation was occasioned \"by reason of or in the course of (his) work\"\u2014\"par le fait du travail, ou \u00e0 l'occasion du travail\"\u2014within the meaning of Art. 7321 of the R.S.Q. 1909.\nWhen injured the plaintiff was returning from his work to his home in a tramcar of the defendant company on which he was entitled to be carried free, under the following provision in the company's booklet of \"Instructions to Conductors and Motormen.\"\n(Instructions aux conducteurs et garde-moteurs).\nLa Cie des Tramways de Montr\u00e9al. No 36.\u2014Transport des employ\u00e9s.\u2014Les conducteurs, garde-moteurs, aiguilleurs et autres employ\u00e9s de la compagnie rev\u00eatus de l'uniforme et portant leur insigne bien en vue, pourront voyager gratuitement pour se rendre \u00e0 leur travail ou en revenir sur tous les tramways de la compagnie. Ces employ\u00e9s devront voyager \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du tramway quand il y aura place, mais ne devront pas occuper les si\u00e8ges quand les voyageurs seront debout, ni engager de conversation avec les employ\u00e9s du tramway.\nAlthough it was not expressly made a term of the formal contract between the defendant company and its employees that the latter should be carried free between their homes and the company's sheds in going to and returning from their work, the evidence leaves little room for doubt that this privilege was recognized as an established custom of the defendants and that the right to enjoy it really formed part of the consideration for which the employees gave their services. I extract the following paragraph from the judgment of the Superior Court:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant en droit, attendu que suivant la coutume suivie et les r\u00e8glements m\u00eames de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse qu'elle remet \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, il est permis \u00e0 tout employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la conduite de ses tramways de monter gratuitement sur tout tramway pour se rendre \u00e0 son travail ou en revenir; que cette disposition est \u00e0 l'avantage de la d\u00e9fenderesse en lui assurant une plus parfaite exactitude de la part de ses employ\u00e9s en lui procurant des employ\u00e9s frais, en leur exemptant la fatigue qu'il r\u00e9sulterait de se rendre \u00e0 pied pour leur travail aux hangars de la compagnie ou en revenir, et que cette disposition est aussi \u00e0 l'avantage des employ\u00e9s en leur fournissant une esp\u00e8ce de surplus de salaire en outre du prix en argent qu'ils re\u00e7oivent; qu'il semble donc que l'aller et retour dans les voitures de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse pour effectuer le travail requis du demandeur fait partie du louage de services entre lui et la d\u00e9fenderesse, que dans ces circonstances l'accident survenu au demandeur est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion du travail et qu'ainsi il y a lieu d'appliquer les dispositions de la loi du travail.\nThe evidence supports the conclusions of fact in this passage.\nThe use of the conjunction \"or\" in the Quebec statute in lieu of the conjunction \"and\" in the English \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" (\"arising out of and in the course of the employment\") will not have escaped attention. The use of the disjunctive in the French statute of 1898, from which the Quebec law is taken, was deliberate and purposeful (Cabouat, Accidents du Travail, Vol. 1, p. 186), and although a commentator in Rec. des Assurances, 1918, at p. 38, says\npour qu'il y ait accident du travail, il faut que celui-ci se soit produit au cours du travail, et soit en rapport direct de cause \u00e0 effet avec lui,\nthe jurisprudence seems clearly to establish that\nil n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que (l'accident) survienne par le fait m\u00eame du travail de la victime; il suffit qu'il se produise \u00e0 l'occasion de ce travail: (D.1900.2.181)\u2014que l'accident se rattache par un lien plus ou moins \u00e9troit \u00e0 l'exercice de la profession de la victime. Otherwise the effect of the two statutes in regard to the matter under consideration appears to me to be the same. I regard \"by reason of\" as the equivalent of \"out of,\" and \"in the course of their work\" as identical in effect with \"in the course of the employment\" and I am prepared to accept as applicable to both statutes the view expressed by Buckley L.J., in Fitzgerald v. Clark & Son[2], that\nthe words \"out of\" point * * to the origin or cause of the accident; the words \"in the course of\" to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident takes place.\nIt follows, I think, that while some cases which are within the Quebec Act may not be covered by the English Act, since it requires that both conditions must be fulfilled, any case within the English Act must necessarily fall within the Quebec statute, which will ex facie be satisfied if the accident either arises by reason of, or arises in the course of, the work or employment.\nWhile in view of such decisions as Davies v. Rhymney Iron Co.[3]; Walters v. Staveley Coal & Iron Co.[4]; Nolan v. Porter & Sons[5]; Edwards v. Wingham Agricultural Implement Co.[6]; Philbin v. Hayes[7]; and Gilbert v. Owners of Steam Trawler Nizam[8], the question whether upon a state of facts similar to those of the case at bar an injured employee would be held to fall under the provisions of the English Act may be regarded as debatable, authoritative statements as to the scope of the statute in recent cases such as Armstrong-Whitworth & Co. v. Redford[9]; Stewart v. Longhurst[10]; Marsh v. Pope & Pearson, Ltd.[11]; Wales v. Lambton & Hetton Collieries[12]; Thorn v. Sinclair[13]; Walton v. Tredegar Iron & Coal Co.[14]; and Mole v. Wadworth[15]; and in such earlier cases as Gane v. Norton Hill Colliery Co.[16]; Cremins v. Guest, Keen & Nettlefolds, Ltd.[17]; Blovelt v. Sawyer[18]; Holmes v. Great Nor. Rly. Co.[19]; Hoskins v. Lancaster[20]; and Moore v. Manchester Liners Ltd.[21]; and the reasoning in Whittall v. Stavely Iron & Coal Co.[22], rather incline me to think that under circumstances such as those of the present case an employee of an English company, injured as the present plaintiff was, would be held to be within the purview of the English statute. As put by Warrington L.J. in the case last cited:\nThe real question that the Court has to ask itself is: Was it an express or implied term of the contract of service that the workman should do, or should be entitled to do, that which he is doing at the time when the accident happened?\nAnd as Bankes L.J. said in the same case:\nIt is necessary to inquire when deciding whether the accident arose in the course of the employment, whether the accident took place upon a way which the workman was using as of right, because then it would be a term either expressed or implied of his engagement that he was to be at liberty so to use it.\nIt seems to me that, upon the findings of the trial judge, which the evidence warranted, the case at bar falls within the principle of the decisions in Cremins v. Guest, Keen & Nettlefords[23], where the workman was held entitled to recover upon a finding that it was an implied term of his contract of service that the train upon which he was being carried should be provided by the employer and that employees should have the right to travel to and fro upon it without charge with the result that the employment was taken to begin when they entered the train in the morning and to cease when they left it in the evening, and in the similar case of Walton v. Tredegar Iron & Coal Co.[24], in which there was a like result notwithstanding a special indemnity contract with the employers, rather than within the decision in Davies v. The Rhymney Iron & Coal Co.[25], where the contrary view was taken although the workman had availed himself of facilities given by his employer to go home, the court there regarding the service rendered by the employers as purely gratuitous. The decision in Coldrick v. Partridge, Jones & Co.[26], is also in point.\nLord Cozens-Hardy, M.R., laid it down in Read v. Baker[27], that\nthe facts being admitted or not disputed, it becomes a question of law whether or not an accident arises \"out of the\" employment.\nOn the other hand Lord Buckmaster said in Stewart v. Langhurst[28]:\nIn my opinion, however, the learned County Court Judge has fallen into error in his endeavour to obtain from outside cases a fixed standard of measurement by which to test the meaning of the words in the statute \"in the course of\" and \"arising out of\" the employment. Some of the reported cases * * * appear to me to have made the same mistake and to have attempted to define a fixed boundary dividing the cases that are within the statute from those that are without. This it is almost impossible to achieve. No authority can with certainty do more than decide whether a particular case upon particular facts is or is not within the meaning of the phrase. The facts in the very late case of Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. v. Bedford[29], bear a curiously close resemblance to those in the recent French case of Masson v. L'Urbaine Seine[30]. In both cases the employer provided a canteen for the exclusive but optional use of its employees. In each the canteen had no direct connection with the factory premises and access to it was by a separate entrance and a stairway. In each the employee was injured by falling on the stairs when returning from the mid-day meal to resume work. In the English case the employer was held liable by the House of Lords (Lords Sumner, Parmoor and Wrenbury), on the ground that the employee might be regarded as \"in the course of the employment\" while descending the stair-case to the actual spot where the work lay. Viscount Finlay and Lord Dunedin dissented. In the French case the Tribunal Civil de la Seine (4\u00e8me ch.) dismissed the action on the ground that the accident had occurred during an interruption of the employment and was \"sans relation avec le travail.\"\nGiving to the decided cases the consideration and weight to which I consider them to be entitled it seems to me that the plaintiff may fairly be regarded as having been, when injured, doing something which an implied term of his engagement \"entitled him to do\"\u2014that he was on the tramcar solely by virtue of his contract of his service\u2014that he was making use of the means provided by his employer to convey him to his home\u2014that he was doing something ancillary or incidental to the work for which he was employed (Davidson v. McRobb)[31], and that the accident which befell him may therefore fairly be said to have \"arisen out of and in the course of his employment.\"\nBut we are not without French authority directly bearing on the subject which, for the reasons stated in the recent judgment delivered in this court in St. Lawrence Bridge Co. v. Lewis[32], is entitled possibly to even greater weight. The idea that injury sustained by a workman while being taken to and from his place of work in a conveyance provided by his employer as a term of the contract of hiring should be regarded as part of the risk involved in his employment has received judicial approval in France both before and since the enactment of the law of 1898, D. 1886, 2.123; Gaz. du Palais, 1886.2.66; Loubat, No. 464, Sachet, Nos. 322-4. Under the law of 1898 and subsequent legislation, in this respect similar, there have been several applications of this doctrine. Thus in Lafaye v. Chemins de fer de l'Est[33], the company was held liable for injury sustained by a workman while proceeding, after his work had been finished, to take his place in a train provided by the company to carry him gratuitously to his home in fulfilment of a term of his engagement. Again in a case before the Cour d'Appel de Grenoble, reported in the Gaz. des Tribunaux, 1904.2.204, and in D. 1905.2.83, the holding was that\nL'accident dont un ouvrier est victime au cours d'un voyage de retour du lieu du travail \u00e0 son domicile, aux frais du patron, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme survenu \u00e0 l'occasion du travail, auquel il se rattache, par une relation incontestable de cause \u00e0 effet. The return journey was regarded as part of the period of employment for which the workman's wages were paid. In a recent case in the Cour de Cassation, D. 1917.1.23 (32\u00e8me esp\u00e8ce), a workman en route to his work injured while unnecessarily crossing some railway tracks in proceeding by a shortcut, which he had, with the knowledge and tacit consent of his employers, been accustomed to use, was held entitled to recover, the court finding that\nl'accident s'est produit \u00e0 une heure o\u00f9 la reprise du travail n\u00e9cessitait la pr\u00e9sence de l'ouvrier en cet endroit.\nand that\nle lieu de l\u2019accident devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une d\u00e9pendance du lieu du travail.\nBut in 1910 the Cour de Cassation (Ch. des Req.) decided the case of. Veuve Dauvert v. Comp. de Tramways de Cherbourg[34], which seems to me to be indistinguishable from the case at bar. Dauvert, an employee of the company, was killed by falling from a platform of a tramcar on which he was being taken from the car-sheds to his home. By a general rule of the company employees coming to and leaving their place of employment (the company's car-sheds) were permitted to ride gratuitously in the tramcars between their homes and the car-sheds. The trial court had taken the view that this rule had been passed with a view to ensuring regularity in service and that it secured moreover an advantage for the employees which constituted a veritable addition to their salaries and which thus presented indisputable characteristics of a stipulation in the contract of employment. The Cour de Cassation found no error in the conclusion of the court that the accident which had caused the death of Dauvert occurred \"\u00e0 l'occasion du travail,\" and his widow's recovery was upheld. I think we may safely follow the precedent which the last cited case establishes and in the case at bar uphold the judgment of the Court of Review confirming that of the Superior Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014C'est une poursuite sous la loi des accidents du travail de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le demandeur intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de la compagnie appelante comme wattman ou garde-moteur. Il avait fini son travail et avait remis\u00e9 sa voiture vers deux heures du matin; il \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 sur un autre tramway de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse pour retourner chez lui, et en se levant pour descendre, il tomba lour-dement sur le parquet glac\u00e9 et glissant du tramway. Cette chute lui occasionna des douleurs dans la r\u00e9gion de l'abdomen. Il revint tout de m\u00eame reprendre son travail le lendemain apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 des bandages. Mais les douleurs devenant plus difficiles \u00e0 supporter, il alla consulter son m\u00e9decin qui, apr\u00e8s examen, constata qu'il souffrait de hernies. L'une d'elles paraissait \u00eatre gu\u00e9rie lors de l'enqu\u00eate; mais l'autre subsistait encore et lui causait une incapacit\u00e9 partielle et permanente.\nLa principale question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si l'employ\u00e9 d'une compagnie de tramways qui est victime d'un accident lorsqu'il est transport\u00e9 gratuitement en revenant de son travail peut invoquer la loi des accidents du travail.\nLa preuve constate que les employes de la compagnie appelante re\u00e7oivent, en entrant \u00e0 son service, un livret intitule \"Instructions aux conducteurs et garde-moteurs\" et l'article 36 de ces r\u00e8glements comporte que les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie rev\u00eatus de leur uniforme pourront voyager sur tous les tramways de la compagnie pour se rendre \u00e0 leur travail ou en revenir.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que cette disposition des r\u00e8glements ne constitue qu'une simple faveur qui ne saurait constituer aucune obligation.\nJe consid\u00e8re que ce passage gratuit que la compagnie donne \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s est \u00e0 l'avantage non-seulement de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 mais aussi d'elle-m\u00eame. Cela lui assure, comme le dit si bien l'honorable juge Lafontaine, une plus parfaite exactitude de la part de ses employ\u00e9s qui peuvent alors se mettre au travail frais et dispos, vu qu'ils s'exemptent de la fatigue de se rendre \u00e0 pied \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 ils devront prendre leur tramway. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, cela constitue un suppl\u00e9ment qui fait partie de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que la compagnie est tenue de payer. Et elle violerait certainement ses obligations si elle refusait \u00e0 son employ\u00e9 de le transporter pour aller \u00e0 son travail ou en revenir.\nOn voit par ces r\u00e8glements que ces employ\u00e9s qui prennent ainsi passage sur un tramway sont soumis, sous certains rapports, aux ordres du conducteur de ce tramway et ne peuvent jouir de ce privil\u00e8ge que dans certaines conditions.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sulte de la loi des accidents du travail a pour fondement l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9pendance o\u00f9 se trouve plac\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du patron l'ouvrier qui est victime d'un accident. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la condition qu'il existe un contrat de louage. L'ouvrier qui irait chercher son salaire apr\u00e8s son travail termin\u00e9 aurait bien droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 s'il lui arrivait alors un accident. Il devrait en \u00eatre de m\u00eame du garde-moteur qui monte dans une voiture de la compagnie pour y jouir d'un passage gratuit qui fait partie de son salaire.\nLa loi des accidents du travail (art. 7321 S.R.Q.) ne couvre pas seulement l'accident survenu par le fait du travail mais aussi \u00e0 l'occasion du travail, c'est-\u00e0-dire celui qui sans avoir pour cause directe le travail de la victime a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par un acte connexe au travail et plus ou moins utile \u00e0 son accomplissement. (Cabouat, vol. ler, n\u00b0 150; Aubry & Rau, vol. 5, par. 372 bis, pp. 477-480; Dalloz, 1900-2-181.)\nComme on le sait, la loi fran\u00e7aise est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e dans les m\u00eames termes que celle de Qu\u00e9bec. Le fait est que notre l\u00e9gislation de 1909 est la copie presque textuelle de la l\u00e9gislation fran\u00e7aise de 1898. Or il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en France par la Cour de Cassation, dans une cause de La Compagnie des Tramways de Cherbourg v. Veuve Dauvert[35], que l'employ\u00e9 qui en vertu d'un r\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'une compagnie de tramways qui permet aux employ\u00e9s venant prendre ou quittant leur service de circuler gratuitement dans les tramways entre leur domicile et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, peut invoquer la loi des accidents du travail s'il est victime d'une chute de la plateforme du tramway qui le ramenait de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 son domicile. Revue judiciaire des accidents du travail vol. 11, ann\u00e9e 1910. Gazette des Tribunaux, 1910-1-143. La Cour de Cassation nous enseigne que dans ce cas-l\u00e0 l'accident est survenu \u00e0 l'occasion du travail.\nUne d\u00e9cision au m\u00eame effet se trouve dans la m\u00eame revue pour l'ann\u00e9e 1913, \u00e0 la page 143. Il me semble bien \u00e9vident alors que le demandeur dans la pr\u00e9sente cause a le droit de r\u00e9clamer sous la loi des accidents du travail.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que la maladie dont il souffre ne provient pas de l'accident. C'est l\u00e0 une question de fait. La preuve d\u00e9montre que l'employ\u00e9, apr\u00e8s l'accident, a ressenti des douleurs qui, apr\u00e8s examen par son m\u00e9decin, justifiaient ce dernier de dire que l'accident avait caus\u00e9 la hernie qui a r\u00e9duit sa capacit\u00e9 de travail. Je ne me croirais pas justifiable de modifier la d\u00e9cision des deux cours inf\u00e9rieures sur cette question de faits.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014D'apr\u00e8s les constatations de fait du premier juge, l'appelante, tant par les r\u00e8glements qu'elle remet \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s que par la coutume suivie, permet \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de monter gratuitement sur ses tramways pour se rendre \u00e0 leur travail ou pour en revenir, ce qui est un avantage pour l'appelante en lui assurant une plus grande exactitude de travail et des employ\u00e9s plus frais et dispos, et pour les ouvriers en leur fournissant une sorte de suppl\u00e9ment de salaire.\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce, Girard revenait de son travail dans une des voitures de l'appelante lorsqu'il fit une chute qui, encore par les constatations de fait du premier juge, causa une incapacit\u00e9 partielle et permanente de travail, lui donnant, dans l'opinion de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de la cour de revision, droit d'action d'apr\u00e8s la loi des accidents de travail de Qu\u00e9bec. L'accident en question est-il survenu \"par le fait du travail ou \u00e0 l'occasion du travail\" (art. 7321, S.R.Q., 1909) de l'intim\u00e9? Les deux cours ont r\u00e9pondu dans l'affirmative et l'appelante nous demande maintenant d'infirmer les jugements rendus contre elle.\nJ'ai eu l'avantage de lire l'opinion tr\u00e8s travaill\u00e9e de mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin. Il d\u00e9montre que les tribunaux anglais et fran\u00e7ais admettent dans ce cas la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre sous la loi, tant anglaise que fran\u00e7aise, concernant les accidents du travail. Mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Brodeur, est de la m\u00eame opinion, mais se base sur la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise uniquement, et, du reste, puisque la loi des accidents du travail de Qu\u00e9bec est copi\u00e9e, du moins pour ce que je viens d'en citer, sur la loi fran\u00e7aise, on trouve, dans la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, un guide tr\u00e8s utile pour son interpr\u00e9tation.\nToutefois j'avoue que je n'ai pu me d\u00e9fendre de quelques doutes, car le but du l\u00e9gislateur est de prot\u00e9ger l'ouvrier contre les accidents dont son travail est la cause ou du moins l'occasion directe, et ici, malgr\u00e9 que le privil\u00e8ge que l'appelante accorde \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de voyager gratuitement dans ses voitures pour se rendre \u00e0 leur travail ou en revenir soit dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des ouvriers et de la compagnie, on peut se demander en quoi un accident arriv\u00e9 au cours du transport gratuit a pour cause ou occasion directe le travail de l'ouvrier. Cependant, la jurisprudence admet le recours en ce cas et l'esp\u00e8ce jug\u00e9e par l'arr\u00eat de la Cour de cassation du 9 juin 1910, que cite mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin, et qui est rapport\u00e9 dans la Gazette des Tribunaux, 1910, 2\u00e8me semestre, premi\u00e8re partie, p. 143, est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identique \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe, car les constatations de fait du premier juge nous permettent de dire que c'\u00e9tait une condition au moins implicite du contrat de louage d'ouvrage que l'intim\u00e9 pourrait voyager gratuitement dans les' voitures de l'appelante en se rendant \u00e0 son travail ou en revenant chez lui, sa journ\u00e9e finie. Cette d\u00e9cision peut donc justifier le jugement dont l'appelante se plaint.\nIl sera int\u00e9ressant de citer ici les observations de l'arr\u00eatiste qui rapporte la d\u00e9cision de la cour de cassation \u00e0 laquelle je viens de faire allusion:\nEn principe, un ouvrier n'est pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la loi de 1898 sur les accidents du travail lorsqu'il est victime d'un accident pendant qu'il se rend de son domicile \u00e0 son travail ou r\u00e9ciproquement, c'est-\u00e0-dire avant que la journ\u00e9e de travail soit commenc\u00e9e ou apr\u00e8s qu'elle est termin\u00e9e. C. de Douai, 25 novembre 1902 (Gaz. des Tribunaux, 18 janvier 1903); C. de cassation, 25 f\u00e9vrier 1902 (Rec. Gaz. des Tribunaux, 1902, 2\u00e8me sem., 1.6; Dalloz, 1902.1.273); 3 mars 1903 (Rec. Gaz. des Tribunaux, 1903, 2\u00e8me sem., 1.61; Dal, 1903.1.273).\nIl en est autrement, et l'ouvrier b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie des dispositions de la loi de 1898, lorsque, par suite de la nature du travail ou de l'\u00e9loignement du chantier, le patron a pris \u00e0 sa charge le transport des ouvriers. En pareil cas, l'accident survenu \u00e0 un ouvrier, au cours du transport, constitue un accident du travail. C. de Caen, 25 juin 1901 (Rec. Gaz. des Tribunaux, 1901, 2\u00e8me sem., 2.421); C. de Grenoble, 27 mai 1904 (Rec. Gaz. des Tribunaux, 1904, 2\u00e8me sem., 2.204; Dal., 1905.2.83).\nCette m\u00eame exception subsiste-t-elle lorsque, ne s'agissant plus d'un transport \u00e0 la charge du patron, celui-ci a simplement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ses ouvriers la facult\u00e9 d'un transport gratuit?\nC'\u00e9tait la question que posait le pourvoi dans l'esp\u00e8ce ci-dessus. La Chambre des requ\u00eates l'a r\u00e9solue affirmativement. Au point de vue juridique, cette solution est peut-\u00eatre admissible, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9s les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la jurisprudence sur la question, quand l'ouvrier se rendant au travail est bless\u00e9 au cours d'un transport fait pour le compte du patron.\nAu point de vue pratique, on peut se demander si l'arr\u00eat que vient de rendre la Chambre des requ\u00eates ne confirme pas l'opinion de ceux qui pensent que lorsque la protection d\u00e9passe une certaine mesure, elle aboutit \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats inverses des effets bienfaisants que l'on en attendait. Il ne serait pas \u00e9tonnant, en effet, que, comme cons\u00e9quence de cet arr\u00eat, la compagnie de tramways demanderesse au pourvoi e\u00fbt retir\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s la facult\u00e9 du parcours gratuit, ne voulant pas, sans doute, que cette autorisation f\u00fbt pour elle une source de charges. Accident survenu au cours du transport gratuit, accident du travail? Soit. Plus de transport gratuit.\nJe suis absolument de cet avis.\nL'appel devra donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.

J.[2], and maintaining the respondents' petition. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie, for the appellant.\nCharles Wilson K.C., for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The late Sir William Van Horne was domiciled in Quebec when he made his last will and testament and died on the 11th of September, 1915, possessed of an estate of the aggregate value of $6,371, 374.31, of which $300,000 worth was situated in the Province of British Columbia. The questions raised herein relative to the amount of the succession duties collectable upon or out of that part of the estate so situated, must be determined by the true interpretation and construction of the \"Succession Duties Act,\" as amended, of said province, if and so far as intra vires the legislature thereof.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] holds that the scale applied by the appellant in estimating the duties payable in question would be ultra vires the power of the said legislature to enact, and hence, the \"Succession Duty Act\" so construed would be ultra vires.\nIt should tend to clarity of thought upon the subject to bear in mind that the right of any one to claim any part of the estate of a deceased rests entirely upon the legislative enactments, in force where the property so left, may chance to have provided.\n[Page 129]The succession duties, so called, requiring a part of the estate situated in any province at the time of death to be handed over to the Minister of Finance or other authority declared by the legislature entitled to demand and receive same, is clearly within the power of the legislature to enact.\nThe scale by which such duties are to be measured and the conditions upon and by which it is to be applied also fall within the said power.\nThere is no attempt made by the enactment here in question to tax, directly or indirectly, any part of the estate lying beyond the province.\nAll that is attempted, is to apply a scale of assessment to that now in question presumed to be fitting the case of a wealthy man's estate.\nSimilar distinctions are, rightly or wrongly, made in an infinite variety of ways in that kind of legislation in the cases of those domiciled within a province.\nTwo of the most prevalent of those distinctions are the cases of the men of wealth, as distinguished from their poorer neighbours, or of men with a family, or next of kin, as distinguished from those who have none.\nNo one has ever, so far as I know, tried to maintain that such distinctive conditions are beyond the power of the legislature having absolute authority over property and civil rights, to impose as a term of the necessary recognition by local authority, in order to entitle any one to claim the succession of any part of the property of a deceased person.\nFor aught I can see, as matter of law, the like distinction might be so made in favour of or against the sex or colour of him or her who has died, or him or her who is to become entitled to receive by virtue of legislative authority what has been left, if the legislature saw fit to do so. It seems to me necessary, from experience of the mode of thought with which enactments such as that in question are sometimes approached, in trying to interpret and construe them, that a full realization of the foregoing elementary principles is necessary.\nThe amended statute now in question if viewed in light of such conceptions is to my mind very clear and simple.\nI agree it might have been expressed in some way that would have rendered the construction put upon it below impossible.\nYet if we pay heed to the interpretation of the definitions of the phrases \"aggregate value\" and \"net value\" when used in the enactment, how, I submit with great respect, can the clauses wherein they occur be construed otherwise than as embracing both property within and without the province?\nThe phrases are defined respectively as follows:\u2014\n\"Aggregate value\" means the value of the property before the debts, incumbrances, or other allowances authorized by this Act are deducted therefrom, and shall include property situate without the province as well as property situate within the province.\n\"Net value\" means the value of the property, both within and without the province, after the debts, incumbrances, or other allowances or exemptions authorized by this Act are deducted therefrom.\nWhat right have we to read them in any sense which will discard this statutory meaning? And what right have we to read into the enactments in which they appear another meaning than that would give?\nAnd when we look at the whole purview of the statute is it not clear that there is no pretence of intention to tax anything situated beyond the province but merely to apply by means of the ascertainment thereof a scale of tax applicable to that within the province according to certain conditions? These conditions I think were properly appreciated by the appellant and duly applied by the rules of proportion he has adopted.\nAnd, curiously enough, as illustrative of how the prepossessions and self-interest of men will tend to mislead them, we have the respondent quite content to adopt the rule of proportion so invoked when it is applied to the deduction of the testator's debts of which none existed in the province.\nAnd that is accepted by the court as quite right.\nIt would have been quite competent, but for the testamentary disposition, for the respondent to have paid all the debts out of British Columbia assets.\nThe necessary relevant authorities are cited in the dissenting judgments below and need not be repeated here.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The decision of this appeal turns upon the proper construction of section 7 of the \"Succession Duty Act\" as amended by the legislation of 1915. The section so amended provides that where the net value of the property of the deceased exceeds $25,000 and passes through a certain course of succession mentioned in the statute, then\nall property situated within the province * * * shall be subject to duty as follows.\nThen follows three sub-paragraphs, A, B, & C, of which paragraph C only has relevancy to the present appeal. That paragraph is in these words:\n(c) Where the net value exceeds $200,000, at the rate of $1.50 for every $100 of the first $100,000, $2.50 for every $100 of the second $100,000, and five dollars for every $100 above the $200,000. Net value as defined in the interpretation section means a net value ascertained by taking into account the value of all property both within and without the province. It seems reasonably clear that the scheme contemplated by the legislature as brought into force by paragraph (c), is that for the purpose of ascertaining the rate in the case of estates falling within that paragraph, the net value of the estate is to be divided into three parts, the first being the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the second also being the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the third being the difference between the sum of two hundred thousand dollars and the sum representing aggregate net value; the net value in every case as already mentioned being ascertained by reference to the whole of the property both within and without the province. This division having been made, the rate prescribed by paragraph (c) is the rate of one dollar and fifty cents notionally applied to the whole of the first one hundred thousand dollars of the net value; the sum of two dollars and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars on the second one hundred thousand dollars notionally applied to the whole of that sum, and five dollars for every one hundred dollars above the two hundred thousand dollars notionally applied to the whole estate both within and without the province. In this manner the rate of taxation is ascertained. The property taxed, however, is only the property situated within the province, and in the case of each of the parts only that part of the first one hundred thousand, the second one hundred thousand or the excess over two hundred thousand, as the case may be, which is so situate is subject to taxation according to the several rates prescribed by sub-section (c), for the parts mentioned. This appears to be a simple and perfectly intelligible scheme applicable alike to estates partly situated within and partly situated without the province, and to estates wholly situated within the province, and the intention of the legislature seems to be expressed with reasonable clearness. The alternative interpretation proposed by Mr. Wilson in his able argument, I think, cannot be maintained on any construction of \"net value\" in sub-section (c), which is not inconsistent with the definition of that phrase given in the interpretation section.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014Although it would appear that in the opinion of the majority of the learned judges who have dealt with this case its determination should turn on whether s. 7 of the British Columbia \"Succession Duty Act\" (R.S.B.C., c. 217), as amended by s. 4 of c. 58 of the statutes of 1915, is or is not intra vires of the Provincial Legislature, I am, with profound respect, unable to discern in it any arguable question of constitutional validity. The subject matter of the taxation being admittedly within the province, I fail to appreciate how it can transcend its legislative jurisdiction to prescribe that the rate of the tax which it is to bear shall depend upon the amount of the decedent's entire estate, whether situate wholly within, or partly without and partly within, the province, or how it could be said if the rate of taxation on the domestic assets were made to increase with the amount of the \"net value\" of an entire estate comprising foreign assets, that the greater tax consequently levied on the domestic assets in that case would involve an indirect tax on the foreign assets. I agree with Mr. Justice Martin that\nit is not a matter of indirect taxation at all but simply the fixing of a basis of domestic assessment in varying circumstances, domestic and foreign. The respondent's petition does not claim freedom from succession duties. It does not challenge the constitutionality of s. 7 of the statute. It asks merely a declaration that the amount of the duty payable under it in respect of the $290,463.25, net value of the estate of the late Sir William Van Horne, K.C.M.G., situate in British Columbia, is $8,523.16 and not $14,242.10 as claimed by the province. Both parties are agreed that the amount of the taxable property in British Columbia is the \"net value\" of the decedent's assets in the province and that this \"net value\" is to be ascertained by deducting from the gross or aggregate value of such assets a part of the debts of the decedent which bears to his whole indebtedness the same proportion as the aggregate value of his British Columbia assets bears to that of his entire estate. Whether this practice is correct or is sanctioned by the statute is therefore a question not presented for our consideration.\nThe difference between the parties arises from a divergence of views as to the mode of computation directed by s. 7, the material parts of which, as amended, read as follows:\u2014\nWhen the net value of the property of the deceased exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars, and passes under a will, intestacy, or otherwise, either in whole or in part, to or for the use of the father, mother, husband, wife, child, daughter-in-law, or son-in-law of the deceased, all property situate within the Province, or so much thereof as so passes (as the case may be) shall be subject to duty as follows:\u2014\n(a) not applicable.\n(b) not applicable.\n(c) Where the net value exceeds two hundred thousand dollars, at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars of the first one hundred thousand dollars, two dollars and fifty cents for every hundred dollars of the second one hundred thousand dollars, and five dollars for every one hundred dollars above the two hundred thousand dollars.\n[Page135]\nCounsel representing the Minister of Finance contends that it is not on the entire \"first one hundred thousand dollars\" worth of property situate in British Columbia that duty at the rate of 1 1\/2% is to be levied, but on the proportion thereof which would be subject to that rate if the entire estate had been situate within the province\u2014and in like manner as to the \"second one hundred thousand dollars' \" worth of assets situate in British Columbia. He would read the words \"every one hundred dollars of the first one hundred thousand dollars\" and \"every one hundred dollars of the second one hundred thousand dollars\" as meaning in each case, \"that portion of every one hundred dollars which bears to it the same proportion as the amount of the net value of the estate within British Columbia bears to the net value of the whole estate wherever situate.\" The respondent executor, on the other hand, maintains that this construction involves interpolating an idea which is not only not expressed in the statute but is excluded by its terms. One hundred dollars, he says, means that sum and not some part or proportion of it varying as the relative amount of foreign assets comprised in the estate is greater or less.\nWith Mr. Justice Galliher I view this as the real, if not the sole, question for decision; and with that learned judge I would determine it in the respondent's favour. While unable to read the words \"net value\" in clause (c) as the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal does (i.e., as having a meaning different from that which the same words bear in the first line of s. 7\u2014viz., the meaning given to it by the definition found in s. 2), I agree with what I understand to be that learned judge's view and also that of Mr. Justice Galliher, that it is the entire first one hundred thousand dollars' worth of \"all property (of the decedent) situate within the province\" that is declared by clause (c) of s. 7 to be liable to a duty of 1 1\/2% and the entire second one hundred thousand dollars' worth of the same property that is declared to be liable to a duty of 2 1\/2%, and that the 5% rate of duty applies only to the excess over the two hundred thousand dollars worth of assets situate within the province. The statute, in my opinion, plainly says so.\nOmitting the introductory forty-six words of s. 7, which serve to define the cases that fall within the operation of the section as a whole, and also the introductory words of clause (c) \"where the net value exceeds two hundred thousand dollars,\" which in like manner serve to define the cases that fall within the purview of that particular clause, the operative part of the section, as applicable to the case before us, reads as follows:\u2014\nAll property situate within the province * * * shall be subject to duty as follows:\u2014\nAt the rate of one dollar and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars of the first one hundred thousand dollars, two dollars and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars of the second one hundred thousand dollars, and five dollars for every one hundred dollars above the two hundred thousand dollars.\nThat this provision was intended to apply to estates consisting of property wholly within the province as well as to those comprising property partly within and partly without the province is conceded. While in the former case the appellant takes the statute just as it is and says that it fully expresses the intention of the legislature, in the latter, he would apply clause (c) as if it read as follows, the words in brackets being interpolated, except the concluding words, which are substituted: (c) Where the net value exceeds two hundred thousand dollars, (and part of the estate consists of property not within the province) at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents for (a part of) every one hundred dollars of the first one hundred thousand dollars, (which bears to the sum of one hundred dollars the same proportion as the net value of the estate within British Columbia bears to the net value of the entire estate of the decedent) two dollars and fifty cents for (a like part of) every hundred dollars of the second one hundred thousand dollars, and five dollars for every one hundred dollars (worth of the rest of the estate within the province).\nIn the case at bar the appellant would apply the 1 1\/2% rate to $4,683.84, the 2 1\/2% rate to $4,683.84 and the 5% rate, not as the statute says to \"every one hundred dollars above the two hundred thousand dollars,\" but to \"every one hundred dollars above $9,366.48.\"\nNot only does clause (c) of s. 7 appear to say in such plain language that the lower rates of 1 1\/2% and 2 1\/2% are the rates of duty to be taken in respect of the first one hundred thousand dollars' worth and the second one hundred thousand dollars' worth of property situate within the province respectively that no excuse is afforded for any departure from Lord Wensleydale's well-known \"golden rule of construction,\" but as part of a taxing Act it does not admit of an equitable construction in favour of the Crown in order to carry out some presumed intention of the legislature in the direction of equality which has not been expressed. Lumsden v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[4]. The subject of taxation must come within the letter of the law. We cannot justify reading into this taxing statute any words such as counsel for the Minister argues the legislature must have meant it to contain to increase the burden of the tax, whether on a plea of equalization or any other. It may be that if the Act be read literally, as I think it must be, the taxation on the $300,000 of British Columbia assets owned by the decedent will be less than it would have been had all the rest of his estate of $6,371,374.75 been likewise situate within the province. But, if that be a result which the legislature did not intend, it is reached merely because it has expressed an intention to that effect and has failed to express any other intention. The remedy is in its hands and must be sought from it and not from the courts. Attorney General v. Milne[5].\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this case is whether the British Columbia Government should levy a succession duty, on Sir Wm. Van Horne's Estate, of $14,242.10, as claimed by the appellant, or of only $8,523.16, as contended by the respondent and as decided by the courts below.\nThe whole difficulty is as to the construction of section 7 of the \"Succession Duty Act\" of British Columbia and as to the way of computing the rate of duty. There was a suggestion by one of the judges below that the Province had no right to take into account the extra-provincial assets to determine the net value of the estate. But this constitutional aspect was not, and with reason, accepted by the other judges. It seems to me that a province acts within its power in enacting that the property of a deceased person situate outside the province should be considered in arriving at the aggregate value. Re Renfrew[6]. There is no attempt in the present statute to tax property outside the province; but it simply declares that the property situate within the province will bear a heavier duty when the whole estate is larger. The provincial authorities in determining the rate of duty in this case have taken into account all the property of the deceased both within and without the province and have subjected the proportionate part of such property within the Province to the duty which would have been payable if the whole estate had been within the province. This mode of calculation is not only a fair and equitable one, but is the one authorized by the statute.\nThe respondent contends that the rate of succession duty should be determined with reference only to the net value of the property of the deceased within the Province.\nSection 2 of the \"Succession Duty Act\" enacts that the net value mentioned in section 7 means the value of the property both within and without the Province.\nIt is common ground that the liabilities of the estate should be charged proportionately on the property in the province and it seems to me that the same rule should be observed as to the payment of the rates of succession duty.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the claim as made by the British Columbia Minister of Finance be declared valid.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014As I view this case, it involves merely the construction of the British Columbia \"Succession Duty Act,\" chapter 217 of the Revised Statutes of 1911, as amended by section 4 of chapter 58 of the statutes of 1915. No constitutional problems arise and the right of the British Columbia legislature to levy a succession duty of any amount on property within the province passing by the death of a person domiciled within or without the province, has not been disputed. The late Sir William Van Horne left an estate of the aggregate value of $6,371,374.73, with liabilities of $169,989.56, so that the net value of the estate was $6,201,385.17. Out of the aggregate value, 2,000 shares in the British Columbia Sugar Refinery, Limited, were in British Columbia and their agreed value was $300,000. The appellant demanded $14,242.10, as succession duty, and the respondent, managing executor of the estate, petitioned the court to have it declared that the claim of the appellant proceeded upon an erroneous basis, and that the sum payable for succession duty was $8,523.16, and no more.\nBy the statute \"aggregate value\" means\nthe aggregate value of the property before the debts, incumbrances, or other allowances authorized by this Act are deducted therefrom, and shall include property situate without the Province as well as property situate within the Province,\nwhile \"net value\" is defined as\nthe value of the property, both within and without the Province, after the debts, incumbrances, or other allowances or exemptions authorized by this Act are deducted therefrom.\nSection 7 of the statute is as follows:\nWhen the net value of the property of the deceased exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars, and passes under a will, intestacy, or otherwise, either in whole or in part, to or for the use of the father, mother, husband, wife, child, daughter-in-law, or son-in-law of the deceased, all property situate within the Province, or so much thereof as so passes (as the case may be) shall be subject to duty as follows:\n(a) Where the net value exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars, but does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars, at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars;\n(b) Where the net value exceeds one hundred thousand dollars but does not exceed two hundred thousand dollars, at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars of the first hundred thousand dollars and two dollars and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars above the one hundred thousand dollars;\n(c)Where the net value exceeds two hundred thousand dollars, at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars of the first one hundred thousand dollars, two dollars and fifty cents for every hundred dollars of the second one hundred thousand dollars, and five dollars for every one hundred dollars above the two hundred thousand dollars. I am of opinion, on the construction of this section, that the property subject to succession duty is \"all property situate within the province,\" and inasmuch as the property in British Columbia of this estate exceeded in value $200,000. the succession duty must be calculated according to paragraph (c) of section 7.\nThe property in British Columbia belonging to the estate amounted, I have said, to $300,000. It appears to have been common ground between the parties that from this $300,000 should be deducted the sum of $9,536.75, being a share of the total liabilities of the same proportion as the sum of $300,000 when compared with the aggregate value of the whole estate, thus leaving a net value in British Columbia of $290,463.25. It is on the basis of this reduction of the assets in British Columbia that both parties have proceeded, and I express no opinion whether the reduction should have been made.\nThe appellant's mode of calculation, which I copy, correcting some misprints in figures, from the respondent's factum, no objection having been taken to the accuracy of the statement by the appellant's counsel, is as follows:\nTotal amount of estate, less debts, $6,207,385.07; agreed value of property in B.C. after deducting proportion of debts, $290,463.25. The appellant then divided $6,207,385.07, the whole estate, by $290,463.25, the agreed net value of the British Columbia property, the quotient being 21.3496. Then to ascertain the duty payable he divides the first $100,000 by 21.3496, which is $4,683.84, and 1 1\/2% on this sum is $70.24.\nThe same process for the next $100,000 at 2 1\/2% produces $117.09.\nThen the appellant deducts twice $4,683.84, i.e., $9,367.68, from the value of the property in British Columbia after deducting the proportion of the debts, viz.: $290,463.25, leaving $281,095.57, and upon this sum charges 5%, i.e., $14,054.77; the result being: first $100,000 at 1 1\/2%, $70.24; second $100,000 at 2 1\/2%, $117.09; the remainder, viz., $281,095.57, at 5%, $14,054.77. Total, $14,242.10.\nThe appellant strongly relies on the statutory definitions of \"aggregate value,\" and \"net value\" given above, and contends that when paragraph (c) of section 7 speaks of the \"net value\" exceeding $200,000, the \"net value\" referred to is the net value of the property both within and without the province. Even supposing this construction to be sound, the rule of paragraph (c) must nevertheless be followed, and the rate of taxation is 1 1\/2% on the first hundred thousand dollars, 2 1\/2% on the second hundred thousand dollars, and 5 per cent above the two hundred thousand dollars. The intention of the legislature is clearly shown by the amendment made in 1915 to section 7, which section, before this amendment, in the case of a succession of more than $200,000.00, required the payment of $5.00 on every $100.00 of the net value of the estate. The effect of the amendment was to charge, even in the case of a net value of more than $200,000.00, 1 1\/2per cent, on the first $100,000.00, 2 1\/2 per cent. on the next $100,000.00 and 5 per cent. on the excess over $200,000.00. Moreover, as stated, the subject of this taxation is \"all property situate within the province\" (see also subsection (a) of section 5) and unless the legislature be held to have intended to impose a tax on property outside the province, which it could not do, the property only which was situate within the province is taxed according to the scale indicated.\nCalculating therefore in conformity with this scale the succession duty on the sum of $290,463.25, agreed upon as the net value of the assets in British Columbia, the amount due is $8,523.16, as found by the two courts below.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Wm.

Tilley K.C. for appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This action is one brought to recover damages for non-acceptance by the defendants, appellants, of a quantity of woollen sweater yarn tendered by the plaintiffs under a contract, called throughout order 1788, for the sale by the plaintiffs to the defendants of 20,000 pounds of such yarn.\nThere is no dispute between the parties as to the facts and the single question argued at bar and to be disposed of on this appeal is whether an unequivocal and absolute written renunciation by the plaintiffs of their contract for the delivery of the yarn contained in a letter of the 2nd October, 1918, had been adopted by the defendants.\nOn the receipt of plaintiff\u2019s letter of renunciation the defendants\u2019 manager, Mr. Reed, gave instructions that the contract was to be marked \u201ccancelled\u201d on the defendants, records, and it was so marked, but no letter was written to plaintiffs notifying them that their renunciation of the contract had been accepted. The defendants had forwarded written instructions to the plaintiffs as to the shipping of the yarn dated the same day as the plaintiffs had sent their renunciation letter. The letter covering the shipping instructions sent by the defendants, and that embodying the renunciation by the latter of the contract crossed each other.\nThe plaintiffs, however, when they received these shipping instructions knew they must have been forwarded before the receipt by the defendants of the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of renunciation of the contract. After the 5th of October, when these crossing letters were received by the respective parties, one sending shipping orders, and the other renouncing the contract, there were no further communications between them respecting this yarn now in dispute, being order No. 1788, until December 10, 1918, when portions of the yarn were offered for delivery to the defendants, and were refused. But it does not seem to me that this subsequent offer materially affected the legal position of the parties.\nThe contention on the part of the appellants was that the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 2nd October, 1918, being an unequivocal and absolute refusal to carry out contract 1788, was received and adopted by the defendants, who at once cancelled the order in their records. They further contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure afterwards to deliver the 4,000 pounds of spot yarn, immediately on receipt of shipping instructions, and the first monthly instalment of 2,000 pounds within a month after receipt of shipping instructions, was evidence that they were aware the defendants had accepted their repudiation.\nThe question then, it seems to me, in every such case must be whether under the proved facts adoption of one party to a contract of its repudiation by the other party may be inferred from the proved facts, or whether an actual notice of acceptance or adoption must be given by the party receiving notice of the repudiation to the party repudiating.\nIt seems to me from reading the authorities that such an actual notice of acceptance or adoption is not necessary but that adoption may be reasonably inferred from all the circumstances as proved. It would, of course, have been better business on the part of the defendants to have acknowledged and accepted plaintiffs\u2019 letter of renunciation, but that they as a fact did accept it is proved by the evidence of their having cancelled the order in their records. Then, what view did plaintiffs entertain on the crucial point of their repudiation having been accepted? Undoubtedly they fully understood and believed it had been, as the evidence of Gordon Geddes clearly shows. He says at page 10:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Now did you receive any reply to your letter of October 2nd?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Then what did you do?\nA.\u2014Well, I waited about three weeks, as near as I can recall, and was firmly convinced\u2014I waited what I thought was a reasonable time\u2014and felt Mr. Reed was taking our letter as final, and the order would be cancelled.\nIt is true, he afterwards changed his mind, for reasons best known to himself, without giving defendants any notice, or inquiring from them whether they were satisfied with his renunciation of the contract or not.\nHowever, we have here the explicit evidence of the letter of renunciation; its receipt by the defendant; the cancelling of the order in its books, and the firm conviction sworn to by the renouncing party that the contract was at an end. No notice of any kind was sent by the plaintiffs of their desire or intention to withdraw their renunciation while, as a matter of fact, they failed to deliver or offer delivery of two instalments of yarn which the contract specifically called for, namely 5,000 pounds as soon as reasonably possible after the 5th October, and 2,000 pounds which should have been forwarded about the 5th of November. In my judgment, the fair inference which should be drawn from all these proved facts is that the contract had been put an end to by consent and assent of both parties. I can see little difference between writing an adoption of the renunciation on the letter containing it, or directing the cancellation of the contract renounced in the records of the party receiving the renunciation. In either case, it is some evidence of adoption of the renunciation, and a letter to the renouncing party, though a prudent and businesslike course, is not an essential necessary to complete the adoption in cases where facts proved allow of a fair inference of acceptance of renunciation being drawn.\nThe law in cases of this kind is laid down by Lord Esher in giving judgment in the case of Johnstone v. Milling[2], at page 467, as follows:\u2014\nAccordingly the defendant has recourse to the doctrine laid down in several cases cited, the best known of which is perhaps the case of Hochster v. De la Tour[3]. In those cases the doctrine relied on has been expressed in various terms more or less accurately; but I think that in all of them the effect of the language used with regard to the doctrine of anticipatory breach of contract is that a renunciation of a contract, or, in other words, a total refusal to perform it by one party before the time for performance arrives, does not, by itself, amount to a breach of contract but may be so acted upon and adopted by the other party as a rescission of the contract as to give an immediate right of action. When one party assumes to renounce the contract, that is, by anticipation refuses to perform it, he thereby, so far as he is concerned declares his intention then and there to rescind the contract, because one party to a contract cannot by himself rescind it, but by wrongfully making such a renunciation of the contract he entitles the other party, if he pleases, to agree to the contract being put an end to subject to the retention by him of his right to bring an action in respect of such wrongful rescission. The other party may adopt such renunciation of the contract by so acting upon it as in effect to declare that he too treats the contract as at an end, except for the purpose of bringing an action upon it for the damages sustained by him in consequence of such renunciation. He cannot, however, himself proceed with the contract on the footing that it still exists for other purposes, and also treat such renunciation as an immediate breach. If he adopts the renunciation, the contract is at an end for the purpose of the action for wrongful renunciation; if he does not wish to do so, he must wait for the arrival of the time when in the ordinary course a cause of action on the contract would arise. He must elect which course he will pursue. Such appears to me to be the only doctrine recognized by the law with regard to anticipatory breach of contract. I accept this extract as correctly stating the law on the subject which I think applicable to this present appeal. I find that the reasonable and necessary inference from the proved facts is that the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of repudiation of 2nd October, never withdrawn or qualified by them, had been adopted and acted upon by the defendants and the contract put an end to by mutual assent. See also Frost v. Knight[4].\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Mr. Gordon Geddes, a member of the respondent firm, tells that they were carrying on, in Sarnia, Ontario, a retail dry goods and woollen business as well as jobbing when he, in the early part of August, 1918, went to Washington to solicit orders from the appellant \u201cfor wool, knitting yarn.\u201d\nHe met, on that occasion, Mr. Reed, an associate director of the Bureau of Purchases for the appellant, and they agreed on terms for two orders to be sent respondent.\nOne order was to be for sock yarn, which is now, save incidentally in its results as shedding light on the course of the business, out of the question raised herein.\nThe other was to be yarn for knitting sweaters. That was, pursuant to the agreement reached orally, forwarded on the 14th August, 1918, to respondent. It was numbered and will be referred to herein as number 1788.\nTo induce the giving of it, Mr. Gordon Geddes had represented that respondents had on hand, ready for shipment, 4,000 pounds of the desired quality. The order No. 1788, so forwarded by appellant specified 20,000 pounds at a price of $1.80, delivery 4,000 pounds at once, and 2,000 pounds a month. Shipping instructions to be given later\u2014and to ship, freight collect, f.o.b. Sarnia.\nPresumably this was received in due course by mail a couple of days later.\nThe first response was dated 24th August, 1918, and so far as related to order No. 1788 was as follows:\u2014\nRe your Order No. W1788 for 20,000 lbs. knitting yarn.\nWe regret to say there is some doubt about our ability to fill this order.\nThe 4,000 lbs. spot yarn was sold and delivered to the American Red Cross at this same price prior to receipt of your order, and the mill from whom we bought this yarn claims they are unable to deliver the balance.\nWe will make every effort to secure this delivery, and will force the issue at once, and if we receive all or any part of it, will deliver it as per your order.\nOn 26th September, 1918, the appellant wrote as follows:\nSarnia, Canada,\nSept. 26, 1918.\nMessrs. Geddes Bros.,\nSarnia, Canada.\nGentlemen:\u2014\nWe write you in reference to order numbers W 1787, calling for 35,000 pounds of worsted yarn, and order W 1788, calling for 20,000 pounds of woollen yarn.\nWe received your letter of August 26th, and do not understand your letter, and we will expect this yarn delivered as contracted with us.!\nI would ask you to wire at once how much of this yarn can be shipped immediately, and when contract can be completed as we are issuing shipping instructions now on all the yarn we have purchased and wish to know just when we can count on delivery.\nBe sure to wire on receipt of this letter, and oblige,\nRespectfully yours,\nEdward T. Reed,\nAssociate Director,\nBureau of Purchases. And on 2nd October, as follows:\u2014\nWashington, D.C.,\nOct. 2nd, 1918.\nGeddes Bros.,\nSarnia, Canada.\nGentlemen:\u2014\nReferring to your letter of September, 25th, we will say that complete shipping instructions are being sent you for order No. Washington 1787 and 1788, and we will be glad if prompt shipments can be made on both these orders.\nRespectfully yours,\nEdward T. Reed,\nAssociate Director,\nBureau of Purchases.\nThat was accompanied by the following shipping instructions relative to No. 1788:\u2014\nTo Geddes Brothers,\nSarnia, Canada.\nPlease ship the following to addresses specified below.

Reed,\nFor Director, Bureau of Purchases.\nI can find no letter of 25th September, 1918, in the case, or explanation relative thereto.\nThe letter of 2nd October, 1918, crossed in the mail the following from respondents:\u2014 Sarnia, Canada,\nOct. 2nd, 1908.\nMr. Edward T. Reed,\nc\/o American Red Cross, Bureau of Purchases,\nNational Headquarters, Washington, D.C.\nDear Sir:\nReplying to your favour of the 26th inst., we wired you to-day as per your request, and enclose confirmation herewith. Regarding your order, No. 1787, for 35,000 pounds of worsted yarn, we expect to be able to deliver this complete, and as we stated to you in our telegram, have approximately 6,000 pounds ready for immediate delivery, which we are holding until we receive shipping instructions from you.\nRegarding your order No. 1788, for 20,000 pounds of woollen yarn at $1.80, it will be impossible for us to deliver this as the mills are not able to make it, they state, on account of having government orders which require their whole attention.\nAt the time this order was taken, i.e., August 14th, Mr. Geddes pointed out to you that there was a possibility that it might not be possible for us to fill these orders complete, and we believe the circumstances were outlined to you at that time. We wrote you on August 26th, explaining just what we would be able to do in reference to these orders and as we received no reply, we presumed you understood the situation.\nWe greatly regret, naturally, that we are not able to fill this order, but it is something over which we have no control, and we trust that under the circumstances you will consider this entirely satisfactory.\nYours very truly,\nGeddes Bros.\nNo such telegram is in the case, nor is there any telegram from respondents as requested by appellant\u2019s letter of 26th September, 1918.\nThe appellant, on receipt of the letter, marked in their books that the order No. 1788 was cancelled; but, evidently, in absence of such telegram as requested and through pressure of work, omitted to write or wire such cancellation had been made.\nNothing more, however, was heard, in regard thereto, by appellant, until the 10th day of December, 1918, when they received from Bates & Bates notification of a shipment by them from Montreal account respondents. The correct inference of cancellation agreed to had, however, been properly drawn as appears from the evidence of said Gordon Geddes who testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. Then what did you do? A. Well, I waited three weeks, as near as I can recall, and was firmly convinced\u2014I waited what I thought was a reasonable time\u2014and felt Mr. Reed was taking our letter as final, and the order would be cancelled. After I waited a certain length of time I began to get worried about it, and having the last two exhibits in my mind, I felt perfectly satisfied that Mr. Reed would force us to deliver that yarn. I got busy and canvassed the jobbing trade, and places we did not usually expect to get yarn in that quantity. I covered London, Toronto, and finally got to Montreal.\nQ. With what result? A. I found some small quantity at Duncan Bell\u2019s, at a high price, and I thoroughly covered all the jobbing houses there and located another small quantity through Mclntyre, Son & Company, also at a high price.\nHe drew the correct inference but failed to telegraph the fact though he had been, as appears above, urged to do so by the letter of appellant of 26th September, above quoted, which the respondents must have received four or five days before wiring as desired.\nI am unable to reconcile with any sense of fair dealing such conduct on his part.\nInstead of doing as they should have done they changed their minds. I suspect by reason of their omission to fairly consider the whole correspondence and act accordingly, that the true reason for change of mind was not any worry about what Mr. Reed would do, but a change of market more favourable to them, six weeks later.\nIt hardly lies in the mouth of one so failing himself to act and answer promptly to complain of another he so treated doing the same. Had they done so on receipt of the letter of 26th September, in all probability we never would have had the confusion presented by the crossing letters of the 2nd October or, I venture to think, this lawsuit. Yet the basis of the argument in the way of excusing the respondents\u2019 conduct in first repudiating their contract, making, pursuant to such repudiation, default from month to month and then suddenly turning round and tendering goods in pretended fulfilment of it, is that the appellant had failed to answer a letter.\nMoreover the argument overlooks the fact that respondents had, by their letter of 24th August, 1918, which I quoted above, assured the appellant that they would make every effort to secure this delivery and would force the issue at once, etc., etc. What effort then made to carry out the said promise does not appear.\nIt certainly does not appear a very solid basis upon which to rest such an argument when they kept appellant waiting a whole month to hear the result of such assurances as said letter contained.\nAnd when they got the letter of 26th September from appellant referring thereto insisting upon due fulfilment of their contract, instead of pleading for forbearance they tell appellant that this one is absolutely impossible of fulfilment.\nIf that is not an absolute repudiation of it, what would be? Must we have violent and ill-natured words used to render repudiation effective?\nIndeed it is fairly arguable on the evidence that the respondents never had become bound and this letter was a distinct refusal to become so and hence nothing more to be said. They doubtless hoped for generous treatment, and got it by the actual cancellation.\nThe other contract got from appellant, at same time, and by virtue of the same soliciting effort, and which in a close sense, as to giving of orders for shipment, and all else ran concurrently with that now in question, has been fulfilled or adjusted in a common sense fashion. They were grouped together in the correspondence up to the point when the respondents said they found that one now in question impossible of fulfilment, and then much correspondence continued relative only to the other. It evidently was assumed by both parties that that alleged contract had ended.\nThe respondents must have been much more dense than I take them to be if they did not infer and clearly understand under all the foregoing circumstances that their abandonment or repudiation of the other order now in question had been assented to by appellant.\nThere were half a dozen shipments under 1787, and all implied therein relative to that contract recognized it as on foot; and most of these before the appellant had ever heard of anything to suggest that the respondents pretended that they were assuming appellant recognized the order now in question as being on foot and in force.\nHow could respondents imagine that appellant during all that time and under such circumstances was distinguishing thus its treatment of one contract and ignoring its twin, unless by reason of assent to the respondent\u2019s renunciation.\nOn November 6th appellant wrote respondents asking how fast shipments will be made on Order No. 1787, but made no reference to any claim under order No. 1788, now in question.\nSeeing this was but a few days after Mr. Geddes had, as he professes, begun to get worried lest he might be called upon to fill the Order No. 1788, it seems very remarkable he did not cease worrying or ask how it came about that appellant seemed only concerned as to order No. 1787. Indeed he carefully abstained, after the 2nd October, 1918, from ever referring to the matter of order No. 1788 in any communications he had with appellant.\nInstead of worrying about being possibly liable to be called on for delivery thereunder, a careful study of all the evidence leads me to interpret his conduct early in November as the result of a treacherous intention to take advantage, if he could safely, of the omission, on the appellant\u2019s part, to formally assent by letter to the repudiation of respondents.\nThe numerous cases cited by the respective authors and editors of Benjamin on Sales, and Blackburn on Sales, relative to contracts for delivery by instalments, fail to disclose anything like a parallel to the features of this case. And those cited in argument fail to fit these peculiar features.\nWe have, however, as the result of much discussion, the opinions of many eminent judges on the question of what may constitute such a renunciation as to relieve the other party to the contract.\nI accept that expressed by Lord Coleridge in the case of Freeth v. Burr[5], at page 213, as follows:\u2014\nIn cases of this sort, where the question is whether the one party is set free by the action of the other, the real matter for consideration is whether the acts or conduct of the one do or do not amount to an intimation of an intention to abandon and altogether to refuse performance of the contract. I say this in order to explain the ground upon which I think the decisions in these cases must rest. There has been some conflict amongst them. But I think it may be taken that the fair result of them is as I have stated, viz., that the true question is whether the acts and conduct of the party evince an intention no longer to be bound by the contract. Now, non-payment on the one hand, or non-delivery on the other, may amount to such an act, or may be evidence for a jury of an intention wholly to abandon the contract and set the other party free. Apply this to the terms of the respondents\u2019 letter declaring it absolutely impossible to fulfil the contract as interpreted by both himself and Mr. Reed, and the fact that the latter did accept and cancel the contract and the conduct of respondents in accord with that assumption, and I think we have a safe guide which leads to the conclusion that respondents are not entitled to recover.\nThe appellant could not on the facts disclosed have recovered anything for any breach of contract.\nOn these grounds alone the appellant is entitled to succeed herein.\nBut, beyond all that and the relevant law I cite as to one aspect of the case, there is to my mind clear and convincing evidence to be inferred from the steps taken by and the conduct of both parties, that there was a well understood mutual rescission of any contract that by any possible conception of the facts may have existed.\nMoreover there seems no ground whatsoever upon which to rest the judgment recognizing a right to insist on delivery of the goods after the times specified in the contract.\nIf the times fixed thereby are to be observed, then the time for delivery as to the first 4,000 pounds was on the 14th August, subject always, of course, to the shipping order and by the time that had been given in the letter of 2nd October, the time had then elapsed for immediate shipment of at least 6,000 pounds, and for another 2,000 pounds before respondents had thought of buying a single pound to ship.\nI am unable to understand how in any view of the facts the respondents could claim any rights as to these early instalments, whatever might be said as to the later instalments on another view of the facts than I hold. And as to these later instalments if the contract could be held on foot, that would seem to have been ended and reduced to a question of damages by the frank declaration of appellant that it could take no further deliveries and must submit to compensation in cases where the contract still in force.\nAn armistice having been declared on the 11th November, 1918, the appellant made an appeal to all those who had sold it goods to cancel their contracts and adjust on an equitable basis.\nThat to the respondents, dated 27th November, 1918, reads as follows:\u2014\nWashington, D.C.,\nNovember 27th, 1918.\nGeddes Brothers,\nSarnia, Ontario, Canada.\nIn Re: Order Washington 1787.\nGentlemen:\u2014\nOn November 20th the War Council of the American Red Cross sent you the following telegram:\u2014\n\u201cIn view of the signing of the armistice the needs of the Red Cross for merchandise have been very much reduced. We would appreciate it therefore if you would be willing to cancel on an equitable basis such part of our contract with you as has not already been shipped. Will you be good enough to advise us if you will assist us in this matter?\nWar Council, American Red Cross.\u201d\nWe have have not as yet heard from you in reference to this telegram and we hope very much that you will be able, on an equitable basis, to do something in the way of cancellation of unshipped part of order.\nI will be in Washington the first four days of next week, and will appreciate, very much, if you could take the matter up with me then.\nRespectfully yours,\nEdward T. Reed,\nAssociate Director. Bureau of Purchases. And to that respondents replied as follows:\u2014\nSarnia, Canada,\nDec. 2, 1918.\nMr. Edward T. Reed, Associate Director,\nBureau of Purchases, American Red Cross,\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Sir:\nWe have your letter of November 27th, and beg to state that we did not receive telegram from the War Council of the American Red Cross. Your letter is the first intimation that you desire to cancel the balance of your order.\nWe suggest that you outline to us the basis on which you desire us to accept said cancellation, and we will do anything possible to meet you.\nYours very truly,\nGeddes Bros., per Gordon G. Geddes.\nAnd then appellant made a special appeal to respondents by the letter of 5th December, 1918, as follows:\u2014\nDecember 5, 1918.\nGeddes Brothers,\nSarnia, Ontario, Canada.\nIn Re: Order Washington No. 1787.\nGentlemen:\u2014\nWe are in receipt of your letter of December 2nd and have wired you as per enclosed \u201cconfirmation telegram.\u201d We would like to have you accept cancellation for the unshipped portion of this order, as you know, owing to the present conditions the needs of the Red Cross have been very greatly lessened and we are not in position to use the supplies of yarn we have on hand and bought. This yarn was not bought for business purposes, and we are not in position to, and should not, throw a lot of yarn on the market, and we have asked firms to accept cancellation.\nWe have been very much pleased with the manner in which practically all of the firms, having orders from us, have accepted cancellation, and we certainly hope that you can do the same. We believe you appreciate, fully, the situation and the facts that the Red Cross is not organized, and should not be organized to dispose of merchandise, and we hope that you can accept cancellation of the unfilled portion of this order and relieve us of this amount of yarn. In reference to this cancellation you will remember that we placed an order with you\u2014No. 1788, for 20,000 pounds of yarn and had entered into this contract in good faith with you, and you cancelled this order\u2014and without making any trouble in regard to it, we accepted this cancellation on your part although we had grounds for demanding the delivery of this yarn, and we hope that you will go over this matter carefully and Consider it from every side.\nI will appreciate it if you could advise me by wire, promptly, as to what you will do in the matter.\nRespectfully yours,\nAssociate Director,\nBureau of Purchases.\nThat of the 27th November, and this, of course, was an appeal in respect of order No. 1787, and so recognized by the respondents\u2019 reply to the former. They made no allusion to order No. 1788, and no reply to this later one.\nMeantime respondents were assiduously working away through Bates & Bates, to get ready to tender goods under order 1788.\nThe goods had not yet been shipped or delivered f.o.b. as nominated in the bond. And they never were so. The contract provided for the delivery at Sarnia, f.o.b., and that term never was departed from, but unfortunately escaped the observation of the court below or I imagine we never would have been troubled with this appeal.\nI, therefore, fail to see how respondents are entitled to recover by virtue of a tender at a place other than that specified in the contract, and never named or dreamed of.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and the action dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am unable to agree with the conclusion at which the Appellate Division arrived. I do not find it necessary to pass any opinion upon the point whether the seller, having made default in delivery of part of the goods, the subject of a sale in which delivery is to be made by instalments, and such default in itself either constitutes sufficient evidence of an intention of the party to abandon the contract, or is accompanied by a declaration on his part to that effect, it is necessary that the buyer must notify his intention to concur in the abandonment of the contract before tender by the seller of delivery of an instalment deliverable at a later date.\nThere are two grounds upon which, in my opinion, the respondent\u2019s action fails.\nFirst: The basis upon which the parties entered upon their agreement was, I think, the fact, which the appellants believed upon the representation of the respondents, that they had 4,000 pounds of yarn ready for immediate delivery; and the delivery of that quantity of yarn forthwith upon the receipt of shipping instructions was, I think, an essential term of the contract breach of which invested the appellants with the right to treat the contract as no longer binding upon them, and I see nothing whatever in the course of events as divulged by the evidence which could be successfully relied upon by the respondents as depriving the appellants of their right to declare their election after the tender of delivery by the respondents.\nSecondly: It is abundantly shown that the respondents quite plainly declared their intention not to fulfil the terms of the contract, and that they interpreted the conduct of the appellants as expressing an intention on their part to concur in that abandonment. I think that was a perfectly reasonable interpretation to put upon the appellants\u2019 conduct when viewed by the respondents as a whole including the pressing communications of the 26th September, and the 2nd of October, followed by the silence which succeeded the despatch of the respondents\u2019 letter of the latter date. That was a perfectly reasonable interpretation and was the interpretation upon which the respondents continued to act until circumstances arose which seemed to offer them more favourable prospects in another direction. It is equally clear that the appellants intended to acquiesce in the abandonment of the contract by the respondents. We have here, then, a declared intention to abandon on part of the seller and a concurrence in fact on the other side accompanied by conduct which was treated by the seller as evidencing such concurrence.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts out of which this litigation has arisen are fully stated in the judgments delivered by Mr. Justice Rose and in the Appellate Division[6]. After much consideration and not a little hesitation\u2014the latter due largely to the respect in which I hold the opinion of the learned trial judge unanimously affirmed by the Divisional Court\u2014I have reached the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\nAlthough the defendants have pleaded that the acceptance of their order by the plaintiffs was conditional\u2014and this would seem to have been the position taken by the plaintiffs in their letters of the 24th of August and the 2nd of October\u2014the evidence puts it beyond reasonable doubt that the sending of the order itself was an unconditional written acceptance or confirmation of acceptance by the defendants of an oral proposal made by the plaintiffs, which had probably been orally accepted by the defendants when made, and that there was in fact a firm contract in the terms of that order. Parol evidence adduced to show that the definite terms of delivery clearly specified were not intended to bind the plaintiffs, but that they were entitled to deliver the wool contracted for as speedily as it could be procured, was, I think, inadmissible. The real question on this branch of the case is whether the contract was rescinded\u2014whether the conduct of the parties was such that the proper inference from it is mutual rescission, or whether the plaintiffs so acted as to justify the defendants in declining to carry out the contract when they did.\nThere is no reason for not fully accepting the view, which I gather prevailed in the trial court and on appeal, that both the plaintiffs and the defendants acted throughout in entire good faith. That of the defendants is not impugned and the fact that the plaintiffs made purchases at the beginning of November, before there was any material decline in prices, to enable them to carry out their contract would seem sufficient to establish that they were also acting bon\u00e2 fide. The defendants believed the contract was put an end to by the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 2nd of October; the plaintiffs early in November believed that it was still on foot and that they might be held to performance.\nBut it must be at least equally clear that both parties were sadly lacking in ordinary business diligence. A letter written by either of them to the other within a reasonable time after the receipt of the letters of the 2nd of October, 1918, which crossed, such as ordinary prudence would seem to have required from each, would have prevented the situation now existing from which serious loss must inevitably fall on one or the other. If the case should be viewed purely as one of anticipatory breach effected by the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 2nd of October intimating that they could not supply the yarn for which they had contracted, I should have agreed that the defendants could not succeed because of their failure to communicate by word or act their election to accept this declaration as a renunciation of the contract and to treat the attitude of the plaintiffs as having put an end to it. Scarfe v. Jardine[7], at pages 360, 361; Johnstone v. Milling[8], at pages 469, 471; Ewart on Waiver Distributed, pp. 89 and 95. The first intimation of acceptance is found in defendant\u2019s letter of the 5th of December. Long before that letter was written the plaintiffs had changed their position in the belief that they were still bound by their contract.\nBut, in my opinion, the subsequent conduct of the parties is in this case of paramount importance and, as put by Lord Coleridge C.J., in Freeth v. Burr[9], at page 213, \u201cthe real question for consideration\u201d is whether, having regard to the terms of the contract and viewed in the light of the plaintiffs\u2019 letters of the 24th of August and the 2nd of October, their subsequent inaction and silence\ndo not amount to an intimation of an intention to abandon and altogether to refuse performance of the contract * * * (do not) evince an intention no longer to be bound by the contract.\nAfter referring to this passage from Lord Coleridge\u2019s judgment with approval in Mersey Steel and Iron Co. v. Naylor, Benzon & Co.[10], the Earl of Selborne L.C., adds, at pp. 439 and 440: It appears to me according to the authorities and according to sound reason and principle that the parties might have so conducted themselves as to release each other from the contract, and that one party might have so conducted himself as to leave it at the option of the other party to relieve himself from a future performance of the contract The question is whether the facts here justify that conclusion.\nThe same extract from the judgment of Lord Coleridge was again accepted as stating \u201cthe true test\u201d by Lord Collins in General Bill Posting Company v. Atkinson[11], at page 122.\nNow what was the conduct of the parties material to the question at issue? Having intimated by their letter of the 2nd of October that they would be unable to fulfil their contract, the plaintiffs made default in delivering 4,000 pounds of yarn which, according to its terms, should have been shipped as soon as reasonably possible after the 5th of October, when shipping instructions reached them, and they again made default in shipping the first monthly instalment of 2,000 pounds which should have been put in transit about the 5th of November. No explanation was made by them of these failures to carry out the contract and no complaint or demand for delivery came from the defendants. Indeed both parties acted as if the contract had ceased to exist\u2014as if the defendants were acquiescing in the plaintiffs\u2019 request to be relieved from it and in their treating it as abandoned.\nMeantime deliveries were being made by the plaintiffs upon, and correspondence took place in regard to, another order for yarn (No. 1787) placed with them by the defendants at the same time as the order now in question (No. 1788). This state of affairs continued down to the 10th of December. No doubt the plaintiffs made successful efforts to obtain the yarn during the month of November. But because uncom- municated to and unknown by the defendants, except as indicative of their honesty of purpose and as establishing a change of position which precluded subsequent acceptance of their letter of the 2nd of October as an anticipatory breach, those purchases are quite as irrelevant to the issue to be determined as is the defendants\u2019 entry in their own books of the cancellation of contract No. 1788 on receipt of the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 2nd of October. Although in a letter written on the 5th of December in regard to contract No. 1787, the defendants state that the plaintiffs had cancelled contract No. 1788 and that they (the defendants) had accepted that cancellation without making any trouble about it, it was not until the 10th of December that the defendants were apprised of any departure by the plaintiffs from the attitude of inability to fulfil the latter contract intimated in their letter of the 2nd of October and of their intention to carry it out.\nWhile the defendants cannot be heard to aver that the contract now in question was terminated by their uncommunicated acceptance of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration of inability to carry it out and acquiescence in its thus being put an end to, the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent failure to deliver the instalments due in October and November, although possibly not such non\u2011performance as would per se justify rescission by the defendants, viewed in the light of their letter of the 2nd of October in my opinion\namounted to an intimation of an intention to abandon and altogether to refuse performance * * * evinced an intention no longer to be bound by the contract,\nand this, as Lord Selborne puts it, gave the defendants the option\nto relieve themselves from a further performance of the contract. See also Millar\u2019s Karri v. Weddel[12], at page 129, per Bigham J.; Cornwall v. Hensen[13], at page 303, per Collins L.J.; Bloomer v. Bernstein[14]. That option they promptly exercised by rejecting on its arrival the first yarn shipped to them by the plaintiffs\u2019 agents and by writing their letters of the 10th of December, on receipt of the first invoice, to the plaintiffs and their agents, Messrs. Bates & Bates, respectively.\nThe principle of the decision in Morgan v. Bain[15], I think, applies and governs. That was the converse case of tender of price and demand for performance by a purchaser who, after he had notified his insolvency to the vendor, had allowed the dates specified for delivery of two instalments to pass without protest, and without any offer to pay the price on delivery or any demand for explanation. On receipt of his subsequent demand of delivery the vendor promptly repudiated any obligation on the ground that the contract had been put an end to. The notice of insolvency did not terminate the contract but gave to the subsequent failure to deliver and to the absence of protest from the purchasers and of tender of price by them a significance as evidence of abandonment which they would not otherwise have had.\nSo here the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 2nd of October, while ineffectual to put an end to the contract because acceptance of it was not communicated and although it should be regarded, as the plaintiffs now contend, not as an intimation of abandonment or refusal to perform but merely as a request to be relieved from the obligations of the contract, gave to the subsequent non-delivery by them and to the defendants\u2019 silence in regard thereto a significance as indicative of a deter- mination to renounce the contract that they might otherwise have lacked. From the non\u2011delivery under the circumstances the defendants had a right to conclude that the plaintiffs had abandoned their contract and, if they did so conclude, to abandon it themselves. Their announcement that they regarded the contract as at an end by their letters written as soon as they had the first intimation of the plaintiffs\u2019 intention to treat it as still subsisting and to carry it out was, I think, a sufficient exercise of the option which the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct had given them to decline performance, notwithstanding that those letters were written on the erroneous assumption that the acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal from the contract on the 2nd of October, entered in their books, though unnotified, had already terminated it.\nTreating the notice of insolvency in the Morgan Case[16], as practically of the same legal value as the unaccepted notice of inability to perform in the case at bar (Tolhurst v. Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers[17], at page 671) the material circumstances of the two cases are scarcely distinguishable. In both there was non-delivery of two instalments, silence in regard to the defaults and equally prompt repudiation when the party who had given the notice subsequently sought to treat the contract as still subsisting and enforceable. If not (as I incline to think it may be) a case of termination by mutual abandonment, as put by Keating J., in Morgan\u2019s Case16\u2014the view of that case also taken by Jessel M.R., in In re Phoenix Bessemer Steel Co.[18], at page 114\u2014we have here a case of conduct of the vendors warranting an inference of intention to renounce, and an exercise by the purchasers of the option to withdraw thus afforded them, which seems to have been the ground of decision of Lord Coleridge in Morgan v. Bain16.\nMoreover, in order to succeed in this action, the plaintiffs must prove delivery or tender of delivery in accordance with the terms of the contract. Under those terms delivery of six or at the most eight thousand pounds of yarn had fallen due at the beginning of December. The amount shipped was 10,332 pounds. The contract provided that delivery should be made in monthly instalments of 2,000 pounds each, commencing a month after the first \u201cspot\u201d delivery of 4,000 pounds. Such stipulations in mercantile contracts are not negligible. Bowes v. Shand[19], at pages 465-6, per Cairns L.C. While not disposed to attach much importance to the fact that the shipment was made from Montreal instead of from Sarnia, since any difference in freight rates would be readily adjustable, I question the sufficiency of the tender of over 10,000 pounds actually made by the plaintiffs early in December to support the averment of performance essential to their claim. Hoare v. Rennie[20].\nIt would rather shock one\u2019s sense of what is just and fair between man and man if, upon the state of facts presented in this case, the purchasers should be legally bound to accept and pay for the goods in question, notwithstanding the vendor\u2019s early intimation of their inability to carry out their contract, their subsequent undoubted default in delivery of at least two instalments (nearly one-third of the whole) and the complete change in circumstances brought about by the armistice. The conclusion that they are not so bound is therefore all the more satisfactory. I do not find in the circumstances enough to warrant a departure from the ordinary practice that costs throughout should follow the event.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014This case possesses some features which render it rather a hard one for the appellant, but that is certainly no reason why perfectly settled legal principles should not be applied regardless of the hardship entailed thereby, and for the existence of which the appellant is not without blame. Nevertheless these features have received my very serious consideration, for the question, as it is now presented to this court, is, in final analysis, whether the conduct of the respondents has been such as to deprive them of recourse under the contract which they admittedly made with the appellant for the sale to the latter of 20,000 pounds of Oxford woollen yarn under order No. 1788.\nAdmitting the existence of a valid contract, the letter of the respondents of October 2nd, 1918, was either a request to be freed from their contractual obligations, a request which was not granted, or an anticipatory breach of their contract.\nTaking it to be an anticipatory breach of contract, it gave the appellant the option either to insist on the performance of the contract or to take the repudiation of the respondents as a definite breach and treat the contract as rescinded. For obviously one contracting party cannot of his own will and without the assent of the other rescind a valid contract. Obviously also this option required due notice to the respondents of the choice made by the appellant.\nAs far as the appellant is concerned there was, after the anticipatory breach, no valid exercise of this option. The appellant did not answer the respond- ents\u2019 letter of October 2nd, but made an entry of cancellation of order No. 1788 in its books, which, not being notified to the respondents, could not operate as an exercise of its option or as a rescission of the contract.\nSo far there can be no difficulty. But it is now argued that the subsequent conduct of the respondents and their failure, after receiving the shipping instructions of the appellant, also dated the 2nd of October, 1918, to make shipments according to the terms of the order, 4,000 pounds at once and 2,000 pounds per month, and their silence until December when the shipments in question were made and notice thereof given to the appellant, amounted to an abandonment of the contract disentitling the respondents to ship the yarn in December and claim payment from the appellant.\nA careful examination of the record has convinced me that this issue of abandonment\u2014as distinguished from the question whether the anticipatory breach of the respondents and their failure to make deliveries in time had relieved the appellant from liability under the contract\u2014was not submitted to the courts below. In the appellant\u2019s plea the ground taken is: 1. That the respondents had repudiated the contract and that thereafter the appellant treated the same as terminated, and purchased other yarn to take the place of the yarn which it had intended to purchase from the respondents, no proof of the latter statement having been made; 2. That the respondents made default in delivering the yarn within the time specified in the appellant\u2019s order and shipping instructions and consequently there was no effective tender of delivery by the respondents under the alleged contract. These two grounds were also taken in the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Division as follows:\u2014 3. If there was a concluded contract between the parties the plaintiffs\u2019 letter to the defendants of 14th August, 1918, was a repudiation thereof and such repudiation continued until after the expiration of the time for delivery under the terms of such contract.\n4. If there was a concluded contract between the parties and no effective repudiation thereof the plaintiffs did not make deliveries within the times specified in such contract.\nIn view of the issue thus presented to the courts below, we have not the benefit of an express finding of the learned trial judge on the question whether there had been an abandonment of the contract by the respondents acquiesced in by the appellant, as distinguished from a rescission by reason of the anticipatory breach of the respondents and the acceptance thereof by the appellant. The issues really presented were decided by both courts below, and in my opinion rightly decided, adversely to the appellant, and it was held: 1, that the anticipatory breach of the contract gave to the appellant an option to treat the same as rescinded, but that the appellant never had signified to the respondents its intention that the contract should be treated as rescinded; 2, that (I take this in somewhat abbreviated form from the judgment of Mr. Justice Hodgins in the Appellate Division) time not having been made of the essence of the contract, the failure to deliver before December was an actual breach, which, if it went to the root of the contract, would merely entitle the appellant, if it saw fit, to treat the non-performance as a repudiation of the whole contract and to sue for damages.\nI cannot help thinking that the question whether the contract was by reason of the conduct of the parties abandoned by them, is entirely distinct from the two questions to which I have referred and which were really in issue. At all events, it is clear that the abandonment must have been concurred in by both parties, for both must agree to an abandonment as well as to a rescission, and an act of abandonment by one of them alone without acceptance or acquiescence by the other cannot effect the continued existence of the contract.\nI may add that the question of abandonment is essentially a question of fact, being an inference to be drawn from all the circumstances of each case, and decisions in particular cases, where it has been held that the circumstances warranted the presumption of abandonment, are of little assistance, unless the circumstances are the same, a coincidence which is hardly to be expected.\nI may now refer to the case of Morgan v. Bain[21], probably the nearest in point, which is cited in the appellant\u2019s factum. There a purchaser of pig-iron to be delivered in specified portions at fixed dates, became insolvent subsequently to the contract and notified the vendor of his insolvency. A petition was filed by the purchaser in the Bankruptcy Court whereupon a person was appointed to collect sums due and carry on the business. A meeting of creditors was held at which a composition at 5s. in the pound was agreed to. No mention was made of the contract in the statement of his affairs submitted by the purchaser, and no deliveries under the contract were made by the vendor at the determined dates. The price of iron having risen the purchaser, who had obtained fresh capital by forming a new partnership, demanded delivery tendering cash payment, but the vendor refused to deliver. It was held under these circumstances, on a special case stating the facts, that the purchaser had abandoned the contract, and that the vendor, by not making deliveries which had become due, assented to its rescission. After full consideration I think that the Morgan Case[22] cannot assist us here, the circumstances being different. The respondents had, it is true, declared on the 2nd of October, that they could not carry out the contract, but, on the same date, the appellant had written insisting on its performance. As matters then stood, under the authority of cases such as Frost v. Knight22, and Johnstone v. Milling[23], the appellant not having exercised its option to treat the contract as rescinded, on the contrary insisting on its performance, the respondents could subsequently carry it out notwithstanding their previous declaration that they would not do so. The only remaining material point is whether the respondents\u2019 subsequent failure to deliver before December and the absence of protest by the appellant, give rise to the presumption of abandonment of the contract by all the parties thereto. I think no such presumption arises here. The anticipatory breach of the respondents was caused by their failure to obtain yarn. Subsequently, fearing that notwithstanding their letter of October 2nd they would be held to make deliveries\u2014and the unretracted letters of the appellant dated September 26th and October 2nd, gave them every reason to believe this\u2014they made fresh inquiries for yarn and, in the beginning of November, secured it in Montreal at a price but little below the contract price, and the appellants\u2019 letter of December 5th was the first intimation to them that the appellant accepted cancellation of the order. There is no suggestion whatever that the respondents acted otherwise than in perfect good faith, and while it would have been more prudent no doubt to answer the appellant\u2019s letter of October 2nd, and thus clear up the matter,\u2014and the appellant itself was wanting in ordinary business caution in not answering the respondents\u2019 letter of the same date\u2014still I must find that the appellant\u2019s insistence on the performance of the contract fully justified the subsequent conduct of the respondent and that no presumption of abandonment by reason of delay in delivery can arise.\nOn the whole, I fully agree with the judgments of the courts below and my opinion is that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hanna, LeSueur & McKinley.\n[1] 47 Ont.

Idington J. contra.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting)\u2014Section 157 of the Criminal Code can only herein be held relevant to a peace officer or public officer as defined in the interpretation clause of the said code; and appellant was not acting within such definition but merely performing a duty of inspecting books under the \"Saskatchewan Temperance Act\", and reporting, which could have been discharged by any one. The offence in question was one against section 39 of the said \"Temperance Act\", and hence impliedly excluded by section 154 of the said code from falling within section 157 thereof.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of the trial court, with a jury, in the judicial district of Swift Current, in Saskatchewan. The accused appellant was indicted as follows : \"For that he, \u2026 with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice, did corruptly give to one \u2026 police officer a bribe \u2026 in order to induce (him) not to proceed against the said (accused) for violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act.\" The accused was found guilty by the jury but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of Appeal.\nThe question submitted in the reserved case stated by the trial judge and the circumstances of the case, are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nHarold Fisher for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was indicted in the King's Bench Judicial District of Swift Current, in Saskatchewan, as follows:\n\u2026\u2026For that he, the said Jacob Kalick, on the 20th of December, A.D. 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice did corruptly give to one Abraham Weder, a Police Officer, a bribe to wit\u2014the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) in order to induce the said Abraham Weder not to proceed against the said Jacob Kalick for violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act.\nOn this he was found guilty by the jury and thereupon the learned trial judge reserved for the Court of Appeal the following question:\u2014\nWas a bribe given in order to induce a Police Officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act, given with intent to interfere with the administration of justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code? The evidence and charge to the jury is hereto annexed. The majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal answered in the affirmative.\nThe dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Newlands which gives us, by virtue of section 1024 of the Criminal Code, the jurisdiction to hear an appeal therefrom, held that the offence disclosed by the evidence did not fall within said section 157 of the Criminal Code inasmuch as it was not specifically defined by the said Code as a crime, and was specifically provided for by the 39th section of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" under and by virtue whereof the officer in question was acting when alleged to have been bribed.\nThe section 39 of said Act reads as follows:\u2014\n39. 1. No police officer, policeman or constable shall, directly or indirectly, receive, take or have any money for reporting or not reporting any matter or thing connected with the administration of this Act, or for performing or omitting to perform his duty in that behalf, except the remuneration and allowances assigned him in virtue of his office by the Government of the Province.\n2. Any police officer, policeman or constable receiving, or any person offering money contrary to the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of $100 and in default of immediate payment, to imprisonment for three months.\nHe held that, inasmuch as Parliament has the exclusive jurisdiction of declaring what is, or may constitute a crime, and had only declared offences against provincial legislation to be crimes when and so far as falling within section 164 of the Criminal Code, which he held could not be so operative or effective as the circumstances in question herein required in order to maintain said conviction. That section reads as follows:\u2014\n164. Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse, disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any Legislature in Canada by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided by law. That, which is simply a re-enactment of the Criminal Code of 1892, seems, not only an express declaration of what (when merely resting upon disobedience of an Act of Parliament or of a legislature) is to constitute an indictable offence, but also to limit or restrict the indictable quality of the offence to something which is not within the reservation expressed by the term\nunless some penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided by law.\nThat enactment of the Criminal Code of 1892 was in substitution of 31 Vict. ch. 71, sec. 3, which was the earliest enactment of the Dominion Parliament giving the added strength of its enactment by virtue of the exclusive jurisdiction it had over criminal law, to help the enforcement of provincial legislation.\nAs I have always understood, the policy pursued in this regard has been to help the provincial legislation but to carefully abstain from trenching upon the provincial legislative powers, or wishes of the provincial legislators, as expressed by themselves relative to the sanctions to be imposed by provincial legislation.\nSuch being the case when we find any provincial legislative enactment containing an express sanction to secure its enforcement, its terms ought to be respected and be the limit in that regard.\nIt seems idle to take as our guide the vulgar idea of what may constitute a crime, when we have a much better guide in the history of the legislation emanating from Parliament as above outlined.\nThen turning to the details of what has to be considered in light thereof, we have, in section 2 of the Criminal Code, the definition and interpretation of the words \"Peace Officer\" and \"Public Officer\" which are used in the said section 157, now in question. Why should we go beyond these for the purposes of this case?\nThere certainly is nothing in the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" that seems to justify any departure from these respective definitions, nor in the code to render it imperative to expand either definition in relation to the particular officer in question herein.\nWhat were his duties? What office did he fill, under the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" which would render it fitting he should be looked upon as either a peace officer or a public officer within the meaning of section 157 of the Criminal Code, now in question?\nHe may have been in fact a peace officer, or worn the uniform of such, but the actual duty in question which he had to discharge was under the liquor department created under said Act to inspect the books which appellant, as a druggist, was bound by said law to keep as a vendor of liquor, and compare the incoming supply of liquors with the outgoings served from said supply, and the prescriptions authorizing sales, and report the result of such inspection and audit to his superior officer.\nAny man or woman sent by the liquor department to discharge such simple duty could have made just as good a report. It was not in any legal sense necessary to have sent a constable, or peace officer, or public officer, as defined by the code, to perform such a duty.\nAnd sending one apparently so decorated surely did not help to bring him within the meaning of section 157.\nThe evidence of Weder, the officer in question, tells the story as follows:\u2014 Q. What was the first conversation you had with him?\nA. When I came, into the drug store I asked for the record and Mr. Kalick gave them to me and I went back into the dispensary to do the work there.\nI sat down at the little table in the dispensary, Mr. Kalick came in and says \"listen here, I will give you $100.00 and you leave the books alone.\"\nI said I would not do that. I then went to work and started to check up the books and just before I was through Kalick came up again and asked me how I was getting along.\nI replied that I was of the opinion that he had to account for some shortage. He said, \"I will give you $500 and you leave the books alone,\" or rather, \"Fix up the books so that they will be all right.\"\nI said I did not know whether he would be short or not yet, that I was not through.\nAfter I was through checking up the books I found a shortage of liquor and I asked Mr. Kalick if he could account for the shortage and he did not say anything to that.\nSo then he offered me $1,000 to call the matter square, that is the way he put it.\nThis illuminates the story relative to the nature of the duties that were being discharged and the offence of the appellant.\nUnless we are to hold that the administration of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" and \"the administration of justice\" are synonymous terms, I fail to see how we can bring this offence, which the foregoing quotation and the remainder of the story unfold, assuming the strict interpretation of it as against the appellant, within the meaning of the indictment assumed to be founded upon section 157 in question.\nI have no doubt upon the facts interpreted as contended for against the appellant, and in the absence of legislation relevant thereto, that he might have been held to have offended at common law as suggested in the court below, or against section 39 of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act,\" I cannot see, even if the conviction herein stands, how the appellant could plead that, if prosecuted at common law or under said section 39 of said Act, in bar of such prosecution.\nThat seems to me not only the fair test, but the one which the law imperatively requires to maintain this conviction as founded on section 157.\nIn short I agree with Mr. Justice Newlands that the offence now in question disclosed by the evidence was, if interpreted against the appellant, clearly one against the above quoted section 39, s.s. 2, and hence impliedly excluded by section 164 of the Criminal Code from falling within section 157, now in question.\nMoreover, assuming there might, in the absence of special or specific legislation bearing on the question, have been found something offensive against the common law, it is not that we have to deal with but section 157. And I submit we must read that and section 164 together, and apply the law that fits the crime.\nI, therefore, am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nDuff J.\u2014The stated case is in these words:\u2014\nOn Feb. 5th, 1920, at Swift Current, the accused was found guilty by a jury on the charge: \"For that he, the said J. Kalick, on the 20th day of December, 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice, did corruptly give to one Abraham Weder, a police officer, a bribe, to wit: the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in order to induce the said Abraham Weder not to proceed against the said J. Kalick, for the violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act.\"\nThe question submitted for the opinion of the Court is:\nWas a bribe given in order to induce a Police Officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act, given with intent to interfere with the administration of justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code? It seems clear that giving a bribe to prevent prosecution for an offence is prima facie an interference with the administration of justice. Mr. Chrysler argues that it is not within those words in the context in which they appear in section 157 on two grounds:\n1. That the offence is specifically dealt with in those parts of the same section as well as in section 164 of the code and that the normal scope of the phrase must receive some restriction in consequence. I cannot perceive the application of sec. 164 and as to the other parts of section 157 they do not touch the case of accepting or giving a bribe for affording protection against a prosecution for an offence and that the facts proved established a case of giving a bribe for such a purpose is assumed in the question submitted.\n2. He argues that the application of the section is limited to offenders or persons supposed to be or suspected of being or fearing that they are offending against the criminal law strictly so called, that is to say, against the criminal law as falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. While the word \"crime\" in the Criminal Code generally speaking applies only to crimes strictly so called and probably has that restricted meaning in this section, I think there is nothing requiring us to limit the meaning of the words administration of justice in the way suggested.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The reserved case assumes that the defendant endeavoured to stifle a prosecution for a violation of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" by bribing a police officer, Was the bribe\ngiven with intent to interfere with the administration of justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code\nis the question propounded. In my opinion it was. It is quite immaterial whether the police officer actually intended or contemplated instituting a prosecution. It suffices that the appellant gave the bribe with intent to head off such a proceeding. The due administration of justice is interfered with quite as much by improperly preventing the institution of a prosecution as by corruptly burking one already begun.\nTwo contentions were pressed by Mr. Chrysler\u2014(a) that interference with a prosecution for a contravention of a provincial penal statute is not within the purview of section 157 of the code; and (b) that if any offence against that section was committed it was that of bribing a police officer\nto protect (the appellant) from detection or punishment\nand not that of\ninterfering corruptly with the due administration of justice.\n(a) The obvious purpose of section 157 is to declare criminal and to render indictable the corruption or attempted corruption of officers engaged in the prosecution, detection or punishment of offenders. \"Offenders\" is a very wide term (Moore v. Illinois)[2], and the use of it affords a strong indication that the application of section 157 should not be restricted, as counsel for the appellant argued, to cases in which the bribe is offered or given to prevent the prosecution, detection or punishment of a person who is, or apprehends that he may be, charged with a crime indictable under the criminal code or at common law. The contravention of a valid provincial penal statute is an offence and a person who commits it is an offender.\n(b) I am unable to agree with the contention that, if what the appellant did amounted to bribing a Peace Officer with intent \"to protect (himself) from detection or punishment etc.\" within the concluding phrases of clause (a) of section 157, it cannot warrant his conviction for the crime of bribing a peace officer with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice provided for in the earlier and more comprehensive phrases of the same clause. That the act charged against the appellant was done with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice in the ordinary acceptation of that phrase is conceded. The mere fact that it might also warrant a conviction under the more restricted terms of the concluding phrase of clause (a) is not, in my opinion, a sufficient reason for cutting down the plain meaning of the earlier phrase. Other instances of similar overlapping occur in the Criminal Code.\nMoreover, in order to bring the case within the concluding phrase of clause (a) a finding that the appellant had committed, or had intended to commit, a contravention of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" would be essential. No such finding has been made. No such issue was presented to the jury. No such charge was laid. Whether the appellant had in fact committed, or had intended to commit, an offence against the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" was quite irrelevant and immaterial to the charge as laid. It was only essential that, being apprehensive of prosecution for such an offence, the appellant should have bribed the police officer with intent to prevent the realization of that possibility. Upon the case presented he could not have been convicted under the concluding phrase of clause (a); but upon the facts assumed in the reserved case he was, in my opinion, rightly convicted under the earlier clause. It is quite unnecessary to consider whether the breach of a provincial penal statute which provides its own penalty is a \"crime\" within the meaning of that word as used at the end of clause (a) of section 157. Expressing no opinion upon that question, I allude to it merely to observe, with great deference, that cases such as In re McNutt[3], referred to by the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, and the later and decisive case of Mitchell v. Tracey[4], which deal with the meaning and scope of the words \"arising out of a criminal charge\" in section 39 (c) of the Supreme Court Act, would appear to me to afford little or no assistance in determining it.\nThe appeal fails.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a criminal appeal. The appellant was convicted before a duly constituted tribunal with having corruptly interfered with the administration of justice in giving to a police officer a bribe of $1,000 in order to induce this police officer not to proceed against him for violation of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act.\"\nThe charge had been laid under section 157 of the Criminal Code which makes it an indictable offence for any person to give to a police officer employed for the prosecution, detection or punishment of offenders any money with intent\n1\u00b0 to interfere with the administration of justice; or 2\u00b0 to procure the commission of any crime; or 3\u00b0 to protect from detection or punishment any person having committed or intending to commit a crime.\nThe reserved case which is now before us is submitted in the following words: Was a bribe given in order to induce a police officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" given with intent to interfere with the administration pf justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code?\nIt is contended by the accused that he was prosecuted for having corruptly interfered with the administration of justice, that the giving of money to protect from detection any one committing a crime before any proceedings have been instituted for the punishment of that crime is not interfering with the administration of justice and that it is another offence dealt with otherwise.\nThe Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan answered the reserved case in the affirmative, Mr. Justice Newlands dissenting.\nThe police officer who received the bribe had been instructed by his superior officers to check the liquor sales made by the appellant and to see whether the latter had unlawfully sold any liquor contrary to the dispositions of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act,\" and to find out whether information should not be laid against the appellant.\nThe work which the police officer was carrying out was authorized by the law and was absolutely necessary to put the wheels of justice in motion.\nI am of opinion that the \"administration of justice\" mentioned in section 157 of the Criminal Code should not be restricted to what takes place after an information had been laid; but it includes the taking of necessary steps to have a person who has committed an offence brought before the proper tribunal, and punished for his offence. It is a very wide term covering the detection, prosecution and punishment of offenders.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mignault J.\u2014On the ground that the charge against the appellant, and on which a verdict of guilty was returned by the jury, comes within the terms of article 157 of the Criminal Code, the jury having found the appellant guilty of having, on the 20th day of December, 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the administration of justice, corruptly given a bribe to a police officer to induce him not to proceed against the appellant for violation of the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act,\" I am of opinion that the question submitted should be answered in the affirmative. To give a bribe to a police officer with this intent is a corrupt interference with the administration of justice within the terms of Article 157. It is, in my opinion, immaterial whether proceedings were then pending or merely likely to be taken, and I do not think that the fact that these proceedings were to be instituted under the Saskatchewan \"Temperance Act\" takes the case out of the operation of this section of the Criminal Code.\nThe appeal therefore fails and should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1920) 3 W.W.R. 99.\n[2] 55 U.S.R. 13, at p. 19.\n[3] 47 Can.

Il aurait pu sans doute nous en expliquer la port\u00e9e. Son successeur, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu, n'a pas pu nous \u00e9clairer beaucoup sur la situation. Cette somme d'un dollar qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e entre les mains de l'agent est bien entr\u00e9e dans le livre de caisse de l'agence et on retrouve bien dans un livret de re\u00e7us le talon du re\u00e7u en question : mais il n'y a rien qui nous indique si cet argent avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour le prix d'achat.\nAu livre des ventes nous ne trouvons rien pour indiquer que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e par le demandeur. Nous trouvons, au contraire, qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 Joseph Pilon.\nLe demandeur a tent\u00e9 de prouver qu'il avait un titre du fils ou de l'ayant-cause de ce Joseph Pilon, mais on ne lui a pas permis de faire cette preuve.\nDans ces circonstances, je pr\u00e9sume que ce quit claim dont il est question dans la lettre de l'agent est un transport que Diotte aurait eu du fils de Pilon et qu'il l'aurait envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent des terres pour le faire enregistrer ainsi que l'acte des Terres de la Couronne l'exige (art. 1563 S.R.P.Q.). Alors ce re\u00e7u n'aurait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour argent pay\u00e9 en acompte de l'achat d'une terre publique mais pour l'enregistrement, ainsi qu'il y est formellement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'ailleurs, du transport (\"quit claim\") du fils de Pilon.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1920: October 21, 22, 25; 1920: November 23.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContract\u2014Construction\u2014Essential term\u2014Special meaning\u2014Parol evidence\u2014Company\u2014Shares\u2014Premium\u2014Payment\u2014Appropriation.\nBoth parties to a contract in writing agreed that one of its terms was not used in the ordinary sense and parol evidence to explain its special meaning was received.\nHeld, Brodeur J. contra, that, such term being essential and the evidence showing that the parties were not ad idem as to it, there was no contract. Idington J. was of opinion that there was a contract but the damages should be assessed by a reference and not as the Court of Appeal directed.\nPer Brodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014A contract is binding upon the parties notwithstanding their different interpretations of its terms; and it is for the court to determine which of these interpretations must be upheld according to the surrounding circumstances which can be proved by oral evidence.\nThe appellant having subscribed for fifty shares of the company respondent, they were allotted to him at $120 per share being at a premium of $20 per share. The appellant sent his cheque for $1,500.\nHeld, Brodeur and Mignault J.J. dissenting, that the $1,500 should be apportioned pro rata between the premium and the par value of the shares.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1920] 3 W.W.R. 365) reversed, Brodeur, J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Clement J. and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe appellant is a producer of fruits. The respondent company is a co-operative corporation composed of shareholders engaged in the cultivation of fruits and it looked after the marketing and the sale of the fruits of the orchards of which the shareholders of the company were the owners. The parties made a contract by which the appellant undertook to sell and the respondent to buy during seven years the appellant's crop of fruit, \"the purchase price to be the market price of such fruit in each year.\" Both parties are agreed that the term \"market price\" was not used in the ordinary sense, to wit: the actual price at which a commodity is commonly sold at the place of the contract, as in this case there was no such market; but both parties were not ad idem as to the exact meaning of this term. The appellant also applied for fifty shares of the company respondent, which were allotted to him at $120 a share, meaning a premium of $20 on the par value. He sent his cheque for $1,500. The question is whether this sum must be first applied in full payment of the premium and the balance in part payment of the par value of the shares; or whether the said sum must be apportioned pro rata between the premium and the par value of the shares.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and W.H.D. Ladner for the appellant.\nJ.J. Taylor K.C. for the respondent. IDINGTON J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed in respect of three of the specific matters in question.\nIn the first place I cannot find anything in the interpretation and construction of the several respective contracts made between appellant on his own behalf and on behalf of the two others he represented, which should maintain the application of the particular sliding scale put forward in the evidence as the only one fitted for determining the rights of the parties.\nIt was neither expressly nor impliedly incorporated in any of the said contracts or in the terms upon which the appellant was admitted as a shareholder or director of the respondent.\nIt was not put forward in the negotiations as a final determination for the term of the ensuing seven years these contracts were to run, but simply as an illustration of the mode in which the respondent had for a year or two then past, been trying to adjust the yearly settlement of its accounts with those selling their products to it.\nIt was not applied for such purpose in regard to the first year's entire products sold the respondent under the contracts now in question.\nIndeed it is doubtful if it was applied as to any material part of such products.\nIn order to help the court in the interpretation of an ambiguously worded contract, extrinsic evidence may be given of the surrounding circumstances under which it was entered into.\nThe identity of the object which the parties had in view as well as the identity of the subject matter with which they were dealing may be better understood when read in light of such surrounding circumstances. For example take one of the contracts before us which reads as follows:\u2014\nAgreement made (in duplicate) this twenty-ninth day of May, A.D. 1914, between John Kidston (hereinafter called the vendor) of the one part, and Stirling & Pitcairn, Limited, a body corporate duly incorporated under the statutes of British Columbia, and having its head office at Kelowna, in the province of British Columbia, (hereinafter called the purchasers), of the other part, whereby it is agreed as follows:\u2014The vendor will sell and the purchasers will buy the crop of fruit now growing or to be grown on the trees of the orchard of the vendor as at present planted, situate near Vernon, in the Coldstream municipality, for a period of seven (7) years from the first of May, 1914.\nThe purchase price shall be the market price of such fruit in each year.\nThe vendor shall pick and gather the said fruit in due course, and when sufficiently mature for the purpose of gathering and taking the same, shall deliver the same to the purchasers' warehouse, reserving such fruit as may be required for the use of the ranch.\nSigned, sealed and delivered.\nJohn Kidston (Vendor)\nStirling & Pitcairn, Ltd.,\n(Purchasers).\nIn the presence of E.C. Kidston.\nOthers in question are in same form.\nThe \"purchase price\" as thus defined when using the words \"the market price of such fruit in each year\" is capable of several distinctly different meanings.\nWas it to be the market price in the nearest market town on the day of delivery for each respective kind and quantity and quality as delivered and to be paid in cash on delivery?\nOr was it to be determined by means of arriving at some average price for the fruit season for each kind and grade in quality of each kind?\nAnd was that to be according to what the application of fair dealing and reasonableness applied to the course of business in each year would disclose? In the iatter alternative, or something akin thereto, a knowledge of the surrounding circumstances would materially assist in understanding what the parties were about.\nThat once discovered would in its turn doubtless admit of the application of proper methods to demonstrate what would be fair and reasonable methods of determining what had been the market price for any given year.\nWhat is fair and reasonable often can be applied in law to help out what the parties have inadvertently failed to make as expressly clear as a court might desire.\nIt is even conceivable that a sliding scale of some kind may, when the accounts come to be taken, be found a valuable auxiliary to work out the result to be determined.\nBut it never would be permissible to act upon the theory that the sliding scale mentioned above had become incorporated in the foregoing contract or the others in same form.\nHad it been demonstrated that the said sliding scale had been, to the knowledge of all the parties, actually applied, without objection, as a factor in determining the price for the year (in July of which the contract was executed though dated in May) it might have been possible (acting upon many decisions which rest upon what the parties did immediately after the execution of the contract and in pursuit thereof) as a means of determining what they had in fact intended by the language used to imperatively uphold the continuation of such use.\nIt is not pretended that the said sliding scale is commonly used in carrying on such business as in question herein. In short I can find no ground upon which to rest the provision in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal for the application of the said sliding scale, and would allow the appeal.\nThere is much to be said in favour of the course of dealing which both parties agreed in and adopted immediately after execution of the contract as demonstrating that both adopted the view that what was in fact intended to be the market price was to be the result of respondent's marketing elsewhere than in British Columbia and that to be determined by deduction of expenses and a fair commission. I think that is likely to be best determined by a referee proceeding on the basis of what was fair and reasonable.\nIn the next place I think that the learned trial judge was right in allowing the plaintiff, now appellant, the sum of $562.50, balance due for dividend on his stock.\nThe contention that the first payment of $1,500 account fifty shares of stock must be first applied in payment of the premium, seems to me quite unfounded whether we look at the nature of the purchase or the letter of appellant appropriating the money and receipt of the secretary of respondent expressly putting it as $30.00 per share.\nIt is quite true that the late Mr. Pooley's record of his way of looking at the payment was in accord with what the respondent contends, but that is by no means clear in what he submitted to the appellant.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge ought to be restored. The appeal ought to be allowed in this case with costs throughout to the appellant.\nThe respondent brought an action against the appellant for specific performance of said contract. I am unable to find any ground in evidence herein upon which such jurisdiction can be exercised if regard is had to the principles which have settled the limitations of the exercise of such jurisdiction.\nThe adequate and usual remedy of recovery for damages for breach of contract was open to the plaintiff in that connection.\nThe many complications involved in the performance of the contract and to be pursued in the remedy given by means of specific performance, were such as to bar a resort to that remedy.\nThe ambiguous nature of the contract of which so many varying views have been taken render specific performance inappropriate.\nI need not continue my list of serious objections to the exercise of such a mode or relief, but may be permitted to refer to the authorities cited on pages 26 et seq. of Fry on Specific Performance, 4th ed. relative to my first objection; to pages 38 et seq. of the same work relative to my second and to pages 294 et seq. of same work, as well as foregoing, in relation to the third objection I take.\nThe interim injunction which was granted was only ancilliary to the specific performance which was sought, and that should have ended with the proper dismissal of the action by the learned trial judge.\nAnother injunction of a similar nature was granted in the Court of Appeal pending the hearing of appeal thereto.\nThat, of course, falls, or should fall, in my opinion, with the failure to establish a right to specific performance, which, I repeat, is the remedy specifically sought in and by the said action. If the relief by injunction is to be held as sought independently of the right for specific performance, then I can find no authority that would entitle respondent to such mode of relief in such a case as presented.\nThe authorities on that head are collected in Kerr on Injunctions, chapter 10, wherein, or in reports of later cases, I can find none to uphold such a contention.\nThe respondent relies upon the decision in the case of Metropolitan Electric Supply Co. v. Ginder[2], which I respectfully submit does not, in its essential features, dependent upon a statutory obligation and a covenant, of which the practical effect was to maintain the right of the company to carry out that obligation, maintain the right to an injunction herein.\nIt does not of my mind present very much resemblance to the features of this case. Yet of all of those cited, on behalf of respondent, it, in principle, comes nearer than any other cited on its behalf, to touching the operation of the principles involved.\nThe decision of Sir George Jessel in the case of Fothergill v. Rowland[3] is almost exactly in point in this, and is adverse to the respondent herein.\nIn conclusion I think the action for specific performance was rightly dismissed by the learned trial judge, and that dismissal should be restored with costs throughout.\nThe respective counsel for the parties hereto are agreed that there is no local statutory provision under which the damages for breach of the undertaking given on the obtaining of the said injunctions can be dealt with herein. They are also agreed that respondent obtained the delivery of the crops of fruit for the balance of the seven year period, whether or not as result of an injunction, which I hold should not have been granted, is not clear.\nThe appellant's action, according to my opinion, must be maintained, but whether it covers anything beyond the time up to when begun, and thus the later results to be decided thereafter, I refrain from dealing with.\nThere is thus ample room for a fine crop of litigation.\nI would allow the appeal and meantime dismiss the action for specific performance, with costs throughout, and I would direct a reference similar to that which the learned trial judge directed, but guarding against his expression that there was no contract.\nI think there was a contract which may be well illuminated by the conduct of the parties relative thereto, whilst excluding the sliding scale in question, and applying the doctrine of what is fair and reasonable which helps so much under our law in the administration of justice.\nDUFF J.\u2014My conclusion is that the trial judge was right in his finding that the parties had never arrived at a contract in terms.\nOn the other hand, fruit, the property of the appellant, was received and disposed of by the respondents in circumstances which exclude the hypothesis that they were not to pay for it, and it follows, of course, that the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondents a reasonable price. My conclusion is that the trial judge's judgment directing a reference to ascertain the value of the fruit understood in this sense should stand. I adhere however to the view expressed in the argument that the dealings of the parties afford up to a certain point a satisfactory guide for the ascertaining of what is reasonable in the circumstances and I think the order of reference ought to contain a direction to the referee on this point. The direction should be that the price is to be ascertained by taking the average price realized by the respondents for fruit sold by them of each kind and grade furnished by the plaintiff and from that should be deducted first, expenses incurred in handling the fruit received from the plaintiff, and, secondly a sum representing a reasonable profit. As to the question of the appropriation of the moneys paid by the appellant on his shares, I concur with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Idington.\nIf follows of course that the respondents' counterclaim for specific performance should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that the learned trial judge reached the proper conclusion upon all the evidence in this case. It discloses a great many incidents which taken together make it reasonably certain that the minds of the parties never met as to the meaning of, or the method of computing, the \"market price\" to be paid the plaintiff. They are agreed that this term is not used in the ordinary sense\u2014that it meant the average yearly price received by the defendants on each grade and variety of fruit sold by them less certain deductions for expenses and profits. But upon the basis of computation of these deductions they were never agreed. Moreover there is a difference between them as to whether sales for export should be included in ascertaining the average prices. If this latter were the only matter in dispute however, I should have had little hesitation in determining it in the plaintiff's favour. Stuart v. Kennedy[4], cited by the appellant from Benjamin on Sales, 5 ed., p. 103, seems closely in point.\nI also agree with the learned trial judge that the payments made by the plaintiff on account of his subscription for fifty shares of stock in the defendant company should be apportioned pro rata between the premium of 20% at which he subscribed and the par value of the shares. That I think is the true meaning of the contract on which the shares were taken, and, with respect, I am unable to understand the application of the doctrine of imputation of payments to the single debt which the plaintiff incurred.\nThe conclusion that the parties were not ad idem as to a vital term of the contract necessarily involves the failure of the action of Sterling & Pitcairn, Limited, v. Kidston.\nI would allow the appeal of the plaintiff Kidston with costs in this court and the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge in each action, and would dismiss the cross-appeal also with costs.\nOn the reference, however, directed by the learned trial judge the value of the fruits delivered by the plaintiff (by which I take it a reasonable price for them is meant) should, under the special circumstances of this case, be ascertained by deducting from the average price realized by the defendants in each year for all fruit sold by them of each kind and grade furnished by the plaintiff the expenses incurred by the defendant in handling the plaintiff's fruit and a reasonable sum for profits on the sale thereof. The evidence warrants the conclusion that a fair price will be best arrived at by this method. BRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014The main question on this appeal is whether or not the contract is a binding one. The trial judge found that the parties were not ad diem and that the contract never existed. The Court of Appeal decided there was a valid contract.\nThe respondent company is a co-operative corporation composed of shareholders engaged in the cultivation of fruits. It looked after the marketing and the sale of the fruits of what is called in the case affiliated orchards, viz., orchards of which the shareholders of the company were the owners. The shares were allotted according to the cultivated area of each orchard.\nIn 1914, Kidston, who is a producer of fruits, wanted to become a shareholder of the respondent company and to have his fruits marketed and sold by it, and he applied for 50 shares which were allotted to him at $120 a share, meaning a premium of $20 over the par value. In the correspondence and the negotiations which then took place, Kidston was advised that the affiliated orchards sold their fruit to the respondent company for a price to be calculated upon the net returns after deducting for expenses and profits according to what was called the \"sliding scale.\" This sliding scale was communicated to Kidston and he then signed a contract providing for the sale of his crop to the respondent company for a period of seven years at a price which was to be \"the market price of such fruit in each year.\"\nHe delivered his fruits and he received during those years the same price as was paid to the affiliated orchards, but he claims that he should have received a larger sum and he takes an action in reddition de compte. He had paid $1,500, at first on his fifty shares of which a sum of $1,000 was apportioned by the respondent company for the premium of $20 a share and on which sum of $1,000 he did not receive any dividend. He claims that this $1,500 should have been apportioned equally on the par value of the shares and on the premium and then he should have received larger dividends.\nKidston, after having instituted his action in 1917, continued however to deliver his fruits to the respondent company until 1919, when, having refused to go on with his contract, the respondent company took an injunction to prevent him from selling to other persons. The injunction was dismissed by the trial judge who decided that the contract was not binding, but the injunction was restored by the Court of Appeal.\nThe case then turns almost entirely on the construction of these words \"market price\" in the contract.\nIn its ordinary sense the market price means the actual price at which a commodity is commonly sold at the place of the contract.\nIn this case, there is no market at the place where the contract was made. These fruits have to be shipped away to the United States or to some cities of the Canadian provinces; and Kidston in his particulars and in his evidence admits that these words had a special meaning in this contract and would not cover the market price of the locality.\nThey mean, according to his opinion, the average price realized by the respondent company for each grade and variety of fruit, less the expenses and a reasonable commission on the sale. In view of this admission by the appellant and in view of the statements made by the respondent company in its pleadings and at the trial, I cannot reconcile myself to the idea that there is no binding contract between the parties. If two persons entered into a contract and understood it in a different sense, it is binding upon them. Stevens' Mercantile Law, p. 102. There is no difference of opinion as to the determining of the average price of each variety of fruit. There is no serious difficulty either as to the expenses connected with the sale of the goods.\nAs to the profits, the respondent company claims that the sliding scale should be used to determine these profits. The appellant opposes this idea.\nFor my part, I would think that the sliding scale should be considered as part of the contract. It was communicated to the appellant before he signed his contract and was referred to time and again by both parties during their course of dealings. That scale was used with regard to all the co-operative associates.\nBut if the sliding scale should not be considered as part of the contract, it would form at least a basis on which a reasonable profit could be ascertained.\nAs to the appropriation of the money made by the appellant on his shares, I consider that out of the amount paid at first the necessary sum for the premium should be deducted and that the appropriation made in that respect by the respondent is well founded.\nWith regard to the injunction or specific performance, I concur with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal.\nOn the whole, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014The more I have studied the voluminous record in this case, the more I have become convinced that the parties were wide apart from the very beginning as to a vital term of their contract, to wit, the price to be paid the appellant for his fruit. They drew up and signed, in May, 1914, a contract which on its face appears clear and unambiguous. The appellant (vendor), by this contract, undertakes to sell and the respondent (purchaser) to buy during seven years the appellant's crop of fruit, the purchase price to be the market price of such fruit in each year, and the vendor to gather and pick the fruit and when sufficiently mature to deliver the same to the purchaser's warehouse.\nSuch a contract, I have said, is on its face clear and unambiguous. The court could easily define the expression \"market price\" which of course would vary from year to year, possibly from month to month, according to the condition of the fruit market, and the appellant would obtain from the respondent the selling price prevailing at the time and place of the sale for fruit of the same kind and quality as that sold to the respondent. With a contract so worded there would of course be no question of expense incurred by the respondent or of any profit realized by it on the resale of the fruit.\nBoth of the parties, however, agree that the obvious meaning of the language of their contract is not that which they had in mind when they made it. The contract was not an ordinary contract of sale, but it involved a kind of agency of the respondent for the appellant in the sense that the price to be considered, the parties admit, is the price not of the sale by the appellant but of the resale by the respondent, and that certain expenses and charges as well as a reasonable commission must be allowed the latter. Having thus both agreed that the contract does not mean what its language clearly imports, the parties follow widely divergent courses when they attempt to define the \"market price\" which is to rule, and from the very start they appear to have been hopelessly apart as to the price which was to be paid for the fruit. The appellant defined \"market price\" in his particulars as the average price realized by the respondent from all sales made by it in each year of each grade and variety respectively, less the expenses properly incurred in handling the same and a reasonable commission on the sale of the fruit. The explanation of the respondent covers nearly a page in the appeal book, and involves considering its policy with what were termed the affiliated orchards, and then, at the end of the selling season, taking the average selling price of a carload lot of each particular variety of fruit, deducting from this a profit on each box in accordance with a scale called the sliding scale adopted by the respondent in its dealings with the affiliated orchards, in addition to which a further sum for packing, overhead and handling charges by package, as per the \"sliding scale,\" would also be deducted. The net result would give the net amount per pound payable to the appellant and would be the market price as the respondent understood it.\nWith the parties so far apart from the very start, it is not surprising that after four years of dealings there is a very considerable difference between what the appellant contends should have been paid and what he actually received from the respondent. The appellant's action involves an accounting so as to establish the amount of this difference, and as his discussions with the respondent brought about no result, he finally refused to make further deliveries and notified the respondent that he would sell his fruit elsewhere. The respondent then took an action for specific performance with an injunction to prevent the appellant from selling his fruit to any other purchaser.\nI must confess that I endeavoured at first to find out which of the versions of the parties was the correct one, and it is noticeable that the respondent before us showed an inclination to accept the appellant's definition of market price, while contending that the \"sliding scale\" should be applied in determining the deductions for expenses and the profit to be charged. The appellant however, strenuously argues, and I think rightly, that the \"sliding scale\" formed no part of the contract. That the conduct of the respondent in fixing the amounts to be deducted for expenses and the commission to be paid it was arbitrary there can be no doubt, and its board of directors, of whom appellant was, during the first years, a member, but a constantly dissenting one, attempted to define the meaning of \"market price\" and finally proposed that a new contract be made stating that the price payable should be fixed by the directors in each year. Under these circumstances it appears to me impossible to place on this vital term of the contract a meaning which can in any way be considered as ever having had that consensus ad idem of the parties which is essential for the existence of a valid contract.\nI find myself therefore in agreement with the opinion of the learned trial judge that there was no valid contract. I may add that there is no room for construction here because the natural and legal meaning of the term \"market price\" was not intended by the parties and they never agreed as to the special meaning which it should hear. The question of the payments made by the appellant on, the shares purchased by him in the capital stock of the respondent company is a rather difficult one to solve. The appellant's application for shares stated that these shares, of a nominal value of $100 each, were issued at a premium of $20 per share, and the appellant, applying for fifty shares, sent his cheque for $1,500, being a deposit of $30 per share and promised to pay $22.50 per share on May 1st, 1915, and a like amount on the 1st of May of the years 1916, 1917 and 1918. He made besides the deposit of $30 per share, the first payment of $22.50 per share due on May 1st, 1915. The respondent acknowledged receipt of the application and of the deposit of $1,500, stated in the formal receipt sent to the appellant to be a deposit of $30 per share on an application for fifty ordinary shares of $100 each issued at 20% premium, but in its books the respondent credited $1,000 to the premium account and $500 to the capital account, so that, of the first payment of $30 per share, $20 went to the premium and $10 to the share itself. The result was that inasmuch as dividends are paid by the respondent on the paid up portion of its capital, the respondent received a lesser dividend than if the payment had been credited ratably on the premium and on the shares, which the appellant contends, but without citing any case supporting his contention, should have been done.\nI do not think that authorities as to appropriation of payments can help us here, for there was only one debt, i.e., for fifty $100 shares sold for $120 each. If there had been two debts, one for the premium and the other for the share itself as distinguished from the premium, I would think that there has been no appropriation by the appellant, who paid first $30 and subsequently $22.50 generally on each of the shares subscribed by him, but that there was an appropriation by the respondent which credited $1,000 to premium and $500 to the 50 shares, and this appropriation was subsequently notified to the appellant when he asked for explanation as to the amount of the dividend cheque sent to him. So that it seems to me that when the learned trial judge allowed the payments made by the appellant to be ratably applied to the premium and to the share itself, thus treating the premium and the share as if they were two separate debts, he could not, under the authorities, ignore the appropriation made by respondent and notified to appellant. In this view of the matter the case of Cory Bros. & Co. v. Owners of \"The Mecca,\"[5], cited by the respondent would be in point and would sustain the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nBut here I find one debt only, that of $120 for each share of a nominal value of $100. As I have said, the appellant paid generally, at first $30 and subsequently $22.50 on each share purchased by him and the receipt given him for the first payment of $30 is also general. The notes of the appellant's conversation with the respondent's manager Pooley, when a subscription of forty shares was contemplated, show that a total liability of $4,800 was mentioned, on which 25% of the total price was to be paid on allotment, and the balance in four equal annual instalments. When the appellant made the first payment of $30 per share subscribed for at $120, he still owed $90 on each share, for the price to him of the shares was $120 each. The dividends of course were paid on the par value, but unless the premium and the par value be distinguished so as to form two separate debts\u2014and then the rules governing appropriation of payments would apply\u2014the appellant still owes $67.50 on his shares and can certainly not claim dividends on the balance due by him on shares, which he purchased at $120. If the premium and the par value be differentiated, it does not seem unnatural that the premium, which is the profit of the company for the privilege of purchasing its shares and not a part of its capital, should be paid first.\nI therefore on this point, and for these reasons, agree with the Court of Appeal.\nThere remains the action for specific performance with the injunction taken by the respondent against the appellant. In my view that there was no valid contract, it is clear that this action was rightly dismissed and the injunction dissolved by the learned trial judge.\nI would therefore allow the appeal of the appellant with costs here and in the Court of Appeal except as to the claim of the appellant for additional dividends and the costs properly ascribable to this claim. The respondent's cross\u2014appeal which presupposes a binding contract between the parties should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cochrane, Ladner & Reinhard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cowan & Gurd.\n[1] [1920] 3 W.W.R. 365.\n[2] [1901] 2 Ch. 799.\n[3] [1873] L.R. 17 Eq. 132.\n[4] [1885] 23 Sc.

(1915) c. 6, s. 20 (b) and s. 23 (c). The maximum rate stipulated in a contract between a gas company and a municipal corporation, while the company has not yet by by-law or otherwise fixed any rates which it proposes to charge, is not an \"existing rate\" as used in section 23 (c) of the \"Public Utilities Act\" of Alberta; and the Board of Public Utility Commissioners has no jurisdiction to modify it.\nPer Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014A gas company, which has a number of wells drilled and ready for operation but has not yet constructed pipe lines to carry their output, nor begun to render service to the public, is a \"public utility,\" within the purview of the \"Public Utilities Act.\" Idington J. contra.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L. R. 416) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], allowing an appeal by the Attorney-General of the Province of Alberta from a decision of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. The Board had adjudged that it possessed jurisdiction under the \"Public Utilities Act\" of Alberta to make an order increasing the prices for the sale by the appellant of gas to consumers in the city of Edmonton beyond the maximum rates fixed by an agreement between the city and the company appellant whereby the company was granted its franchise by the city and which agreement was confirmed by chapter 29 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1916.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. and H. R. Milner for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and I. B. Howatt for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After consideration I have reached the conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nI concur with the reasons for such dismissal stated by my brother Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014To maintain this appeal we must hold that a municipal corporation having, with the assent of the electors, known as burgesses, made a contract, of such an unusual and ultra vires character, with a company of adventurers, to make it legal required legislative ratification thereof, and then that the' Legislature by enacting such merely ratifying legislation, impliedly enabled the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners to go a step further than had been given by either contract so ratified, or the legislation creating this Board; and hence, without the consent of said burgesses to a variation of the contract, by adding to the maximum price named in such a contract for the services to be rendered, although it might never come to be operative. The company in question never got beyond the stage of expending some money in way of exploitation or construction, and never operated, nor was ready to operate, anything, yet claims that it is a public utility within the meaning of the definition thereof in the \"Public Utilities Act,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n(b) The expression \"public utility\" means and includes every corporation other than municipal corporations (unless such municipal corporation voluntarily comes under this Act in the manner hereinafter provided), and every firm, person or association of persons, the business and operations whereof are subject to the legislative authority of this province, their lessees, trustees, liquidators, or receivers appointed by any court that now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any system, works, plant or equipment for the conveyance of telegraph or telephone messages or for the conveyance of travellers or goods over a railway, street railway, or tramway, or for the production, transmission, delivery or furnishing of water, gas, heat, light or power, either directly or indirectly, to or for the public; also the Alberta Government telephones, now managed and operated by the Department of Railways and Telephones.\nThe company in question pretends that it intends to supply gas. How such a company, merely exploiting the territory from which it expects to supply gas, can claim that it\nowns, operates, manages or controls, any system,\nwithin the meaning of said description, I am unable to understand.\nAnd much less am I able to understand how a board merely given a possible jurisdiction to assent to the entry of such a company into a particular field to operate in, and then, when in operation, regulate its rates, can imagine that it has not only the powers duly assigned it, but also the power to override the legislative limitations of powers of contract, which a municipality has had imposed upon it by its charter, and extend those limited powers further than the legislative creator had seen fit to grant by special legislation, and in doing so to exceed not only the contractual power or the expression thereof, and the specific legislation, but also something far beyond the powers assigned the Board itself.\nIt seems to me as plain as the English language can make it, in the use thereof by a draftsman trying to express a Canadian legislator's meaning, that the Board can only deal with existent public utilities, and have nothing to do with the birth, growth, and finishing of same ready to be owned and used.\nAnd, despite the resistance of the Attorney General for the province and the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court thereof specifically designated by the legislation creating the said Board as the only authority which is to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of the Board, the company comes here asking us to overrule such determination, notwithstanding said court has pointed out many other insuperable objections in the way of the Board exercising such autocratic powers as the company desires it to exercise.\nThe company of course, is entitled to say that it got leave from this court to come here, but that is no more conclusive as to our jurisdiction than any leave, given by a single judge, for example, under the Winding-Up Act, or another court inadvertently giving leave to appeal in a case over which we never have been given jurisdiction.\nAlthough appearing of record in this case as a party to the order granting leave, I wholly dissented therefrom for reasons assigned in writing.\nI hold that we are not here to pass upon mere administrative acts of any branch of government, unless expressly assigned that duty by Parliament, as, for example, in regard to appeals from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. I have, however, in deference to what is assumed to be the contrary opinion of the majority of the court, set forth above what seem to me amply sufficient reasons for dismissing the appeal as well as that of want of jurisdiction.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of the Appellate Division. The judgment of the Board in which the question of jurisdiction is fully discussed sets forth as follows:\u2014\nAny jurisdiction the Board may possess so far as increasing rates is concerned is derived from s.s. c. of section 23 of the \"Public Utilities Act.\" That section provides that the Board may after hearing fix \"just and reasonable\" rates * * * whenever the Board shall determine any existing individual rate * * * to be unjust or unreasonable, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory or preferential.\nThe order of the Board, having regard to the circumstances, which it is unnecessary to recapitulate, in effect is simply an order authorizing the company to exact charges exceeding the limit fixed by the agreement between the company and the municipal corporation of Edmonton and by the statute confirming the agreement. The company is providing no services, it is in no position to provide any services; consequently it is not in fact exacting any rate and it has not by any corporate act fixed the rates it is to charge. The order is therefore an order changing the limits fixed by the agreement between the company and the municipality ratified as already mentioned by statute in respect of tolls and it is nothing else.\nThe question is: Does the provision quoted sanction such an exercise of authority by the Board ?\nIf such be the purpose of the provision the language is not apt; it is a provision for substituting just and reasonable rates for rates which have been held by the Board on investigation to be unreasonable or insufficient. The provision does not appear to contemplate orders which merely expand or restrict the limits fixed by a statutory contract in respect of tolls and charges. Whether in exercising authority under the section the Board may disregard the limits fixed by such contracts is another question. The language in my opinion is not sufficiently precise to support an order which merely changes such limits.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant company has not yet established a service. While it has a number of wells drilled and ready for operation it has not constructed pipe lines to carry their output. By its agreement with the city of Edmonton, whereby it obtained its franchise, certain maximum rates of charge for its services are established. That agreement has been validated and confirmed by statute. The company, however, has not, by by-law or otherwise, fixed any rates which it proposes to charge.\nAlleging that the maximum rates specified in the agreement with the city are quite inadequate, the company applied to the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners to fix increased rates for its future services. The Board heard and granted this application, notwithstanding the intervention of the Attorney General contesting its jurisdiction. On an appeal taken under the provisions of the statute the Board's order was vacated by the Appellate Division as made without jurisdiction, and from that decision the present appeal has been brought by leave of this Court.\nThree objections are taken to the jurisdiction of the Board:\u2014\n(a) that because it has not begun to render service to the public the appellant company is not yet a \"public utility\" within the purview of the \"Public Utilities Act\"; (b) that the Board's jurisdiction is confined to increasing, reducing or approving of existing rates, and a maximum rate is not an \"existing rate\"; and (c)that, except for the reduction of excessive rates, provided for by s. 20 (b) of the statute, the Board has no power to interfere with rates fixed by the terms of a contract between a public utility and a municipality.\nThe status of the appellant company to apply to the Board and to assert the present appeal depend alike upon its existence as a public utility. Objection (a) should therefore be dealt with whatever view may be taken of objections (b) and (c). I am, with respect, of the opinion that it should not prevail. If it is sound a company ready to operate cannot obtain the sanction or approval of the Board to the rates it proposes to charge before actually commencing to do business, but must wait until it is in actual operation and actually charging such rates before it can legally apply for such sanction or approval. That this was the intention of the legislature seems highly improbable. The appellant company, in my opinion, \"owns, * * or controls * * works, plant or equipment * * for the production or furnishing of gas * * to or for the public\" and is therefore within the definition of \"public utility\" found in clause (b) of s. 2. Nothing in that clause imposes actual operation or even complete readiness to operate as a condition precedent to such a company as the appellant attaining the status of a \"public utility.\" On the contrary the tenor of the Act, taken as a whole, appears to contemplate that in the stage of development which the appellant's works, plant and equipment have reached that status should be accorded to it. But objection (b) seems to me to be fatal to the jurisdiction of the Board whose powers are purely statutory. Sec. 20 (b) clearly does not apply. Nobody suggests that the maximum rates authorized by the agreement with the municipality of Edmonton are excessive. Sec. 23 (c) is the only other provision which purports to confer direct jurisdiction over rates. But the operation of that section is by its terms confined to cases where \"the Board shall determine any existing rate * * to be unjust, unreasonable, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory or preferential.\" It may be that it is not necessary to have a rate in actual use and in course of collection to render this clause of the statute applicable. But there must at least be a fixed rate which the company has determined, by by-law or in some other proper method, to impose and charge whenever it shall render the service for which such rate is prescribed. A rate merely stipulated as the maximum which the company may exact, but which has not yet been charged or authorized by the company and may never be so charged or authorized is not an \"existing rate.\" I am therefore of the opinion that the case before us does not fall within s. 23 (c).\nThe only other suggestion offered in support of the appellant's position which seems to call for observation is that the Board has jurisdiction under s. 37 to deal with and prescribe the rates to be charged by a public utility as a condition of giving approval to a \"privilege or franchise\" granted to it by the municipality. But, in view of the explicit provisions of the statute empowering the Board to deal with rates and delimiting its jurisdiction in that connection, s. 37 in my opinion, cannot be invoked for that purpose. The principle of the decision in Fort William Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Property Owners [2] seems to be in point. The conditions authorized to be imposed by s. 37 are\nconditions as to construction, equipment, maintenance, service or operation.\n\"Operation\" is the only word in this group which could possibly cover the fixing of rates. I had occasion to consider its meaning and scope in the recent case of Ottawa Electric Railway v. Township of Nepean[3]. As used in the statute now before us, in my opinion, it does not include the fixing or regulation of rates or charges.\nMr. Clarke pressed for an expression of opinion upon objection (c) whatever view should be taken with regard to objections (a) and (b). But, having regard to my conclusion that objection (b) is well taken and is fatal to the company's application, I think objection (c) should not now be passed upon. It is not only unnecessary to deal with it but any expression of opinion upon it might well be regarded as purely academic.\nMoreover, we were informed by counsel that an appeal is actually pending under a similar statute in the appellate court of another province in which this very question is presented for decision, in the case of a public utility in actual operation and charging fixed rates or tolls. We should not embarrass the presentation or determination of that appeal by any expression of opinion here which could be regarded as unnecessary or premature.\nBecause the appellant's application does not fall within s. 23 (c) owing to their being no \"existing rates\" the Board in my opinion was without jurisdiction to entertain it and to make the order reversed by the Appellate Division. Solely on this ground I would affirm the judgment a quo and dismiss the appeal with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014On the ground that the so-called rate which the appellant seeks authority from the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners of Alberta to increase is not an \"existing rate\" within the meaning of section 23, s.s. (c) of the \"Public Utilities Act\" (Alberta), my opinion is that this appeal fails and should be dismissed. The appellant's franchise agreement with the city of Edmonton fixes no rate, but establishes a maximum price for gas which the appellant cannot exceed. Under this agreement and within this maximum the appellant must by by-law determine the price to be paid by the consumers of gas, and then only will there be an existing rate. It has not yet done so for it has not yet laid down the pipe lines through which the gas will be supplied. There is therefore no existing rate, but merely a maximum agreed upon by the appellant and the city, and it is this contractual maximum which the appellant seeks to have increased. In my opinion, the condition required for the exercise of the Board's jurisdiction is wanting. Looking at the whole situation and the changed conditions since the agreement was made, it would seem that resort should be had to the Legislature rather than to the Board whose powers clearly do not extend to a case like this one.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 15 Alta.

As, however, my colleagues seemed to have a different impression, I found it necessary to read with care all the pertinent evidence in the case referred to by counsel on either side, as also the judgment of the trial judge, Mr. Justice Hyndman, and that of the Appellate Division reversing it.\nAs a result, I am clearly of the opinion that, alike on the applicability of the maxim volenti non fit injuria and of the law of contributory negligence, the defendants are not liable and that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nIf there ever was a case, in my opinion, to which the doctrine of the maxim was applicable and should be applied, it is this case.\nThe actual work and duty of the plaintiff, for which he was employed, was to put in repair the very roadbed, the dangerous condition of which, it is contended by the plaintiff Mulcahy, caused the accident in question. He undertook the employment and continued in it with full knowledge of the very bad and unsafe condition of the roadbed. His knowledge of its condition was probably better than that of any other man. He applied, after going to work at the repairs in August, for new rails, and before, and in the beginning of September, was informed that the company would supply new rails for a portion of the road but could not do so for that part of it where the accident occurred, namely, between McLennan and Grande Prairie. On receiving this definite information, he, on the 6th September., 1917, wrote to his foreman the following letter.\nSpirit River, Sept. 6, 1917.\nMr. Frank Donis,\nEx. Gang Foreman.\nDear Sir:\nWhen you are working your gang from Manir Tank Mile 341 to Smoky 297 getting worst places out of track you will notice you will find some very bad rails. I have made requisitions for rails to Mr. Sutherland and he claims that he cannot give me any rails between McLennan and Grande Prairie so when you find a very bad one go to the nearest siding and take out rails from side track and put in main line and put your bad rail in side track that you take from main line leave a man to protect side track until you return with bent rail to replace good rail taken out. I understand this is a very expensive way to do but it is the only way we can get some of the very worst rails out which will cause bad derailments if left in track when repaired I know it will break up your gang so you cannot make a good showen but I understand all of this and will proct (protect?) you if anything is sayed about your work not showen up be shure and tamp up under new rail in low places good.\nYours truly,\nJ.W. Mulcahy,\nR.M.\nNo evidence could more clearly establish plaintiff appellant's full knowledge of the road's condition and of the inability of the company to supply new rails on that portion of the road where the accident occurred. The instructions he gave his foreman in this letter as to how he should remove and replace very bad rails, taken in conjunction with the other letters in evidence, shew his complete knowledge of all the facts, namely, the bad condition of the road on this particular section, the inability of the company to supply new rails for that comparatively untravelled section as all the rails they could procure were required for the section of the road where there was the greatest traffic for freight and passengers, and the means he directed the foreman should take to supply the new rails required as substitutes for any \"very bad ones.\"\nThis letter is, to my mind, also a complete answer to the suggestion that the company had aggravated the dangers to which plaintiff was exposed by neglecting to supply him with new rails. It shews his full knowledge of the company's inability to supply new rails between McLennan and Grande Prairie where the accident occurred as all the new rails they could procure were required for the more travelled sections of the road. With all this actual knowledge, the plaintiff continued in his position as roadmaster, repairing the road for which he had been specially employed. I can only, without quoting more from the evidence, repeat my strong opinion that the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria should be applied.\nThen, as to the contributory negligence of the plaintiff, I am also of the clear opinion that it has been proved up to the hilt. He was in control of the car, called a speeder, at the time of the accident and sat in the front seat along with a workman named Carbonneau. Frank Donis, who was running the car under his instructions sat behind him, and the evidence shews clearly it was plaintiff Mulcahy's custom and duty to signal to him the rate of speed. As usual, the witnesses differ somewhat as to the rate, but Mulcahy's own evidence is that, at the time of the accident, the speeder was running at between 10 and 15 miles an hour.\nAccepting plaintiff Mulcahy's own evidence of the state and condition of the roadbed and rails over which they were running, this rate of speed, I think, was not short of reckless imprudence and negligence. It no doubt thereby contributed to throw the car off the rails and cause the accident which occurred. If, however, the evidence of the other witnesses, Donis and Sutherland and Carbonneau, is accepted, that the roadbed, at the place in question, was not at all in the very bad condition that Mulcahy describes, but, as one of them Sutherland said:\nabout the best piece of track up there, the land dry and the ditching very good, there was no chance for water to remain around the track and keep it soft or give it a chance to become rough,\nthen the proper conclusion to be drawn is that which I think the trial judge, accepting their evidence, drew that the car ran off or jumped the track, not from the bad condition of the roadbed or rails, but from some unexplained cause.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is clear that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The learned trial judge rested his judgment herein upon the application of the doctrine expressed in the maxim volenti non fit injuria.\nAssuming, for argument's sake, such a defence would have been applicable if the accident had happened the next day after the respondent had entered upon his new employment, relying upon the reasonable expectation of his being supported in his effort to improve the dangerous condition then existent and to be rectified, I cannot see how it can be made applicable to the circumstances created by the gross neglect of appellant to supply the rails which the respondent so repeatedly urged upon its managers to be used in rendering the very spot in question safe.\nThe Appellate Division, in my opinion, was quite right in reversing, for the reasons assigned by it, the judgment of the learned trial judge on that ground, unless there was pressed upon it, and shewn to be well founded, the ground of contributory negligence on the part of respondent which is now urged upon us.\nAlthough a casual expression by the learned trial judge is quoted by counsel for appellant as indicating that, in the said judge's opinion, the defence of contributory negligence was established, I cannot read it as an express finding upon the conflicting evidence that appears or think that, if he so intended to find, he would have so passed over what he found on the facts and let the matter rest there, and then turned to elaborate the ground upon which he does rest his judgment.\nAnd the absence of any reference thereto in the able and fully considered opinion of the court below, seems to indicate that no such defence had been pressed on that court.\nThe evidence on the point, I repeat, is most conflicting. And in one view presented is reduced to a narrow point, which does not seem by any means to render it safe for us to act upon, under the foregoing circumstances.\nIndeed it amounts to no more than a possible suspicion that when the speeder car approached the point in question it might have been wiser for respondent to have indicated, to the man operating, a reduction in the rate of speed.\nI do not think, in face of the foregoing history of the alleged defence, and the conflict of evidence, as well as the fact that the motorman knew the road as well as respondent, that we would be justified in allowing the appeal on that ground, and, therefore, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014This appeal involves a controversy touching the application of the maxim volenti non fit injuria. Long ago Bowen, L. J., called attention in a well known judgment to this\u2014that the maxim is volenti non fit injuria not scienti non fit injuria. I make this observation because I should like it to be quite plain that some sentences in the judgment of the learned trial judge seemingly not quite consistent with this should not be accepted as an accurate exposition of the rule.\nI do not find it necessary to discuss the question whether if we had been confronted with a case in which the essential elements were the request by the company to Mulcahy to undertake the work he did undertake in the circumstances known both to him and to his superiors, the learned judge's finding of fact that the conduct of the parties properly interpreted evinced an intention that Mulcahy should bear the risk of the dangerous condition of that part of the railway where his duties were to lie could properly be set aside by the Appellate Division. I shall proceed upon the hypothesis that Mulcahy did undertake the risk but his agreement to undertake the risk must, as the Appellate Division have held, be qualified by the condition necessarily implied that the company would do what they reasonably could to assist him in minimizing the risk. That must, I say, be taken to have been one of the terms upon which the risk was assumed and I think an essential term. It follows that the failure on the part of the company to fulfil this term disables them from relying upon Mulcahy's undertaking unless at all events they can establish that by their default Mulcahy was not prejudiced. The Appellate Division have taken the view apparently that this was not shewn. Mr. Wilson has not satisfied me that that view is erroneous. ANGLIN J.\u2014The judgment of the Appellate Division is challenged by counsel for the defendant company on two grounds. It is urged (a) that the plaintiff voluntarily incurred the risk of the defective condition of the railway which has been found to have been the cause of his injury; (b) that excessive speed of the car, or \"speeder,\" on which he was travelling was the true cause of the accident and that he was so far responsible for it that he should either be deemed the author of his own wrong or at least guilty of contributory negligence.\nAs to the first defence, depending upon the applicability of the maxim volenti non fit injuria, I agree with the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Ives in the Appellate Division concurred in by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta and Mr. Justice Beck. The plaintiff did not agree to relieve the company from liability for accidents that might happen from an unnecessary prolongation of the risk arising from irremediably defective rails owing to its failure to comply with his reasonable and reiterated request that he should be sent a supply of good rails to replace them. No such implication is warranted either from his assumption or his retention of the post of roadmaster of the section.\nThat the speeder was running at an excessive speed at the time of the injury was not found by the learned trial judge, who dismissed the action because he was \"by no means satisfied\" that the speeder did not\njump the rails, * * * without any explainable cause.\nBut, assuming in the defendant's favour that the speed was too great, the evidence is not convincing either that the driver should be regarded as the plaintiff's alter ego so as to make him responsible for negli- gent driving or that the plaintiff had such an opportunity of observing and controlling the speed immediately before the moment of the accident that a case of contributory negligence on his part is clearly made out. Notwithstanding the able argument presented by Mr. Wilson I am not satisfied that there is error in the judgment a quo.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 15 Alta.

The respondent was injured, while in the employ of the company appellant, by placing his hand on an electric motor which was defective. The respondent alleged that he did so in order to ascertain if the motor was overheated, which act was necessary in order to keep the motor in operation by oiling it if needed. The appellant company pleaded that the respondent's duty, according to instructions given, consisted only in replacing the fuses when they burned out. The jury, after finding that the accident was not due to the sole fault of either the appellant or the respondent, answered to question 4 as reported in the head-note. The appellant's ground of appeal is that there is no relation of cause and effect between the defective condition of the machine and the injuries which the respondent sustained. The respondent contends that the verdict is not clearly wrong and therefore must stand.\nA. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the appellant.\nErnest P\u00e9lissier K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014There is much in the form of the verdict of the jury which is open to criticism.\nBut reading it as a whole there is one thing clear and that is that the contention of the appellant never was intended by the jury as its verdict.\nI prefer giving it, as the evidence justifies and the learned trial judge and the unanimous holding of the Court of King's Bench did, a rational meaning.\nTo do so this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014I concur in the view of the court below that there was evidence to support the verdict for the plaintiff if the jury had found such a verdict after a complete and proper direction by the trial judge.\nBut the questions for the jury were eminently debatable ones and it is a case in which a judgment for the plaintiff ought not to be sustained unless two conditions are satisfied: 1\u00b0 that the trial judge by his charge brought home to the comprehension of the jury the nature of the questions upon which they had to pass and 2\u00b0 that there should be no substantial doubt as to the meaning of the jury's finding. Neither of these two conditions is satisfied. I think it is gravely questionable that the jury understood the questions they were asked to answer; and further, after a good deal of consideration, I am quite unable to satisfy myself as to the meaning of their answers. There should be a new trial and all costs, including the costs of this court, should abide the event of the new trial.\nAnglin J.\u2014Greatly as I regret the necessity for the adoption of that course I see no way to avoid ordering a new trial of this action. The meaning of the jury's findings is at best obscure. Putting upon them the most benevolent interpretation of which they are susceptible they seem to be hopelessly inconsistent.\nThe fault attributed to the defendants is the operation of a machine known to be defective. But, admittedly, the defect in the machine did not itself expose the plaintiff to any risk. Unless we are to attribute to them an utter disregard of the requirement that to be actionable fault must be a proximate cause of the injury\u2014dans locum injuriae\u2014the jury must be taken to have meant that the operation of the defective machine entailed duties on the plaintiff in the discharge of which he was exposed to unnecessary and unwarranted risk of injury. Yet they found as fault on his part that in performing the act which was the immediate cause of his being injured he exceeded what he was told to do and took unnecessary risks.\nIt is suggested for the plaintiff that by this latter finding the jury merely meant that, although it was part of his duty to see that the defective bearing did not become overheated and therefore to ascertain its condition from time to time by feeling the casing covering it, he was not sufficiently cautious in doing so. But the verdict scarcely admits of that interpretation and attributing the intention to the jury of making such a finding is almost pure conjecture. If taken literally the finding ascribes to the plaintiff fault of such a character that the conclusion is almost inevitable that it was the sole cause of the accident. But the jury negatived that view and expressly found that there was fault on the part of the defendants which contributed to causing the injury. A somewhat meagre charge, particularly as to the necessity for direct causal connection between any fault to be found and the injury sustained, may to some extent account for the difficulties which the findings present. At all events it seems to me that they are insuperable and that justice to both parties requires that a new trial should be had. Costs of the abortive trial should abide the event. The costs of the appeals to the Court of King's Bench and to this Court should be costs in the cause to the appellant payable to it in any event of the action.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the result. Mignault J.\u2014In this case the majority of the court is of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered. I would have been ready to express my views on the merits of the respondent's action and to state whether it should be maintained or dismissed. I realize however that such an expression of opinion might possibly influence or embarrass the new trial now ordered. So, while I would have preferred to dispose immediately of the action on its merits, I will not dissent from the judgment ordering a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, McDougall, Stairs & Casgrain.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Flynn J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLouis St Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nErnest Roy K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting). This appeal raises the point of whether or not the possession of a right to cut standing timber for a term of thirty years can be placed on the valuation roll which is the first step taken under the Municipal Code of Quebec in the way of imposing taxes to be borne by the owner of any land or part thereof.\nThe taxes in the rural municipalities of Quebec are borne by the owner of the land, or parts thereof.\nThe right to cut standing timber was at one time, as we held in the case of the Laurentide Paper Co. v. Baptist[2], a mere personal right.\nNo matter whether the right was in perpetuity or merely for a term of years such, by reason of the peculiar angle at which learned lawyers sometimes will look at things and arrive, by what to them seems to be a sound process of reasoning, at conclusions that determine the quality of the ownership of anything, was the ultimate result reached.\nWhen that case was decided, and for a very long time before, the view taken in that case, and in which I agreed, no doubt was settled law in Quebec. It might be that the timber growing on the land was the only thing of value thereon or therein or that could be produced thereby; and that the unsophisticated might be unable to appreciate the difference between the conclusive right to enter and cut same as and when from time to time the possessor of such right might see fit and by means of the law protect such right absolutely; and the absolute legal ownership thereof as part of the entire property in the land. Perhaps even the sophisticated were at times puzzled to maintain the nature of the subtle distinction between the right to cut and carry away, and the absolute ownership of a dismembered part of the entirety, even though the former, at least, had not acquired a universally recognized legal designation or definition of it.\nI suspect it was by reason of the results reached in said case, that shortly after the declaration thereof the common sense of the legislature of the province saw fit to try and make the legal conception of juristic right, so far as legislative power could do so, conform with the common sense conception of ownership of land, or part therein or thereof or thereout, and accordingly enacted 2 Geo. V., cap. 45, amending Art. 381 of the Civil Code, as follows:\u2014\n1. Article 381 of the Civil Code is amended by inserting, after the word \"habitation\" in the second line, the words: \"the right to cut timber perpetually or for a limited time.\"\nArticle 381, thus amended, now reads as follows:\u2014\n381. Rights of emphyteusis, of usufruct of immovable things, of use and habitation, the right to cut timber perpetually or for a limited time, servitudes, and rights of action which tend to obtain possession of an immovable, are immovable by reason of the objects to which they are attached. The fundamental law of the province as formerly interpreted having been thus expressly amended, I respectfully submit that this new addition to the list of rights formerly held to be immovable, though less than the entire ownership thereof, and a new definition of what is to be comprehended within the term \"immovable\" ought to be observed throughout by the courts; and at all events in dealing with any subject matter falling within the term \"immovable\" used in any legislative enactment passed by the Quebec Legislature after said amendment, that word \"immovable\" should be interpreted in light thereof and construed accordingly, unless there appear in such enactment a clear intention that another meaning is to be attributed to the word \"immovable.\"\nThe new Municipal Code was enacted some five years thereafter and must, I submit, be read in light thereof.\nArticle 651 thereof reads as follows:\u2014\nAll land or immovable property situated in a local municipality, except that mentioned in article 693 is taxable property.\nSurely that is expressly within the definition of \"immovable\" in the Civil Code as amended.\nArticle 693 contains a lot of exemptions of which this now in question is not one.\nI am quite aware that much in the language of the new Municipal Code remained, as it was in that which it substituted, apparently capable of subserving either the purpose of Art. 381 of the Civil Code, as it stood before the amendment, or as it stood when amended.\nIt is, however, in Article 651, just quoted, that the key note of the whole is to be found so far as assessment or valuation roll is concerned, and I submit that said article dominates all else in that regard. It is the amended article of the code which must also always be applied to the later enactments and deeds or agreements. And if the Laurentide Paper Co. Case[3], or one like thereunto, should again hereafter arise, it is the amended article that should, so far as relevant, be applied.\nWe ought not to encourage the following of a metaphysical train of thought born of other days, to defeat such a plain enactment, clearly intended to set aside for all purposes that which had resulted from the adoption by the courts of that mode of reasoning.\nThe Legislature, moved evidently by a new mode of reasoning in relation to every-day affairs of the people concerned, had been led to determine that the antiquated mode, so far as the right to cut timber extended, should cease in regard to the meaning of the word \"immovable.\"\nThe comprehensive conception and purpose of such an excellent fundamental law as the Civil Code should not be lightly set aside.\nI think, therefore, the appeal fails.\nThere is another aspect presented by the hearing of this case.\nThere is, as I read the law, no title to land (in the sense in which these words are used in section 46 (b) of the Supreme Court Act defining our jurisdiction) involved herein upon which our jurisdiction can rest. At all events if the right in question is a mere personal one, there can be no title to land in question, and hence we should dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. And if, by any process of reasoning, there can be found a title to land in question, then, and only then, we have jurisdiction and, by adopting that ruling, the appellants are assessable and properly placed on the valuation roll.\nThe appeal, is in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014By article 688 M.C. municipal taxes imposed on land may be collected from the\noccupant or other possessor of such land as well as the owner thereof or from any subsequent purchaser of such land.\nBy section 16, s.s. 20, owner is defined as meaning\neveryone having the ownership or usufruct of taxable property or possessing or occupying the same as owner or proprietor or occupying Crown lands under a location ticket.\nSection 16 provides that the expression so defined\nshall have the\nmeaning, signification and application\nso assigned to it\nunless the context * * * declares or indicates the contrary.\nIt is, in my judgment, not permissible to give to the word \"owner\" or \"proprietor\" in sec. 688 a more extended meaning than that derived from the above quoted definition. Nothing in the context or in the subject matter indicates an intention to employ the word in a more comprehensive sense. These considerations in my opinion dispose of the appeal. Article 381 C.C. as amended undoubtedly provided that the appellant's droit de coupe de bois is an immovable but it does not follow that this right is a usufruct or that it is proprietorship within the meaning of these provisions of the Municipal Code. It is not sufficient, I think, to bring a possible subject of taxation within the sweep of these provisions to have a statutory enactment declaring that possible subject to be an immovable.\nAnglin J.\u2014Since \"the right to cut timber permanently or for a limited time\" has been declared by Art. 381 of the Civil Code, as amended by 2 Geo. V., c. 45, to be\nimmovable by reason of the object to which it is attached\nI should have been disposed to regard it as \"immovable property\" within Art. 651 of the Municipal Code and, as such, \"property taxable\" in the name of the owner or holder of such right, were it not for the definition of \"immovable property\" in paragraph 27 of Art. 16 of the latter code. That definition is as follows:\nThe words \"land\" or \"immovable\" or \"immovable property\" mean all lands or parcels of land (toute terre ou partie de terre) in a municipality owned or occupied by one person, or by several persons jointly, and include the buildings and improvements thereon.\nIt is argued that this definition is merely indicative and not restrictive. But the introductory paragraph in Art. 16, in my opinion, answers that contention. It reads as follows:\u2014\nArt. 16. The following expressions, terms and words whenever they occur in this code or in any munioipal by-law or any municipal order have the meaning, significance and application respectively assigned to them in this article unless the context of the provision declares or indicates the contrary.\nThe \"application\" of the term \"immovable property\" is thereby confined to\nall lands or parcels of land (toute terre ou partie de terre). Now, standing timber is no doubt part of the land on which it stands. But the mere right to cut that timber is not. This distinction (I speak with the utmost respect) is, in my opinion, disregarded in the judgment of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench. It seems to have been assumed, as put by Mr. Justice Martin, that under the right to cut them\nproperty in the trees is vested in the buyer before severance of the trees from the soil.\nOwnership of the trees passes, in my opinion, only when they are cut and converted into movables. The incorporeal right theretofore vested in the holder of this droit de coupe is not parcel (partie) of the land and therefore not \"immovable property\" within the meaning of that term as used in Art. 651 of the Municipal Code, although it undoubtedly is so for other purposes. I would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nJ.

Les terrains en question portent deux \u00e9valuations, l'une pour la foncialit\u00e9 ou le fonds, qui est mise au nom du propri\u00e9taire, et l'autre pour la coupe du bois, qui est mise au nom des appelants.\nLa corporation d\u00e9fenderesse dans sa d\u00e9fense maintient la validit\u00e9 de son r\u00f4le et all\u00e8gue qu'elle a le pouvoir de taxer les appelants pour leurs droits de coupe. Pour \u00e9viter les frais d'enqu\u00eate, les parties ont admis que les demandeurs sont contribuables dans la municipalit\u00e9, qu'un r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, et que les demandeurs y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entr\u00e9s comme propri\u00e9taires de la coupe de bois. Ces admissions sont suivies d'une demande d'adjudication dans les termes suivants:\nLa seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir si un propri\u00e9taire d'un droit de coupe de bois pour trente ans de ce jour peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation sans \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire du fonds sur le terrain priv\u00e9.\nCette question est \u00e9videmment soumise suivant les dispositions des articles 509 et suivants du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 cette question et a maintenu l'action des appelants, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi[4] qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le propri\u00e9taire d'un droit de coupe de bois est propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble et comme tel est sujet \u00e0 \u00eatre tax\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s municipales, m\u00eame quand il n'est pas propri\u00e9taire du fonds.\nNous avons alors \u00e0 examiner si ce jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi est bien fond\u00e9.\nLes r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation sont faits sous les dispositions des articles 649 et suivants du Code Municipal. Ils servent de base aux taxes municipales (art. 684). Ils doivent contenir, en autant de colonnes distinctes:\n\u2026 2\u00b0 la d\u00e9signation et la superficie de tout immeuble de la municipalit\u00e9, ainsi que de toute partie d'immeuble \u2026 3\u00b0 la valeur r\u00e9elle de tout immeuble et de toute partie d'immeuble imposable; \u2026 6\u00b0 les noms et pr\u00e9noms des propri\u00e9taires de tout immeuble et de toute partie d'immeuble, s'ils sont connus.\nDans le cas actuel, le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation de l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 certains lots de terre comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes personnes en tant que le fonds est concern\u00e9 et les appelants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s comme propri\u00e9taires de la coupe de bois sur ces m\u00eames lots. Il y a une \u00e9valuation distincte pour le fonds et pour la coupe de bois. Quand les taxes seront pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es, les appelants seront appel\u00e9s \u00e0 contribuer pour leurs coupes de bois.\nLa corporation intim\u00e9e avait-elle le droit d'inscrire les appelants sur le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation comme propri\u00e9taires des coupes de bois.2\nSi les appelants \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires du bois debout lui-m\u00eame, je n'h\u00e9siterais pas \u00e0 dire que oui. En d'autres termes, si nous \u00e9tions en pr\u00e9sence d'un droit de superficie, le conseil municipal aurait le droit de porter au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation le propri\u00e9taire du fonds et le propri\u00e9taire du droit de superficie; car alors il s'agirait d'un lot de terre poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et occup\u00e9 partie par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds et partie par le propri\u00e9taire superficiaire; et chacun de ces propri\u00e9taires pourrait \u00eatre tax\u00e9 pour la partie qu'il occupe. (Art. 16 al. 27, C.M.)\nPlaniol, vol. 1er, 4e \u00e9d., n\u00b0. 2572, dit:\nLa superficie formant, comme le fonds lui-m\u00eame, une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re (Besan\u00e7on, 12 d\u00e9c. 1864: D. 65-2-1, et la note) est par suite susceptible d'hypoth\u00e8que.\nProudhon, Trait\u00e9 des droits d'usage et du droit de superficie, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 604:\nLa superficie est un immeuble particulier qui, quoique reposant sur le sol d'autrui, a cependant son existence propre et ind\u00e9pendante de tout autre h\u00e9ritage \u2026 Et en cela il est d'une nature toute diff\u00e9rente de celle du droit d'usage qui, comme servitude r\u00e9elle, ne peut avoir une existence solitaire, m\u00eame civile, s\u00e9par\u00e9e du fonds auquel elle est due.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 5, 2\u00e8me \u00e9d., n\u00b0. 341, dit:\n2Le superficiaire n'a pas un simple droit d'usufruit mais bien un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. L'article 378 du code civil nous dit que les arbres sont immeubles tant qu'ils tiennent au sol par les racines. Alors s'ils appartiennent \u00e0 une personne diff\u00e9rente de celle qui a le fonds, ils sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre grev\u00e9s d'hypoth\u00e8ques, d'usufruit et de servitude, nous enseignent l\u00e9s auteurs suivants : Rolland de Villargues, vo. Superficie; Aubry & Rau, vol. 2, p. 440; Demolombe, vol. 9, n\u00b0. 483; Fuzier Herman, vo. Superficie: Planiol, 2\u00e8me \u00e9d., vol. 1er, no. 1182.\nLe droit de superficie n'est pas nomm\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans le code civil mais il n'en existe pas moins, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Cournoyer v. Cournoyer[5].\nMais nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence d'un droit de superficie.\nEn 1908, dans une cause de Laurentide Paper Co. v. Baptist[6], cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le droit de coupe constitue seulement un droit mobilier sur le bois quand il est coup\u00e9, et que l'enregistrement de ce droit ne pourrait donner au propri\u00e9aire de la coupe une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence contre l'acheteur subs\u00e9quent de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur laquelle ce droit de coupe peut s'exercer.\nCe jugement a \u00e9videmment incit\u00e9 la l\u00e9gislature \u00e0 faire l'amendement que nous retrouvons dans les statuts de 1912 quand on a amend\u00e9 l'article 381 du code civil.\nL'article 381 se lisait comme suit:\nSont immeubles par l'objet auquel ils s'attachent, l'emphyth\u00e9ose, l'usufruit des choses immobili\u00e8res, l'usage et l'habitation, les servitudes, les droits ou actions qui tendent \u00e0 obtenir la possession d'un immeuble.\nEt en 1912, on a ajout\u00e9 avant le mot \"servitude\" les mots suivants:\nle droit de coupe de bois perp\u00e9tuel ou pour un temps limit\u00e9. Si on avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider la pr\u00e9sente cause sous les dispositions du code civil, j'aurais \u00e0 dire que le droit de coupe de bois est un immeuble. Malheureusement pour l'intim\u00e9e, la d\u00e9finition faite du mot immeuble dans le code civil n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e au code municipal; et alors il faut avoir recours au code municipal pour d\u00e9cider la question qui nous est soumise. Or le code municipal, par sa d\u00e9finition du mot immeuble, art. 16 al. 27, n'a pas compris le droit de coupe de bois. Tous les droits immobiliers dont parle le code civil ne sont pas susceptibles d'\u00eatre tax\u00e9s, mais il n'y a que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ou les parties de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre impos\u00e9es.\nIl y a bien des immeubles d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme tels au code civil qui ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme immeubles au code municipal. Ainsi les servitudes, les droits concernant la possession d'un immeuble, le capital des rentes constitu\u00e9es, les deniers provenant du rachat de rentes constitu\u00e9es appartenant \u00e0 des mineurs, les sommes donn\u00e9es par les ascendants \u00e0 leurs enfants en consid\u00e9ration de leur mariage pour \u00eatre employ\u00e9es en achats d'h\u00e9ritages, sont des immeubles suivant le code civil (arts. 381 & 382) mais personne ne pr\u00e9tendrait que ces immeubles pourraient \u00eatre port\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation et seraient des immeubles sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9finition port\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 16, alin\u00e9a 27, du code municipal.\nIl est possible que le l\u00e9gislateur e\u00fbt l'intention en 1912 de constituer la coupe de bois comme susceptible d'\u00eatre tax\u00e9e, mais il ne l'a pas dit.\nIl est possible que tes Breakey soient propri\u00e9taires d'un droit de superficie et par cons\u00e9quent d'une partie de l'immeuble. Alors on aurait d\u00fb l'all\u00e9guer et le prouver: mais l'admission comporte seulement qu'ils sont les propri\u00e9taires non pas du bois lui-m\u00eame mais du droit de coupe. J'aurais d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 enclin \u00e0 renvoyer le dossier en cour sup\u00e9rieure pour faire la preuve certaine de la nature de leurs droits sur le bois, mais r\u00e9flexion faite, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il valait mieux disposer de la cause telle que les parties l'avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant nous avec leurs admissions. D'ailleurs si les demandeurs sont r\u00e9ellement propri\u00e9taires des arbres et si, en d'autres termes, leur droit est un droit de superficie, rien n'emp\u00eache de soumettre ce point aux tribunaux. Je consid\u00e8re qu'on ne pourrait pas alors invoquer chose jug\u00e9e, car ce n'est pas ce qui nous est soumis par le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nJe viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que nous devrions r\u00e9pondre n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 la question qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e par les parties.\nLe jugement a quo doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Les appelants qui ont acquis des droits de coupe de bois consid\u00e9rables dans la municipalit\u00e9 de Metgermette-Nord, se plaignent qu'on les ait entr\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation comme sujets aux taxes municipales \u00e0 raison de leurs droits de coupe de bois, et la question formul\u00e9e par les parties, et qui doit d\u00e9terminer le sort de cette cause, est de savoir si un propri\u00e9taire d'un droit de coupe de bois pour trente ans peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation sans \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire du fonds. La cour sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 cette question, mais la cour du Banc du Roi, les honorables juges Carroll et Pelletier diff\u00e9rant[7], a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, d\u00e9cidant que le droit de coupe de bois est assujetti aux taxes municipales impos\u00e9es en vertu du code municipal sur les immeubles. Il est hors de doute, depuis l'amendement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 Particle 381 du code civil, que le droit de coupe de bois, perp\u00e9tuel ou pour un temps limit\u00e9, se trouve dans la classe des immeubles par l'objet auquel ils s'attachent. Mais cette disposition du code civil ne r\u00e9sout pas la question qui nous est soumise. Il s'agit, au contraire, de savoir si ce droit immobilier est sujet \u00e0 la taxe sur les immeubles sous l'op\u00e9ration du code municipal. L'article 651, premier alin\u00e9a, de ce dernier code dit bien que\nsont des biens imposables tous les terrains, immeubles ou biens-fonds situ\u00e9s dans une municipalit\u00e9 locale, sauf ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans l'article 693.\nCependant il faut se reporter \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du paragraphe 27 de l'article 16 pour d\u00e9terminer la signification, pour les fins du code municipal et de l'article 651, des mots 'terrains, immeubles ou biens-fonds', et ce paragraphe dit :\nLes mots \"biens-fonds\" ou \"terrains\" ou \"immeubles\" d\u00e9signent toute terre ou toute partie de terre poss\u00e9d\u00e9e ou occup\u00e9e, dans une municipalit\u00e9, par une seule personne ou plusieurs personnes conjointes et comprennent les b\u00e2tisses et les am\u00e9liorations qui s'y trouvent.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de cela que ce que le code municipal consid\u00e8re comme \"biens imposables\" ce sont les choses et non les droits. Le droit, en un sens, est une' abstraction. C'est son objet qui le rend mobilier ou immobilier. Avant l'amendement de l'article 381 C. C, on consid\u00e9rait le droit de coupe de bois comme un droit mobilier, car son objet \u00e9tait le bois que le concessionnaire avait le droit d'aller couper et enlever: Laurentide Paper Company v. Baptist[8]. Le code civil maintenant le range parmi les droits qui sont immeubles par l'objet auquel us se rattachent. Mais cela n'entra\u00eene pas la cons\u00e9quence que ce soit une terre ou partie de terre. C'est tout simplement un droit, immobilier bien entendu, mais un droit qu'on ne saurait confondre avec une terre ou partie de terre Le savant avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question que je lui ai pos\u00e9e lors de l'audition, a dit qu'il entendait par \"partie de terre\" une partie physique de cette terre. Le texte anglais du paragraphe 27, qui parle de \"parcels of land\", d\u00e9montre bien qu'il en est ainsi. On pourra appliquer les mots \"partie de terre\" au cas, entre autres, o\u00f9 une terre se trouve dans deux ou plusieurs municipalit\u00e9s et alors chaque municipalit\u00e9 taxera la partie de cette terre qui se trouve dans ses limites. Mais cela me para\u00eetrait \u00eatre un abus de langage que de dire qu'un droit de coupe de bois est une partie de la terre o\u00f9 ce droit s'exerce, et il ne suffit pas que ce droit soit immeuble, il faut encore d\u00e9montrer que c'est un immeuble dans le sens que le code municipal, art. 16, parag. 27, donne \u00e0 ce mot.\nS'il suffisait de citer l'article 381 du code civil pour donner raison \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, il faudrait logiquement dire que le droit de servitude est imposable, car ce droit est \u00e9galement immeuble par l'objet auquel il se rattache. Or on ne soutiendrait pas s\u00e9rieusement cette proposition.\nOn dit que la concession d'un droit de coupe de bois sur une terre diminue la valeur de cette terre, que le propri\u00e9taire de la terre aurait le droit de faire \u00e9valuer sa terre sans le bois qui s'y trouve, et qu'alors ce bois qui fait partie de la terre serait exempt de taxes si on ne pouvait atteindre le concessionnaire du droit de coupe. Cet argument, qui me semble \u00eatre surtout un argument pour la l\u00e9gislature, ne me convainc pas. Il aurait autant de force dans le cas d'une terre grev\u00e9e d'une servitude, car cette servitude diminue plus ou moins, suivant sa nature plus ou moins on\u00e9reuse, la valeur de la terre sur laquelle elle s'exerce. Mais il ne s'agit pas ici de la vente du bois qui se trouve sur une terre, ni de la vente du droit de superficie, mais de la vente d'un droit de coupe de bois, et comme nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une d\u00e9finition adopt\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur, il faut se demander si cette d\u00e9finition comprend le droit de coupe de bois. Mon opinion est qu'elle ne le comprend pas.\nJe crois donc que la question soumise par les parties doit recevoir une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative. Avec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible pour les honorables juges de la cour du Banc du Roi qui ont exprim\u00e9 l'opinion contraire, je suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec les d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour du Banc du Roi et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Galipeault, St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, M\u00e9tayer & Devlin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Roy, Langlais, Lavergne, Langlais, Godbout & Tremblay.\n[1] [1919] Q.R. 29 K.B. 309.\n[2] [1908] 41 Can.

The appellants agreed to buy certain goods from A., who assigned, for an indebtedness, to the respondent bank his interest in the contract. A. later on shipped the goods, attached bills of lading to the drafts and delivered them to the bank, which credited A. with the proceeds of the drafts and forwarded them with the bills of lading to its branch where appellants accepted them and received the bills of lading. The bank brought action on the drafts but the appellants, having a claim for damages suffered by them by reason of A.'s breach of contract, set it off against the bank's claim.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the acceptance of the drafts by the appellants, with full knowledge of A.'s breach of contract, implies an acknowledgement of unconditional liability towards the respondent bank, which had no notice of the breach.\nThe appellants raised for the first time in this appeal the objection that the words \"and exchange,\" written on the bills without indicating the rate of exchange, prevented them from being for a sum certain under the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" section 28.\nPer Sir Louis Davies C.J., Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014This objection should not be entertained now, as, if it had been raised on the pleadings or at the trial, evidence might have been adduced to show, by custom of trade or otherwise, that these words import a definite and precise liability. Per Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014If these words have any application at all in the case of these inland bills, they cannot be taken to deprive the instruments before us of their character as bills of exchange because of any indefiniteness or uncertainty in the amount for which the acceptors became liable.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 482) affirmed, Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Simmons J. at the trial and maintaining the respondent's, plaintiff's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. B. Barron for the appellant.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent recovered judgment at the trial upon certain bills of exchange drawn by one Arnett, upon appellants, which were accepted by them.\nThe appellants had entered into a written contract with said Arnett, a manufacturer at Souris, Manitoba, for the manufacture by him of certain goods which were to be shipped for them to Calgary and ultimately used by them for their place of business in Calgary.\nThe bills of exchange in question were drawn by said Arnett at Souris and discounted with respondent at its Souris agency. These bills of exchange were respectively accompanied by shipping bills, or bills of lading, with instructions written at head of each draft \"hold for arrival of goods.\"\nAnd not until and evidently in consideration of the delivery of such bills of lading was the acceptance written by appellants of the bills of exchange now in question.\nOut of such an ordinary course of dealing we have presented in this appeal some remarkable contentions founded on the proposition that because the manufacturer, Arnett, had assigned (beyond question I assume as collateral security for advances made or to be made by respondent) the said contract to the respondent by the following memorandum:\u2014\nFor value received I hereby assign all my rights, title and interest in the attached contract between myself and the King George Ice Cream. Parlors dated February 10, 1919, and all the moneys payable thereunder and in the property therein mentioned, to the Union Bank of Canada.\nDated April 19th, 1919.\nT. L. Arnett\ntherefore any bills of exchange drawn by Arnett and discounted with respondent, though only accepted by appellants under circumstances as above related, were possibly worthless in the hands of the respondent and, at all events, were subject to be set off by any claim for damages suffered by appellants by reason of Arnett's breach of said contract.\nI submit such a proposition only needs to be stated to shew how very unfounded is this appeal. To my mind it is not arguable.\nThe respondent is suing upon a bill of exchange given for good and valuable consideration, accepted by appellants, as already stated in consideration of its delivery to them of the documents enabling them to get posses- sion of the goods. And there is no pretence of knowledge on the part of the respondent of any breach or notice by appellants to it, when so accepting these drafts, of breach or claim for damages in consequence thereof.\nEven if there had been it could not have put the appellants in any better position as against the respondent. I only mention it as one of the peculiarities of the case set up.\nThe contracts of appellants with respondent evidenced by these several acceptances are entirely collateral to the original contract and shew no privity of contract between the respondent and appellants founded on the said original contract.\nAnd, if possible, there is still less upon which to rest any equitable claim of set off, or anything to entitle the appellants to have respondent restrained from enforcing the clear undoubted claim it has in respect of each of said acceptances.\nThe respondent was the undoubted holder, in due course, of each of these bills of exchange, and entitled to recover from the appellants by reason of their respective acceptances thereof in consideration of the delivery of the bills of lading, or shipping bills, as more usually called in speaking of shipments by railway.\nAnd the question raised as to the certainty of the amount of each bill by reason of the use of the words \"and exchange\" which for a few minutes seemed to me the only serious point taken in the argument, seems to be answered in several ways.\nIn the first place the amount of such inland rate for cost of collection is well settled by daily practice forming part of our common knowledge and that specifically referred to in the Banking Act to be a clearly fixed sum. In the next place the memo written on the bill should be used in light of such common knowledge and it leaves no doubt in my mind of the exact sum covered by the use of these words.\nAnd again the original contract of appellants with Arnett expressly provides that appellants were to pay by accepting drafts\nto bear eight per cent per annum and bank charge for collection\nwhich latter phrase has a well known definite meaning.\nThere is also the suggestion, made by Mr. Clarke, of counsel for respondent, that the instrument, with the evidence connected therewith, was at all events evidence of a contract between the respondent and the appellants of the meaning of which there can be no doubt.\nAnd I may repeat that it was as such a collateral contract in no way dependent upon, or reduceable in effect by reason of the result of breaches by Arnett of the original contract.\nAnother point was faintly made by counsel for appellants that the only signature to the acceptance was that of Antoniou, which seems amply met by the following statement made on examination for discovery:\u2014\nQ. Were you authorized by your firm to accept these drafts and the contract, you have signed all of them I see, I do not see any other members of your firm on them?\nMr. Barron: You can take that as an admission from us that he was authorized and was acting on behalf of the King George Ice Cream Parlors and for his partners and whatever signing he did do, is the same as the signature of all the partners of the firm. I have told Mr. Carson I would admit that all the time. That will save you considerable time in getting an answer out of the witness.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs throughout. DUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014As between the respondent and the appellant the effect of the assignment of the 19th April, 1919, no doubt depends upon the Consolidated Ordinances, Ch. 21, sec. 10, s.s. 14 (\"The Judicature Ordinance\") but the rights of the bank and Arnett inter se are governed by the Manitoba statute in force at the date of the assignment, the effect of which appears to be that the bank acquired a legal title to Arnett's rights under his contract with the appellant. Apart from this statute the bank became, even without notice, the owner, at least in equity, of Arnett's rights.\nAt the date of the bills of exchange sued upon, June 10th, 1919, Arnett was largely indebted to the bank, considerably, that is to say, in excess of the aggregate of the three bills. The evidence makes it quite clear that the bills of lading were to be accompanied by drafts and I think the proper inference from the facts is that the parties recognized the legal position, namely, that the bank held the assignment and any rights accruing to Arnett under his contract with the appellant as security for his indebtedness and that the right given by the contract to require acceptance of drafts by the appellant was a right which Arnett was to exercise for the bank. This right, as between Arnett and the bank was, as already indicated, the bank's, the drafts were drawn for the immediate benefit of the bank, the discounting of the bills was, in substance, only a recognition of the bank's right and the bank's title, in other words, in substance the bank was the drawer of the bills. In these circumstances, with great respect, I cannot accept the view that the bank was a holder in due course. It follows, moreover, that the bank was merely in exercise of its rights under the contract and assignment. The acceptance which indeed was not strictly a voluntary acceptance, can be no answer to the appellant's claim to set up in reduction a right to reparation in damages arising from Arnett's failure to observe the terms of the contract. Such a claim is not a mere personal claim or defence but a claim arising out of the very transaction upon which in the view above expressed the bank's right to recover is based.\nNor am I able to understand how the appellant's right is affected by the fact that judgment has been recovered against Arnett. The doctrine of res judicata is founded in justice and convenience and has no application here; the right as against Arnett arises under the contract; the right of set-off against the claim of the bank rests upon the ground that the bank is not entitled to recover moneys which in the circumstances it would be unjust to call upon appellant to pay.\nANGLIN J.\u2014By accepting the bills of exchange sued upon, the appellants contracted directly and unconditionally with the respondent bank to pay to it the amounts thereof. An acknowledgement of absolute liability therefor was implied. The consideration for these contracts was the surrender of the bills of lading held by the bank. This alteration of the bank's position, quite apart from any right it may have as the \"holder in due course\" of negotiable paper, I think, precludes the defence of set-off of the appellants' claim for damages against Arnett, the drawer of the bills.\nMoreover, for the establishment of their right of recovery on their claim for damages the appellants must invoke the judgment pronounced, but not yet entered, in their action against Arnett. They cannot successfully prefer this inchoate judgment as establishing their right to damages and at the same time deny its effect as a merger of the cause of action on which it was pronounced merely because it had not been formally entered. If effective to establish their right to damages it must also operate to merge the claim for those damages which it is sought to set off in this action. That the judgment against Arnett can be set off against the plaintiff's claim is not contended.\nThe other grounds of appeal lack substance and even if well founded as answers to a claim dependent on the bank's status as a holder of the bills in due course being established, they would be ineffectual to defeat its claim based on its position as the holder of independent contractual rights on which the defendants are directly liable to it.\nPressing the defence that the acceptances by Basil Antoniou did not bind the firm of which he was a principal and his co-partners seems to me scarcely consistent with good faith in view of the following admission of counsel for the defendants on the examination of one of his clients for discovery.\nYou can take that as an admission from us that he (Antoniou) was authorized and was acting on behalf of the King George Ice Cream Parlors and for his partners and whatever signing he did do is the same as the signature to all the partners of all the firm. I have told Mr. Carson I would admit that all the time.\nThe objection based upon the insertion of the words \"and exchange\" in the bills is taken for the first time in this court. In my opinion it should not be entertained, as, if it had been raised on the pleadings or at the trial, evidence might have been adduced to shew that these words import a definite and precise liability. If they have any application at all in the case of these inland bills, I think they cannot be taken to deprive the instruments before us of their character as bills of exchange because of any indefiniteness or uncertainty in the amount for which the acceptors became liable.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014It is unfortunate for the appellants that before accepting the bills sued on, they did not consider the objections they now urge as reasons why they should not be held on their acceptances. The breach of contract they complain of had then occurred, and they nevertheless accepted the bills. They now say that as the drafts were attached to the bills of lading, they could not get the goods without accepting the drafts, but then, to get possession of the goods, they rendered themselves personally liable to the bank for payment, unless they can shew that the latter is in no better position than Arnett. The fact is, however, that the bank had made advances to Arnett in view of his contract with the appellants and had credited the five drafts drawn by him on the appellants against his overdraft so that there remained a credit in Arnett's favour of $360.00. The bank was therefore a holder in due course of the bills, and the appellants by accepting them, with full knowledge of Arnett's breach of contract, accepted an unconditional liability towards the bank and should not now be listened to when they attempt to offset Arnett's liability for breach of contract against the bank's claim against them on their acceptance of the bills. The fact that for greater security the bank took an assignment of Arnett's rights under his contract with the appellants is no reason for depriving it of its claim based on the appellants' acceptance.\nBut Mr. Barron now says, for the first time, that although the bills were accepted by Antoniou duly authorized by the other appellants, this is not in law an acceptance for the other appellants.\nAt the examination on discovery of Antoniou Mr. Barron made the following admission:\u2014 Q. Were you authorized by your firm to accept these drafts and the contract, you have signed all of them I see, I do not see any other members of your firm on them?\nMr. Barron. You can take that as an admission from us that he was authorized and was acting on behalf of the King George Ice Cream Parlors and for his partners and whatever signing he did do, is the same as the signature of all the partners of the firm. I have told Mr. Carson I would admit that all the time. That will save you considerable time in getting an answer out of the witness.\nIn view of this admission, which no doubt lulled the respondent into complete security on the question of Antoniou's authority to accept, I think Mr. Barron should not be listened to when he now attempts to escape from the effect of his admission, which I can only construe as fully recognizing that Antoniou's acceptance was the acceptance of the appellants.\nMr. Barron made another objection at the argument for the first time, and that is that the words \"and exchange\" in these bills without indicating the rate of exchange, prevented them from being for a sum certain, under the Bills of Exchange Act, sect. 28, parag. (d) of s.s. 1.\nHad this objection been made at the trial, it might have been shewn that these words have, by custom of trade or otherwise, a definite meaning well understood by the parties. It seems scarcely consistent with the rules of fair dealing in judicial proceedings to consider now such a technical objection, and I do not propose to do so.\nOn the whole I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 15 Alta.

C.\u2014(D.) 32-33 Vict, c. 29, s. 28\u2014(D.) 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9, s. 2.\nThe appellant was accused of an offence, punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding five years and for which he had the right of election to be tried by a judge or a jury. He first elected to be tried by a jury and, after the preliminary hearing, he was committed for trial. Whilst still in custody of the sheriff, he wrote to the latter that he was electing for a speedy trial and the sheriff notified the judge of the sessions of this election. He was then brought before a district magistrate and there elected for a speedy trial. Later on, the Attorney-General signed a declaration that the indictment has been on his order \"brought before the grand jury.\" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the appellant tried before a jury and found guilty.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the conviction of the appellant by a jury was legal.\nPer Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Duff J.\u2014The requirement signed by the Attorney-General was in compliance with section 825 Cr. C., as amended by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9. s. 2.\u2014Idington J. contra and Anglin J. semble.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The election for a speedy trial made by the appellant before a district magistrate was not valid, as it should have been made before the residing judge of the sessions of the Peace, according to section 827 Cr. C.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The election by the appellant for a speedy trial, contained in his letter to the sheriff, was valid, as being made in conformity with s.s. 2 of s. 828 Cr. C., and any subsequent irregularity could not affect the appellant's rights.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench affirmed, Idington J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Desy J., with a jury and dismissing the motion made by the appellant for a stated case.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nFernand Choquette for the appellant.\nLucien Cannon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014At the close of the argument on this appeal, I was of the opinion that the only arguable point requiring consideration was to the effect that the Attorney-General had not complied with the amendment to section 825 of the Criminal Code, 8-9 Ed. VII., Ch. 9, which enacted that\nwhere an offence charged is punishable with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may require that the charge be tried by a jury, etc.\nIt was admitted that the offence charged in the indictment came within this section.\nAfter examining the indictment filed with the record, it seems to me quite clear that there is nothing in this objection.\nThe indictment appears first to have been signed by the crown prosecutors on behalf of the Attorney-General under section 873, but in addition to this the Attorney-General personally signed a requirement on the back of the indictment that \"it should be brought before the grand jury.\" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the prisoner tried before a jury and found guilty. It seems to me therefore that the amending section of 825 has been fully complied with.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was brought before the magistrate of the District of Quebec upon the accusation of an offence which entitled him to a right of election to be tried by a judge or jury, and he elected the latter, on the 28th April, 1920. Thereupon he was duly committed for trial accordingly.\nOn the 5th of May, following, whilst still in custody of the sheriff, he availed himself of the privilege given by subsection 2 of section 828 of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows:\u2014\n2. Any prisoner who has elected to be tried by a jury may, notwithstanding such election, at any time before such trial has commenced, and whether an indictment has been preferred against him or not, notify the sheriff that he desires to re-elect, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the sheriff and judge or prosecuting officer to proceed as directed by section eight hundred and twenty-six.\nThe sheriff duly notified the judge of the sessions of this election.\nSome question is now raised, for the first time, as to whether the judge to whom the notice was delivered in fact was a judge of the sessions.\nThat, to my mind, is quite immaterial. When once the accused has duly made his election in the manner prescribed by the statute, he has duly established his right to be tried by a judge, unless by virtue of some other provision in the statutes that right has been overruled, or taken away.\nThere is no pretence herein that any such overruling of his election as was possible, under subsection 3 of the said section, was seriously considered and determined against him. No such contention has been set up. And if any mistake arose in the delivery of the sheriff's notice, when properly addressed as the record before us shews or in the proceedings thereon the prisoner must not suffer for that.\nWhat is relied upon with more assurance is that contained in the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1909, which, amongst other changes, amended section 825 as it theretofore stood by adding subsection 5, which reads as follows :\u2014\n5. Where an offence charged is punishable with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may require that the charge be tried by a jury, and may so require notwithstanding that the person charged has consented to be tried by the judge under this part, and thereupon the judge shall have no jurisdiction to try or sentence the accused under this part.\nUnder this sub-section undoubtedly the Attorney-General for the province can overrule the appellant's election.\nThe sole question with me herein is one of fact. Did the Attorney-General deliberately decide, in light of the foregoing facts, that the appellant should be deprived of his prima facie right of election to trial by a judge instead of by a jury?\nCuriously enough the opinion judgment of Mr. Justice Martin seems expressly to admit that the indictment upon which the appellant was convicted by the jury was\non the 9th of June * * * preferred against the accused before the Grand Jury of the District then in session, upon the order of the Attorney-General of the Province, under the provisions of Article 873 of the Criminal Code.\nAnd Mr. Justice Pelletier in like manner attributes such action as the Attorney-General took to have been done pursuant to same article 873 of the Criminal Code. That article reads as follows:\u2014\n873. The Attorney-General or any one by his direction or any one with the written consent of a judge of any court of criminal jurisdiction or of the Attorney-General, may prefer a bill of indictment for any offence before the grand jury of any court specified in such consent.\n2. Any person may prefer any bill of indictment before any court of criminal jurisdiction by order of such court.\n3. It shall not be necessary to state such consent or order in the indictment and an objection to an indictment for want of such consent or order must be taken by motion to quash the indictment before the accused person is given in charge.\n4. Except as in this part previously provided no bill of indictment shall be preferred in any province of Canada.\nIf what was done by the Attorney-General in way of the preferment by the indictment in question is attributable to the operation of said section, then, what was done by such preferment certainly does not fall within the meaning of the amendment of section 825, by adding subsection 5 above.\nUp to the time of this express amendment the Attorney-General could not, nor could any one on his behalf, take away the right of election given the accused, though the learned judge or prosecuting officer before him, had long had the power, under section 828, subsection 3, of refusing to allow the exercise of the right of re-election in special cases whenever they deemed it would not be in the interests of justice.\nThe occasion for this, by some mischance I am unable to understand, possibly never arose. A possibly accidental absence of the judge qualified to act is one surmise if, as suggested in argument, he who did act was not, but then that could not deprive accused of the election he made by his letter to the sheriff and forwarded by the sheriff's letter to the right judge.\nBe all that as it may, if the accused was not brought up before the right judge, as the statute requires, that was the fault of the prosecuting counsel, else we should not have the judicial assent indorsed on the sheriff's letter, and that did not take away this right of the accused, and due regard should have been had to the fact, on the motion to quash the indictment. Any irregularity on the part of the local authorities in the matter could not, as appears by Reg. v. Burke[1], affect the appellant's rights.\nWith great respect, neither of these learned judges in appeal seems to me accurately to have distinguished that which may rest upon section 873 from that which must rest upon section 825, subsection 5, added by the amendment of 1909. I agree with them that section 873 was all that parties acting had in mind. The former is intended to govern the right to go before a grand jury to prefer an indictment, which right at common law was possessed by all the King's subjects but, by later legislation, was cut down to what the Attorney-General might permit, or the learned judge presiding might, on application to him; permit or order.\nThat modern way of restricting and regulating proceedings before a grand jury was first introduced, so far as I can find, into Canada by the Act respecting Criminal Procedure of 1869, 32-33 Vict., Ch. 29, sec. 28, confined to something like half a dozen offences.\nNeedless to trace how this at one time known as relating to vexatious indictments was developed until the restriction became complete and was subjected to the requirements of said section 873, just quoted.\nIt is, however, imperatively necessary to bear in mind herein the origin and purpose of that section and its requirements as distinguishable from the origin and purpose of the later enactment of 1909, upon which the decision of this appeal should turn. The mode in which the numerous attorneys general of different provinces carried out the earlier enactment might vary in minor details and, especially in the method of expression adopted for causing those concerned to know and understand that required assent, no doubt differed.\nThat would, speaking generally, be a matter of minor consequence.\nIt is a very different object that is to be attained by the action of the Attorney-General upon the new section 825, subsection 5, quoted above, which involves the taking away of a right of election given to an accused person and implies the exercise of a kind of judicial power or authority which the Attorney-General is, I submit, expected by the amendment to specially direct his mind to in each case coming up for action. The power is expressly one given to him alone and cannot be transferred to another.\nI am unable to see on this record any clear exercise of any such power. What does appear therein seems to me more aptly attributable to the provisions of section 873 as, by two of the learned judges below, seems to have been inferred.\nWhat possible reason could exist for the exercise of such a power relative to what seems, at first blush, a very ordinary sort of offence?\nAnd again, if the Attorney General really intended to take away the right from an accused of trial before a judge, I should have expected I respectfully submit, to find it expressed by apt language which would have left no room for argument, and that which we are referred to does not express anything but what is consistent only with a direction under section 873. Moreover how could there have been left in the mind of any one concerned in the motion to quash the indictment, before accused was forced to plead thereto, any doubt or difficulty, for if in fact the fiat indorsed was in truth intended to mean what is contended for, surely in the City of Quebec, above all places, that could easily have been set at rest by an affidavit or otherwise.\nThose accused of crimes may, in the majority of cases, be at bottom in some minds entitled to very little consideration.\nBut we must guard their rights as sacredly as possible, and remember that society is not well served by the conviction of any man unless by due process of law strictly adhered to.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, for the reasons I have assigned, and that the right to have a case stated should have been given him and, by reason not only of default thereof but under and by virtue of the powers assigned in such event by sections 1018 and 1024, respectively, to the Court of King's Bench and this Court, the conviction should be quashed, or, if the majority of the court so conclude, referred back to the learned trial judge to state such case as he should have stated.\nSee The King v. H\u00e9bert[2], and Reg. v. Hogarth[3], as well as Reg. v. Burke[4], already cited.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nAnglin J.\u2014Only one of the objections to the validity of his conviction taken on behalf of the defendant calls for consideration. It is that based on the alleged absence from the record of anything which establishes the exercise by the Attorney-General of the power conferred on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825 of the Criminal Code (8-9 Ed. VII, e. 9, s. 2) to require that a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding five years shall be tried by a jury notwithstanding that he has consented to speedy trial by a judge. The jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench in proceeding with the trial of this case is thus challenged. If there was a valid election by the accused for a speedy trial, the jurisdiction of that court was thereby superseded (ss. 825, 827 and 833, Cr. C.; Reg v. Burke[5]; Rex v. Bissonnette[6], per Lamothe C.J.) and could be re-established only by the Attorney-General personally exercising the special power conferred on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825. Being a condition of jurisdiction the fact that the authority had been exercised should appear on the face of the proceedings. The ordinary presumption in favour of the jurisdiction of a superior court scarcely covers such a case.\nThe law does not prescribe any particular method in which the Attorney-General is to act. Neither is notice to any person or body required. Nor is it necessary that the Attorney-General should make his requisition in open court. I am satisfied that the indorsement over his signature on the indictment of his authorization for its presentment, provided it is couched in terms which unmistakably imply action under s.s. 5 of s. 825, will suffice.\nBut s. 873 Cr. C. likewise provides for the preferring of indictments by or on behalf of the Attorney-General before a grand jury. The power which that section confers, however, should not be exercised where the accused has already elected for speedy trial, and he may so elect after an indictment has been preferred under it. Giroux v. the King[7]. This latter step was not taken in the present case, counsel for the prisoner relying on what he assumed to have been a valid election for speedy trial already made in the Court of Sessions of the Peace, and the case appears to have proceeded in the Court of Appeal on the footing that such an election had been duly made.\nCounsel for the Attorney-General very frankly stated, in answer to a direct question put by me, that if the indictment now before us had been preferred under the authority of s. 873 it would have been in its present form and might have carried precisely the indorsement found upon it, namely:\nLe pr\u00e9sent acte d'accusation \"indictment'' est port\u00e9 devant le grand jury par ordre du soussign\u00e9 procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n9 juin 1920.\n(Sign\u00e9) L. A. Taschereau,\nProc. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la prov. de Quebec.\nIn other words, so far as the proceedings shew, the action taken by the Attorney-General in regard to the presentation of this indictment is referable quite as readily to s. 873 as to s.s. 5 of s. 825. It is therefore impossible to say that it imports a requisition under the latter provision. Under these circumstances, if there had been a valid election for speedy trial, in my opinion it would be extremely doubtful, to say the least, whether the conviction could stand and whether the motion to quash the indictment made on behalf of the accused before plea should not have prevailed. But I find it unnecessary to determine this question since, in addition to relying on the indorsement on the indictment as sufficient evidence of the exercise of the power conferred by s.s. 5 of s. 825, counsel representing the Attorney-General now insists, as it is quite within his right to do (a respondent may support the judgment a quo on any ground), that there was no valid election for a speedy trial because the attempt of the accused to make such an election did not take place before the judge of the Sessions of the Peace as contemplated by s. 827 Cr. C. Election before the prosecuting officer (s.s. 2) is not suggested.\nThe District Magistrate, Corriveau, before whom the record shews the accused was brought to make his election, was without jurisdiction to receive it because there was at that time a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the District of Quebec (s. 823 ii) as appears in the record and is admitted by counsel for the appellant.\nI cannot accede to the suggestion that the notice to the sheriff, not required in this case (s. 826), but provided for in other cases by ss. 825 (6), 828 (2), and 830 (2) itself constitutes an election. Where it is made part of the procedure, that notice is a preliminary step leading to the accused being given an opportunity to make his election by being brought before the proper officer for that purpose. But the statute makes it very clear that the election itself must take place before the judge or the prosecuting officer ss. 825 (7), 826 and 827.\nThere was therefore no election by the accused for a speedy trial sufficient to bring either ss. 3 and 4 of s. 827 or s. 833 into operation. It follows that, the jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench never having been superseded, its re-establishment by action of the Attorney-General under s. 825 (5) was not necessary. The indictment can be supported under s. 873.\nI regard this rather as a case of first election within s. 826 (7), than as a case of re-election within s. 828. Section 830 (2) would be applicable, however, if the accused upon withdrawing his original election for a summary trial had elected to be tried by a jury and the warrant of committal for trial had so stated. That warrant is not in the record, and the election which preceded it is stated in the proceedings to have been merely to proceed by preliminary investigation in lieu of summary trial.\nThere was evidence on which a jury could find the defendant guilty of the charge laid against him. Taken as a whole as it must be, the charge is not open to the objections raised. The sentence imposed, while apparently severe, was within the jurisdiction of the court. It is not within our province to review its propriety.\nThe defendant may have a real grievance in that he was not given the opportunity to which he was entitled of making an election for a speedy trial before a competent judicial officer. But I know of no redress for that grievance which it is open to us to accord him in this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel sous les dispositions de l'article 1024 du code criminel.\nLa question qui nous est soumise est de savoir si la Cour du Banc du Roi avait juridiction pour juger l'appelant. Ce dernier all\u00e8gue qu'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 sous l'article 446a du code criminel, il a opt\u00e9 pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif et que plus tard, malgr\u00e9 son option, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 par acte d'accusation devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 et condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 quinze ans de p\u00e9nitencier.\nLa Couronne pretend que l'appelant n'a jamais fait d'option valable et que, m\u00eame s'il en a fait une, le Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral avait le droit de le poursuivre par acte d'accusation devant la Cour du Banc du Roi sous les dispositions de l'article 825, s. 5 du code criminel.

G.P.\nLe mois n'est pas mentionn\u00e9, mais les parties reconnaissent que c'est le mois de mai et que les initiales T. et G. sont celles de Talbot et Gendron, Greffiers de la Paix.\nNous voyons ensuite sur le dos de la m\u00eame lettre l'entr\u00e9e suivante:\nQu\u00e9bec, 7 mai 1920.\nPr\u00e9sent: M. le Juge Corriveau, M.D.D.\nLe pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent, la d\u00e9cision sur son option pour proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif est ajourn\u00e9e au 10 mai 1920.\nGus. Chouinard,\nD.G.P.\nLes initiales M.D.D. signifient Magistrat de district et celles D.G.P. signifient D\u00e9put\u00e9 Greffier de la Paix.\nCes deux entr\u00e9es que nous retrouvons sur la lettre du sh\u00e9rif me paraissent peu explicites et correctes.\nD'abord le 5 mai il n'a pas pu y avoir d'option pour proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, car \u00e0 cette date l'accus\u00e9 n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 devant le Juge des Sessions. La lettre du sh\u00e9rif adress\u00e9e au Juge des Sessions n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e que le 6 mai et ce n'est que le 7 que le pr\u00e9venu compara\u00eet devant un juge, qui n'est pas, cependant, le Juge des Sessions mais un Magistrat de district, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui avait condamn\u00e9 l'accus\u00e9 \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s.\nIl est admis par les deux parties qu'il y a un juge des sessions \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nEn vertu du code criminel (Partie XVIII), les options pour proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditifs doivent avoir lieu (art. 827) devant le juge qui est d\u00e9fini par l'article 823 comme \u00e9tant le Juge des Sessions. Le magistrat de district, suivant ce dernier article, n'a juridiction que dans le cas o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de juge des sessions. Le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, n'avait donc pas juridiction dans le district de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 il y avait un juge des sessions. Par cons\u00e9quent, le pr\u00e9venu n'a donc pu faire d'option valable pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif.\nD'ailleurs a-t-il fait une option qui enlevait \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi toute juridiction?\nL'entr\u00e9e qui est sur la lettre du sh\u00e9rif, en date du 7 mai, d\u00e9montre qu'il n'y a pas eu d'adjudication sur l'option du pr\u00e9venu pour proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif. L'entr\u00e9e n'exprime probablement pas correctement ce qui a eu lieu. A raison de ce qui est survenu subs\u00e9quemment, je serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que ce jour-l\u00e0, le 7 mai, la Couronne a fait une demande ou bien a manifest\u00e9 l'intention d'avoir un proc\u00e8s par jury, et que la question est rest\u00e9e en suspens de savoir si l'accus\u00e9 serait jug\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour des Sessions ou \u00e0 la Cour Criminelle.\nAvant l'amendement de 1909 (8 et 9 Ed. 7, ch. 9, s. 2), le privil\u00e8ge de l'accus\u00e9 de choisir un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif \u00e9tait absolu; et du moment que son consentement pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif \u00e9tait inscrit au dossier, son proc\u00e8s devait avoir lieu conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la partie XVIII du code criminel (art. 825, s.s. 2, 3 et 4 code criminel, S.R.C. 1906) c'est-\u00e0-dire devant le Juge des Sessions de la Paix.\nLes amendements de 1909 ont ajout\u00e9 plusieurs autres sous-sections \u00e0 l'article 825, et notamment une \u00e0 l'effet que le Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral peut faire une demande que le proc\u00e8s ait lieu devant un jury.\nIl me semble que cette demande, si elle ne peut pas \u00eatre refus\u00e9e, ainsi que le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9, doit \u00eatre au moins consign\u00e9e au dossier de la cause afin d'\u00e9voquer la cause devant la Cour du Banc du Roi ou bien d'enlever au Juge des Sessions toute juridiction. Dans la cause actuelle, je suis d'opinion que l'accus\u00e9 a bien d\u00e9sir\u00e9 opter pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif: mais son consentement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait devant le juge comp\u00e9tent. Alors le Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral pouvait, sous l'article 873 du code criminel, porter un acte d'accusation devant le Grand Jury.\nL'appelant se plaint aussi de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 des instructions du juge au jury, mais il n'y a rien dans ces instructions qui violent aucun principe de droit. Quant aux faits nouveaux qu'il pr\u00e9tend avoir d\u00e9couvert depuis le proc\u00e8s et quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la sentence, ce sont des questions qui ne sauraient justifier notre intervention.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nMignault J.\u2014Il y a deux questions \u00e0 examiner sur cet appel, car les autres griefs d'appel, dans mon opinion, sont mal fond\u00e9s; 1\u00b0 L'appelant a-t-il r\u00e9ellement opt\u00e9 pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif; 2\u00b0 S'il y a eu telle option, l'acte d'accusation (indictment) sur lequel le proc\u00e8s a eu lieu d\u00e9montre-t-il que le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec exer\u00e7ait le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 5 de l'article 825 du code criminel, ou bien celui de l'article 873 du m\u00eame code, qui permet au procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants de soumettre un acte d'accusation au grand jury? Le pouvoir exerc\u00e9 sous l'article 825, al. 5, est d'une port\u00e9e plus consid\u00e9rable que celui que conf\u00e8re l'article 873, car il rend sans effet l'option pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif. Mais lorsque telle option n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement faite, il va sans dire que l'acte d'accusation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sous l'op\u00e9ration de l'article 873, conf\u00e8re pleine juridiction \u00e0 la cour qui juge le proc\u00e8s. Du reste, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, le magistrat de district avait fait l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire et avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait lieu de faire subir un proc\u00e8s au pr\u00e9venu, de sorte que l'acte d'accusation aurait pu \u00eatre soumis au grand jury sans l'ordre du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nMaintenant y a-t-il eu option du pr\u00e9venu pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif? Si j'arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la r\u00e9ponse doit \u00eatre dans la n\u00e9gative, je n'aurai pas besoin d'exprimer d'opinion sur la deuxi\u00e8me question.\nIl est hors de doute que l'appelant d\u00e9sirait avoir un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, mais le d\u00e9sir ne suffit pas, il faut que l'option elle-m\u00eame soit faite devant une personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 la recevoir. A cet \u00e9gard, les parties admettent qu'il y a \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec un juge des Sessions de la Paix, l'honorable M. Choquette. Il y a aussi un magistrat de district, M. Phil\u00e9as Corriveau.\nApr\u00e8s son arrestation, l'appelant fut amen\u00e9 devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix, o\u00f9 il fit option pour un proc\u00e8s sommaire. Il lui fut cependant permis plus tard de se d\u00e9sister de cette option, et de proc\u00e9der par enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Cette enqu\u00eate, si le magistrat trouvait mati\u00e8re \u00e0 proc\u00e8s, pouvait, suivant son choix, le conduire soit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix, soit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s devant la cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant au criminel. Pour le premier, le proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, il fallait une option du pr\u00e9venu: pour le second, le proc\u00e8s devant la cour du Banc du Roi, aucune option n'\u00e9tait requise.\nLe 5 mai 1920, le magistrat de district d\u00e9clara, je l'ai dit, qu'il y avait mati\u00e8re \u00e0 proc\u00e8s. Le m\u00eame jour les procureurs de l'appelant \u00e9crivirent au sh\u00e9rif de Qu\u00e9bec le notifiant que leur client d\u00e9sirait opter pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif et le pri\u00e8rent, en cons\u00e9quence, d'amener l'accus\u00e9 devant la cour des sessions dans le plus court d\u00e9lai possible afin qu'il p\u00fbt faire sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 cet effet. Sur r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, le sh\u00e9rif, le 6 mai, \u00e9crivit au juge des Sessions de la Paix, l'informant que l'accus\u00e9\nd\u00e9clare maintenant faire option pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif.\nD'apr\u00e8s le code criminel, article 826, paragraphe 1er,\nTout sh\u00e9rif doit, dans les vingt-quatre heures apr\u00e8s qu'un pr\u00e9venu ainsi que ci-haut est pr\u00e9ventivement incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 en attendant son proc\u00e8s, informer le juge par \u00e9crit que ce pr\u00e9venu est ainsi incarc\u00e9r\u00e9, relatant son nom et la nature de l'accusation port\u00e9e contre lui, sur quoi le juge fait compara\u00eetre le pr\u00e9venu devant lui sous le plus court d\u00e9lai possible.\nRemarquons que par l'expression \"juge,\" la loi entend, dans le cas du district de Qu\u00e9bec, le juge des sessions (art. 823 code crim.). Lorsque le pr\u00e9venu est amen\u00e9 devant le juge, celui-ci, apr\u00e8s avoir pris communication des d\u00e9positions \u00e0 la suite desquelles le pr\u00e9venu a \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9:\n(a) fait conna\u00eetre au prisonnier de quelle infraction il est accus\u00e9 et lui en d\u00e9crit la nature; et (b) lui explique qu'il peut, \u00e0 son choix, subir son proc\u00e8s imm\u00e9diatement devant un juge sans l'intervention d'un jury, ou rester en prison ou sous caution, selon que la cour en d\u00e9cide, pour subir son proc\u00e8s de la mani\u00e8re ordinaire devant la cour qui a juridiction criminelle. (Art. 827 code criminel.)\nSi, lors, de cette comparution devant le juge, le pr\u00e9venu consent \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s devant lui, sans l'intervention d'un jury, le proc\u00e8s qu'on appelle exp\u00e9ditif se fait devant le juge.\nD'apr\u00e8s l'article 828, paragraphe 2,\ntout prisonnier qui a opt\u00e9 pour le proc\u00e8s devant un jury, peut nonobstant l'option ainsi faite, en tout temps avant le commencement du proc\u00e8s, et soit qu'une accusation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non port\u00e9e contre lui, notifier, au sh\u00e9rif, qu'il d\u00e9sire revenir sur sa d\u00e9cision; sur quoi le sh\u00e9rif et le juge ou le fonctionnaire poursuivant doivent suivre la proc\u00e9dure prescrite par l'article huit cent vingt-six. Cette notification au sh\u00e9rif se fait dans le cas o\u00f9 un pr\u00e9venu, qui a opt\u00e9 pour le proc\u00e8s devant un jury, d\u00e9sire revenir sur sa d\u00e9cision, et alors le sh\u00e9rif et le juge doivent suivre la proc\u00e9dure prescrite par l'article 826 dont j'ai cit\u00e9 le premier alin\u00e9a. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, l'appelant n'avait pas opt\u00e9 en faveur d'un proc\u00e8s devant un jury, mais avait choisi une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, laquelle, je l'ai dit, pouvait conduire soit au proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif devant le juge des sessions, soit au proc\u00e8s ordinaire devant un jury.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 828 suppose qu'il y a eu choix d'un proc\u00e8s devant un jury, choix que le pr\u00e9venu d\u00e9sire r\u00e9tracter. Il y a une disposition au m\u00eame effet, et pour le m\u00eame cas de r\u00e9tractation d'option, aux alin\u00e9as 2 et 3 de l'article 830. Il y a \u00e9galement une disposition semblable \u00e0 l'article 825, paragraphe 6, pour les accus\u00e9s sous caution, mais il n'y est pas question de r\u00e9tractation d'option, mais du choix d'un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif.\nApparemment on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ici comme si l'appelant avait choisi un proc\u00e8s par jury et voulait revenir sur ce choix, car c'est dans ce cas qu'on s'adresse au sh\u00e9rif lorsque le pr\u00e9venu est incarc\u00e9r\u00e9. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, le sh\u00e9rif a inform\u00e9 par \u00e9crit le juge des sessions que l'appelant d\u00e9sirait maintenant fake option pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif.\nSur r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, le juge des sessions aurait d\u00fb faire compara\u00eetre le pr\u00e9venu devant lui, et lui faire les d\u00e9clarations exig\u00e9es par l'article 827, et c'\u00e9tait alors le moment de faire l'option d'un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif. Au lieu de cela, le 7 mai, on a fait compara\u00eetre l'appelant devant le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, et une inscription au dos de la lettre du sh\u00e9rif\u2014il semble au moins qu'on aurait d\u00fb faire une entr\u00e9e au registre\u2014indique que, le pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent, la d\u00e9cision pour son option pour proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif est ajourn\u00e9e au 10 mai. En regard, on a \u00e9crit :\nLe Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy, option pour proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif. Prod. le 5, 1920,\navec les initiales des greffiers de la paix au bas.\nEst-ce pour la raison que M. Fernand Choquette, avocat de l'appelant, nous a indiqu\u00e9e, de sa parent\u00e9 avec l'honorable M. Choquette, juge des sessions, dont il est le fils, que M. Corriveau, le magistrat de district, a si\u00e9g\u00e9 le 7 mai? Les dispositions du code de proc\u00e9dure civile qui auraient emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Fernand Choquette de compara\u00eetre devant son p\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re civile ne s'appliquent \u00e9videmment pas \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s devant une juridiction criminelle, et alors que j'appr\u00e9cie hautement le sentiment de d\u00e9licatesse qu'invoque le savant avocat de l'appelant, qui a tr\u00e8s habilement plaid\u00e9 cette cause, il est \u00e9vident qu'on devait ici suivre la proc\u00e9dure qu'indique le code criminel. Or malheureusement c'est devant le juge des sessions que devait se faire l'option d'un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, en r\u00e9ponse aux d\u00e9clarations que celui-ci devait faire au pr\u00e9venu au d\u00e9sir de l'article 827; et comme il s'agit d'une mati\u00e8re de juridiction de droit commun, et que la proc\u00e9dure par voie de proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif est de nature exceptionnelle, et exige le consentement du pr\u00e9venu devant le juge des sessions, je ne puis arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que la Cour du Banc du Roi, si\u00e9geant au criminel, qui est la juridiction de droit commun, a \u00e9t\u00e9 dessaisie de la cause par ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 devant le magistrat de district.\nLes honorables juges de la cour d'appel paraissent avoir pris pour acquis qu'il y avait eu choix d'un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif. Le fait qu'ils n'ont pas discut\u00e9 la question dont je viens de parler me dispose \u00e0 croire qu'elle a pu n'avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant eux. Mais \u00e9videmment cette question est pr\u00e9judicielle, car s'il n'y a pas eu choix r\u00e9gulier d'an proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, il n'importe nullement que le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n'ait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 express\u00e9ment qu'il exigeait le proc\u00e8s devant un jury malgr\u00e9 l'option pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif. Je n'ai donc pas \u00e0 exprimer d'opinion sur la question que les honorables juges de la cour d'appel ont longuement discut\u00e9e.\nLes autres moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l'appelant, je l'ai dit, sont dans mon opinion mal fond\u00e9s. L'appel doit donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant : Fernand Choquette.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Marchand & Cannon.\n[1] [1893] 24 O.

In 1867, he bequeathed it to seven legatees who were thus joint undivided proprietors, one of whom was his daughter, D., owner of one-eighth of the property. In 1879, being indebted to the respondent, D. signed a deed of obligation in his favour and, as collateral security, D. transferred to the respondent all her rights in the above property. In 1899, the respondent obtained judgment for the amount then due which was never registered nor executed. The whole property was then assessed for taxing purposes under the name of \"Estate O.\" without any objection on the part of the respondent who never concerned himself about the property. In 1902, the appellants, two of the legatees, purchased about the two-thirds of the shares of their co-legatees, with the exception of those of D. and others which they tried but failed to acquire. Up to two years previous to 1906, the municipal taxes had been paid, without the evidence showing positively by whom. In 1907, the taxes not having been paid for more than two years, the property was sold by the municipality and adjudicated to the appellants who were the only bidders. Two years later, they became absolute owners by virtue of a deed of sale from the municipality. In 1912, the respondent took an action to set aside the adjudication and the deed of sale, alleging fraud on the part of the appellants and also irregularities in the proceedings of the sale. Held Sir Louis Davies C. J. and Brodeur J. dissenting, that the appellants, as co-owners of the property, were not in law bound to pay the taxes or to give to the respondent notice of the sale and that there was no fraud on their part in making use of the means of a sale for taxes in order to dissolve the undivided ownership.\nPer Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The first offer, even if the only one, made in a sale for taxes, is an \"ench\u00e8re\" within the meaning of Art. 1001 M.C.\nPer Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The party owing municipal taxes is not deprived of the right to bid and be declared purchaser of the property sold by the municipality for the payment of those taxes.\nPer Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The property having been entered on the valuation roll under the name of \"Estate O.\" without any objection by the respondent the sale ought to be considered as made super domino.\nPer Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The seizure and the sale of the goods and chattels of the party owing municipal taxes is not a preliminary condition to the sale of the immovable property, the provision of Art. 962 M.C. being permissive and not imperative.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The respondent was not the \"owner\" of the eighth undivided part transferred to him by D.\nPer Brodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014The evidence is sufficient to create the presumption that the appellants were in possession, if not of the whole property, at least of the seven-eighths part of it, and they were bound in the circumstances of this case to pay all the taxes due on it or to give notice to the respondent of the sale of the property for taxes due.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench reversed, Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Belleau J.[1] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. Roy K.C. for appellant.\nAug. Lemieux K.C. and Paul Robitaille for respondent. The Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, affirming that of the Superior Court[2], confirmed. I agree generally with the reasons stated by my brother Brodeur J., but I prefer to base my opinion upon the ground that the non-payment of the taxes on the lands in question and for which they were sold and bought in by the defendants constitute, under the facts in this case, a deliberate fraud on the part of the defendants as against the plaintiff.\nThese defendants were the owners of the lands in question but subject to a security for the payment of $500 loaned by the plaintiff to one Diana O'Connell, a sister of James O'Connell and a legatee for one-eighth of the latter's interest in the lands in question.\nThe plaintiff was a non-resident in the municipality but the security held by him for the $500 loan was well known to defendants, as clearly appears from the evidence.\nThe defendants were and had been for years in the possession of these lands and had received whatever revenues they yielded, paying the taxes thereon regularly until the year 1906. They attempted to purchase the plaintiff's claim in an undivided one-eighth interest, but the negotiations to that end were not successful. I think the facts proved leave only one fair inference to be drawn, namely, that, after such failure, they determined not to pay the accruing taxes and not to notify the plaintiff of their intended default, and in this way to have the lands sold and purchase them in at the sale and so destroy and defeat plaintiff's title under his security. By their previous action for years in receiving the revenues and paying the taxes on the lands they had lulled the plaintiff into a false security. Having paid all municipal taxes up to the year 1906 and having failed in their efforts to purchase plaintiff's undivided interest, their secret determination not to pay the accruing taxes and to have the land sold under the statute for their non-payment and bought in by themselves without any notice whatever to the plaintiff and so destroy his security and his interest in the land, amounted, in my opinion, in view of the facts, to a deliberate fraud upon the plaintiff which the law will not sanction or approve.\nThe learned Chief Justice Lamothe, of the Court of King's Bench, who dissented from the judgment of that court, held that, while the dealings and omissions of the defendants in regard to their non-payment of the taxes in order to have the lands sold\nwere approaching bad faith, they did not actually constitute fraud\nAs I have already stated, in my opinion, this conduct and deliberate neglect on defendants' part without giving plaintiff the slightest notice of their intentions, not only approached bad faith but, under the circumstances of this case, actually constituted fraud.\nIdington J.\u2014There is nothing in the evidence in this case to establish any legal obligation on the part of the appellants to continue to pay taxes, even if we assume, which is not proven, that they, or some of them, had, for some years, paid taxes for the benefit of respondent and themselves.\nNor is there anything in statute law, or otherwise, prohibiting a part owner from buying at a tax sale lands in which he has merely an interest. The reliance placed by Mr. Justice Martin upon Art. 748 C.C.P., which he links up with Art. 1591 C.C., with deference, does not seem to me to be warranted. Indeed it seems a straining of the language used, and overlooks the basis for the rule contained in said Art. 748 C.C.P.\nIt no doubt originated in the fact that the parties to such sales as contemplated thereby had often much to do with the conduct of the sale; whereas the tax sale originated in quite another way and is something with the conduct of which the owner or debtor has nothing to do.\nI am unable to appreciate, at the value respondent does, the subtle argument that there must be more than one bidder.\nIf adopted herein I fear we would be endangering many titles resting upon tax sales.\nThere is, if my memory serves me rightly, an Ontario decision setting aside tax sales when the group attending same agreed, improperly, to refrain from bidding against each other, thereby defeating the purpose of the Act there in question.\nAll we have here is that the respondent seems to have expected his co-owners in part to have gone on paying the taxes without any contribution from him.\nWithout more than appears in the evidence it does not become one suffering from his own neglect of duty to complain.\nThe assessment being made en bloc to the estate of somebody, did not seem to me quite regular until I turned to the statute and was surprised to find that it expressly provided for such mode of assessment in such like cases, yet not expressly covering en bloc assessments of distinctly separate parcels.\nAt all events no one speaking judicially seems to have considered it worthy of serious mention, and all assume such an assessment legally possible. If the assessment in that form was valid when the roll completed, how can the appellant purchasers who had not a common interest with respondent throughout the entire block sold, but only in one item of part thereof (Lot 266) be spoken of as joint owners or co-owners?\nAnd how can they be held to have been impliedly, with him, joint debtors to the municipality?\nAnd how can any such assumed legal relationship, under such circumstances, be of any consequence in the disposition of this case?\nAnd how can the debt due the municipality be of any consequence under such circumstances in determining the right of any one or more of such parties to bid and buy the whole block as offered?\nThey had no joint interest in the whole property so sold. They were neither joint owners nor joint debtors.\nI see no ground upon which the respondent can in law say they (the appellants) were, as purchasers, simply relieving him from paying the taxes upon that part in which he had an interest.\nWith these observations I fully agree in the main with the judgments of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Greenshields.\nI would therefore, allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014I find myself fully in accord with the views expressed in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Greenshields.\nThe appeal, should, I think, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014I concur in the conclusions reached by my brother Mignault, whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading, and generally in the reasons on which they are founded.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014Il s'agit de la validit\u00e9 de la vente d'un immeuble pour taxes municipales. Cette vente est attaqu\u00e9e par Lef\u00e8vre parce qu'elle serait entach\u00e9e de fraude et parce qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite ill\u00e9galement. Les d\u00e9fendeurs-appelants sont les acqu\u00e9reurs de cet immeuble.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure[3] a maintenu l'action pour les deux motifs qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s, soit la fraude et l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 le dispositif de ce jugement sans en adopter tous les consid\u00e9rants.\nLes ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s invoqu\u00e9es \u00e9taient nombreuses et elles ont donn\u00e9 heu \u00e0 une grande divergence d'opinion parmi les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. L'opinion de la majorit\u00e9 est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les termes suivants du jugement de cette cour:\nConsidering that the two lots of land numbers two hundred and sixty-six (266) and three hundred and sixty (360) of the cadastre of the parish of Ste-Foy were assessed together in the name of the Estate John O'Connell, whom the appellants represent, and the latter were liable towards the said municipal corporations for the payment of all the municipal taxes due for Lot No. 360 and seven eighths of those on Lot 266, and which the appellants made default to pay.\nConsidering that, although the proceeding of the sixth of March, 1907, took the form of a tax sale, it was in reality only a payment by the appellants to the said municipal corporation of a' debt they and the respondent Lef\u00e8vre owed that corporation the said tax sale did not under the circumstances disclosed and established in this case vest the appellants with a title to respondent's Lef\u00e8vre one undivided eighth interest in said lot 266. This Court, without adopting all the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment appealed from, to wit, the judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Quebec herein rendered on the third day of October, one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, doth confirm the said judgment as to its dispositif.\nEn d'autres termes, la Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 simul\u00e9e et n'a jamais exist\u00e9 valablement et que le pr\u00e9tendu prix d'achat vers\u00e9 par les appelants ne constituait, apr\u00e8s tout, que le paiement de la taxe municipale auquel les d\u00e9fendeurs, comme seuls propri\u00e9taires ou propri\u00e9taires conjoints de l'immeuble vendu, \u00e9taient tenus.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans ses consid\u00e9rants avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les d\u00e9fendeurs-appelants avaient eu la possession de cet immeuble et en avaient pay\u00e9 les taxes municipales. La majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi est venue \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion, savoir que les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient en possession de cet immeuble et qu'ils en avaient pay\u00e9 les taxes.\nL'honorable juge-en-chef Lamothe, qui \u00e9tait dissident en faveur des appelants, d\u00e9clare lui aussi:\nLes appelants poss\u00e9daient les immeubles et ils en retiraient les revenus\u2014s'il y avait des revenus, ce qui n'appara\u00eet pas.\nL'honorable juge Greenshields, qui \u00e9tait aussi dissident, ne nous dit pas formellement qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas en possession, mais il rapporte des faits qui ne sont pas prouv\u00e9s. Voici, en effet, ce qu'il dit:\nPrevious to the death of the testator, James O'Connell, the property in question had been entered for taxing purposes in the books of the local corporation of Ste-Foye under the name of John O'Connell. After his death none of the legatees made any application to have his or her or their names entered upon these books, and none were entered, and the property appeared as belonging to the estate of James O'Connell, and the two lots, 266 and 360, were continuously and without interruption valued by the municipality for taxing purposes en bloc and were assessed as belonging to the estate James O'Connell. Il n'y a pas un seul mot de preuve dans la cause sur la mani\u00e8re dont les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9es avant la mort du testateur James O'Connell. Par cons\u00e9quent, on ne peut pas dire si le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation portait alors le nom de John O'Connell plut\u00f4t que celui de James O'Connell. Je crois que l'honorable juge a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 ce sujet.\nLe seul t\u00e9moignage que nous avons sur ce point est celui du s\u00e9cr\u00e9taire de la corporation municipale de Ste-Foy, M. Robitaille. Or cet officier ne parle nullement des r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation qui existaient \u00e0 la mort de James O'Connell en 1870. Son t\u00e9moignage ne porte que sur les r\u00f4les de 1896 \u00e0 1907.\nLes appelants, malgr\u00e9 l'opinion quasi unanime des cours inf\u00e9rieures sur cette question de possession disent que cette preuve de possession n'existe pas dans le dossier, et que les dispositifs des deux jugements des cours inf\u00e9rieures, \u00e9tant bas\u00e9s sur cela, ils devaient \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nD'ordinaire nous ne renversons pas les jugements sur des questions de faits quand les cours inf\u00e9rieures en sont venues \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. Mais comme je vois que quelques-uns de mes coll\u00e8gues sont d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas de preuve pour justifier cette opinion des cours inf\u00e9rieures, je me vois dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'analyser la preuve et les faits de la cause.\nIl est vrai que la preuve directe de ces faits n'est pas aussi claire qu'elle aurait d\u00fb ou pu l'\u00eatre; mais cela est d\u00fb \u00e0 la mauvaise foi apparente de la d\u00e9fenderesse dans son t\u00e9moignage. Le demandeur l'a examin\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin et elle s'est content\u00e9e de dire qu'elle ne connaissait rien et que le tout avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par son fils, l'autre d\u00e9fendeur, qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 avant l'audition des t\u00e9moins. Elle refuse m\u00eame de dire si elle a fait certains contrats, lorsque ces contrats portent sa signature. Je suis d'opinion que la preuve est suffisante pour cr\u00e9er une pr\u00e9somption que les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient en possession et qu'ils payaient les taxes.\nVoici les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve:\nEn 1870, James O'Connell mourait laissant un testament par lequel il divisait ses biens entre ses enfants et ses petits-enfants par parts in\u00e9gales.\nParmi ses biens se trouvaient les lots 266 ct 360 du cadastre de Ste-Foye.\nL'une des filles de James O'Connell, qui s'appelait Diana et qui avait h\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'un huiti\u00e8me des biens, a, le 9 avril 1879, transport\u00e9 au demandeur Lef\u00e8vre ses droits successifs et notamment un huiti\u00e8me du lot n\u00b0 266 en garantie d'un pr\u00eat que Lef\u00e8vre lui avait fait.\nElle partit ensuite pour aller demeurer aux Etats-Unis, ainsi que la plupart des l\u00e9gataires et h\u00e9ritiers de James O'Connell, \u00e0 l'exception de John O'Connell, le mari de la d\u00e9fenderesse, et le d\u00e9fendeur William John O'Connell et son fr\u00e8re et ses soeurs.\nCes derniers sont rest\u00e9s en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nNous n'avons pas les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation de 1879 \u00e0 1896, mais au r\u00f4le qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en 1896, Madame Veuve John O'Connell, la d\u00e9fenderesse, y est entr\u00e9e comme propri\u00e9taire et un nomm\u00e9 Giroux comme locataire.\nAu r\u00f4le fait en 1899 le nom de Giroux n'appara\u00eet plus comme locataire et le nom du propri\u00e9taire est transcrit comme suit: \"Succession Dame Veuve John O'Connell.\"\nEntr\u00e9e bien singuli\u00e8re si l'on consid\u00e8re que Madame Veuve O'Connell \u00e9tait encore vivante. Mais cette entr\u00e9e peut s'expliquer par le fait que les enfants de John O'Connell, notamment le d\u00e9fendeur William-John alias James O'Connell et Mary Maria O'Connell avaient des parts indivises dans ces immeubles et alors on a, tout de m\u00eame improprement, d\u00e9crit les propri\u00e9taires comme \u00e9tant \"Succession Dame Veuve John O'Connell.\"\nMaintenant il ne faut pas confondre le testateur, James O'Connell, avec John O'Connell, son fils, le mari de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Cette d\u00e9signation \"Succession Dame Veuve John O'Connell\" qu'on rel\u00e8ve dans le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation de 1899 s'applique \u00e9videmment au fils John et non \u00e0 son p\u00e8re, le testateur, qui s'appelait James, car si on avait voulu par l\u00e0 d\u00e9signer le terrain comme appartenant \u00e0 la succession James O'Connell on n'aurait pas d'abord dans le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation de 1896 port\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au nom de \"Dame Veuve John O'Connell\" et ensuite dans le r\u00f4le de 1899 au nom de \"Succession Dame Veuve John O'Connell.\"\nDans cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e 1899, la d\u00e9fenderesse a tent\u00e9 d'acheter les droits de Diana O'Connell dans cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le demandeur lui-m\u00eame a re\u00e7u des avocats des appelants une lettre lui demandant s'il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 vendre ses droits. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 ces offres.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient plus heureux avec la plupart des autres co-h\u00e9ritiers qui leur vendaient leurs parts indivises par acte fait le 8 mars 1902. Les parts indivises qui y sont c\u00e9d\u00e9es y sont erron\u00e9ment d\u00e9crites mais cela ne saurait affecter le pr\u00e9sent litige.\nJe note tout de m\u00eame dans cet acte que \"Mrs. Mary Stuart Munro, widow of the late John O'Connell,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9fenderesse, \u00e9tait alors co-propri\u00e9taire avec les h\u00e9ritiers de James O'Connell. Comment \u00e9tait-elle devenue propri\u00e9taire? On ne le sait pas. Mais tout de m\u00eame il fait bon de signaler ce fait comme partie des pr\u00e9somptions qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir sa possession et son administration des immeubles en question. En 1902, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est encore port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation fait cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 sous le nom de \"Succession Veuve John O'Connell\" et il en est de m\u00eame sur celui de 1905.\nC'est sur cette succession que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue par le conseil de comt\u00e9, pour taxes, le 6 mars 1907.\nApr\u00e8s cet expos\u00e9 de faits il me semble qu'il ne peut pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9tendu que les d\u00e9fendeurs n'\u00e9taient pas en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Comme propri\u00e9taires indivis ils \u00e9taient soumis au paiement des taxes qui grevaient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ces taxes frappaient non-seulement toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mais chaque part indivise de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (art. 1983, 2017 C.C., 946 C.M.). Si les d\u00e9fendeurs n'avaient pas de titre pour toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ils \u00e9taient pour le moins propri\u00e9taires indivis pour la plus grande partie, probablement \u215e, quand la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tax\u00e9e et ensuite vendue pour d\u00e9faut de paiement des taxes. Alors la portion indivise dont les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e au paiement des taxes municipales.\nDans les cours inf\u00e9rieures on a pris comme acquis le fait que les taxes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es par les d\u00e9fendeurs jusque vers 1902. Ils \u00e9taient en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 soit personnellement, ainsi que le constate le r\u00f4le de 1896, soit comme repr\u00e9sentants et h\u00e9ritiers de John O'Connell. Ils ont d\u00fb retirer les revenus de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 m\u00eame ces revenus ont d\u00fb payer les taxes municipales, puisque leur co-propri\u00e9taire, le demandeur, n'en a jamais pay\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. Il serait inconcevable de croire que la corporation municipale aurait pass\u00e9 vingt ans sans percevoir les cotisations qui frappaient cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils g\u00e9raient au moins la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui appartenait \u00e0 autrui pour partie. Que leur administration f\u00fbt celle du negotiorum gestor sous les articles 1043 et suivants du code civil ou de mandataires par mandat tacite sous les articles 1701 et suivants du code, les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient tenus d'apporter \u00e0 la gestion de la part indivise du demandeur les soins d'un bon p\u00e8re de famille. Ils devaient donc payer les taxes qui frappaient cette part indivise, vu qu'ils en retiraient les revenus, ou du moins avertir le demandeur de les payer afin que ce dernier p\u00fbt prot\u00e9ger ses droits sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Non ; les d\u00e9fendeurs cessent de payer les taxes, gardent le silence et ensuite laissent vendre cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui valait plusieurs milliers de, dollars pour environ cent dollars.\nJe n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 caract\u00e9riser cette conduite de frauduleuse.\nB\u00e9darride, vol. 2, p. 3, nous dit que la fraude\nest l'art perfide de braver les lois avec l'apparence de la soumission, de violer les trait\u00e9s en paraissant les ex\u00e9cuter, et de tromper par l'ext\u00e9rieur des actes et des faits sinon ceux qu'on d\u00e9pouille du moins les tribunaux dont ils pourraient invoquer la puissance.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs laissent le demandeur dans une fausse s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Pendant des ann\u00e9es et des ann\u00e9es ils administrent son huiti\u00e8me indivis dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, essaient de l'acheter, mais ne pouvant pas r\u00e9ussir ils ont recours au d\u00e9faut du paiement des taxes municipales. Ils ne remplissent pas leurs propres obligations et ne l'avertissent pas que leur g\u00e9rance est termin\u00e9e. Ils n'agissent certainement pas en bon p\u00e8re de famille (art. 1709, 1710 & 1045 C.C.).\nIl est incontestable que le demandeur souffre un pr\u00e9judice et que le fait dont ce pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sulte est un fait ill\u00e9gal ou ill\u00e9gitime (B\u00e9darride, no. 643). Les d\u00e9fendeurs ne sauraient donc profiter de cette vente municipale qu'ils invoquent pour garder la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur. Comme dit Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 20, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition, n\u00b0 536, en parlant de l'administration de la chose commune:\nSi l'objet indivis est entre les mains de l'un des communistes, il est vis-\u00e0-vis de ses co-propri\u00e9taires tenu d'en prendre soin. Il est donc responsable des fautes qu'il commet dans sa gestion.\nDomat, au livre II, titre 5, discute les engagements r\u00e9ciproques de ceux qui ont quelque chose de commun sans convention. Ainsi, parlant d'une chose qui se trouve commune, comme une succession entre coh\u00e9ritiers, il ajoute, p. 253, vol. 3, \u00e9dition de 1822:\nAinsi celui qui a la chose commune entre ses mains doit en prendre soin.\nIl ne doit donc pas la laisser vendre pour d\u00e9faut de payer les imp\u00f4ts fonciers qui peuvent la frapper, au moins sans avertir son co-propri\u00e9taire.\nSi les d\u00e9fendeurs voulaient faire cesser l'indivision et se rendre acqu\u00e9reurs de la part d\u00e9tenue par le demandeur, ils devaient alors provoquer le partage et prendre une poursuite en partage sous les dispositions des articles 689 et suivants du code civil. Mais cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une voie trop droite pour les d\u00e9fendeurs. Ils ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 avoir recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure'd'une vente simul\u00e9e pour d\u00e9faut de payer les taxes municipales et acqu\u00e9rir \u00e0 vil prix une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de valeur.\nJe crois donc que la vente doit \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et que l'action du demandeur doit \u00eatre maintenue.\nL'appel des d\u00e9fendeurs doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9 attaque une vente pour taxes municipales et dirige son action contre les appelants qui se sont rendus acqu\u00e9reurs \u00e0 cette vente. Il a r\u00e9ussi devant le premier juge[4] et \u00e9galement devant la cour d'appel, le juge-en-chef et le juge Green-shields ayant toutefois fait enregistrer leur dissentiment. Les appelants nous demandent maintenant d'infirmer ces deux jugements et de renvoyer l'action de l'intim\u00e9.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il s'agit ici venait de la succession de feu James O'Connell, et la fille de ce dernier, Diana O'Connell, \u00e9pouse de Donald McDonald, para\u00eet avoir succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un huiti\u00e8me de cette succession, qui comprenait deux immeubles, les nos 266 et 360 du cadastre de la paroisse de Sainte-Foy, dans le voisinage imm\u00e9diat de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. Le 9 avril, 1879, Diana O'Connell, alors veuve, qui devait $520.00 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, consentit en sa faveur un acte d'obligation promettant lui payer cette somme avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 10% dans deux ans. Par cet acte, pour assurer le paiement de ce montant, elle c\u00e9da et transporta \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ses droits successifs dans la succession de son p\u00e8re, et plus sp\u00e9cialement un huiti\u00e8me indivis du lot n\u00b0 266. En 1899, l'intim\u00e9 obtint contre Diana O'Connell un jugement sur cet acte d'obligation pour une somme de $780.00, mais il n'appert pas que ce jugement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi d'ex\u00e9cution. En 1902, l'appelante Mary Stuart Munroe et son fils William John O'Connell, ce dernier d\u00e9fendeur dans cette action et maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, ont achet\u00e9 les parts indivises de plusieurs des col\u00e9gataires de la succession O'Connell, mais la part de Diana O'Connell n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise. En 1907, les lots 266 et 360 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus par la corporation du comt\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec pour taxes municipales dues \u00e0 la corporation de Sainte-Foy, et Mary Stuart Munroe et son fils William John O'Connell s'en sont rendus adjudicataires pour le montant des taxes et des frais. Deux ans plus tard, un acte de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti en faveur des adjudicataires, aucun retrait n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9. C'est cette vente que l'intim\u00e9 attaque.\nJe ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de dire au d\u00e9but que l'\u00e9tude du dossier, tel que les parties l'ont fait, a \u00e9t\u00e9 loin de me satisfaire. Le dossier imprim\u00e9 ou \"case\" est mal fait et mal coordonn\u00e9, certains exhibits se trouvant plac\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le jugement de la Cour d'Appel et les autres avant, et il est \u00e9vident que la lecture des \u00e9preuves a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par une personne incomp\u00e9tente. A tous \u00e9gards, ce \"case\" ne r\u00e9pond pas aux exigences des r\u00e8gles de pratique de cette cour. De plus, la preuve faite de part et d'autre laisse beaucoup \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, et l'intim\u00e9 est maintenant r\u00e9duit \u00e0 invoquer des pr\u00e9somptions ou des inductions pour remplacer la preuve positive qu'il aurait d\u00fb produire \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate.\nMais voyons les moyens de nullit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9.\nJe dois dire d'abord qu'\u00e0 mon avis l'intim\u00e9 n'est nullement propri\u00e9taire d'une part indivise du lot n\u00b0 266, et cela malgr\u00e9 que l'avocat des appelants, dans sa plaidoirie devant nous, ait exprim\u00e9 l'opinion qu'il l'\u00e9tait. L'acte d'avril 1879 est un acte d'antichr\u00e8se auquel s'appliquent l'article 1967 du code civil ainsi que les r\u00e8gles du gage, et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la part indivise donn\u00e9e en gage est rest\u00e9e \u00e0 Diana O'Connell. Une esp\u00e8ce absolument identique est celle Eglauch v. Labadie[5], jug\u00e9e par feu Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier. On peut m\u00eame se demander si l'antichr\u00e8se d'une part indivise produit un effet quelconque avant le partage, question sur laquelle je ne me prononce pas, car, comme je l'ai dit, l'avocat des appelants a admis le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que je lui eusse signal\u00e9 l'article 1967, et je me dispense de discuter une question qui ne se pose pas en vue de l'attitude prise par les appelants.\nLe premier moyen de nullit\u00e9 est la fraude. L'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les d\u00e9fendeurs, depuis un grand nombre d'ann\u00e9es, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession du lot n\u00b0 266, dont ils avaient retir\u00e9 tous les revenus et acquitt\u00e9 toutes les charges, \u00e0 part celles pour le paiement desquelles les immeubles nos 266 et 360 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus; qu'apr\u00e8s des tentatives pour acqu\u00e9rir les int\u00e9r\u00eats du demandeur ils avaient laiss\u00e9 un certain montant de taxes municipales impay\u00e9, \u00e9videmment dans le but de laisser vendre cet immeuble et de s'en porter acqu\u00e9reurs, alors qu'ils \u00e9taient eux-m\u00eames tenus au paiement des taxes comme possesseurs et qu'ils pouvaient arr\u00eater la vente en payant le montant d\u00fb comme ils l'ont fait lors de l'adjudication.\nApr\u00e8s un examen attentif du dossier, je ne trouve la preuve que d'un seul fait parmi ceux mentionn\u00e9s par l'honorable juge, la tentative d'acheter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'intim\u00e9. Il n'y a rien qui fasse voir que les appelants (je parle de Mde. O'Connell et de son fils maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur reprise d'instance par sa veuve) \u00e9taient en possession du lot n\u00b0 266, ni qu'ils en aient retir\u00e9 les revenus ou acquitt\u00e9 les charges. En supposant que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait, comme il l'all\u00e8gue, leur copropri\u00e9taire, rien n'obligeait les appelants \u00e0 payer sa part de taxes. Et quant \u00e0 la possession, la seule chose qui paraisse, c'est qu'un locataire, le nomm\u00e9 Abraham Giroux, \u00e9tait en possession des lots nos 266 et 360. Or on n'a pas interrog\u00e9 Giroux, qui a pu tr\u00e8s bien payer les taxes. On a questionn\u00e9 Mde. O'Connell, vieille femme d'environ quatre-vingts ans, mais on n'a rien prouv\u00e9 par elle, car son fils vaquait \u00e0 toutes ses affaires et ce fils est mort depuis le 13 janvier 1913. Il n'y a non plus au dossier aucune preuve directe que les appelants aient laiss\u00e9 les taxes impay\u00e9es dans le but de faire vendre l'immeuble et de le racheter ensuite. Raisonnant ex post facto on peut peut-\u00eatre dire que les appelants, qui n'ont pas pay\u00e9 les taxes pendant une couple d'ann\u00e9es\u2014et on n'a pas prouv\u00e9 qu'ils les payaient auparavant, c'est une pr\u00e9somption qu'on a voulu tirer du fait que l'intim\u00e9 ne les a pas pay\u00e9es, mais il n'est pas impossible que Giroux l'ait fait\u2014ont voulu laisser vendre l'immeuble et s'en porter ensuite adjudicataires. En supposant que les appelants aient eu cette intention, il n'en r\u00e9sulte pas n\u00e9cessairement qu'ils aient voulu frauder l'intim\u00e9. Ils \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les deux-tiers indivis des immeubles 266 et 360, l'autre tiers indivis appartenant aux autres h\u00e9ritiers O'Connell. Ils ne devaient pas, dans ces circonstances, la totalit\u00e9 des taxes, et rien ne les obligeait \u00e0 payer la part de leurs copropri\u00e9taires. En supposant qu'ils aient pay\u00e9 toutes les taxes pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, ils n'\u00e9taient certainement pas tenus de continuer ind\u00e9finiment de payer pour leurs copropri\u00e9taires, et pour l'intim\u00e9, s'il \u00e9tait vraiment copropri\u00e9taire, surtout quand on ne d\u00e9montre pas qu'ils recevaient les revenus ou loyers de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Il y avait pour les appelants deux moyens de sortir de cette situation, l'action en partage ou la vente des immeubles pour les taxes, et je suis d'avis qu'on ne peut accuser les appelants de conspiration frauduleuse parce qu'ils ont choisi le second moyen, beaucoup moins co\u00fbteux que le premier.\nOn dit que les appelants auraient d\u00fb pr\u00e9venir l'intim\u00e9 de cette vente. Le s\u00e9cr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil de comt\u00e9 a annonc\u00e9 la vente, tel que l'exigeait le code municipal, et \u00e0 moins de dire qu'il y avait, pour les appelants, obligation l\u00e9gale de donner un avis particulier \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, ce qu'on ne peut pr\u00e9tendre, on ne peut les taxer de fraude parce qu'ils n'ont pas donn\u00e9 cet avis. On a voulu soutenir qu'il y avait eu ici gestion d'affaires pour l'intim\u00e9. Rien ne justifie cette assertion, car on n'a pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il y ait m\u00eame eu une gestion quelconque. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9, c'est qu'il y a eu incurie incroyable de la part de l'intim\u00e9 qui demeurait \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et qui n'est pas all\u00e9 une fois, dans une quarantaine d'ann\u00e9es, visiter cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 copropri\u00e9taire, et ne s'est jamais occup\u00e9 de savoir si les taxes \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es. Dans ces circonstances, on ne doit pas \u00e9couter l'intim\u00e9 quand il reproche aux appelants de n'avoir pas pay\u00e9 les taxes pour lui, et qu'il les accuse de conspiration frauduleuse parce qu'ils ont cess\u00e9, dit-il, de payer ces taxes, qu'ils ont laiss\u00e9 vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et l'ont ensuite rachet\u00e9e sans l'en avoir pr\u00e9venu.\nIl y a ici, on me permettra de le dire, une confusion d'id\u00e9es, assez in\u00e9vitable il est vrai, car on proc\u00e8de de supposition en supposition. On suppose d'abord, et \u00e0 tort suivant moi, que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait copropri\u00e9taire avec les appelants; le jugement qu'il a obtenu, en 1899, contre Diana O'Connell dans une action purement personnelle, d\u00e9montre qu'il se consid\u00e9rait cr\u00e9ancier et non copropri\u00e9taire. Se basant ensuite sur cette pr\u00e9tendue copropri\u00e9t\u00e9, on suppose, sans aucune preuve, que les appelants \u00e9taient en possession du lot n\u00b0 266 et qu'ils en tiraient les revenus. Cela m\u00eame ne suffit pas, car il faut encore supposer, toujours sans preuve, que ces revenus \u00e9taient suffisants pour payer les taxes. Ensuite on dit que le copropri\u00e9taire en possession est oblig\u00e9 de prendre soin de la chose commune et qu'il est responsable des fautes qu'il commet dans sa gestion (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, 3\u00e8 \u00e9dition, n\u00b0 536). Cela je le conc\u00e8de, mais il ne s'ensuit pas qu'il soit oblig\u00e9 envers ses copropri\u00e9taires d'acquitter les charges et imp\u00f4ts dont la chose est grev\u00e9e, surtout pour la part incombant \u00e0 ses copropri\u00e9taires. Au contraire, les auteurs enseignent qu'il n'y a, en l'absence d'une convention expresse, aucun lien personnel entre les copropri\u00e9taires, aucun mandat tacite entre eux comme entre associ\u00e9s aux termes de l'article 1851 du code civil (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, no. 539: Fuzier-Herman, vo. Indivision, nos 137 et suiv.). S'il n'y a ni lien personnel, ni mandat tacite, il est clair que le copropri\u00e9taire en possession ne repr\u00e9sente pas ses copropri\u00e9taires et qu'il n'est tenu \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard d'aucun devoir actif, mais seulement du devoir n\u00e9gatif de ne pas abuser de sa possession et de ne pas s'opposer \u00e0 ce' que ses copropri\u00e9taires jouissent avec lui de la chose commune (Fuzier-Herman, eodem verbo, nos 73 et 74.) Et quant aux dettes ou charges qui gr\u00e8vent la chose, chaque copropri\u00e9taire est tenu d'en supporter sa part (Fuzier-Herman, nos 97 et 98), et par cons\u00e9quent l'un d'eux n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de payer pour les autres. Tout ceci est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et il est \u00e9galement \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de dire qu'il n'y a pas de responsabilit\u00e9 sans obligation, et pas de faute \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y ait manquement \u00e0 un devoir. Et si les appelants n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de payer les taxes pour l'intim\u00e9, s'ils n'\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s de lui donner un avis particulier d'une vente annonc\u00e9e publiquement, et on ne cite aucune autorit\u00e9 exigeant cet avis, il s'ensuit qu'ils ne sont pas en faute \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, que la fraude n'existe pas pour la raison qu'aucun droit de l'intim\u00e9 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, et que s'il souffre un pr\u00e9judice il le souffre par sa propre incurie.\nJe conclus donc que l'accusation de fraude n'est pas \u00e9tablie, et il ne faut pas oublier que l'intim\u00e9, \u00e9tant demandeur, avait la charge de cette preuve. Venons-en maintenant aux formalit\u00e9s de la vente, qui sont celles que prescrivait l'ancien code municipal. Les articles que je citerai sont les articles de ce code. L'intim\u00e9 attaque cette vente pour cinq raisons.\n1. Il n'y a pas eu d'ench\u00e8res, ni d'ajournement de la vente, et cette vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en bloc.\nCe moyen a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 bien fond\u00e9 par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, qui se base sur des d\u00e9finitions donn\u00e9es du mot \"ench\u00e8re\" par certains r\u00e9pertoires, et sur l'article 1003 C.M. qui veut que la vente soit ajourn\u00e9e si, au moment de la vente, aucune ench\u00e8re n'est offerte. Ici les appelants avaient offert de payer le montant des taxes et des frais. Aux termes de l'article 1001\nquiconque offre alors (au temps fix\u00e9 pour la vente) de payer le montant des deniers \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever pour la moindre partie de ce terrain, en devient l'acqu\u00e9reur, et cette partie du terrain doit lui \u00eatre adjug\u00e9e sur le champ par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, qui vend celle qui convient le mieux \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du d\u00e9biteur.\nIl est \u00e9vident donc que s'il y a eu telle offre, on ne peut dire qu'il n'y a pas eu d'ench\u00e8re, et l'article 1003 ne s'applique pas. Dans ces circonstances, la vente ne devait pas \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9e.\nOn insiste et on dit que la vente des nos 266 et 360 s'est faite en bloc, c'est-\u00e0-dire que les deux num\u00e9ros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus ensemble et pour un seul prix.\nLa preuve constate que ces deux lots \u00e9taient entr\u00e9s et \u00e9valu\u00e9s ensemble au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. Ils paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9s tous les deux au nomm\u00e9 Giroux. Cela \u00e9tant, j'adopte la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette objection que donne l'honorable juge-en-chef Lamothe en ces termes:\nIl n'y a, dans ce fait, aucune irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 fatale. Deux lots de terrain, ayant des num\u00e9ros de cadastre diff\u00e9rents, peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s et tax\u00e9s ensemble s'ils appartiennent \u00e0 un m\u00eame propri\u00e9taire, s'ils forment une seule exploitation, etc. Ils peuvent \u00eatre vendus en bloc dans les m\u00eames cas. Lors de la confection du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, on peut objecter \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de ces deux lots: si aucune objection n'est faite, le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation ainsi que le r\u00f4le de taxation, ne sont pas, par l\u00e0, frapp\u00e9s de nullit\u00e9. La saisie se fait conform\u00e9ment au r\u00f4le municipal; elle ne peut se faire autrement.\n2. La vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite aux d\u00e9biteurs. L'intim\u00e9 dit \"aux saisis.\" Il est \u00e9vident qu'il n'y avait pas de \"saisis\" ici, car il n'y a eu aucune saisie, et, quand la vente a lieu aux termes des art. 998 et suiv. du code municipal, elle se fait sans qu'il y ait saisie des immeubles assujettis aux taxes.\nIl est vrai qu'aux termes de l'article 748 du code de proc\u00e9dure, la partie saisie, si elle est personnellement tenue de la dette, ne peut se porter adjudicataire, mais je suis d'avis que la validit\u00e9 des ventes pour taxes municipales doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions du code municipal seulement. Or ce code ne contient pas de dispositions semblables \u00e0 l'article 748 C.P.C.\nDu reste, tout le monde sait qu'il arrive tr\u00e8s souvent qu'une personne responsable du paiement des taxes municipales ou d'une partie de ces taxes ach\u00e8te \u00e0 la vente municipale, son but \u00e9tant quelquefois de se faire donner un nouveau titre qui, au bout de deux ans sans retrait, la fera consid\u00e9rer comme propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable (art. 1007 C.M.), et aura l'effet de purger l'immeuble des hypoth\u00e8ques (art. 1013 C.M.). Si maintenant nous d\u00e9clarions qu'une personne responsable des taxes ne peut acheter \u00e0 la vente municipale, nous reconna\u00eetrions implicitement l'invalidit\u00e9 d'une quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de titres qui reposent sur un achat semblable. Je suis d'opinion que ces titres sont valables, et je ne veux d'autre autorit\u00e9 que celle de la loi, car l'art. 1001, que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9, se sert de l'expression \"quiconque\" qui \u00e9videmment comprend, parmi les personnes qui peuvent ench\u00e9rir, le d\u00e9biteur des taxes. On dit qu'alors cette personne ach\u00e8te d'elle-m\u00eame. Cela n'est pas exact: elle ach\u00e8te de la corporation du comt\u00e9 au nom de qui l'acte de vente est consenti (art. 1009 C.M.). Peu importe qu'elle paie sa dette en m\u00eame temps que le prix de vente : la faute, si faute il y a, est celle de la loi qui ne veut pas que le prix d'adjudication d\u00e9passe le montant des deniers \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever y compris les frais. Pour cette raison, on ne peut se plaindre que la vente se soit faite \u00e0 vil prix, car le prix de vente ne peut exc\u00e9der le chiffre des taxes et des frais encourus. Voy. l'art. 1001 C.M.\nL'intim\u00e9 cite des autorit\u00e9s anglaises et am\u00e9ricaines sur cette question. Je crois qu'il suffit de nous en tenir aux articles du code qui sont suffisamment explicites pour nous guider en cette mati\u00e8re.\n3. Il n'y a pas eu de discussion pr\u00e9alable des meubles des appelants, les d\u00e9biteurs.\nJe r\u00e9ponds que la saisie et la vente des meubles du d\u00e9biteur, facultatives aux termes de l'article 962 C.M., n'est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable de la vente des immeubles pour les taxes qui les gr\u00e8vent en vertu des art. 998 et suivants du code municipal.\n4. Les appelants, d\u00e9biteurs des taxes, en payant le prix d'adjudication, se trouvent avoir pay\u00e9 leur propre dette, et ne peuvent ainsi changer le titre qu'ils avaient aux lots nos 266 et 360.\nJ'ai r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette objection en discutant le deuxi\u00e8me moyen de nullit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9.\n5. La vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite super non domino et non possidente et est partant nulle.\nLa preuve constate qu'en 1896 les num\u00e9ros 266 et 360 \u00e9taient entr\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation au nom de Dame Veuve John O'Connell. En 1899 l'entr\u00e9e est \"Succession Dame Veuve John O'Connell.\" En 1902 c'est \"Succession Veuve John O'Connell.\" En 1905 on met \"Succession John O'Connell.\" En 1908, apr\u00e8s l'adjudication mais avant l'acte de vente, on lit: \"Dame Mary S. O'Connell et Mr. W. G. O'Connell.\"\nAvant de discuter cette objection il vaut mieux rendre compte des dispositions principales du code municipal se rapportant tant au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation qu'\u00e0 la vente des terrains pour taxes.\nLe code municipal, art. 718, exige qu'on entre au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, les noms, pr\u00e9noms et qualit\u00e9 des propri\u00e9taires de biens imposables quand ils sont connus. Aux termes de l'article 723 si le propri\u00e9taire d'un terrain est inconnu, les estimateurs mettent le mot \"inconnu\" dans la colonne des noms des propri\u00e9taires, en regard de la d\u00e9signation de ce terrain. Le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation est examin\u00e9 par le conseil, et toute personne peut se plaindre des entr\u00e9es y faites, et le conseil peut corriger les noms des personnes qui y sont inscrites (art. 734, 735). Ce r\u00f4le sert de base au r\u00f4le de perception qui indique, entre autres mentions, les noms et \u00e9tat de chaque propri\u00e9taire contribuable inscrit au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, ou le mot \"inconnu\" si le propri\u00e9taire est inconnu (art. 955.)\nMaintenant, quant \u00e0 la vente d'immeubles pour taxes, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil local, sur l'ordre du conseil, doit, avant le 20 d\u00e9cembre de chaque ann\u00e9e, transmettre au bureau du conseil de comt\u00e9 une liste des personnes endett\u00e9es pour des taxes municipales ou scolaires, avec la d\u00e9signation des terrains impos\u00e9s et le montant des taxes qui les affectent (art. 373). Ces renseignements re\u00e7us, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil de comt\u00e9 doit pr\u00e9parer, avant le 8 janvier de chaque ann\u00e9e, une liste donnant la d\u00e9signation de tous les terrains situ\u00e9s dans la municipalit\u00e9 du comt\u00e9 \u00e0 raison desquels il est d\u00fb des taxes municipales ou scolaires, avec les noms des propri\u00e9taires tels qu'indiqu\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, et en regard des terrains le montant des taxes qui les affectent. Cette liste est accompagn\u00e9e d'un avis public annon\u00e7ant que ces terrains seront vendus \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re publique au lieu o\u00f9 le conseil de comt\u00e9 tient ses sessions, le premier mercredi de mars suivant \u00e0 dix heures du matin, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement des taxes et des frais encourus (art. 998). La liste et l'avis doivent \u00eatre publi\u00e9s en la mani\u00e8re ordinaire et, de plus, deux fois dans la Gazette Officielle et dans un ou plusieurs \"papiers-nouvelles,\" dans le cours du mois de janvier (art. 999). Au temps fix\u00e9 pour la vente, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil de comt\u00e9 vend ces terrains apr\u00e8s avoir fait conna\u00eetre le montant \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever sur chacun d'eux, y compris la part de frais encourus pour la vente (art. 1000). Puis l'article 1001 indique la mani\u00e8re de faire cette vente; je le cite encore textuellement \u00e0 cause de son importance dans cette cause:\nQuiconque offre alors de payer le montant des deniers \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever, y compris les frais, pour la moindre partie de ce terrain, en devient l'acqu\u00e9reur, et cette partie du terrain doit lui \u00eatre adjug\u00e9e sur le champ par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, qui vend celle qui convient le mieux \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du d\u00e9biteur.\nSur paiement, par l'adjudicataire, du montant de son acquisition, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier constate les particularit\u00e9s de la vente dans un certificat fait en double sous sa signature, et en remet un duplicata \u00e0 l'adjudicataire. Le deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 1004 dont je viens de transcrire le premier alin\u00e9a, ajoute:\nL'adjudicataire est d\u00e8s lors saisi de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain adjug\u00e9 et peut en prendre possession, sujet au retrait qui peut en \u00eatre fait dans les deux ann\u00e9es suivantes, et aux rentes fonci\u00e8res constitu\u00e9es. Citons aussi Particle 1007:\nSi, dans les deux ann\u00e9es qui suivent le jour de l'adjudication, le terrain adjug\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rachet\u00e9 ou retrait d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions du chapitre suivant, l'adjudicataire en demeure propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable.\nL'adjudicataire a droit alors \u00e0 un acte de vente du terrain, qui lui est consenti par la corporation du comt\u00e9. Ajoutons que la vente transf\u00e8re \u00e0 l'adjudicataire tous les droits du propri\u00e9taire primitif et, sauf certaines exceptions, purge tous les privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques dont le terrain peut \u00eatre grev\u00e9 (art. 1013). Enfin l'action pour faire annuler une vente de terrain faite en vertu de ces dispositions, ou le droit d'en invoquer l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, se prescrivent par deux ans \u00e0 compter de la date de l'adjudication (art. 1015).\nQuand la vente en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite les immeubles \u00e9taient entr\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation au nom de la succession John O'Connell. Ces biens venaient de la succession James O'Connell, de sorte qu'il y avait erreur de pr\u00e9nom. Cette erreur cependant ne pouvait tromper personne, l'intim\u00e9 moins que tout autre, et ce qui me para\u00eet d\u00e9cisif c'est que personne, ni l'intim\u00e9, ni aucun autre int\u00e9ress\u00e9, n'a demand\u00e9 la correction du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. L'intim\u00e9\u2014s'il \u00e9tait vraiment copropri\u00e9taire, et je ne puis lui reconna\u00eetre cette qualit\u00e9\u2014aurait pu faire ins\u00e9rer son nom au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. Il n'en a eu aucun souci pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant sans doute faire payer les taxes municipales par d'autres. Je suis donc d'opinion que l'intim\u00e9 est mal fond\u00e9 \u00e0 dire, \u00e0 cause de l'entr\u00e9e des terrains au nom de la succession John O'Connell, que la vente s'est faite super non domino.\nLes formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par le code municipal pour la vente des terrains pour taxes municipales paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies. Les annonces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans la Gazette Officielle ainsi qu'\u00e0 la porte de l'\u00e9glise de la paroisse de Sainte-Foy. Je ne trouve pas au dossier la preuve de l'annonce dans un \"papier-nouvelles\" au d\u00e9sir de l'art. 999, mais l'intim\u00e9 ne s'est pas plaint devant nous qu'elle n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et la pr\u00e9somption est qu'elle a d\u00fb \u00eatre publi\u00e9e: omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite et solemniter facta donee probetur in contrarium. Du reste, l'article 1015 emp\u00eacherait l'intim\u00e9 de s'en plaindre maintenant. Je trouve que le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier s'est litt\u00e9ralement conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 1001 en faisant l'adjudication. Il explique son mode de proc\u00e9der en ces termes:\nQ. Vous rappelez-vous de la fa\u00e7on dont la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite? Est-ce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite comme vous dites l\u00e0? Comment avezvous demand\u00e9?\nR. Je mets la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'abord, \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re et je demande qui offre de payer le montant des taxes et des frais pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le premier pr\u00eat me dit; Je la prends pour le montant des taxes et des frais: Je demande s'il y a d'autres ench\u00e9risseurs. S'il y en a qui me disent; Il n'y en a pas, je l'adjuge. C'est de m\u00eame que \u00e7a s'est fait l\u00e0.\nQ. Comment demandez-vous l'ench\u00e8re?\nR. C'est-\u00e0-dire, supposons qu'il y en a deux pour acheter. Une premi\u00e8re fois, il dit; Je la prends pour le montant des taxes et des frais. Un autre, par derri\u00e8re vous, peut dire; Je la prends pour les trois quarts, ou le huiti\u00e8me, pour le m\u00eame montant.\nQ. C'est de m\u00eame qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re?\nR. Sans doute, c'est de m\u00eame.\nOn ne peut mieux se conformer aux exigences du code municipal. Le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier n'a pas le droit de recevoir plus que le montant des taxes et des frais. Les surench\u00e8res se font, si je puis m'exprimer ainsi, en moins prenant, c'est-\u00e0-dire, la somme offerte restant invariable, le surench\u00e9risseur prend moins de terrain pour le m\u00eame montant que le premier ench\u00e9risseur, et ainsi de suite. S'il n'y a qu'un seul ench\u00e9risseur, il prend le terrain ou la partie qu'il indique dans son ench\u00e8re pour le montant des taxes et des frais encourus. Que les tiers puissent en souffrir, c'est possible, mais ils peuvent surench\u00e9rir de la mani\u00e8re que j'ai indiqu\u00e9e, et s'ils sont cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires ils ont droit de recevoir un avis du registrateur s'ils ont pris la pr\u00e9caution de faire inscrire leur nom dans le livre d'adresses de ce dernier (art. 2161 (i) code civil). En tout cas, la seule question qui doive nous occuper ici, ce ne sont pas les inconv\u00e9nients qui peuvent r\u00e9sulter de la loi, mais uniquement celle de savoir si on s'est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la loi. Je ne puis r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question autrement que dans l'affirmative. J'ajoute que si l'intim\u00e9 souffre un pr\u00e9judice, il ne peut s'en prendre qu'\u00e0 son incroyable incurie. Vigilantibus non dormientibus scripta est lex.\nLes objections de l'intim\u00e9 me paraissent donc toutes mal fond\u00e9es et, par cons\u00e9quent, l'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 et l'action de l'intim\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours, moins toutefois, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es plus haut, les frais d'impression du \"case.\"\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, Parent & Casgrain.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robitaille & Fafard.\n[1] [1920] Q.R. 57 S.

Before any contestation, both parties agreed to submit to one arbitrator the question whether such encroachment on lot No. 586 had taken place and, in the affirmative, the amount of compensation. The respondent then fyled with the arbitrator, under protest by the appellant, a larger claim for $162,040.50, representing 681,162 square feet of land comprised in lot No. 586. The arbitrator rendered his decision allowing $51,539.58, the value of 572,662 square feet.\nHeld that the arbitrator's sentence was not ultra petita.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 29 K.B. 302) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec,[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Dorion J. and maintaining the respondent's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Lafleur K.C. and Rivard K.C. for the appellant.\nGelly K.C. and Dion K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The neat question raised herein is whether or not the arbitrator exceeded the terms of the submission.\nHaving regard to all the surrounding facts and circumstances, by which, if there is any ambiguity, we must be guided in the interpretation thereof, I do not think there is any room for argument.\nHe was duly appointed to determine how much area the appellant had invaded of the property belonging to respondent, and then to find the value thereof.\nIt was not the action alone and the limits of its then ambit that was intended to dominate the terms of the submission, though that was rather inaptly referred to in the resolution leading up to the submission, and liable, in default that, to be expanded in its operation by an amendment.\nIt was doubtless the possibilities of extension or diminution of the size of the area encroached upon that led to a more comprehensive definition in the deed of submission. The terms of the latter must govern.\nI, therefore, am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014On the whole, I am of the opinion that the question passed upon was one within the competence of the arbitrator.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with my brother, Mr. Justice Mignault. Brodeur J.\u2014La Commission du Havre de Qu\u00e9bec a fait du creusage \u00e0 l'embouchure de la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles afin d'am\u00e9liorer et d'agrandir le port de cette ville. La compagnie intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que ces travaux se faisaient sur un lot de gr\u00e8ve dont elle \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9taire en vertu d'une concession seigneuriale faite \u00e0 ses auteurs dans les premiers temps de la domination francaise. Ce lot de gr\u00e8ve \u00e9tait recouvert d'eau \u00e0 haute mar\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e a alors pris une action pour r\u00e9clamer $96,000 en all\u00e9guant que la Commission du Havre s'\u00e9tait ainsi empar\u00e9e de 384,000 pieds de son terrain. Les parties ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de soumettre \u00e0 l'arbitrage la question du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ainsi que la compensation qui devrait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e pour tout le terrain dont la Commission se serait empar\u00e9e.\nAlors la compagnie Le Parc St-Charles a produit devant l'arbitre une r\u00e9clamation non pas seulement pour 384,000 pieds mais pour presque le double de cette quantit\u00e9.\nPar la sentence arbitrale l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e' \u00e0 payer au del\u00e0 de $50,000.\nPar sa pr\u00e9sente action l'intim\u00e9e demande l'homologation de cette sentence arbitrale. La Commission du Havre s'oppose \u00e0 cette homologation et pr\u00e9tend que l'arbitre a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ultra petita, qu'il n'avait pas le droit d'adjuger sur la valeur de pr\u00e8s de 600,000 pieds de terrain quand l'action soumise \u00e0 l'arbitrage ne portait que sur environ 400,000 pieds.\nVoil\u00e0 tout le litige qui nous est soumis. Nous n'avons rien \u00e0 faire avec la valeur proprement dite de ce lot de gr\u00e8ve.\nLe montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 et accord\u00e9 me para\u00eet exag\u00e9r\u00e9. Car une r\u00e9clamation semblable nous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise dans la cause de B\u00e9langer v. The King et nous n'avons pas voulu confirmer le jugement de la cour d'Echiquier, tellement \u00e9lev\u00e9 nous paraissait le montant accord\u00e9. Mais dans la pr\u00e9sente cause nous n'avons rien \u00e0 faire avec le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9. Ceci a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la seule discr\u00e9tion de l'arbitre que les parties ont nomm\u00e9.\nNous avons simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l'acte d'arbitrage r\u00e9f\u00e8re simplement \u00e0 la quantit\u00e9 de terrain mentionn\u00e9e dans l'action originaire, soit environ 400,000 pieds, ou bien s'il peut couvrir les 600,000 pieds pr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9s dans la sentence arbitrale.\nL'acte d'arbitrage, dans le pr\u00e9ambule, parle d'abord de l'action de $96,000, ensuite de l'impossibilit\u00e9 pour les parties de s'entendre pour \u00e9viter les frais d'un litige judiciaire; et alors elles conviennent de nommer un arbitre pour d\u00e9terminer en dernier ressort les points suivants:\n(a) Quels sont les titres de la dite compagnie aux terrains et lot de gr\u00e8ve connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 aux plan et livre de renvoi officiel du cadastre de St-Roch de Qu\u00e9bec Nord, sous le num\u00e9ro 586 dont il est question dans la dite cause.\n(b) D\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tendue et les extr\u00eames limites de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et du lot de gr\u00e8ve n\u00b0 586 de St-Roch Nord sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 qui fait face \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles et au fleuve St-Laurent;\n(c) Etablir si les Commissaires ont empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le lot de gr\u00e8ve n\u00b0 586 du cadastre de St-Roch Nord, s'ils ont de plus pris possession d'aucune partie du dit lot par leurs travaux de draguage pratiqu\u00e9s dans l'estuaire de la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles;\n(d) S'il est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la satisfaction du dit arbitre que les dits empi\u00e8tements de la dite prise de possession ont eu lieu, \u00e9tablir le montant de la compensation que la dite Compagnie est en droit de r\u00e9clamer et de recevoir des dits Commissaires.\nUn arbitre n'a comp\u00e9tence que pour conna\u00eetre des contestations qui lui sont soumises par l'acte d'arbitrage. La jurisprudence s'est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral montr\u00e9e tr\u00e8s tol\u00e9rante dans l'application de la r\u00e8gle qui exige la d\u00e9signation de l'objet du litige; et de l'ensemble de ses d\u00e9cisions il r\u00e9sulte que le litige peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. On a dans le cas actuel d\u00e9sign\u00e9 les points litigieux, mais on n'a pas cru devoir les limiter \u00e0 ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans l'action qui a provoqu\u00e9 l'arbitrage, mais on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arbitre le pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer les limites du lot de gr\u00e8ve, l'\u00e9tendue de l'empi\u00e8tement commis par la Commission du Havre, et enfin l'indemnit\u00e9 que la compagnie est en droit de r\u00e9clamer pour cet empi\u00e8tement.\nCet acte d'arbitrage ouvrait la porte \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que celle qui \u00e9tait originairement faite. Et c'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nJe consid\u00e8re que l'arbitre a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans les limites de ses pouvoirs.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Les appelants se plaignent d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, si\u00e9geant en appel, confirmant \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 un jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, prononc\u00e9 par l'honorable juge Dorion, lequel jugement homologuait une sentence arbitrale rendue contre les appelants par l'honorable M. H. C. Pelletier, juge en retraite de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, nomm\u00e9 arbitre unique par les parties.\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e, en juillet, 1917, avait intent\u00e9 contre les appelants une action en recouvrement de la somme de $96,000 pour la valeur de terrains dont les appelants s'\u00e9taient empar\u00e9s en faisant des travaux de creusage dans la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles dans le port de Qu\u00e9bec. Sa d\u00e9claration, tr\u00e8s courte, se lisait comme suit:\n1. La demanderesse est propri\u00e9taire pour l'avoir acquis de ses deniers et en vertu de bons et valables titres du lot No 586 du cadastre officiel de la paroisse de St-Roch Nord, dans la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, avec toute la gr\u00e8ve qui en d\u00e9pend. 2. La demanderesse est aussi propri\u00e9taire du dit lot et de la dite gr\u00e8ve, en ayant prescrit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement par sa possession et celle de ses auteurs \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire pendant audel\u00e0 de trente ans conform\u00e9ment aux articles 2242 et 2251 du Code Civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n3. Les d\u00e9fendeurs depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et sp\u00e9cialement depuis l'ann\u00e9e 1912, ont fait des travaux de creusages dans la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles dans le port de Qu\u00e9bec, et sp\u00e9cialement en front de la susdite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la demanderesse:\n4. Les d\u00e9fendeurs en ex\u00e9cutant ces dits travaux ont empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la demanderesse, s'en sont empar\u00e9s, ont creus\u00e9 sur icelle et enlev\u00e9 tout le terrain constituant une partie consid\u00e9rable de la dite gr\u00e8ve, savoir, sur une superficie de 384,000 pieds carr\u00e9s, convertissant ce dit terrain \u00e0 leur usage.\n5. La valeur du terrain ainsi enlev\u00e9 et qu'ils ont converti \u00e0 leur usage est de $96,000.00 \u00e0 raison de 25 cents du pied carr\u00e9.\n6. Les d\u00e9fendeurs ont ainsi empi\u00e9t\u00e9 et pris possession du terrain de la demanderesse ill\u00e9galement, sans droit aucun et sans avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune expropriation et malgr\u00e9 les protestations r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es de la demanderesse.\n7. Les d\u00e9fendeurs sont toujours rest\u00e9s depuis en possession du dit terrain.\n8. La demanderesse a requis les d\u00e9fendeurs de payer la dite somme de $96,000.00, mais les d\u00e9fendeurs ont toujours refus\u00e9 de payer.\nPourquoi la demanderesse demande jugement contre les d\u00e9fendeurs pour la dite somme de quatre-vingt-seize mille piastres ($96,000.00) avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u00e9pens.\nAvant toute contestation de cette action, les parties sont convenues de soumettre leur diff\u00e9rend \u00e0 l'arbitrage. A cet effet les appelants ont adopt\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution suivante le 10 ao\u00fbt, 1917:\nResolved: That the action taken by La Compagnie Le Parc St-Charles Limit\u00e9e, against the Quebec Harbour Commissioners, claiming from them the sum of $96,000.00 for alleged encroachment upon, and taking possession of that part of their property No. 586 of the official cadaster of St-Roch Nord, under No. 2354 of the Superior Court of Quebec, be submitted to one arbitrator, whose decision shall be final and binding upon both parties, as a final judgment of the Superior Court, without the right of appeal therefrom, said arbitrator to enquire into, and give a decision on the following points :\n(a) The titles of the company plaintiff to the land and beach lot No. 586 of St-Roch Nord in question in this case.\n(b) To determine the extent and extreme limits of said property and beach lot No. 586 of St-Roch Nord on the side of said lot, facing the River St. Charles and the River St. Lawrence. (c) Have the Commissioners encroached upon said property and beach lot No. 586 of St-Roch Nord, and have they taken possession of any part thereof by dredging operations performed in the estuary of the River St. Charles.\n(d) In the affirmative, what is the value of the property so taken, and what compensation is the company plaintiff entitled to receive therefrom.\n(e) That the cost of said arbitration be borne equally by both parties.\nResolved: That Honourable H. C. Pelletier, retired judge of the Superior Court, be appointed as arbitrator in this case.\nLe 14 ao\u00fbt, l'intim\u00e9e accepta cette proposition d'arbitrage et nomma comme son arbitre M. Antoine Gobeil, avocat de Qu\u00e9bec, mais subs\u00e9quemment les parties d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de s'en rapporter \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'honorable M. H. C. Pelletier comme seul arbitre.\nLa convention d'arbitrage fut pass\u00e9e, le 6 septembre, devant Mtre J. A. Charlebois, notaire de Qu\u00e9bec, et elle pr\u00e9cisait la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans les termes suivants:\n(a) Quels sont les titres de la dite compagnie aux terrains et lot de gr\u00e8ve connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 aux plan et livre de renvoi officiel du cadastre de St-Roch de Qu\u00e9bec Nord, sous le num\u00e9ro 586 dont il est question dans la dite cause?\n(b) D\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tendue et les extr\u00eames limites de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et du lot de gr\u00e8ve No. 586 de St-Roch Nord sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 qui fait face \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles et au fleuve St-Laurent.\n(c) \u00c9tablir si les Commissaires ont empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le lot de gr\u00e8ve no. 586 du cadastre de St-Roch Nord, s'ils ont de plus pris possession d'aucune partie du dit lot par leurs travaux de draguage pratiqu\u00e9s dans l'estuaire de la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles.\n(c) S'il est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la satisfaction du dit arbitre que les dies empi\u00e9tements et la dite prise de possession ont eu lieu, \u00e9tablir le montant de la compensation que la dite compagnie est en droit de r\u00e9clamer et de recevoir des dits Commissaires.\nCette convention stipulait que les appelants ne seraient tenus de payer le montant accord\u00e9 par l'arbitre que lorsqu'ils l'auraient re\u00e7u du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, mais qu'en attendant ils payeraient les int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de six pour cent par an sur cette somme. Il faut aussi ajouter que la convention d\u00e9clarait que les parties avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de soumettre toutes les questions soulev\u00e9es dans l'action au jugement d'un arbitre unique et amiable compositeur.\nPendant la proc\u00e9dure de l'arbitrage, l'intim\u00e9e, se basant sur des mesures des terrains empi\u00e9t\u00e9s faites par M. Giroux, arpenteur, produisit une r\u00e9clamation pour 681,162.1 pieds carr\u00e9s, estim\u00e9s \u00e0 25 cents du pied, formant une somme de $162,040.50. Les appelants s'object\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette r\u00e9clamation pour la raison qu'elle changerait la nature de la premi\u00e8re demande de l'intim\u00e9e qui \u00e9tait de $96,000.00 au lieu de $162,-040.50.\nLe 19 janvier, 1918, l'arbitre rendit sa d\u00e9cision devant le notaire Charlebois d\u00e9clarant que les appelants s'\u00e9taient empar\u00e9s de 572,662 pieds carr\u00e9s de terrain appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e qu'il a \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 9 cents du pied, formant un montant total de $51,539.58.\nL'intim\u00e9e demande maintenant l'homologation de cette sentence arbitrale et r\u00e9clame des appelants la somme de $3,092.37 pour un an d'int\u00e9r\u00eats sur $51,539.58, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n'ayant pas encore fourni aux appelants les deniers requis pour payer cette derni\u00e8re somme.\nLes appelants pr\u00e9tendent:\u2014\n1\u00b0 Qu'ils n'avaient pas le pouvoir de soumettre \u00e0 l'arbitrage la question soulev\u00e9e par la premi\u00e8re action de l'intim\u00e9e.\n2\u00b0 Que l'arbitre avait adjug\u00e9 ultra petita en accordant une compensation \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e pour 572,662 pieds de terrain, alors que, par l'action soumise \u00e0 l'arbitrage, elle ne demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e que pour un empi\u00e8tement de 384,000 pieds. A la discussion devant cette cour les avocats des appelants n'ont pas insist\u00e9 sur le premier moyen, et il ne sera question que du second, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'assertion que la sentence arbitrale est ultra petita.\nMalgr\u00e9 la savante argumentation de MM. Lafleur et Rivard pour les appelants, je ne puis me convaincre que leur grief contre la sentence arbitrale soit bien fond\u00e9.\nJ'admettrais imm\u00e9diatement que la sentence serait absolument nulle si le savant arbitre avait adjug\u00e9 sur quelque chose qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas soumis par la convention d'arbitrage, et on ne pourrait donner effet \u00e0 sa sentence jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de l'empi\u00e8tement sur lequel il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de se prononcer. Tel n'est pas le cas cependant.\nLa pr\u00e9tention des appelants est que l'action qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l'arbitrage se plaignait d'un empi\u00e8tement de 384,000 pieds seulement, et quels que soient les termes de la convention d'arbitrage, ils doivent \u00eatre restreints \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait en question dans cette action, et ils invoquent \u00e0 cet effet leur r\u00e9solution que j'ai cit\u00e9e plus haut.\nIl est clair que l'action de l'intim\u00e9e aurait pu \u00eatre amend\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 jugement final, mais les appelants nient la possibilit\u00e9 d'un amendement apr\u00e8s la convention d'arbitrage, disant qu'une seule des parties ne peut, sans l'assentiment de l'autre, changer l'acte de compromis. Il est bien \u00e9vident que l'acte de compromis ne peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 que de consentement mutuel, mais, dans mon opinion, il n'y a eu, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune modification.\nEt d'abord, j'interpr\u00e8te l'action de l'intim\u00e9e, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la convention d'arbitrage, comme se plaignant d'un empi\u00e8tement sur le lot cadastral n\u00b0 586 et comme demandant \u00e0 raison de cet empi\u00e8tement, une indemnit\u00e9 de $96,000.00. Il est vrai que la d\u00e9claration dit que l'empi\u00e9tement comprend une superficie de 384,000 pieds carr\u00e9s, et que c'est en \u00e9valuant ce terrain \u00e0 25 cts du pied qu'elle en arrive \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le chiffre de $96,000.00. Cependant la superficie mentionn\u00e9e n'est pas indiqu\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un terrain distinct, c'est une partie non limitativement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e du lot n\u00b0 586, et la mention de la superficie de 384,000 pieds ne peut avoir un plus grand effet, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, que celui de la description du terrain dont les appelants se sont empar\u00e9s. Etant donn\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e se plaint d'un empi\u00e8tement sur un lot d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par son num\u00e9ro cadastral et demande \u00e0 en \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e, si, pendant le proc\u00e8s, on constatait que l'empi\u00e9tement d\u00e9passait 384,000 pieds, je crois\u2014mais en cela je ne fais qu'exprimer mon opinion personnelle\u2014que le tribunal aurait pu, m\u00eame sans amendement, indemniser l'intim\u00e9e pour tout l'empi\u00e8tement, \u00e0 la condition de ne point d\u00e9passer le chiffre de $96,000.00. En d'autres termes la partie essentielle de l'action c'est l'all\u00e9gation de l'empi\u00e9tement au pr\u00e9judice du lot 586 et la demande de l'indemnit\u00e9 de $96,000.00, et s'il y a description inexacte de la partie de ce lot comprise dans l'empi\u00e9tement, j'appliquerais la r\u00e8gle falsa demonstratio non nocet. Au demeurant, nul doute que le tribunal, dans un tel \u00e9tat de choses, aurait pu, ex abundanti cauiela, permettre d'amender la d\u00e9claration pour la faire co\u00efncider avec les faits prouv\u00e9s, mais dans mon opinion l'amendement n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 indispensable dans l'esp\u00e8ce si l'indemnit\u00e9 totale accord\u00e9e ne d\u00e9passait pas $96,000.00. Mais le motif sur lequel la cour se base pour renvoyer l'appel, c'est que, dans l'acte de compromis, les parties ont express\u00e9ment soumis \u00e0 l'arbitrage la d\u00e9cision de l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e pour l'empi\u00e8tement quel qu'il f\u00fbt que les appelants avaient commis au pr\u00e9judice du lot n\u00b0 586, et qu'en vertu des termes m\u00eames de cet acte de compromis l'\u00e9tendue de l'empi\u00e8tement n'\u00e9tait pas restreint aux 384,000 pieds carr\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9s dans l'action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la convention d'arbitrage. En tant que besoin en \u00e9tait, on peut consid\u00e9rer la d\u00e9claration dans cette action comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e par l'acte de compromis.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Adjutor Rivard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Getty & Dion.\n[1] Q.R. 29 K.B. 302.\n"}

Walsh, (1920) 61 S.C.R. 312\nDate: 1920-12-17\nAlexander C. McKenzie (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHattie Walsh (Defendant) Respondent.\n1920: November 11; December 17.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nSale of land\u2014Memo. in writing\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Additional terms.\nPursuant to an agreement to purchase her property the vendor signed the following document: \"Received from A. C. McKenzie the sum of two hundred dollars on the purchase of house No. 33 Spring Garden Road. Purchase price ten thousand five hundred dollars. Balance on delivery of deed.\" In an action by the purchaser for specific performance.\nHeld, that this document contained all the essential terms of a contract for the sale of land and complied with the conditions of sec. 7 of the Statute of Frauds. R.S.N.S. [1900] ch. 141.\nIt was contended that the time for completion of the purchase was a term of the contract and should have appeared in the written memorandum.\nHeld, that the finding of the trial judge that the time for completion was agreed on after the document was signed should be accepted and it was, therefore, not a term of the original contract but an arrangement for carrying it out.\nPer Duff J.\u2014This defence was not pleaded nor submitted to the jury and, as a question of fact, could not be raised after verdict since it was not disclosed so as to challenge the attention of the plaintiff.\nIt was also alleged that the property sold was mortgaged and the purchase was only of the equity of redemption which the memorandum did not disclose.\nHeld, that the purchase was of the whole property and not of the equity of redemption only and that the contract contained in the memorandum could be worked out as if it provided for the mortgage. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff and dismissing the action.\nThe material facts and the questions raised on this appeal are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nJenks K.C. for the appellant.\nPower K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I must confess I was not, at the close of the argument, without some doubts as to the sufficiency of the written receipt or memorandum relied upon in this case as satisfying the Statute of Frauds. After consideration, however, and reading of the authorities cited by counsel on both sides, I have reached the conclusion that the memorandum or receipt is sufficient. That it must contain all the essential terms of the contract and must show that the parties have agreed to those terms is conceded by both sides. That it does do so, I conclude. The essential terms are the parties, the property and the price.\nThe memo. or receipt in this case reads as follows:\nHalifax, N.S.\nFebruary 5, 1919.\nReceived from A. C. McKenzie the sum of two hundred dollars on the purchase of house, No. 33 Spring Garden Road. Purchase price ten thousand five hundred dollars. Balance on delivery of deed.\n(Signed) Hattie Walsh.\nIt seems to me that these three essential terms of the contract\u2014parties, property and price\u2014are all included.\nIt appears that after the memo. was signed the parties met and arranged for a time of completion, viz., the 15th of April, and possession, the 1st of May. I have read most carefully the judgments delivered in the court below and concur with the opinion of Chief Justice Harris that the written memorandum or receipt discloses a contract in writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds and that the arrangements subsequently made for a time of completion and possession were in the nature of appointments merely to carry out the contract and not varying its terms.\nI concur with the learned Chief Justice's judgment and for the reasons given by him would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs throughout.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant as plaintiff sued respondent for specific performance of an agreement entered into by her for the sale to him of a house and premises in Halifax.\nThe appellant paid, after several meetings at which negotiations had taken place, two hundred dollars, and got from the respondent the following receipt:\u2014\nHalifax, N.S.,\nFebruary 5, 1919.\nReceived from A. C. McKenzie the sum of two hundred dollars on the purchase of house No. 33, Spring Garden Road. Purchase price ten thousand five hundred dollars. Balance on delivery of deed.\n(Signed) Hattie Walsh.\nShe evidently, a month or so afterwards, had made up her mind not to sell.\nThe appellant brought this action on the 2nd of May, 1919, and, by his statement of claim, delivered later, set forth therein a copy of this agreement as basis of his claim.\nIt is now contended by respondent, after being beaten in several other contentions she set up, that this is not a sufficient memorandum in writing to comply with the Statute of Frauds. Prima facie it certainly seems to be so by containing all the essential elements of a bargain and sale of land.\nIt is given expressly, for the cash payment, on the purchase of a house, definitely described, of which the purchase price is to be $10,500 and the balance on delivery of deed.\nSurely that covers all that is necessary to satisfy the Statute of Frauds unless there is something rendering the transaction entered upon much more complicated than usual, which does not appear herein.\nThe respondent in defence pleaded that the actual agreement was only an optional one dependent upon whether or not the respondent would be able to obtain possession of another property which she had leased, and further that the respondent signed the above quoted memorandum upon the representation by appellant that it was a mere receipt for two hundred dollars.\nUpon this issue the parties went to trial and the result, upon most conflicting evidence, was a verdict of the jury answering questions submitted entirely negativing the contentions thus set up.\nNo other questions seem to have been suggested by the respondent.\nIn an ordinary trial as to the validity of the receipt as a contract setting out the terms, this should have ended the whole matter in dispute.\nThe resourceful counsel for respondent was only able to suggest at the close of the learned trial judge's charge the following, answered as appears by the learned judge as follows:\u2014\nMr. Ralston: Will you explain that the arrangement is everything that took place between them that night? His Lordship: The arrangement is the agreement between the parties; the written agreement is conclusive in McKenzie's favour, if he is telling the truth, but the woman says that agreement was not the whole agreement, that the whole agreement contained that condition, and that is the difference between the parties.\nThen one would have expected the matter to end by the verdict of the jury, for counsel did not object to the charge further, or except thereto in any other way.\nWhat transpired between the learned judge and counsel later, does not appear in the case before us, but one may infer from the judgment of the learned judge that some further contentions, however irregular, had been set up by counsel, for there is a judgment of the learned trial judge in which he deals with a contention first that the time for completion of the contract had not been contained in the memorandum of the contract, and secondly that the mode of dealing with the problem of an existing mortgage had not been dealt with in the memorandum.\nHe disposes of the former by finding as a fact that the time for completion had been determined by the parties after the signing of the memorandum.\nIt was quite competent for the parties proceeding upon the validity of the memorandum to have done so, and default that, for the court to have determined what was a reasonable length of time, on the assumption that the contract was sufficient within the Statute of Frauds.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge may fall within either and must bind all concerned.\nThe other question of the existence of a mortgage is an every day incident dealt with by the courts in suits for specific performance and is amply covered by the decision of this court in Williston v. Lawson[2], at page 679, as expressed by Strong J. in the language quoted. I doubt if there ever sat in any Canadian Court a judge more learned in the relevant law to be observed as a guide, or better qualified to express an opinion on such a point of equity jurisprudence upon which the right to specific performance rests.\nIt would seem to me that the matter should have rested there. But the respondent was persistent and appealed, taking, in her notice of appeal, the following grounds, the nature of which I give in abbreviated form:\u2014\n1st, that the findings were against the weight of evidence; 2nd, such as reasonable men should not have made; 3rd, because they were against the probabilities; 4th, that the learned judge wrongly instructed the jury; and 5th, because the learned judge's direction as to the effect of the conflict was to present an issue of one or other party committing perjury and hence a withdrawal of the case from the jury.\nNot a word therein points to the question of the requirements of the Statute of Frauds having been fulfilled or not.\nI cannot find in the case any leave to amend this notice or take any other ground.\nThe first observation I think this calls for is that all argument addressed to us relative to the noncompliance with the Statute of Frauds never seems to have occurred to counsel at the trial beyond what was properly submitted to the jury and thus disposed of; and seems to have been abandoned as a hopeless contention when giving notice of appeal but, by reason of something which does not appear, suggested in appeal, is again mooted.\nThe result thereof is an opinion judgment of the learned Chief Justice completely answering any such contention; another of Mr. Justice Longley that finds fault with the learned trial judge's charge, and expresses the opinion that there should be a new trial, and then, though finding difficulty in assenting to the proposition of Mr. Justice Ritchie that the document was not of a character to fulfil the conditions of the Statute of Frauds, finally assents thereto and to the dismissal of the action.\nI recite all this as illuminating how little confidence either bench or bar had in the contention now made the sole basis of answer to this appeal here.\nI respectfully submit that once the issues raised before the jury had been by them disposed of adversely to the respondent, there was nothing more, reasonably to be hoped for, as resting upon the Statute of Frauds.\nI repeat that the memorandum was not solely a receipt for money, but prima facie evidence of a complete contract within the Statute of Frauds, and when such substantial issues as presented to the jury were disposed of by them, nothing more should have been given effect to, and that the mere matters of method or form of carrying out the contract need not have been further considered as being required by the Statute of Frauds.\nHence I think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur on the whole with the judgment of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, and there is only one point which I would like to put in a slightly different way.\nThe majority of the full court took the view that the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds had not been complied with inasmuch as it was a term of the agreement that the balance of the purchase money was to be paid on the 15th of April and the deed then delivered and that this term does not appear in the memorandum produced by the plaintiff. I assume, without expressing any opinion on it, that the document produced is not in itself of such a character as to preclude oral evidence shewing that it did not embody all the material terms of the contract and consequently that it was open to the defendant to plead and prove by oral evidence that a stipulation to the effect mentioned was a term of the agreement.\nThe statement of defence raises no such issue. The 9th paragraph, it is true, alleges that the memorandum produced by the appellant did not contain all the terms of the agreement actually entered into between the parties but the language of the plea (\"does not contain all the terms of the said conditional agreement or option\") unmistakably relates to the agreement alleged by the defendant in paragraph 7 which, while professing to set out fully the terms of the agreement, mentions no stipulation touching the date of the delivery of the deed or payment of the purchase money. The state of the pleadings is not without importance as indicating the issue to which the evidence was directed; although of course the pleadings in themselves are by no means conclusive as to that. An examination of the proceedings at the trial, however, leaves no doubt on one's mind that the evidence was not directed to the issue whether or not such a stipulation formed part of the agreement between the parties. Such an issue would of course be an issue of fact and primarily therefore a question for the jury. In that issue the onus would be on the defendant because the plaintiff had alleged a contract in the terms of the memorandum set out and if the defendant denying an agreement in such terms alleged in the alternative that if there was an agreement in such terms there was a further term not disclosed by the memorandum that would be matter of defence and of the onus of that defence he must acquit himself. Only once during the trial was the point adverted to. In cross-examination, the plaintiff was asked whether the arrangement that the balance of the purchase money was to be paid on the date mentioned was made on the day on which the memorandum was signed or later. The plaintiff was unable to answer although he did say that this was a part of the arrangement between him and the defendant. No question was submitted to the jury upon the point, no suggestion was made by defendant's counsel that the jury should be asked to pass upon it. On motion for judgment the trial judge was asked to dismiss the action on the ground that no date for completion was mentioned in the memorandum but he rejected the contention taking the view that the arrangement in respect of the date of completion was made after the day on which the memorandum was signed and that in any event this arrangement was not part of the contract but in the nature of an appointment for the purpose of carrying out the contract.\nIt was not, in my opinion, open to the defendant after the verdict to raise this question as a question of fact. I express no opinion as to whether the practice of the Nova Scotia courts would permit such a question to be decided by the judge as a question of fact. No such question of fact could be raised after verdict because the point not having been taken on the pleadings, it was the defendant's duty, if intended to rely upon it, to disclose it in such a way as to challenge the plaintiff's attention to it and it is very clear that this was not done.? I may add, however, that dealing with it as a question of fact, reading the memorandum with the evidence given by the plaintiff, my finding would be that the defendant had failed to prove that such a term was part of the contract. It follows, of course, from this that the defendants could not, raising the point as a point of law, succeed.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Drysdale restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014This case has, in my opinion, been so satisfactorily dealt with by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia that I shall content myself with expressing respectful concurrence in the opinion which he delivered. I would merely add a reference to the well-known language of Halsbury L.C. in Nevill v. Fine Art and General Ins. Co.[3], at page 76, on the hopelessness of asking for a new trial for mere non-direction where no exception has been taken to the charge at the trial.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an action taken by the appellant for the specific performance of an agreement for the sale by the respondent to the appellant of the former's house in Halifax. On the 5th February, 1919, the appellant called on the respondent and proposed to purchase her house. The appellant testifies as to his conversation with the respondent as follows:\u2014\nQ. Tell us what the conversation was? A. I just asked her if the house was for sale; she told me it was; then I asked her the price; she told me what the price was, $10,500.00, and after a little talking back and forth I told her I would give her her price.\nQ. That is $10,500.00? A. Yes. Q. What happened then? A. At the same time she told me she was offered $10,000.00, or had been offered $10,000.00 and that she was asking $10,500.00.\nQ. You agreed to give her $10,500.00?. A. Yes; then I went out and told her I would be back in half an hour; I went out and came back with the receipt and the money.\nQ. You came back; you brought back this receipt I show you and this cheque? A. Yes, and that cheque.\nQ. What took place then? A. I read the receipt and passed it over to Mrs. Walsh and apparently she read it; she had it anyway and she apparently read it before she signed it.\nQ. She signed it in your presence? A. Yes.\nQ. And you gave her this cheque? A. Yes.\nQ. You got the cheque back from your bank vouchered cashed?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what further was said about the property at that time?\nA. There was nothing particular said at that time.\nThe receipt referred to is very material because the issue now between the parties is whether it was a sufficient memorandum in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. It reads as follows.\nHalifax, Feb. 5th, 1919.\nReceived from A. C. McKenzie the sum of two hundred dollars on the purchase of house No. 33, Spring Gar. Rd., purchase price ten thousand five hundred dollars.\nBalance on delivery of deed.\n(Sgd.) Hattie Walsh.\nTwo objections are now made to the sufficiency of this receipt.\n1. It was agreed between the parties, according to the appellant's story, that the balance of the purchase price would be paid on the 15th of April, and that possession would be given the appellant on May 1st, and this term was a material term of the agreement and was not mentioned in the memorandum.\n2. There was a mortgage on the house of $5,000 and the appellant states that the respondent said that this mortgage could stay on, and no mention of this is made in the memorandum. I may say that the learned trial judge (Drysdale J.) tried this case with a jury, and the issue raised at the trial by the respondent was that it was a condition of the arrangement that the appellant was not to have the house unless the respondent could get her tenants out of another house belonging to her by April 1st. The learned trial judge put questions to the jury covering this issue, and the answers were against the pretensions of the respondent. Judgment was given in favour of the appellant, but the respondent succeeded in her appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc.\nMy opinion is clearly that the learned trial judge's charge was a fair one, and if the evidence of the respondent's daughters was not sufficiently set out by the learned trial judge, his attention should have been called to the matter by the respondent's counsel after the charge. This was not done, and I do not think the objection should now be entertained. I may add that no new trial was granted by the court below, but the appellant's action was dismissed on the objections taken to the memorandum under the Statute of Frauds, the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia dissenting.\nComing now to the objections founded on the Statute of Frauds, the only one on which I feel any difficulty is the first one, and this difficulty is on the point whether the agreement alleged by the appellant as to the payment of the balance of the purchase price and the delivery of possession took place at the interview of February 5th, or was a subsequent parol agreement. If the former, I would think it was a material term of the agreement, and should have been mentioned in the memorandum. If it was a subsequent parol agreement, I think the memorandum is sufficient. As can be seen, the memorandum describes the house to be sold and mentions the price, $10,500.00, on which $200.00 was then paid, and says:\u2014\nBalance on delivery of deed.\nThe appellant in his statement of claim says that, by a subsequent parol agreement, it was agreed that payment of the balance and delivery of the deeds should be made by the 15th of April, and that respondent should occupy the house free of rent until May 1st.\nIn the evidence given by the appellant as part of his case, he says that this agreement would be in March some time, either February or March. When called in rebuttal, he first says it was made the next time he was in the respondent's house, but adds further on that it may have been made either when the receipt was signed or later.\nThis, as it stands, is somewhat indefinite, but the learned trial judge found as follows:\u2014\nIt seems the parties met after the date of memo and arranged for a time of completion, viz., the 15th of April and possession the 1st of May, but I think such arrangements were in the nature merely of appointments to carry out the contract and not an effort to vary the terms, which could not, I think, be verbally done.\nI think this agreement, if subsequent to the memorandum, was of the nature stated by the learned trial judge, but the material point is that the learned judge finds as a fact that the arrangement was subsequent to the' memorandum. I think this finding of fact should be accepted.\nThe consequence is that this memorandum contains the material terms of the agreement of February 5th, and is sufficient to support the appellant's action. On the question of the sufficiency of the memorandum, the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia who dissented in the court below, is so complete that I rely on his reasoning and do not find it necessary to repeat it here. I also accept as entirely sufficient the judgment of the learned Chief Justice on the second objection of the respondent as to the mortgage on the property.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs here and in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

[1914] c. 1955 40 (1) and s. 69 (16).\nBy sec. 41 (1) of the Ontario Assessment Act \"land shall be assessed at its actual value\" and by sec. 69 (16) \"the court may, in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed, have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed.\"\nHeld, that in assessing land under these provisions the governing principle is to ascertain its actual value.\nHeld, further, Brodeur J. dissenting, that in this case the assessment was made chiefly, if not entirely, on consideration of the value at which adjacent lands were assessed and the actual value was disregarded. The case was, therefore, sent back to the tribunal appealed from to have the land assessed on the proper principle.\nAPPEAL from the ruling of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board which set aside the assessment on appellant's land made by the County Court Judge and restored the higher valuation of the Court of Revision.\nThe questions raised on the appeal are sufficiently indicated in the above head-note.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal by the owner of two parcels of land in the City of Port Arthur from a judgment of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board reversing a judgment of the District Judge for Thunder Bay, which in turn had altered the judgment of the Court of Revision confirming an assessment of the lands in question.\nThe assessment of the two parcels of land had been fixed by the Court of Revision at $32,000 and $28,000 respectively, being at the rate of $300 per acre; the District Judge reduced these assessments respectively to $10,700 and $9,300, being at the rate of $100 per acre. The Ontario Railway and Municipal Board restored the assessment fixed by the Court of Revision, namely, $60,000, for the two parcels of land.\nUnless it was clearly apparent that the Board from whose judgment this appeal was taken had erred in its conclusions either by adopting some wrong principle or in ignoring some right one, I would not be disposed even if I had the power, to interfere with its judgment.\nThey are men of great experience in dealing with matters of the kind in question here and, as the hearing took place in Port Arthur where the lands are situate, I assume they would have an opportunity of inspecting them and those in the immediate vicinity and, in this way, would be better qualified than we possibly could be to determine the actual value of the lands in dispute and the weight to be given to the evidence as to the assessment of these adjoining lands in deciding the actual value of those in question here.\nIt is contended, however, that the Board erred in that they disregarded the provision of the Assessment Act, requiring the lands to be assessed at their actual value and in allowing undue weight to the evidence respecting the assessment of the lands of the same kind as those in question in the immediate vicinity. The learned chairman of the Board, during the hearing of the appeal, expressed himself strongly, more than once, to the effect that the Board's duty was to find the actual value of the lands in question, and I find it difficult to reach the conclusion that he erred in giving undue weight to the assessments upon lands of the same kind in the immediate vicinity of those in question. He seemed fully to appreciate the finding of that \"actual value\" as the dominant and controlling factor in determining the amount at which they should be assessed.\nBut the evidence given before the board was most meagre and unsatisfactory as to this \"actual value\" and the Assessment Act expressly provides that, in arriving at such actual value, consideration might be given to the assessed value of lands of the same kind in the immediate vicinity of those in question.\nWhether undue weight was given to this evidence of the assessed value of other lands of the same kind as those in question in the immediate vicinity is very difficult to decide.\nIn view of the large amount involved and the very meagre and unsatisfactory character of the evidence of actual value given, some of my colleagues think that justice requires there should be a rehearing of the case by the board and fuller and better evidence given of the \"actual value\" of the lands which the Act requires. Under the circumstances, I am not disposed to dissent from such a disposition of the appeal.\nI think we are all agreed that the actual value of the lands and that only can be assessed. That is the dominant and controlling factor which must determine the assessment, and it would seem as if the assessor failed to appreciate that fact and did not bring before the board the evidence necessary to enable it to find such actual value but relied too much upon the subordinate fact of the assessed value of adjoining lands.\nUnder all the circumstances I would agree to the reference back to the board with instructions to take further evidence of the actual value of the lands in question, due regard being had to the assessment values, unappealed from, of the lands of a similar kind in the immediate vicinity of those in question, in order to arrive at the actual value of those in question\nIt must not be assumed however, by this reference back to the board to fix the assessment upon the \"actual value\" of the land, that the statutory direction in arriving at that actual value to consider the assessed values of similar lands in the immediate vicinity of those under consideration, is to be ignored. On the contrary, these values must have due consideration and weight, but they were evidently not intended by the legislature to be the sole or even the controlling factor in determining the actual value of the lands being assessed, but simply as one item of evidence in reaching that actual value which had to be considered.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is a non-resident owner of two parcels of land situated in Port Arthur, one of one hundred and seven acres and the other of ninety-three acres, separated only by a highway running between them, and thus together forming a rectangular block of two hundred acres.\nThe respondent is the Assessment Commissioner of Port Arthur who had these parcels placed on the said city's assessment roll at an assessed value of three hundred dollars an acre. The said owner appealed from said assessment to the Court of Revision for the municipality, which dismissed his appeal.\nHe then duly appealed to the learned judge of the District Court of the Provisional District of Thunder Bay, who, after hearing evidence (which for some reason or want of reason is not before us) allowed the appeal and reduced the assessment to one hundred dollars an acre.\nIt does appear from notes of his finding that appellant had called two witnesses well acquainted with the lands in question for many years, and well qualified to speak on the subject of real estate values in the part of Port Arthur in question, who put the value of the whole possible farm land, undrained, at $75 to $100 an acre. One of these men speaking from personal experience, indicates it would cost more to drain and clear and make productive than it would be worth.\nThe learned judge says Mr. Royds did not call any witnesses.\nAnd then the learned judge closed his remarks thus:\u2014\nIn my opinion, the value put by Mr. Schwigler and Mr. Tomkin is altogether too high, and I cannot see where any owner can put these swamps and muskegs to any use that would justify such a value. But on their evidence I fix the assessment at $100 per acre and it is reduced accordingly.\nFrom that judgment the respondent herein appealed to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, which reversed same and restored the assessment made by said respondent.\nThe record of the proceedings before us indicates that counsel appeared respectively for the appellant then, now respondent herein, and for the respondent then, now the appellant herein. Yet the proceedings were opened by Mr. Royds in person without being sworn, so far as appears, though in regard to any others called as witnesses the record indicates that each man so called was sworn.\nHe began thus:\u2014\nAs shewn on the blue print submitted, the parcels marked in red ink, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, form assessment subdivision 22, and parcels numbered in red pencil 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, form assessment subdivision 32. We do not intend in this particular appeal to burden this Court with witnesses regarding the valuation. We do not wish to take up that matter at present, because as you know since the war these things differ considerably, and we are going to appeal to you as a matter of equity in the assessment of this property.\nThe Chairman: The reduction as made by the judge stands unless we are satisfied that its actual value is more than the value fixed by him.\nPassing that perfectly correct ruling of the chairman, without heeding it, Mr. Royds launched out into something unusual on the part of a witness, and which is somewhat difficult to understand, but incidentally discloses, if it means anything, that he had in mind to compare adjoining or adjacent blocks of land (which had been subdivided and partly built on) extending over a wide stretch of such neighbouring territory with these uncleared, unbroken, unimproved non-subdivisions now in question.\nHe apparently conceived the idea of selecting such improved subdivisions into small lots (assessable to different owners) and making a total estimate of the whole of such assessments, and then, computing the entire acreage of each of such tracts so selected, divided the total assessment of each by its acreage so ascertained, and thus arrived at an assessment per acre exceeding the assessment of the land now in question herein, thus satisfying his own mind that he had made an equitable assessment. The only vacant unsubdivided block considered at all lay nearer the centre of the city and hence furnished no basis for a fair comparison based on acreage.\nHe was asked, before he got started very far, as follows:\u2014\nTo the Vice-Chairman:\nQ. Is this property marsh lands? A. No. It is straight back nearly directly west from the post office. There is one lot on each side of the Dawson Road. The assessment against parcels 1 to 6 at the time it was purchased by the owner were approximately $10,000; that was in 1895.\nTo the Chairman:\nQ. That is the aggregate assessment? A. Yes, in 1895, and the aggregate assessment of that subdivision 22 at the present time is $536,275.\nTo Mr. McKay:\nQ. What do you mean by subdivision 22? A. The land west of High Street to the city boundary, subdivision 2 of Ward 2. That is the assessment for the whole subdivision. It was assessed for $10,100 in 1895. Parcels 7 to 11 were assessed approximately at $7,000 in 1895, and the assessment in 1919 was $331,810. I have taken the whole block of land so as to make the assessment appear more equitable, and I have taken the total assessment against these lands.\nTo the Chairman:\nQ. It is actually assessment by subdivision lots? A. Yes, but I have apportioned it out in the whole acreage, including streets, lots and everything.\nOne and another asked questions but the results may be just as inaccurate as when he denied the fact of those lands being marsh lands.\nI doubt if he really intended to swear as it reads, for if anything is clearly proven in the case, these lands in question are largely marsh lands.\nPossibly his mind was running on his preconceived notion of the other tracts he was speaking of a minute later. If so then there was no fair comparison possible between the subdivisions he referred to and the unsubdivided lands in question and, for the purposes of this appeal, that is all that need concern us. He seems aggrieved that appellant has not improved and subdivided his lands, although, from all that appears, subdivision within the city's bounds seems to have run, as elsewhere, far beyond the bounds of prudence.\nThe only other evidence, if this and such like irrelevant talk can be called evidence, given on behalf of appellant before the board appealed from herein, was a single witness who was called to prove that in 1911 or 1912 he tried to buy the land in question from the appellant and he refused to consider any offer as he had determined to keep his land for some relative, although the said witness tried it on by steps up to $20,000 or $30,000 and even $50,000. The latter figures evidently I suspect, were a joke.\nThat witness on cross-examination testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. You anticipated making a large profit? A. We wanted a sudivision and we wanted to divide it up. It was close to the town, and the extension of the railway out that way would make it a marketable property, if we spent a little money on it.\nQ. What did you reasonably expect to make over your figure of $50,000? A. I could not tell you that now. This was a long time ago.\nQ. Would you give that for it now? A. No.\nQ. At what price did you anticipate putting the individual lots on the market? A. We had not made up our minds; we would figure that out. We would fix a price according to what it would cost, but Mr. Dreifus would not commit himself to any price and we had to give him up. We corresponded with him for about two years. He would not answer a letter for a long time after we had written him.\nThe respondent would not venture to swear that the land in its present state and in the state of the market when the assessment was made, was worth, in the market, what he had assessed it at, or to name a price.\nHis appeal ought, I respectfully submit, instantly to have been dismissed for want of evidence, but it was not. The now appellant, therefore, was driven to calling three witnesses who demonstrated by facts that the judgment of the learned district judge could not have been disturbed by raising the assessment above what he had fixed.\nThe ruling which followed, and is now appealed against, would maintain any assessment, no matter if double or treble the actual value, so long as it could be argued that some other property, assessed in like manner illegally and improperly beyond its value on same assessment roll and hence must be upheld.\nThat is not the meaning of the words\nand the Court may, in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed, have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed,\ninterjected in 1892 into the section from which the section 69, sub-section 16, relied upon, has come.\nIn the Assessment Act the predominating clause is that in which, as the chairman of the board repeatedly suggested in the course of the proceedings, the actual value is made the rule to be observed.\nTo reject this appeal would revolutionize the whole jurisprudence established by many decisions during the twenty-eight years since the embarrassing subsidiary paragraph relied upon was quietly introduced so long ago as 1892, and enable municipalities to defeat through compliant assessors the very fundamental principle of the Assessment Act.\nInstead of the respondent bearing the onus of proof in such an appeal as before the Board, it was the duty of the appellant assessor to have established by evidence that the actual value of the land in question had been that set down on the roll. If the practice had been adopted of reporting the evidence given before the learned judge from whose judgment the appeal was taken, so that the Board could read it, that might not be necessary. Assuming, however, as appears herein, that it formed no part of the record before the board, then clearly the appellant on a re-hearing must bear the burden I indicate; in same manner as an appellant to the Court of Revision must bear the burden of proving the assessor in error.\nThen, if that prima facie is so established, the onus of proof may be shifted to the respondent.\nIt does sometimes so happen that the conflict of evidence renders it difficult to determine. The actual difference of opinion so made to appear may be slight and in such a case I conceive the change of 1892 was designed to permit the appellant court to refer to the roll as an element to help to a solution of such a problem as thus presented.\nIt was never conceived that it should be taken as the sole guide, but only as a factor in the last resort to avoid, by the allowance or disallowance of the appeal, unjust consequences of disturbing a roll clearly founded on the strictest effort to give full force and effect to the imperative requirement of the Act that land, unless in the excepted cases, had been set down at its actual value.\nA roll that its maker does not pretend to have been so made out is not available for any such purpose.\nIt certainly is remarkable that in a city of the size of Port Arthur not a single person could be brought to say the assessment was right on the basis of actual value.\nThe pretence that there are no sales rather tends to shew there is no value. Of course we ought to know that such is not the case. It may well be that the actual value is low, indeed very low, and, if you will, unexpectedly so, but whatever it is, according to the judgment of witnesses competent to speak, their evidence must be the guide.\nThe absurdity of bringing forward evidence of a refusal to sell, or worse still, of such a refusal in 1911 and 1912 when everyone knows that estimated values then and eight or nine years later are not identical, tends to show, on respondent's part, a rather perverse way of looking at things, which, I submit, should not be encouraged.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs herein and before the board appealed from, and the judgment of the learned district judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014Section 40 s.s. 1 should be read with sec. 69, s.s. 16 of the Assessment Act. Reading the two provisions together I can entertain no doubt that the rule given by them as the rule governing the Court of Revision in hearing and determining an assessment appeal is that the assessment is to be determined by the actual value of the land and that for the purpose of arriving at the actual value of the land the court may refer to the assessment of land in the vicinity \"similar\" in character and consider the value of such land as manifested by the assessment. It is not necessary to attempt for the purposes of this appeal any definition of the phrase \"actual value\" as employed in this statute. It is very clear to me that the board has proceeded upon the theory that the enactment of sec. 40, s.s. 1 is modified by that of s.s. 16 of sec. 69 and that the actual value for the purpose of assessment may be something other than the actual value in fact, the determination of which is governed by the practice of the assessor as applied to similar lands in the vicinity. This I think is an erroneous view. The governing enactment is that of section 40, s.s. 1, and the rule laid down by s.s. 16 of sec. 69, is a subsidiary rule which has been enunciated with the object of facilitating the application of the governing rule. The assessment of other lands may be referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the actual value, that is to say as affording some evidence of the actual value but only for that purpose.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the board to enable them to determine the assessment in accordance with this principle.\nAnglin J.\u2014The following concluding paragraph from the opinion of its chairman contains the basis of the decision of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board allowing an appeal in this case from the learned District Court Judge.\nThe chief reliance of the appellant is the provisions of section 69, subsection (16) of \"The Assessment Act\" which so far as material reads \"the Court may, in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed.\"\nUnder the authorization of this provision, the appellant showed that parcel 4, the unsubdivided block above referred to, is assessed to a resident of Port Arthur at $400 an acre; parcel 6, the subdivided parcel above referred to, is assessed in the aggregate at $425 per acre; parcel 7, a subdivided parcel lying west of parcel 8 and further than it from the centre of the city is assessed in the aggregate at $400 per acre. No satisfactory proof was given that the character and quality of the land embraced in parcels 5 and 8 were materially different from the land in parcels 4, 6 and 7.\nFrom this evidence the Board has reached the conclusion that there is not such a disparity in the value of parcels 5 and 8 as compared with parcels 4, 6 and 7, as to warrant the reduction made by the learned district judge, and in the opinion of the board the assessment as confirmed by the Court of Revision should be restored. The principle involved in this passage is in my opinion clearly erroneous. If if does not entirely ignore the paramount provision of s.s. 1 of s. 40, of the Assessment Act\u2014that \"land shall be assessed at is actual value'' it at least, treats as dominant a subordinate clause of s. 69 (16) which permits the Court of Revision\nin determining the value at which any land shall be assessed (to) have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed.\nMoreover this latter provision rests on the assumption that the assessment shall have been made on the basis directed by the Act, i.e., that land shall be assessed at its actual value. The evidence of the assessor Royds shows that the roll in this instance was not so prepared\u2014that his idea in making his valuations was that there should be such relative uniformity of assessment that the burden of taxation \"should be borne in an equitable manner\"\u2014that a person situated as is the appellant\nshould be at least willing to contribute his equitable share with the people who gave his land the value it has.\nRoyds' evidence as a whole demonstrates that in preparing the assessment roll his purpose was not to assess land at its actual value, but rather to assure what he deems equality of assessment, regardless of actual value. The assessments on similar lands in the vicinity of those of the appellant, therefore, do not in this case afford the criterion of value which the legislature doubtless had in view when it provided that reference might be had to them by the Court charged with\ndetermining the value at which any land shall be assessed. With great respect, the board appears to have restored the original assessment of $300 an acre, which the District Court Judge had reduced to $100, solely because\nthere is not such a disparity in the value of parcels 5 and 8 (the subject of the assessment under appeal) as compared with parcels 4, 6 and 7 (similar land in the vicinity) as to warrant the reduction made by the learned District Judge.\nThe Board would seem to have taken the assessment of these neighbouring lands, assumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to be of the same character, as conclusive of the valuation that should be put upon the lands of the appellant for the purpose of the assessment roll. Actual value, of which there was some evidence, seems to have been wholly disregarded. The decisions of this Court\u2014La Corporation Archi\u00e9piscopale C. R. de St. Boniface v. Transcona[1], and Rogers Realty Co. v. Swift Current[2], seem to me to be in point.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and set aside the order of the board. Although at first disposed to restore the order of the learned District Court Judge, which there is evidence to support, I think on the whole the better course is to exercise the power conferred by s.s. 2 of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, as enacted by 8 & 9 Geo. V., ch. 7, and remit this case to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board in order that it may fix the assessment of the actual value of the land as prescribed by s.s. 1 of s. 40 of the Assessment Act. Brodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014I am not satisfied that the Ontario Municipal Board have based their decision on some erroneous construction of the law.\nThe law requires (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 195, s. 40, Assessment Act) that land should \"be assessed at its actual value.''\nThe land in question covers a somewhat large area in the midst of the city of Port Arthur and has belonged for a great number of years to the appellant who apparently keeps it for a relative to whom he proposes to leave it in the future.\nIt is not subdivided into town lots.\nSome years ago the appellant had the opportunity of selling this land for $50,000 and he would not consider favourably such an offer. The land is assessed at about that sum.\nThe evidence is conflicting. Some witnesses say the property is not worth more than $100 an acre. On the other hand, it is in evidence that it is worth far more than that. The members of the board held their sittings in the locality and saw the land and could make as good an estimation as these witnesses. They came to the conclusion that the property should be assessed at $300 an acre. They base their judgment on a case of In re Lake Simcoe Hotel Co. and Barrie[3], or at least they refer us to the decision in that case.\nIn that case of Lake Simcoe, it is stated that value alone is to be considered in making assessments and it is added also that the proper guide is to be found in sect. 69 (16) of the Assessment Act, providing that the Court may in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed. In the present case, the land not being on the market, we have no sale price to guide us. It does not give any revenue, and we cannot then have reference to the returns to determine the value. The board considered the assessment at which the lands in the vicinity were assessed. Different groups of lots of land were formed for making the comparison and it was found that these adjoining properties were assessed at four and five hundred dollars an acre.\nIt seems to me that the appellant, in these circumstances, cannot complain of the decision of the board which assessed its land at three hundred dollars an acre.\nIf I could read in the decision of the board that they had disregarded the actual value of the land and had based their valuation only on the neighbouring property I would decide in favour of the appellant. But as they failed to find out by sales, by the income or by other means the actual value of the property, and as the evidence of value given by witnesses was \"little more than guesses,\" they found in the value of adjoining properties a guide which the law itself declares could be considered.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The only ground on which this Court has jurisdiction to vary the valuation of property assessed, is that the court appealed from has proceeded upon an erroneous principle (sec. 41, Supreme Court Act). So on this appeal from the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, which is the court of last resort in the province of Ontario on matters of assessment, it must be shown that the board, in allowing the appeal of the present respondent from the judgment of the district judge, has proceeded upon an erroneous principle. There is no doubt that the respondent urged an erroneous principle before the board when he contended that because of municipal requirements the city of Port Arthur had to have a certain amount of revenue and that therefore equity of assessment (whatever that may mean) would be the fair way. But the Board does not appear to have proceeded on any such ground, so it is unnecessary to consider it.\nHowever the board clearly bases its judgment upon subsection 16 of section 69 of the Assessment Act, which says:\u2014\nIn other cases, the court, after hearing the complainant, and the assessor, or assessors, and any evidence adduced, and, if deemed desirable, the person complained against, shall determine the matter, and confirm or amend the roll accordingly. And the Court may in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed, have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed. And in all cases which come before the Court it may increase the assessment or change it by assessing the right person, the clerk giving the latter or his agent four days notice of such assessment, within which time he must appeal to the Court if he objects thereto.\nThe governing provision in the Assessment Act is section 40, subsection 1, which is as follows:\nSubject to the provisions of this section, land shall be assessed at its actual value.\nSection 40, which lays down an imperative rule, is among the provisions of the Act concerning the valuation of lands, while section 69 is in the part of the statute which deals with the Court of Revision. Subsection 16 is clearly permissive only, and allows the Court, before which an appeal against the assessment is taken, to have reference, in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed, to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed. Thus the imperative rule is that land shall be assessed at its actual value, and that rule is binding on the Court. But in determining the actual value of the land, the Court may have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed.\nCareful reading of the reasons for judgment of the learned chairman of the board, has convinced me that undue prominence was given by the board to subsection 16 of section 69, while the imperative rule of subsection 1 of section 40 was apparently lost sight of. Evidence of the actual value of the land was given before the board, but this evidence was dismissed with the remark that\nin view of the fact that there is no movement in properties of this kind at present, or indeed since before the war, such estimates of value can be little more than guesses.\nOther facts were also relied on by the learned chairman, such as the assessment of the two parcels in question in 1915 at $104,500 without protest, and the further fact that when asked whether he would take $50,000 for the property some eight or nine years ago, the appellant stated that he did not wish to sell and was holding the lands for a relative. It is noticeable that Meikle, who testified as to this conversation with the appellant, says, in answer to a question put to him by the respondent's counsel, that he would not give that price for the property now. And the silence of the appellant in 1915 is certainly not conclusive against him when he protests the assessment in 1919, although it is possibly a circumstance to be weighed.\nI have therefore come to the conclusion that instead of considering what was the actual value of the land, the board based its judgment, to the exclusion of evidence of actual value, on subsection 16 of section 69, which merely permits the Court, in determining the actual value, to have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed. Giving to this provision the prominence which the Board gives it, practically nullifies the imperative rule of section 40, subsection 1, and makes it really the dominant rule, instead of being, what it is, a guide to the Court in determining the actual value. The result is that evidence of actual value was disregarded, and the assessment of similar land in the vicinity was considered as the controlling element in the passing on the appeal from the district judge, whose judgment was based on evidence of actual value.\nI agree that the case should be referred back to the board in order that it may determine what the assessment of these lands should be according to their actual value as required by the Assessment Act. To that end the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Malcolm A. McKay.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D. J. Cowa\n[1] 56 Can.

VII, c. 19, s. 601 (Ont.)\nPrior to 1913 the soil and freehold of roads and highways in Ontario were vested in the Crown and the roads and highways themselves in the respective municipalities subject to any rights in the soil reserved by the person who laid out such road or highway.\u201d Sec. 433 of the Municipal Act, 1913, repealed these provisions and vested the soil and freehold of roads and highways in the municipalities without any reservation of right. Prior to 1913 land had been dedicated for a highway with the right reserved to maintain a raceway across it.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that sec. 433 did not take away the right so reserved; to effect that purpose clear and unambiguous language is necessary and a mere inference from the repeal of the provisions protecting the rights reserved is not sufficient; and that the purpose of sec. 433 was to do away with the confusion arising from the joint proprietorship over roads and highways to which effect can be given without causing the injustice of taking private property without compensation.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 79) reversed and that of the trial judge (39 Ont. L.R. 382) restored.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff. A single question of law was raised on this appeal, namely, whether or not sec. 433 of the Municipal Act, 1913, by repealing a provision which protected private rights in a highway existing when it was acquired by the municipality, had the effect of depriving the owner of such rights. The trial judge held that it had not such effect and the Appellate Division that it had.\nH.J. Scott, K.C. for the appellant.\nLennox for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The contest in this case is as to the right of the now appellant to maintain a raceway in connection with his mill property under the surface of a highway called Pine Street in the village of Woodbridge.\nThe question in dispute depends upon the proper construction of the 433rd section of the Municipal Act, 1913. That section reads as follows:\n433. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the soil and freehold of every highway shall be vested in the corporation or corporations of the municipality or municipalities, the council or councils of which for the time being have jurisdiction over it under the provisions of this Act.\nThe law applicable down to the enactment of this section was 3 Edw. VII, ch. 19, section 601, as follows:\n601. Every public road, street, bridge, or other highway, in a city, township, town or village\u2014except any concession or other road therein, which has been taken and held possession of by any person in lieu of a street, road or highway laid out by him without compensation therefor\u2014shall be vested in the municipality subject to any rights in the soil reserved by the person who laid out such road, street, bridge or highway. It is not contended that there was any express reservation of appellant\u2019s rights within the meaning of those words in section 433.\nAgreeing as I fully do with the reasoning of Sir William Meredith, Chief Justice of Ontario, who delivered the judgment of the Appeal Court, concurred in by Maclaren, Magee and Hodgins JJ., I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe legislature has since altered section 433 and its proper construction is not now of public importance, and as I have nothing material to add to the Chief Justice\u2019s reasons for judgment, I content myself with a simple concurrence therein.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised herein is whether or not the appellant\u2019s easement of carrying a mill raceway across a highway constituted solely by the dedication of the predecessors in title through whom appellant claims, who obviously had reserved such easement, has been taken away by section 433 of the Municipal Act of 1913, which reads as follows:\u2014\n433. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the soil and freehold of every highway shall be vested in the corporation or corporations of the municipality or municipalities, the council or councils of which for the time being have jurisdiction over it under the provisions of this Act.\nI should be very unwilling to assume that the legislature ever intended to exercise its undoubted but extreme power of taking any man\u2019s property and transferring it to another without due compensation. I cannot think that it intended deliberately to do so as is contended for herein. Such legislation, if ever attempted, must be construed in the most restricted sense.\nMuch stress is laid upon what is claimed to be the clear meaning of the language used. The introductory words \u201cunless otherwise expressly provided\u201d are read by those urging this view as if it were absolutely necessary to have the express provisions framed in the form of a deed or other instrument of that sort.\nIt seemed at the close of the argument as if respondents were willing to concede that, for example, a statutory right of a railway crossing or running along the highway might be such an express provision. But why so? Surely that sort of provision is often beyond the legislative jurisdiction of the provincial legislature as much as any private grant.\nIt is not an express provision within the power of the legislature, much less within the literal meaning of the words in question in the connection in which they are used, which would seem possibly to imply something expressly provided by the legislature.\nPassing this more or less arguable proposition I am decidedly of the opinion that unless the narrow limits suggested thereby or something akin thereto is to be adhered to, the words \u201cotherwise expressly provided\u201d are quite comprehensive enough to cover a claim such as the reservation of this easement claimed by appellant, and all other rights established by law as that is; just as effectually as those created by other statutes for purposes of railways crossing or running along the highway or the use of parts of the soil by watermains of water supply companies, and such like.\nAll such like rights would be obliterated by maintaining the interpretation of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario of the said section, unless resting upon the provision of some Dominion legislation. I agree so fully with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Middleton in his dissenting opinion that I need not enlarge.\nI do not think that the amending Act of 1919 in any way helps or hinders either side in such a case as this pending at the time it was passed. Counsel for the respondent after taking his point having had time to consider the objections thereto, with commendable frankness, admitted so on resuming his argument.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and the learned trial judge\u2019s judgment restored but not to go into effect for six months in which, meantime, if so advised, respondent can remedy the wrong or expropriate appellant\u2019s property in the said easement.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal turns on a dry question of law, namely, the application of section 433 of the Ontario Municipal Act of 1913. The section is in the following words:\u2014\n433. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the soil and freehold of every highway shall be vested in the corporation or corporations of the municipality or municipalities, the council or councils of which for the time being have jurisdiction over it under the provisions of this Act.\nThis section replaced sections 599 and 601 of the Municipal Act of 1903, the text of which was in these words:\u2014\n599. Unless otherwise provided for, the soil and freehold of every highway or road altered, amended or laid out according to law, and every road allowance reserved under original survey along the bank of any stream or the shore of any lake or other water, shall be vested in His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors.\n601. Every public road, street, bridge or other highway, in a city township, town or village\u2014except any concession or other road therein, which has been taken and held possession of by any person in lieu of a street, road or highway laid out by him without compensation therefor\u2014shall be vested in the municipality subject to any rights in the soil reserved by the person who laid out such road, street, bridge or highway. It has been held by the majority of the Appellate Division that the effect of the legislation of 1913 is to abrogate rights existing at the time the legislation was passed secured by the provision of sec. 601 that the interest vested in the municipality shall be\nsubject to any right in the soil reserved by the persons who laid out such road, street, bridge or highway.\nSections 599 and 601 of the Act of 1903 have had a place in the Ontario municipal legislation for many years and have been the subject of a good deal of discussion and the general effect of the decisions appears to be correctly stated by Mr. Biggar in his Municipal Manual at p. 818, namely, that as regards highways created by dedication \u201cthe soil and freehold\u201d were vested in the municipality subject as in that section 601 provided. In this general view of sec. 601 the Act of 1913 effected, as regards such highways, no change in the law presently relevant, unless, as has been held by the Appellate Division, by repealing section 601 it did as regards such highways abrogate the rights secured by the language above quoted. I am unable myself to agree with this conclusion and I think that section 14 s.s. (c) of the Interpretation Act points to the principle which ought to be applied if indeed its language does not expressly cover the case. That section is in these words:\u2014\n14. Where an act is repealed or whenever any regulation is revoked, such repeal or revocation shall not, save as in this section otherwise provided,\n* * *\n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the Act, enactment, regulation or thing so repealed or revoked. In the case at least of highways established by dedication after the passing of section 601 or its parent enactment, one is not, I am inclined to think, exceeding the bounds of reasonable construction in holding that the right of the dedicand was a right \u201cacquired under the Act\u201d and therefore protected by this clause. But whether that be or be not strictly so the Act of 1913 ought, I think, to be read in light of the canon of construction laid down in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parke[3], applying the language of Lord Blackburn in Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[4]:\u2014\nIt is clear that the burthen lies on those who seek to establish that the Legislature intended to take away the private rights of individuals, to shew that by express words, or by necessary implication, such an intention appears.\nThe words \u201csoil and freehold\u201d are not words of such aptness and precision as one might have expected to find if the intention had been to transfer the full and unincumbered proprietorship a coelo usque ad centrum; and indeed obviously the dominium of the municipality is subject so long as the highway remains a highway to the public right of passage exercisable by all His Majesty\u2019s subjects.\nIn the result the construction contended for would disable the municipality from acquiring only a stratum of land sufficient for highway purposes in a case in which the acquisition of the soil ad centrum (in the case e.g. of a highway laid out over a mining property) might entail a great deal of unnecessary expense and inconvenience. The better view appears to be that the subject matter with which the legislature is dealing is the title held at the time of the passing of the Act by the Crown or by some public authority subject to the public right of user as a highway. If that is the subject matter to which the enactment is directed and I think that conclusion is justified by the character of the existing legislation, then the principle of construction applies that general words should not be extended so as to involve collateral effects upon the rights of individuals which the legislature must be presumed not to have contemplated. Railton v. Wood[5].\nANGLIN J.\u2014The findings of the learned trial judge are now fully accepted with the result that the right of the appellant to maintain the raceways in question across Pine street, a public highway, prior to the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1913 (3 & 4, Geo. V, ch. 43) is conceded. The sole question on this appeal is whether that legislation destroyed or took away such right without compensation. Such a confiscatory effect will not be given to a statute unless it be inevitable. Maxwell on Statutes, 6 ed., 501. The intention to accomplish that result must be expressed in clear and unambiguous language, 27 Hals., Laws of England, No. 283. Here it has been inferred chiefly because of the omission in section 433 of the Municipal Act of 1913, which replaced sections 599 and 601 of the Municipal Act of 1903 (3 Ed. VII, c. 19), of the words\nsubject to any rights in the soil reserved by the person who laid out such road, street, bridge or highway.\nIt is obvious, as is pointed out by Justice Middleton, that there must be some restricton on the broad meaning which it is sought to attribute to the language of section 433. Certain rights which form part of the soil and freehold of highways were not thereby vested in the municipalities. I agree with that learned judge that it is reasonably clear that the purpose of the change made by the Act of 1913 was to do away with some uncertainty and confusion that arose from the former legislation which, while providing that highways should be vested in the municipalities (s. 601), at the same time declared (s. 599) that the soil and freehold thereof were vested in the Crown. Apparently to overcome this difficulty the legislation of 1913 vested the soil and freehold in the municipalities, thus transferring to them the proprietary rights theretofore held by the Crown. The attainment of the purpose of the amendment does not require interference with easements, such as that held by the plaintiff, and reasonable effect, and I think the full effect intended by the legislature, can be given to the language of section 433 without involving their confiscation.\nMoreover I doubt whether the language\nthe soil and freehold of every highway shall be vested\u2014\nis apt or appropriate to carry a mere easement enjoyed over the highway, since an easement is only a right in the owner of a dominant tenement to require the owner of servient land \u201cto suffer or not to do\u201d something on such land and neither forms part of the ownership thereof nor involves a right to any part of its soil or produce. Gale on Easements, 9 ed. 91.\nIn reaching the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge[6], restored, I have entirely put out of consideration the amendment of 1919 (9 Geo. V. c. 46, s. 20) brought to our attention by Mr. Lennox. (See Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux)[7]. If, notwithstand- ing ss. 18 and 19 of the Interpretation Act, any inference may properly be drawn from this enactment it would seem to afford an indication that the view of the effect of the legislation of 1913 above stated probably accords with what the legislature intended. Of course s. 19 precludes any inference that the statute of 1913 before the amendment of 1919 had the effect for which the respondent contends or that such amendment was necessary to give it the effect for which the appellant contends. The amendment was obviously passed to meet the decision of the Appellate Division in this case and may well have been introduced merely ex majori cautela.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs here and in the Appellate Division.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014It is common ground that the street under which were the raceways in question had been dedicated as a public highway by the predecessor in title of the plaintiff\u2011appellant and that the dedication was subject to his right as owner of certain mills to enjoy the raceways across the street.\nThe public highways were before 1913 partly vested in His Majesty and partly vested in the municipalities (1903, ch. 19, ss. 599 and 601).\nThe vesting in the municipality was made subject to any rights in the soil reserved by the person who laid out the road (section 601).\nIn the year 1913, it was enacted that all the roads would be vested in the corporation. It is true that the old sections 599 and 601 of the Municipal Act were repealed and that no formal provision was enacted as to the reservations that the former owners of the road possessed under the old law. But it seems to me that the object of the statute of 1913 was simply to bring a change as to the vesting of the highways from His Majesty into the municipal corporations.\nThe repeal had not the effect of affecting any right, privilege or easement that the appellant possessed concerning those raceways (s. 14 R.S.O. ch. 1). The appellant still possesses the right which he reserved to himself when his predecessor made his dedication to use these raceways and continue the industrial development which he could make with his mills.\nI entirely concur in the views expressed in the Appellate Division by Mr. Justice Middleton.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and the order of the trial judge restored with a proviso however that it shall not become operative for a period of six months, to enable the municipality in the meantime, if it so desires, to expropriate the right or easement in question.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aylesworth, Wright, Moss & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lennox & Lennox.\n[1] 45 Ont.

Ord. (1905) c. 94, s. 24. Held, Duff J. dissenting, that, though the assets of a partnership include an interest in land, an oral agreement by one partner to buy out the other partner's interest in the partnership is enforceable and the Statute of Frauds is inapplicable in such a case, unless it be shown that there appears a \"contrary intention\" to the rule enacted by s. 24 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\" that \"land\" which has \"become partnership property * * * shall * * \"be treated as between the partners * * * as personal or \"movable and not real estate.\"\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 556) affirmed, Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe appellant and the respondent were carrying on business in partnership as farmers, ranchers and general dealers in cattle. The respondent alleged that the appellant orally agreed to buy out the respon- dent's interest in the partnership on certain terms and sued for the price agreed. The appellant denied this, pleaded the Statute of Frauds and counterclaimed for an order dissolving the partnership and for an accounting. Upon the case coming on for a first trial, without the terms of the partnership agreement or of the lease being put in evidence, the respondent admitted that among the assets of the partnership was a leasehold interest in some real estate. The trial judge then dismissed the respondent's action, following Gray v. Smith[2]. On appeal to the Appellate Division, this judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered[3]. On the second trial, both the partnership agreement and the lease were produced and the respondent's action was then maintained.\nA. McL. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. B. Barron for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The reasons stated by Mr. Justice Stuart in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division in this case are quite satisfactory to me. I agree with them and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The parties hereto by articles of partnership agreed to become partners in the business\nof mixed farming and cattle buyers.\nThe respondent had, two days before, obtained a lease of four hundred acres of land in Alberta for the term of five years. By said articles of partnership it was\nagreed and distinctly understood\nthat the said lease should\nbe the property of and belong to the partnership\nand the respondent agreed\nto hold the said lease for the sole use and benefit and in trust for the said partnership\nand that he would execute such documents as required to insure the benefit for the partnership which was to become bound by the provisions and covenants contained in said lease and save respondent harmless.\nA month later these parties were negotiating for a dissolution of said partnership and as the result thereof orally agreed that the appellant should buy out all the respondent's interests therein, including the interest he had so acquired in said lease.\nThe learned trial judge decided in favour of the respondent seeking to enforce the terms of said oral agreement.\nThe appellant, amongst other things he contended for, set up the provision of the Statute of Frauds, and another statute requiring the contract to be in writing.\nSection 4 of the Statute of Frauds is the only one that seems to raise any difficulty.\nThe question raised thereunder is whether or not the contract in question was one for\nthe sale of lands tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or concerning them.\nThe authorities are collected in Leake on Contracts, 4th ed., pages 164 et seq., so far as bearing upon the necessity for an assignment of a lease for a term of years being reduced to writing. Of these the cases Buttemere v. Hayes[4], and Smart v. Harding[5], followed as they have been by many others, seem to establish the proposition that a contract for the transfer of a lease for a term of years or even a less interest in the possession of land, requires to be in writing.\nThe question raised herein is whether or not that is applicable to a bargain involving the transfer of the whole of the assets of a partnership when made between two partners.\nThe Partnership Ordinance in Alberta CO. 1915, ch. 94 by section 24 thereof, enacts as follows:\u2014\nSection 24:\u2014Where land or any interest therein has become partnership property, it shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be treated as between the parties (including the representatives of the deceased partner) as personal or movable and not real estate.\nIt is submitted by counsel for appellant that this refers to the law as administered in the courts of equity for many years prior to the passing of the Ordinance.\nAssuming that to be the case, had either of the parties any more, after the execution of the articles of partnership, than an equitable interest in the lease to dispose of?\nAnd is that on going a step further anything more than the interest either had in the ultimate result of what value there would be left for either after winding up? And I can conceive of a possible case of a joint adventure in the acquisition of real estate or any interest therein which might, in the last analysis, leave nothing but that real estate to be bargained about, and where there might be room for the application of the obiter dicta in the case of Gray v. Smith[6]. But under such articles of partnership as above referred to, I am unable to see any escape from the authorities cited by the court below, and many others, reducing the interest sold to a mere chose in action, and hence that the appeal should fail.\nI do not think it necessary in the view I take to consider the motion to quash further than to say that it is what the court expresses by its formal judgment, and not the opinions leading up thereto, that must govern, and the record shews that all the court decided was for a new trial.\nI think the appear fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I am not satisfied that the Appellate Division considered that the judgment on the previous appeal had determined the point of the applicability of the Statute of Frauds. An opinion to that effect was expressed but the actual determination of the question in its relation to the rights of the parties in the action seems to have been left for the judgment on the new trial. For that reason I think the point is open on the present appeal.\nOn the merits of the point, as the majority of the court take a different view there is perhaps not much object in entering upon a detailed discussion. The fallacy, if I may say so with great respect, which appears to have prevailed with the majority of the judges in this litigation is that the provision of \"The Partnership Act\" declaring the interest of a partner in partnership land to be (as between partners) personalty\u2014a provision declaratory of the law as it existed at the time the Act was passed\u2014concludes the point; in other words, that because for certain purposes the partner's interest is personalty it follows necessarily that it is something to which the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds can have no application.\nThe point of course is: Is such an interest an interest in land within the meaning of the fourth section? The judgments of Lord Cairns in Brook v. Badley[7], and of the Lords Justices James and Cotton in Ashworth v. Munn[8], appear to me to furnish the reasoning governing the determination of the point.\nLord Cairns' expression in the first mentioned case,\na person who has a direct and a distinct interest in the land,\nis\u2014if anything\u2014more clearly applicable to the case of a partner than to the case with which he was dealing; and all the judges who took part in the judgment in Ashworth v. Munn8 in the Court of Appeal treated the judgment of Lord Cairns as governing the case of a partner. Lord Justice Cotton said, speaking of a partner's interest, at p. 374:\nIt is, in my opinion, independently of any decision, an interest in land;\nand at pp. 376-7 he says it is quite impossible, in his opinion, to distinguish for the relevant purpose the case of partnership property from that of the interest of a person in land which is to be sold and the proceeds of which are to be divided among beneficiaries of whom he is one. The interest in every such case, of course, is, before any sale takes place, by reason of the doctrine of notional conversion, in contemplation of law personalty; but it is very clearly, I think, (as all the eminent judges held) none the less an interest in land. In Gray v. Smith[9], Lord Justice Cotton expressed the opinion that an agreement for the dissolution of a partnership and a transfer of one partner's share in the assets (including leaseholds) is an agreement within the fourth section concurring in this with Kekewich J.; and nobody after reading the judgment of the Lords Justices in Ashworth v. Munn [10] could be surprised at this expression of opinion.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The judgment of the Appellate Division delivered by Mr. Justice Stuart disposed of the question at issue in this Court so satisfactorily that I feel I cannot usefully add to it.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Stuart in the Appellate Division, I would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 15 Alta.

At the trial it was proved, (which evidence was objected to by the appellants) by this councillor's own admission, that he had in fact received notice in due time.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that the proceedings of the council at the meeting were irregular and null. Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins (Q.R. 19 K.B. 68) overruled.\nPer Anglin J. (dissenting).\u2014Any irregularity that there may have been in the giving of notice of the meeting was cured by article 14 M.C.\nA colonization road, which passed through the municipality respondent and a neighbouring municipality, had been opened by the provincial authorities long before the existence of both municipalities. The municipality respondent changed, within its limits, the course of this road without changing the place where it connected with the neighbouring municioality, and passed a by-law closing the other road. Per Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014It was not necessary for the municipal council to obtain, previously, the consent of the county council. (Art. 519 M.C.). Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 29 K.B. 146) reversed, Anglin J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, District of Roberval and dismissing the appellant's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nBelcourt K.C. and Bergeron for the appellants.\nAug. Lemieux K.C. and Lapointe K.C. for the respondents.\nIdtngton J.\u2014These three appeals were heard together as they involve the same question. For the reasons assigned by my brother Brodeur (with which I agree) relative to the failure of the council of respondent to act in compliance with the statutory provision (other than alleged need of county council's consent) which should have governed it in taking steps to pass such a by-law as in question, I think this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with Brodeur J.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014I respectfully concur in the unanimous opinion of the learned Judges of the Court of King's Bench, which I understand is shared by my brother Mignault, that this case does not fall within Art. 519 of the Municipal Code. I likewise concur in their view that notice of the presentation of the by-law in question was sufficiently given unless the legality of the council meeting of the 27th of October has been successfully attacked. In my opinion it has not.\nAny irregularity that there may have been in the giving of notice of that meeting to councillor Gilbert, who did not attend it, was, I think, cured by Art. 14 of the Municipal Code, since it is proved by Gilbert's own admission that he had in fact received notice in due time and the omission to serve it in the prescribed method and to state in the minutes of the meeting that notice had been given in conformity with the requirements of the Municipal Code therefore did not entail any substantial wrong or injustice. I accept the opinion of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench as to the admissibility of this evidence.\nWith profound respect for the contrary opinion of my learned brothers Brodeur and Mignault, in which I understand my brothers Idington and Duff are disposed to concur, I also agree with the views of the majority of the learned judges of that Court that this irregularity does not fall under the last paragraph of Art. 116 of the Municipal Code. I can find no justification for construing the explicit words\nif it appear that the notice of meeting has not been served on all the absent members (\"s'il appert que l'avis de convocation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres absents,\")\nas if they read \"if it does not appear that the notice of meeting has been served on all the absent members.\" and that, with respect, is what is done in maintaining this appeal. If it appears affirmatively that notice of the special meeting has not been given to every absent councillor, the council is, no doubt, obliged to adjourn at once, and, if it does not, nullity of any proceedings taken follows. But if this be not shewn\u2014if, although the usual proof of notice be lacking, the council is otherwise satisfied that every absent member was in fact notified\u2014while its proceedings may be irregular they are not declared null by Art. 116 M.C. They are, no doubt, taken at the risk of nullity if the fact should prove to be that any absent councillor had not been notified. But, if he was in fact notified and that can be established, a case is made, in my opinion, for the application of Art. 14 M.C. which ordains that\nno objection founded upon form, or upon the omission of any formality, even imperative, in any act or proceeding relating to municipal matters, can be allowed to prevail in any action, suit or proceeding respecting such matter, unless substantial injustice would be done by rejecting such objection or unless the formality omitted be such that its omission, according to the provisions of this code, would render null the proceedings or other municipal acts requiring such formality.\nThe omission to serve the notice of the special meeting in the method prescribed by Art. 340 M.C, and the omission of the entry in the minutes prescribed by the second paragraph of Art. 116 M.C, were in my opinion not informalities which, according to the provisions of the Municipal Code, rendered the proceedings of the council null. The only provision relied upon as entailing nullity is the concluding paragraph of Art. 116 M.C. The proceedings would have been null under that paragraph had it appeared that notice of the meeting had in fact not been received by the absent Gilbert. But that did not appear\u2014could not have appeared\u2014since the fact was otherwise. I think it is too narrow a construction of the last paragraph of Art. 116 M.C., to hold that it entails nullity merely because service of notice of the meeting on an absentee has been effected informally, where he has actually received notice in writing. For these reasons, I am with respect of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Ces trois causes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies parce qu'elles soul\u00e8vent des questions identiques. Ce sont des actions confessoires par lesquelles les demandeurs r\u00e9clament de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse la reconstruction d'une cl\u00f4ture entre leurs fermes et les routes y adjoignant. (Articles 505 CC, 473, 474, 475 C.M.)\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse plaide que ces routes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9es par r\u00e8glement municipal du 5 novembre 1917, et que la corporation pouvait enlever les cl\u00f4tures qu'elle y entretenait (art. 467 C.M.).\nLes demandeurs ont r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette d\u00e9fense que le r\u00e8glement est nul parce qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un avis de motion r\u00e9gulier (art. 359 C.M.), cet avis de motion ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance sp\u00e9ciale ill\u00e9galement tenue le 27 octobre 1917 (art. 116 C.M.).\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu ces actions en d\u00e9cidant : 1\u00b0 que l'avis de motion exig\u00e9 par l'article 359 du code municipal n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, et 2\u00b0 que le r\u00e8glement ayant trait \u00e0 la fermeture d'un chemin qui sert de sortie d'une municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre (art. 519 C.M.) ne devenait en vigueur qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le conseil de comt\u00e9.\nLa cour d'appel[2] a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement et a renvoy\u00e9 les actions.\nLes faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au litige sont les suivants:\nLe gouvernement provincial a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 construire, il y a trente-cinq ans environ, un chemin de colonisation dans la r\u00e9gion du Lac St-Jean qui relie la rivi\u00e8re Saguenay \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re P\u00e9ribonka et qui passe \u00e0 travers six cantons. Ce chemin s'appelle le Chemin Archambault. (Rapports du Commissaire de l'Agriculture et des Travaux Publics de Qu\u00e9bec, 1887, p. 47. Rapports du Commissaire de l'Agriculture et de la Colonisation de Qu\u00e9bec, 1890, p. 170; 1893, p. 136-160; 1894, p. 381; 1896; p. 252). A certains endroits il suit la fronti\u00e8re des lots d'un rang et en d'autres il conduit d'un rang \u00e0 un autre. A l'entr\u00e9e dans la municipalit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, St-Henri de Taillon, il suit le front des terres du deuxi\u00e8me rang. Il monte ensuite entre les lots 21 et 22, 26 et 27, 30 et 31 des rangs trois, quatre et cinq jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il atteigne, \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re du sixi\u00e8me, rang, la municipalit\u00e9 voisine, St-Henri de Taillon Ouest. Les demandeurs sont propri\u00e9taires de fermes qui longent ce chemin dans le deuxi\u00e8me et le troisi\u00e8me rang. C'est la partie du chemin que la corporation intim\u00e9e veut fermer.\nLa corporation de St-Henri de Taillon a r\u00e9cemment ouvert une route plus \u00e0 l'est, entre les lots 14 et 15, sur les rangs deux, trois et quatre; et cette nouvelle route, qui part du chemin Archambault \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re du deuxi\u00e8me rang, pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9glise, rejoint ce m\u00eame chemin en utilisant le chemin de front du cinqui\u00e8me rang. Je d\u00e9signerai la route que l'on veut fermer sous le nom de route Boily-Fortin et la nouvelle route comme route de l'est.\nEn vertu de la loi (2064 S.R.P.Q.), une municipalit\u00e9 est tenue d'entretenir les chemins de colonisation qui traversent son territoire de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu'elle entretient les chemins qu'elle ouvre elle-m\u00eame. Elle ne peut fermer ces chemins de colonisation sans le consentement du minist\u00e8re (art. 2065 S.R.P.Q.).\nLe conseil municipal de St-Henri de Taillon para\u00eet avoir, le 9 juillet 1917, adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution demandant au minist\u00e8re de la colonisation de fermer les route Boily-Fortin qui fait partie du chemin Archambault, disant qu'une nouvelle route (route de l'est) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte. Cette permission leur fut accord\u00e9e le 30 ao\u00fbt 1917.\nCette fermeture projet\u00e9e a \u00e9videmment m\u00e9content\u00e9 plusieurs contribuables, car une assembl\u00e9e du conseil a lieu le 15 octobre 1917; et, apr\u00e8s avoir pris le vote des contribuables pr\u00e9sents, il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sur une proposition second\u00e9e par Ad\u00e9lard Gilbert que la route Boily-Fortin resterait ouverte.\nLes partisans de la fermeture ne se tinrent pas pour battus, car le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, ayant re\u00e7u des requ\u00eates de leur part, convoqua pour le 27 octobre 1917 une s\u00e9ance sp\u00e9ciale du conseil. Au lieu de signifier r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les avis, conform\u00e9ment aux articles 115 et 340 du code municipal, en en laissant une copie \u00e0 chacun des conseillers en personne ou \u00e0 leur domicile ou place d'affaires, il les d\u00e9posa au bureau de poste.\nAu jour fix\u00e9 par l'assembl\u00e9e, Gilbert, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui avait le 15 octobre second\u00e9 la proposition de laisser la route Boily-Fortin ouverte, \u00e9tait absent. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la s\u00e9ance ne mentionne pas qu'avant de proc\u00e9der aux affaires, le conseil ait constat\u00e9 que l'avis de convocation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 ce membre (art. 116 C.M.); on n'a pas clos l'assembl\u00e9e ainsi que le requiert l'article 116 C.M. sous peine de nullit\u00e9; au contraire, les autres conseillers ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et ont adopt\u00e9 deux propositions, la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9voquant les proc\u00e9dures du 15 octobre, et la seconde autorisant le secr\u00e9taire \u00e0 donner des avis publics convoquant les contribuables \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e et d\u00e9clarant qu'\u00e0 cette assembl\u00e9e le conseil proc\u00e9dera, apr\u00e8s examen des requ\u00eates, \u00e0 la passation d'un r\u00e8glement ordonnant la fermeture des routes Boily-Fortin. L'avis public fut donn\u00e9 pour le 5 novembre 1917; et ce jour-l\u00e0 le conseil a adopt\u00e9 unanimement (Gilbert \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent) un r\u00e8glement ordonnant la fermeture de ces routes.\nPlus tard, le 24 novembre, le conseil adopta une autre r\u00e9solution autorisant le maire \u00e0 engager des hommes\npour enlever la broche des routes entre 21 et 22, rang deux, et entre 26 et 27, rangs trois et quatre; les hommes nomm\u00e9s pour cet ouvrage devront, avec la permission des propri\u00e9taires, fermer les routes \u00e0 chaque bout avec une cl\u00f4ture.\nLes personnes envoy\u00e9es pour s'entendre avec les propri\u00e9taires voisins enlev\u00e8rent les cl\u00f4tures sans leur consentement.\nComme on le voit, il y a eu de la part du conseil, beaucoup d'h\u00e9sitation et de contradiction dans ses actes. En ao\u00fbt, r\u00e9solution pour fermer la route d'abord. Le 15 octobre, on d\u00e9cide de laisser le chemin ouvert. Le 27 octobre, on r\u00e9voque la r\u00e9solution du 15 octobre. Le 5 novembre, un r\u00e8glement est adopt\u00e9 pour fermer la route; et enfin le 24 novembre, on engage des hommes pour enlever les cl\u00f4tures, mais on leur recommande de ne fermer la route qu'avec le consentement des propri\u00e9taires.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si cette assembl\u00e9e du 27 octobre est l\u00e9gale.\nLe nouveau code municipal s'est \u00e9videmment inspir\u00e9 de l'id\u00e9e qu'il faut \u00eatre plus rigoureux qu'on ne l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 au sujet de ces assembl\u00e9es sp\u00e9ciales et des avis qu'il faut donner. Nous n'avons qu'\u00e0 lire \u00e0 ce sujet le rapport des codificateurs en date du 20 novembre 1912 (p. VIII) sur les sessions du conseil. Ainsi, dans l'ancien code, l'avis qu'il fallait donner aux conseillers pour une session sp\u00e9ciale n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessairement par \u00e9crit (arts. 126 et 215 ancien code municipal) mais l'article 115 C.M. exige imp\u00e9rieusement que cet avis sp\u00e9cial doit \u00eatre maintenant par \u00e9crit. Le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu \u00e9videmment \u00e9carter la jurisprudence de la cour d'appel dans la cause de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins[3], o\u00f9 on avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que si une session du conseil est ajourn\u00e9e faute de quorum \u00e0 un jour subs\u00e9quent, l'avis requis sous l'article 139 de l'ancien code, alors en force, pouvait \u00eatre donn\u00e9 verbalement. Aujourd'hui, au contraire, dans un cas semblable, l'article 118 du nouveau code exige que ce soit par \u00e9crit.\nUn r\u00e8glement pouvait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 sans donner d'avis de motion; maintenant l'article 359 du code municipal exige un avis de motion.\nComment l'avis pour les assembl\u00e9es sp\u00e9ciales doit-il \u00eatre donn\u00e9 aux conseillers?\nCet avis sp\u00e9cial doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 par \u00e9crit, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit (art. 115 C.M.). L'article 332 C.M. nous indique ce que cet avis doit contenir. Des copies d\u00fbment attest\u00e9es doivent en \u00eatre faites pour en remettre une \u00e0 la personne \u00e0 \u00eatre notifi\u00e9e (art. 332 C.M.). L'article 340 C.M. nous dit que la signification d'un tel avis sp\u00e9cial se fait en laissant une copie de l'avis \u00e0 celui \u00e0 qui il est adress\u00e9 en personne, soit \u00e0 son domicile, soit \u00e0 sa place d'affaires. L'article 344 C.M. nous indique les heures auxquelles un avis sp\u00e9cial peut \u00eatre signifi\u00e9; et l'article 345 C.M. nous d\u00e9clare que si les portes du domicile ou de la place d'affaires sont ferm\u00e9es alors la copie de l'avis doit \u00eatre affich\u00e9e sur l'une de ces portes. Quand la personne a fait la signification, elle doit en donner un certificat sign\u00e9 et attest\u00e9 soit sous son serment d'office ou sous serment sp\u00e9cial, donner son nom, sa r\u00e9sidence, la description de la mani\u00e8re dont l'avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 et le jour, le lieu et l'heure de la signification (art. 355 C.M.). Ce certificat doit accompagner l'original de l'avis et \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans les archives de la corporation (art. 334 C.M.).\nDans le cas actuel, nous trouvons dans les archives de la corporation le certificat suivant:\nJe, soussign\u00e9, J. L. Larouche, certifie sous serment d'office que j'ai signifi\u00e9 l'avis sp\u00e9cial par \u00e9crit aux conseillers sus-nomm\u00e9s en laissant une copie \u00e0 chacun d'eux au bureau de poste entre et heure de 1' -midi le 22\u00e8me jour du mois d'octobre 1917.\n(Sign\u00e9) J. L. Larouche.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident que la signification de l'avis sp\u00e9cial n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite suivant les dispositions de la loi, qui exigent de celui qui la fait de se transporter au domicile ou \u00e0 la place d'affaires du conseiller, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne lui remette cet avis ailleurs \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame en personne (arts. 340, 344 C.M.).\nPouvait-on faire la preuve testimoniale du fait que tout de m\u00eame l'avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 au conseiller Gilbert qui \u00e9tait absent \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e du 27 octobre?\nJe dis que non. Il y a eu objection \u00e0 cette preuve et cette objection aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre maintenue. Le code municipal exigeant que ces certificats de signification d'avis soient par \u00e9crit, les tribunaux ne sauraient accepter d'autre preuve que celle r\u00e9sultant de l'\u00e9crit lui-m\u00eame. L'article 1233 du code civil nous indique les cas o\u00f9 la preuve testimoniale peut \u00eatre admise. Le fait qui nous occupe ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l'un de ces cas; et l'article 1233 C.C. ajoute:\nDans tous les autres cas, la preuve doit se faire au moyen d'\u00e9crits ou par le serment de la partie adverse. Que devait faire le conseil \u00e0 sa s\u00e9ance du 27 octobre? L'article 116 C.M. nous l'indique:\nLe conseil municipal, avant de proc\u00e9der aux affaires \u00e0 cette session doit constater et mentionner dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la s\u00e9ance, que l'avis de convocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 tel que requis par les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code aux membres du conseil qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'ouverture. S'il appert que l'avis de convocation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres absents, la session doit \u00eatre close \u00e0 l'instant sous peine de nullit\u00e9 de toute proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e.\nDans la cause actuelle, le conseiller Gilbert \u00e9tait absent. Alors le conseil aurait d\u00fb, avant de proc\u00e9der, ins\u00e9rer dans son proc\u00e8s-verbal si l'avis de convocation lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9. Il ne l'a pas fait. Et ce pour une bonne raison, c'est que le certificat de signification qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux archives de la corporation ne d\u00e9montrait pas que l'avis lui e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 remis. Ce certificat \u00e9tablissait bien que l'avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau de poste; mais rien n'\u00e9tablissait qu'il lui \u00e9tait parvenu. Alors la session aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre close; et ne l'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9, les proc\u00e9dures qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sont frapp\u00e9es de nullit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, la convocation des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e \u00e0 cette assembl\u00e9e est nulle, ainsi que l'avis de motion qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 qu'un r\u00e8glement serait adopt\u00e9 pour la fermeture du chemin en question \u00e0 la prochaine s\u00e9ance du conseil. Mais il est \u00e9vident que ces d\u00e9lais ne faisaient pas l'affaire des partisans de la fermeture; ils ont insist\u00e9 pour proc\u00e9der, croyant leurs chances meilleures maintenant qu'en attendant un peu plus tard.\nOn a invoqu\u00e9 l'article 14 du code municipal, qui dit que l'omission de formalit\u00e9s m\u00eame imp\u00e9ratives ne saurait constituer une objection s\u00e9rieuse, \u00e0 moins qu'une injustice r\u00e9elle ne d\u00fbt en r\u00e9sulter. Mais l'article 14 C.M. ajoute:\n\u00e0 moins que les formalit\u00e9s omises ne soient de celles dont l'omission rend nuls, d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code, les proc\u00e9dures ou autres actes municipaux qui doivent en \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9s. Or l'article 116 C.M. d\u00e9clare formellement que\ns'il appert que l'avis de convocation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres absents, la session doit \u00eatre close \u00e0 l'instant, sous peine de nullit\u00e9 de toute proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut donc pas invoquer au soutien de ses irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s l'article 16 du code municipal. L'avis de motion de l'adoption d'un r\u00e8glement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance-l\u00e0 n'est donc pas l\u00e9gal; et alors elle s'est trouv\u00e9e, \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du 5 novembre, \u00e0 adopter un r\u00e8glement pour la fermeture du chemin sans un avis pr\u00e9alable. L'article 359 C.M. d\u00e9clare que tout r\u00e8glement, sous peine de nullit\u00e9, doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un avis de motion donn\u00e9 s\u00e9ance tenante et il ne peut \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 une s\u00e9ance subs\u00e9quente. L'avis de motion en question a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement tenue et il rend, par cons\u00e9quent, nulle l'adoption du r\u00e8glement fait \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance subs\u00e9quente.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse a invoqu\u00e9 un jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la cour d'appel dans une cause de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins[4], o\u00f9 l'on trouve le jug\u00e9 suivant:\nWhen a regular session of a municipal council is adjourned, for want of a quorum, to a subsequent day, the notice of the adjournment to the absent councillors, required under art. 139 M.C., may be given verbally, and, although service of such notice must be established at the resumed session, a mention in the minutes that this was done is not essential to the validity of the proceedings. Hence, a resolution passed at such a resumed session, although the minutes contain no reference to the notice given after adjournment to the absent councillors, if no substantial injustice is shown to result therefrom, will not, in view of art. 16 M.C., be declared null and void.\nCette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e en 1909 par une majorit\u00e9 de quatre juges contre un. Le juge Cimon, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissident, \u00e9tait bien au courant de nos lois municipales, vu qu'il \u00e9tait juge dans un district rural et qu'il y avait exerc\u00e9 sa profession toute sa vie. Ce jugement de la cour d'appel renversait celui de la cour de revision qui \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e du juge Langelier, alors juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant, Sir Louis Jett\u00e9, qui est devenu plus tard juge-en-chef de la cour d'appel, et du juge Carroll, qui est aujourd'hui juge de la cour d'appel.\nComme on le voit, les opinions \u00e9taient s\u00e9rieusement partag\u00e9es dans cette cause de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins[5]. De plus, cette cause n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e sur la validit\u00e9 d'une assembl\u00e9e convoqu\u00e9e par avis sp\u00e9cial, mais sur la validit\u00e9 d'une assembl\u00e9e ajourn\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire sous l'article 139 du code municipal qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans des termes diff\u00e9rents de notre article 116 du code municipal actuel.\nAinsi l'avis sp\u00e9cial n'avait pas besoin d'\u00eatre par \u00e9crit, mais pouvait \u00eatre donn\u00e9 verbalement. Le certificat de signification de cet avis pouvait se faire alors verbalement devant le conseil et l'article 139 de l'ancien code n'exigeait pas que la session f\u00fbt close \u00e0 l'instant\ns'il appert que l'avis de convocation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres absents\nsous peine de nullit\u00e9; mais on disait simplement que le d\u00e9faut de signification rend nulle toute proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance du conseil. Notre article 116 du code actuel est couch\u00e9 dans des termes plus pr\u00e9cis et plus formels et, par cons\u00e9quent, je crois que l'on peut difficilement invoquer cette d\u00e9cision de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins5. D'apr\u00e8s la nouvelle r\u00e9daction des articles sur la mati\u00e8re, les formalit\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre accomplies d'une mani\u00e8re plus certaine; l'avis ne doit pas \u00eatre simplement verbal mais doit \u00eatre par \u00e9crit. Tout cela, il me semble, d\u00e9montre que le jugement dans la cause de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins5 ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 dans la cause actuelle. On a invoqu\u00e9 \u00e9galement la cause de Mathieu v. Corporation de St Fran\u00e7ois[6], jug\u00e9e en 1918 et o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'une r\u00e9solution d'un conseil municipal enjoignant au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de donner avis public qu'\u00e0 la session g\u00e9n\u00e9rale subs\u00e9quente du conseil un r\u00e8glement sera adopt\u00e9 pour une fin indiqu\u00e9e, \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 l'avis de motion pr\u00e9alable requis par l'article 359 du code municipal.\nIl s'agissait dans cette cause d'un r\u00e8glement qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 non pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sous l'autorit\u00e9 du code municipal mais sous l'Acte des Bonnes Routes, 3 Geo. V, c. 21. On avait adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement et on avait donn\u00e9 un avis de ce r\u00e8glement \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e pr\u00e9alable; mais la cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un r\u00e8glement n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire et que l'on pouvait proc\u00e9der simplement par r\u00e9solution; et le regrett\u00e9 juge-en-chef, Sir Horace Archambault, apr\u00e8s avoir exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que j'ai cit\u00e9e plus haut dans le jug\u00e9, dit:\nD'ailleurs, la loi des bons chemins n'oblige pas le conseil de proc\u00e9der par r\u00e8glement. Il l'autorise \u00e0 proc\u00e9der par r\u00e9solution, et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'une r\u00e9solution soit pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d'un avis de motion. Si le document dont il s'agit n'est pas valide comme r\u00e8glement, il l'est certainement comme r\u00e9solution.\nComme on le voit, il n'y a pas de d\u00e9cision formelle sur le point que l'avis qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e du 27 octobre pouvait valoir comme avis publie exig\u00e9 par l'article 359 du code municipal.\nMaintenant pouvait-on fermer les routes Boily-Fortin?\nCes routes forment partie d'un chemin de colonisation connu sous le nom de chemin Archambault qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es par le gouvernement provincial, avant la fondation de la municipalit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse et des municipalit\u00e9s environnantes. Quand des municipalit\u00e9s sont \u00e9tablies et qu'il y a des chemins de colonisation, ces chemins tombent sous la juridiction et le contr\u00f4le de la municipalit\u00e9 et sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des chemins locaux et non pas comme des chemins de comt\u00e9. Un chemin local peut \u00eatre sous le contr\u00f4le d'une municipalit\u00e9, mais quand il s'agit de le fermer, il faut voir si ce chemin sert de sortie \u00e0 une autre municipalit\u00e9. Dans ce cas-l\u00e0, quoique le chemin soit un chemin local, il ne peut pas \u00eatre ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit avec le consentement du conseil de comt\u00e9. (Art. 519 C.M.).\nLes parties du chemin Archambault qui se trouvaient dans la municipalit\u00e9 de St-Henri de Taillon sont bien tomb\u00e9es sous le contr\u00f4le de cette municipalit\u00e9, mais pouvait-elle en fermer une partie sans le consentement du conseil de comt\u00e9? S'il s'agissait de chemins ordinaires, d'une route qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par une municipalit\u00e9 et qui ne toucherait pas directement \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 voisine, je comprendrais que le conseil local pourrait fermer cette route sans r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au conseil de comt\u00e9. Mais quand il s'agit d'un chemin de colonisation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert pour toute une r\u00e9gion, ce chemin ne peut pas \u00eatre d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 sans le consentement du conseil de comt\u00e9.\nNous avons la preuve dans le cas actuel que ce chemin pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 par les contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9 voisine, St-Henri de Taillon Ouest, pour aller \u00e0 un quai qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur le Lac St-Jean, \u00e0 un endroit appel\u00e9 Rivi\u00e8re-\u00e0-la-Pipe. 60-61 V. c. 2, 1897, p. 33. Et voici que par la fermeture de cette route, ces contribuables vont \u00eatre oblig\u00e9s de s'allonger pour atteindre le quai qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit pour l'accommodation de tous les colons de la r\u00e9gion. Le conseil de comt\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb, dans les circonstances, \u00eatre saisi de la question pour savoir si on devait donner suite \u00e0 cette fermeture ou non.\nJe crois donc que la corporation intim\u00e9e a eu tort de fermer ce chemin et d'enlever cette cl\u00f4ture avant d'avoir obtenu cette autorisation du conseil de comt\u00e9.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel et que les jugements de la cour sup\u00e9rieure doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9tablis.\nMignault J.\u2014Ces trois causes soul\u00e8vent les m\u00eames questions et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9es ensemble. Il y avait une quatri\u00e8me cause, William Tremblay v. La Corporation de St-Henri de Taillon, o\u00f9 on avait \u00e9galement appel\u00e9 du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en appel. Cette derni\u00e8re cause diff\u00e9rait des trois autres en ce que le demandeur (appelant devant nous) demandait l'annulation du r\u00e8glement et des autres proc\u00e9dures de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse (intim\u00e9e devant nous) invoqu\u00e9es par cette derni\u00e8re dans sa d\u00e9fense aux trois actions, celles de Joseph Boily, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Fortin et Joseph Tremblay. Une question quant au droit d'appel ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans cette quatri\u00e8me cause, cette cour a ordonn\u00e9 comme suit:\nMarch 8. Motion to quash stands reserved until after hearing in the other three cases against the above corporation, Boily, Fortin and J. Tremblay. No further expense to be incurred meanwhile in this case.\nL'audition a donc eu lieu dans les trois causes seulement.\nLes actions des trois demandeurs appelants se plaignaient de l'enl\u00e8vement d'une cl\u00f4ture s\u00e9parant leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d'une route ouverte \u00e0 la circulation du public, l'entretien de cette cl\u00f4ture \u00e9tant pour moiti\u00e9 \u00e0 la charge de la d\u00e9fenderesse intim\u00e9e; et all\u00e9guant que leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s jouissaient d'une servitude consistant dans l'obligation de cl\u00f4turer cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la loi contre l'intim\u00e9e, les appelants concluaient \u00e0 ce qu'il f\u00fbt enjoint \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de faire, entretenir et maintenir une cl\u00f4ture suffisante pour s\u00e9parer leurs terrains de la dite route sur la moiti\u00e9 de son parcours \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait la cl\u00f4ture enlev\u00e9e.\nL'intim\u00e9e contesta ces actions all\u00e9guant que, par un r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 le 5 novembre, 1917, la route que les appelants d\u00e9claraient ouverte au public avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment ferm\u00e9e; que ce r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 des avis requis par la loi et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment promulgu\u00e9 et \u00e9tait en vigueur; que ce r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi et que l'intim\u00e9e avait autorit\u00e9 pour fermer cette route; que la cl\u00f4ture appartenait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9lais voulus par la loi.\nLa r\u00e9ponse des appelants all\u00e9gua que le r\u00e8glement du 5 novembre 1917 \u00e9tait radicalement nul, parce qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 de l'avis de motion requis par la loi; que les avis publics \u00e9taient \u00e9galement nuls, parce qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s sans autorisation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, la r\u00e9solution ordonnant la publication de ces avis ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e, le 27 octobre 1917, \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance sp\u00e9ciale du conseil irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement convoqu\u00e9e et tenue de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 entra\u00eener la nullit\u00e9 de toutes proc\u00e9dures qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es; que le 15 octobre, 1917, le conseil de l'intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les dites routes resteraient ouvertes, et que c'\u00e9tait pour tromper les appelants et d'autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s qu'une s\u00e9ance sp\u00e9ciale fut convoqu\u00e9e le 27 octobre, laquelle fut tenue irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et ill\u00e9galement comme susdit, et les avis intentionnellement donn\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que ceux qui \u00e9taient favorables au maintien des dites routes n'en eussent pas connaissance. Il est visible, par l'analyse que je viens de faire de la proc\u00e9dure, que le principal moyen soulev\u00e9 devant cette cour et les cours de premi\u00e8re instance et d'appel, savoir que les routes en question communiquaient d'une municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre et ne pouvaient \u00eatre ferm\u00e9es par le conseil de l'intim\u00e9e sans l'approbation du conseil de comt\u00e9, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9ponse des demandeurs. Il est possible que la quatri\u00e8me action (William Tremblay v. La Corporation de St-Henri de Taillon), soulevait cette question, point sur lequel je ne me prononce pas, mais je cherche en vain une all\u00e9gation de ce moyen de nullit\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9ponse des appelants. Cependant, comme cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e devant nous et devant les autres cours, je vais en traiter tout comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement soulev\u00e9e. J'ajoute que si je croyais ce grief fond\u00e9, j'ordonnerais tout amendement n\u00e9cessaire pour lui donner effet.\nPremier grief. Le r\u00e8glement en question ferme une route qui sert de communication d'une municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre et, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne pouvait entrer en vigueur qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le conseil de comt\u00e9, ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nIl s'agit de l'article 519 de code municipal, deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a, ajout\u00e9 en 1872 \u00e0 l'ancien code municipal par la loi 36 Vict., ch. 21, sect. 21, qui dit:\nN\u00e9anmoins, tout r\u00e8glement ou proc\u00e8s-verbal fait pour fermer un chemin qui sert de sortie, descente ou mont\u00e9e \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 locale voisine, ou pour d\u00e9tourner ce chemin \u00e0 l'endroit de telle sortie, descente ou mont\u00e9e, n'a de vigueur qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par une r\u00e9solution de la corporation de comt\u00e9, adopt\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des membres qui composent son conseil.\nJ'interpr\u00e8te cet article comme s'appliquant, non pas \u00e0 un chemin par lequel on peut parvenir \u00e0 un autre chemin qui sert de sortie, descente ou mont\u00e9e \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 locale voisine, mais comme emp\u00eachant, sans l'approbation du conseil de comt\u00e9, la fermeture du chemin m\u00eame qui sert de sortie, descente ou mont\u00e9e \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 locale voisine, ou le d\u00e9tournement du chemin \u00e0 l'endroit de telle sortie, descente ou mont\u00e9e. Je me sers du langage m\u00eame de l'article 519 C.M., langage assez d\u00e9fectueux au point de vue grammatical, mais la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur est rendue tr\u00e8s claire par le texte anglais de l'article, qui parle d'un r\u00e8glement ou proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant\nthe closing of a road leading into or from any neighbouring local municipality, or for diverting such road at a point where it leads into or from such municipality.\nCe que la loi d\u00e9fend, \u00e0 moins que l'approbation du conseil de comt\u00e9 n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue, c'est de priver les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 locale voisine par les chemins ou routes qui y conduisent, et cela me para\u00eet d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par les mots\nou pour d\u00e9tourner ce chemin \u00e0 l'endroit de telle sortie, descente ou mont\u00e9e,\nde sorte que nous devons examiner si, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, les appelants sont priv\u00e9s de cet acc\u00e8s. Si le chemin qu'ils devront parcourir pour atteindre une municipalit\u00e9 locale voisine est rendu plus long, sans qu'ils soient priv\u00e9s de cet acc\u00e8s, l'article ne s'applique pas.\nLes appelants se plaignent de la fermeture d'un chemin ou route conduisant \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 locale voisine, savoir \u00e0 Honfleur ou P\u00e9ribonka. Or il suffit de lire le t\u00e9moignage de l'appelant Boily (et les parties ont admis que les autres appelants diraient la m\u00eame chose) pour se convaincre que les appelants, par la fermeture de deux bouts de route longeant leurs terrains, ne sont pas priv\u00e9s d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette municipalit\u00e9, bien que le chemin qu'ils ont \u00e0 parcourir soit plus long. J'en cite un court passage: Q. Si vous voulez aller aujourd'hui \u00e0 Honfleur, vous avez un chemin pour y aller?\u2014R. Il y a un chemin.\nQ. Plus long?\u2014R. Plus long.\nQ. Vous avez un chemin pour aller \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 voisine, la fermeture de cette route-l\u00e0 ne vous a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 d'avoir un chemin existant dans votre municipalit\u00e9?\u2014R. Cette route-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait construite quand je me suis b\u00e2ti le long de la route.\nQ. Cela vous fait plus long?\u2014R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous avez encore un chemin complet pour aller \u00e0 P\u00e9ribonka et l'autre bord? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Seulement que cela vous rallonge?\u2014R. Cela nous rallonge.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que ce premier grief est mal fond\u00e9. Je puis ajouter que l'intim\u00e9e, avant de fermer ces bouts de route, avait obtenu l'autorisation du D\u00e9partement de la Colonisation, des Mines et des P\u00eacheries de Qu\u00e9bec, autorisation qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire car des deniers publics avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction du chemin.\nDeuxi\u00e8me grief. Il s'agit de l'assembl\u00e9e du conseil de l'intim\u00e9e, le 27 octobre, 1917, \u00e0 laquelle on a ordonn\u00e9 qu'avis public f\u00fbt donn\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par le conseil le 5 novembre. L'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu'aucun avis de motion de ce r\u00e8glement au d\u00e9sir de l'article 359 C.M. n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9; il ne discute pas autrement la question de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette assembl\u00e9e. Or la cour d'appel \u00e9tait d'opinion que l'avis public ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union pouvait valoir comme avis de motion, suivant en cela sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure dans la cause de Mathieu v. Corporation de la paroisse de St-Fran\u00e7ois[7]. En cela, si la session du 27 octobre a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement convoqu\u00e9e et tenue, je partage l'opinion de la cour d'appel.\nCependant voici la principale difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'avis de motion qu'on pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. L'un des conseillers, le nomm\u00e9 Ad\u00e9lard Gilbert, n'assistait pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 27 octobre, qui \u00e9tait une session sp\u00e9ciale du conseil convoqu\u00e9e par le maire. Les avis aux conseillers de cette session avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier par des lettres non recommand\u00e9es, et il y a de lui au dossier un certificat, dat\u00e9 du 23 octobre, de l'envoi de l'avis par ces lettres. L'honorable juge Pelletier dit que ce certificat \u00e9tait sur la table du conseil \u00e0 son assembl\u00e9e du 27 octobre. Je n'ai pu v\u00e9rifier cette affirmation au dossier; j'y trouve, au contraire, dans la d\u00e9position de secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, Larouche, l'admission que ce certificat n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit au conseil au d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9ance, et il n'est pas mentionn\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s-verbal.\nLa cour d'appel s'est bas\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9cision dans la cause de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins[8], pour \u00e9carter l'objection. On y avait jug\u00e9, sous l'empire de l'ancien code municipal, que lorsqu'une session r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d'un conseil municipal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e \u00e0 une date subs\u00e9quente, faute de quorum, l'avis pouvait \u00eatre donn\u00e9 verbalement aux conseillers absents, et que bien que la signification d'un tel avis doive \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e \u00e0 la session ajourn\u00e9e, la mention de cette formalit\u00e9 dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal n'est pas requise \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures. Dans cette cause-l\u00e0, la cour d'appel infirma le jugement de la cour de revision, et le principal argument qui l'a d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9tait bas\u00e9 sur l'article 16 de l'ancien code, maintenant l'article 14 du nouveau.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, la cour d'appel \u00e9tait unanime, mais l'honorable juge Martin aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que l'assembl\u00e9e du 27 octobre \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, s'il ne se f\u00fbt cru li\u00e9 par Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins8. Il ne croyait pas non plus devoir mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une jurisprudence \u00e9tablie depuis dix ans. C'est cette derni\u00e8re raison seule qui me fait h\u00e9siter en cette cause. Il est vrai que le nouveau code a amend\u00e9 l'ancien en exigeant, dans l'article 115 C.M., que l'avis soit donn\u00e9 par \u00e9crit, mais sans la d\u00e9cision de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins[9], on aurait pu consid\u00e9rer l'avis requis par les anciens articles 126 et 127 C.M. comme devant \u00eatre donn\u00e9s par \u00e9crit, car l'article 127 C.M. parlait de sa signification. Mais l'effet de l'amendement est de rendre la loi encore plus rigoureuse, et nul doute maintenant que, malgr\u00e9 Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins9, l'avis d'une session sp\u00e9ciale du conseil doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 par \u00e9crit. Si l'affirmation du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier qu'il n'a pas produit au conseil au d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9ance son proc\u00e8s-verbal de signification est exacte, et elle n'est ni contredite ni expliqu\u00e9e, la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la session ne peut se d\u00e9fendre m\u00eame en vertu de Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins9, car on y a admis la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prouver cette signification \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e du conseil.\nJe partage enti\u00e8rement l'avis du juge Martin quand il dit:\nIt appears to me that the three paragraphs of Article 116 M.C. must be read together and together form one article. Notice of a special meeting must be in writing (M.C. 115) and served by leaving a copy of the notice with the person to whom it is addressed in person or at his domicile or place of business (M.C. 340), and it was the duty of the council before proceeding to the business of the special meeting, to set forth in the minutes of the sitting that notice of meeting had been given to any member not present, in conformity with the requirements of the Municipal Code, and the concluding paragraph of Article 116 to the effect that, if it appears that notice of meeting has not been served on all the absent members, the sitting must be immediately closed under penalty of the nullity of all its proceedings, in my opinion refers to the preceding paragraph indicating the manner in which the evidence of the regularity and sufficiency of the notice is to be set down and established. A moins de prendre sur nous de mettre la loi enti\u00e8rement de c\u00f4t\u00e9, nous devons donner effet \u00e0 la disposition imp\u00e9rative de l'article 116 C.M., lequel comporte nullit\u00e9, que\ns'il appert que l'avis de convocation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres absents, la session doit \u00eatre close \u00e0 l'instant, sous peine de nullit\u00e9 de toute proc\u00e9dure y adopt\u00e9e.\nLa cour d'appel dit que cette disposition ne s'applique pas \u00e0 moins qu'il n'apparaisse que les membres absents n'ont pas re\u00e7u signification de l'avis. Ainsi si rien n'appert du tout il r\u00e9sulterait que le conseil peut continuer sa s\u00e9ance. Pour ma part, je n'interpr\u00e8te pas ainsi l'article 116 C.M.; et je crois qu'il faut lire le troisi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de cet article avec le deuxi\u00e8me, car ils ne forment r\u00e9ellement qu'une seule disposition. Le deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a exige la mention dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal que l'avis de convocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 aux membres du conseil qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'ouverture de la s\u00e9ance, et s'il appert (\u00e9videmment par cette mention au proc\u00e8s-verbal) que l'avis de convocation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres absents, la session doit \u00eatre close \u00e0 l'instant. N'estil pas \u00e9vident que le l\u00e9gislateur exige la preuv\u00e9 que l'avis de convocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 aux conseillers absents? Et afin que ma pens\u00e9e ne reste pas douteuse, je dirai que dans mon opinion le conseil doit constater, avant de proc\u00e9der, si l'avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 aux conseillers absents, et si la signification de cet avis n'appert pas, il doit imm\u00e9diatement clore la session.\nIl est vrai que Gilbert dit qu'il a bien re\u00e7u l'avis plus de deux jours avant la session. Mais on s'est object\u00e9 \u00e0 cette preuve, et d'ailleurs le conseil n'avait rien devant lui pour d\u00e9montrer que l'avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par Gilbert, et il aurait d\u00fb suspendre sa s\u00e9ance tant que cette preuve n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et la cl\u00f4re en l'absence de preuve suffisante que l'avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 au conseiller absent.\nSi donc on regarda comme un avis de motion la r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e le 27 octobre, cet avis n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \"s\u00e9ance tenante,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire pendant une s\u00e9ance l\u00e9galement tenue du conseil, au d\u00e9sir de l'article 359 C.M., qui est de droit nouveau.\nConvient-il maintenant de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une jurisprudence \u00e9tablie depuis plus de dix ans conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel dans Hudon v. Roy dit Desjardins?[10]. J'ai dit qu'on ne peut m\u00eame se r\u00e9fugier derri\u00e8re cette d\u00e9cision dans l'esp\u00e8ce, car il appert, par la d\u00e9position du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, qu'il n'a pas mis devant le conseil le certificat produit par lui et qui d'ailleurs n'aurait pas prouv\u00e9 que Gilbert avait re\u00e7u l'avis envoy\u00e9 par la poste. Mais le nouveau code \u00e9carte ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui se contentait d'un avis verbal, et, dans ces circonstances, et vu qu'il s'agit d'interpr\u00e9ter un nouveau code municipal entr\u00e9 en vigueur depuis peu, je crois qu'il vaut mieux que nous exprimions notre opinion sur le m\u00e9rite de la question. Mon opinion donc est qu'on doit se conformer aux exigences des articles 115 et 116 C.M., et, par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d'avis que la session du 27 octobre a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement convoqu\u00e9e et tenue.\nCeci am\u00e8ne l'application de l'article 359 C.M., et il faut tenir que l'avis de motion du r\u00e8glement du 5 novembre, exig\u00e9 \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9 par l'article 359 C.M., n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, et le r\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame est nul. L'appel dans les trois causes devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec les frais d'un seul appel dans cette cour et dans la cour d'appel et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli. J'accorderais cependant aux appelants tous leurs d\u00e9bours\u00e9s dans les trois causes.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bergeron & Brassard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lapointe, Langlois & Sylvestre.\n[1] Q.R. 29 K.B. 146.\n[2] Q.R. 29 K.B. 146.\n[3] Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n[4] Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n[5] Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n5 Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n5 Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n[6] Q.R. 28 K.B. 98.\n[7] Q.R. 28 K.B., 98.\n[8] Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n8 Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n[9] Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n9 Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n9 Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n[10] Q.R. 19 K.B. 68.\n"}

Smith (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1920: December 1, 17.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nAction\u2014Commission\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Leave to amend\u20146 Geo. V., c. 24, s. 19 (Ont.); 8 Geo. V., c. 20, s. 58 (Ont.)\nBy 6 Geo. V, ch. 24, sec. 19 amended by 8 Geo. V, ch. 20, sec. 58, sec. 13 of the Ontario Statute of Frauds, R.S.O. [1914] Ch. 102 was enacted as follows:\u2014\u201cNo action shall be brought to charge any person for the payment of commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing separate from the sale agreement and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that this enactment is not retrospective and does not bar an action to recover commission under a contract made before it came into force. Opinion of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 120) and of the trial judge (47 Ont. L.R. 37) overruled on this point.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 120), allowing the pleadings to be amended and damages claimed for breach of contract, affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Duff J.: The Appellate Division should have allowed the appeal and refused the motion for dismissal of the action. No amendment was necessary, the pleadings as they stood being sufficient.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the defendant but allowing the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim if he wished. The plaintiff sued for a commission on the price of land sold through his efforts and the only question raised on the appeal was whether or not the Act 6 Geo. V, ch. 24, sec. 19, amended by 8 Geo. V, ch. 20, sec. 58, which is set out in the head-note applied in the case of a contract entered into before it came into force. The trial judge held that it did. The judges of the Appellate Division took the same view but the majority held that the action should have been one for damages and allowed the pleading to be amended accordingly.\nArnoldi K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.F. Lawrence for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an action for the recovery of a commission on the sale of land under a mere verbal contract which would have entitled the respondents to succeed but for the provisions of the amendment, by 6 Geo. V, ch. 24, sec. 19, and 8 Geo. V, ch. 20, sec. 58, to the Ontario Statute of Frauds, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo action shall be brought to charge any person for the payment of a commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing separate from the sale agreement and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\nThe parties stated in their respective pleadings their respective contentions and agreed that the issues should be disposed of thereon under Rule 122 of the Ontario Judicature Act. Upon argument before Mr. Justice Middleton he held that under the imperative requirements of said amendment the respondent\u2019s action must fail, and dismissed it accordingly.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division they all seemed impressed with the correctness of that decision of the case presented to him but, upon the suggestion of Mr. Justice Riddell that the action had been misconceived and should have been founded upon facts which seemed to imply, in his view, a legal obligation resting upon appellant not to interfere with respondent\u2019s right to earn said commission, a judgment was reached, concurred in by the majority that the appeal should be dismissed and leave given to amend and substitute a new action founded upon such implication.\nWhen I say \u201cconcurred in by a majority\u201d it is to be observed that one of the three constituting the majority did so hesitatingly.\nThe others expressed their view by the opinion written by Mr. Justice Masten in which the Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division concurred, holding that the case as presented had been properly decided, but apparently assented to the permission to amend should that be made within ten days, and default thereof, the appeal and action should be dismissed with costs.\nNo such amendment has been made and the case has been argued before us upon its original footing.\nWe are always reluctant to interfere with mere matters of procedure in the courts below, but is this proposed alteration of the record a matter merely of procedure? I think not in light of the fact that respondent has not accepted what has been proffered. The amendment, if made, would only result in the trial of an action for damages upon the implication of contract and breach thereof, which never could result in any substantial damages.\nHow can there be substantial damages for breach of an implied contract upon which, in the ultimate result, the respondent could not shew that he had lost anything because he was only deprived of the possibility of acquiring a result upon which in law he could never recover?\nI think this cause, in any form it is put, is hopeless in light of the imperative requirements of the above quoted amendment, and hence that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and below, and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014The principle which in my judgment governs this appeal can be stated in the language of Willes J. delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber and speaking on behalf of a court of six in Phillips v. Eyre in 1870[3]. The passage is as follows:\u2014\nRetrospective laws are, no doubt, prima facie a questionable policy, and contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law. \u201cLeges et constitutiones futuris certum est dare formam negotiis non ad facta praeterita revocari; nisi nominatum et de praeterito tempore et adhuc pendentibus negotiis cautum sit.\u201d Accordingly, the court will not ascribe retrospective force to new laws affecting rights, unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that such was the intention of the legislature.\nI think the case falls within the principle because, 1st, the considerations upon which that principle rests apply to their full extent to the statute before us and 2nd, the conclusion is powerfully supported by the decisions of the courts in cases in which the principle has been applied. The well known passage may be recalled in which Lord Coke (2 Inst. 292) lays it down that it is\na rule and law of Parliament that regularly nova constitutio futuris formant imponere debet non praeteritis\nand the rule that statutory enactments generally are to be regarded as intended only to regulate the future conduct of persons is, as Parke B. said in Moon v. Durden, in 1848[4],\ndeeply founded in good sense and strict justice\nbecause speaking generally it would not only be widely inconvenient but\na flagrant violation of natural justice\nto deprive people of rights acquired by transactions perfectly valid and regular according to the law of the time.\nThe plaintiff had a contract with the defendants. Under that contract he was entitled, upon the performance of certain conditions, to be paid by them a certain sum of money. He was entitled also to have them refrain from taking steps which would prevent him earning his right to be paid by hindering him in the performance of the conditions. The effect of the statute construed, as we are asked to construe it, on behalf of the defendant, was to enable the defendants to refuse to pay, to refuse to perform their obligations under this contract because the plaintiff could never acquire a right to bring an action upon it unless the defendants consented to sign a memorandum complying with the provisions of the statute. It is quite true that the statute does not in terms declare such a contract to be void but the effect of taking away the right to bring an action is that practically as regards the power of the plaintiff to secure the right which the contract gave him according to the law as it then was, the contract is reduced to an abstraction. The plaintiff\u2019s right at the time of the passing of the Act was a valuable right, a right capable of being appraised in money; after the passing of the Act it became, if the defendant\u2019s construction is the right one, deprived of all value. It is not of any importance that the right of action had not accrued when the statute was passed, for\nwords not requiring a retrospective operation so as to affect an existing status prejudicially ought not to be so construed.\nMain v. Stark[5], in 1890.\nThe application of the principle is disputed on two grounds: 1st, and this is the ratio of the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton, it is said that the statute is a statute relating to procedure and the case therefore falls within the rule thus expressed by Lord Penzance, then Wilde B. in his judgment in Wright v. Hale[6],\nbut where the enactment deals with procedure only unless the contrary is expressed the enactment applies to all actions whether commenced before or after the passing of the Act,\nand the 2nd: It is said that the language of the statute sufficiently expresses the intention of the legislature that it should govern all actions without exception begun after the date fixed by the statute itself for the commencement of its operation.\nTo consider first the language of the statute. As Parke B. said in Moon v. Durden[7], the rule is \u201cone of construction only\u201d and\nwill certainly yield to the intention of the legislature; and that intention may be manifested by express language or may be ascertained from the necessary implications of the provisions of the statute, or the subject matter of the legislation or the circumstances in which it was passed may be of such a character as in themselves to rebut the presumption that it is intended only to be prospective in its operation. Examples might be multiplied in which judges of very high authority have said that the intention to affect prejudicially existing rights must appear from the express words of the enactment, e.g., by Fry J. in Hickson v. Darlow[8], at page 692,\nthey are not to have a retrospective operation unless it is expressly so stated.\nAnd even more numerous instances might be adduced of dicta enunciating the doctrine that the intention must appear from the words of the statute itself.\nThe principle is one of such obvious convenience and justice that it must always be adhered to in the construction of statutes unless in cases where there is something on the face of the enactment putting it beyond doubt that the legislature meant it to operate retrospectively.\nRolfe B. in Moon v. Durden[9], at page 33. In Midland Rly. Co. v. Pye, in 1861[10], at page 191, there is a passage in the judgment of Erle C.J. approved by the Privy Council in Young v. Adams[11], at page 476. It is in these words:\u2014\nThose whose duty it is to administer the law very properly guard against giving to an Act of Parliament a retrospective operation unless the intention of the legislature that it should be so construed is expressed in plain and unambiguous language; because it manifestly shocks one\u2019s sense of justice that an act legal at the time of doing it should be made unlawful by some new enactment. Again in Perry v. Skinner, in 1837[12], Parke B. in a passage approved in the last cited case says that\nthe law will not give retrospective effect to any Act of Parliament unless the words are manifest and plain.\nThe foundation of the rule being, as Lord Coke says that it is a\nrule and law of Parliament that regularly nova constitutio\nnon praeteritis \u201cformam imponere debet,\u201d this practice of Parliament itself would seem to be an adequate justification for the practice of the courts in restricting the application of statutes to the future unless the intention that they are to have a wider effect is perfectly plain.\nDecisions seemingly inconsistent with this principle may generally be explained as having proceeded from the view that either the subject matter or the circumstances of the legislation excluded the application of the consideration of justice and convenience upon which the practice of Parliament is based. In Cornill v. Hudson[13], for example, the court had to decide the question whether section 10 of the Mercantile Amendment Act of 1856, providing that the limit of the Statute of James should not be extended by reason of a person, in whom the right of action was vested, being at the time the cause of action accrued, beyond the seas or in prison. Lord Campbell in delivering the judgment of the Court said:\u2014\nThe intention was to prevent actions thereafter to be brought whether on past or future transactions. Does that tend to injustice? I see none. It only carries out what was probably the intention of the legislature, that persons should not, by merely remaining abroad, now that travelling is so easy and directions are so readily transmitted, be enabled indefinitely to prolong the time within which they may commence their actions. The period might extend to fifty years. Then as to imprisonment. An imprisonment of six years for crime is extremely rare in this country: persons might often commit the grossest injustice by remaining voluntarily in prison to keep alive the right of action. The legislature intended to prevent this vexatious prolongation of the right. I see no injustice in this intention, which may fairly be collected from the words of the 10th section.\nOn the other hand in Jackson v. Wooley, in 1858[14], at pages 787-8, the Court of Exchequer Chamber held that section 14 of the same Act should not be applied in such a way as to deprive the plaintiff of a right of action existing at the time the statute was passed and the rule of construction laid down by Lord Cranworth then Rolfe B. in Moon v. Durden[15], at page 33, quoted above was approved. Lord Hatherley L.C., Pardo v. Bingham in 1869[16], at page 740, seems to have thought that Cornill v. Hudson[17], had been overlooked by the judges who decided Jackson v. Woolley14, but the report shews that Cornill v. Hudson17, was cited before the Exchequer Chamber; and in Williams v. Smith, in 1859[18], at pages 563-4, it was stated by Erle and Crompton JJ. that all the judges of the King\u2019s Bench (the judges who decided Cornill v. Hudson17) agreed with the opinion of the Exchequer Chamber and Crowdy J. explicitly adopted the passage quoted above from the judgment of Rolfe B. in Moon v. Durden15. Singularly Lord Hatherley does not refer to Williams v. Smith18.\nWest v. Gwynne, a decision of the Court of Appeal in 1911[19] is another case in which the point of view exemplified by the judgment of Lord Campbell in Cornill v. Hudson17 dictated the opinion of the Court and it was held that the general words of a statute passed for the purpose of correcting a state of law lending itself to grave abuse should not be restricted for the purpose of enabling people to exercise their legal rights unreasonably or oppressively from the vantage ground of the apex juris. Emergency statutes passed during the war providing for the suspension of particular remedies and intended only to be measures of temporary duration (see Welby v. Parker[20]), have been held to apply to existing contracts and securities on the ground that the language was clear and that the object of the legislation would otherwise be defeated.\nNow coming more precisely to the language of the statute before us, there is one peculiarity of it which brings it within the scope of judicial comment of high authority, namely, the fact that the words \u201cshall be in writing\u201d point to a writing to be brought into existence after the passing of the Act. Because of the corresponding language of the Statute of Frauds, Pratt B. said, in Moon v. Durden[21], at page 27, that the\nform of the condition on which the right to bring an action was made to depend imported that future agreements alone\nwere struck at; and Rolfe B. in his judgment delivered in the same case at page 36 expressed the opinion quite decidedly that the previous decision in Towler v. Chatterton[22], was open to criticism on the ground that the similar language in Lord Tenterton\u2019s Act\npoints to a writing to be signed by the parties * * that is to future acts only.\nAnd the form of this phrase appears to be a complete answer to the suggestion made by Mr. Arnoldi that the postponement of the date of the coming into operation of the statute is in itself a ground for thinking that it is to have a retrospective effect. As to this point, moreover, it could have little weight in relation to the bearing of the statute upon negotia pendentia in respect of which, of course, a cause of action might not accrue until after the date named.\nI come now to the first mentioned ground upon which the appellant relies, the ground upon which Mr. Justice Middleton proceeded. Is this a statute predudicially affecting rights as contemplated by Lord Coke\u2019s canon or is it a statute relating to procedure only within the rule stated by Lord Penzance. The last mentioned rule rests upon the simple and intelligible reason stated by Mellish L.J. in Republic of Costa Rica v. Erlanger, in 1876[23], at page 69, in these words:\u2014\nNo suitor has any vested interest in the course of procedure, nor any right to complain if during the litigation the procedure is changed provided, of course, that no injustice is done.\nTrue, in the application of this rule difficulties and differences of opinion frequently arise. In Wright v. Hale[24], already referred to, it was held that a statute enabling a judge to deprive the plaintiff of costs in a case in which but for the statute he would have had an unqualified right to receive costs, was a statute relating to matter of procedure only (23-24 Vict. c. 126, s. 34); but in a subsequent case, Kimbray v. Draper, in 1868[25], Cockburn C.J. and Blackburn J. used language indicating that in their view the decision in Wright v. Hale24 was not a proper application of Lord Penzance\u2019s principle. The rule, of course, does not imply that all new laws prejudicially affecting remedial rights are prima facie retrospective. Both Lord Penzance and Mellish L.J. used very guarded language, the former limiting the application of the rule to statutes which affect procedure alone and the latter excluding it where the effect of applying it would be to make the statute an instrument of injustice. It seems too obvious for argument that a statute declaring contracts enforceable by the usual method, (that is to say by action) for the breach of which either party may recover damages, to be no longer enforceable by action so that the parties have no longer any legally enforceable right under such contracts, is a statute which, if our language is to have any relation to the facts of the economic world, abrogates or impairs rights just as a statute taking away property does. A right in the legal sense, not only in the common language of men but in the language of common lawyers everywhere, connotes a right which the courts will protect and enforce by some appropriate remedy.\nThis may be illustrated by a reference to statutes giving or taking away a right of appeal. A right of appeal is, of course, a remedial right and the courts have had to consider frequently the question whether a statute giving or taking away a right of appeal should prima facie be construed as affecting the parties to pending litigation. If such statutes are to be regarded as regulating procedure only within the meaning of this rule, then prima facie their application would not be restricted to proceedings subsequently instituted. Speaking broadly, the courts have persistently refused to take this view of such statutes; they have almost uniformly been held not to fall within the category of statutes relating to procedure only on the reasoning expressed in these words by Lord Macnaghten in Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving[26], at page 372.\nOn the other hand, if it be more than a matter of procedure, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of the Act, the appellants would be entitled to succeed. The Judiciary Act is not retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment. And therefore the only question is, was the appeal to His Majesty in Council a right vested in the appellants at the date of the passing of the Act, or was it a mere matter of procedure? It seems to their Lordships that the question does not admit of doubt. To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a superior tribunal which belonged to him as of right is a very different thing from regulating procedure. In principle, their Lordships see no difference between abolishing an appeal altogether and transferring the appeal to a new tribunal. In either case there is an interference with existing rights contrary to the well-known general principle that statutes are not to be held to act retrospectively unless a clear intention to that effect is manifested.\nThere is however a group of authorities, which in this connection merits some discussion\u2014cases relating to the construction of statutes dealing with the limitation of actions.\nFirst, a word as to the decisions under the statute of William IV. The language of section 8 of 3 & 4, Wm. IV, ch. 27, was held to be retrospective. Jukes v. Sumner, in 1845[27]; Angell v. Angell, in 1846[28]. That section is declaratory in its terms and was said by Parke B. in the first mentioned of these cases speaking on behalf of the Exchequer Chamber to effect a \u201cparliamentary conveyance.\u201d In Doe d. Evans v. Page[29] it was held by the Court of King\u2019s Bench that section 7 of the Act was not retrospective.\nIn Towler v. Chatterton[30], it was held that 9 Geo. IV, ch. 14 (Lord Tenterden\u2019s Act) prevented the plaintiff recovering in an action brought after the passing of the Act based upon an oral promise made before the passing of the Act but six months after the cause of the action first accrued. The decision there rested upon the fact that an express provision of the statute postponed the operation of it for a period of seven months after the date of its passing and this provision, it was held, enabling plaintiffs to protect themselves by commencing their action before the Act should take effect removed all possibility of the mischief which the canon was intended to prevent. With this decision Rolfe B. disagreed. Moon v. Durden[31]. The same kind of question arose in The Queen v. Leeds and Bradford Rly. Co. in 1852[32], where the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had to consider a statute imposing a limitation of six months in respect of certain proceedings before a justice of the peace which provided that the enactment should not come into force until the expiration of 7 weeks after its passing. The Court held the statute to apply to proceedings taken after the passing of the Act in respect of a ground of complaint which had arisen before; but Lord Campbell is reported to have said in giving judgment\nif it had been enacted that the provisions of the statute should come into operation immediately I should have said that there was a hardship in their being construed retrospectively and I should have been unwilling so to construe them.\nCrompton J. added\nall the conditions of the enactment might be carried out without unjustly excluding any remedy for existing complaints.\nTwo decisions both reported in 8 E. & B. illustrate the manner in which the courts have dealt with such statutes. In Jackson v. Woolley[33], the Court of Exchequer Chamber had to consider the effect of sec. 14 of the Mercantile Amendment Act of 1856. The precise point to be determined was whether (payments having been made within six years before suit by a co-contractor of the defendant and before the passing of the Act) the effect of that action was to deprive the plaintiff of his right of action. The Court, (Williams J., Martin B., Willes J., Bramwell, B., Watson B., and Byles J.) held that such operation could not be given to that section without offending against Lord Coke\u2019s canon. The other case is Cornill v. Hudson[34] already discussed.\nThe combined effect of these two decisions apparently is that a statute dealing with the subject of time limit upon actions is not to be given a retrospective effect and is not to be applied in such a way as to deprive the plaintiff of a right of action which he had at the time when the statute was passed unless the court can clearly see from the provisions of the statute that such was intended to be the effect of it or unless the circumstances in which the statute was passed shew that no injustice of the kind struck at by Lord Coke\u2019s maxim would result from giving such operation to it. The last of the relevant authorities dealing with statutes on this subject is The Ydun[35] in which it was held that the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, (prescribing a time limit of six months for actions against public authorities and imposing a liability to costs as between solicitor and client upon the unsuccessful plaintiff in any such action) was an answer to an action commenced after the passing of the Act and after the expiration of the period of six months limited by the statute. The trial judge, Jeune P., seemed to think the language of the Act too clear to admit of the application of any rule of construction but proceeded to say that it was a case of a statute relating to procedure and that, at all events, there was no hardship because of the fact that some weeks had elapsed between the passing of the Act and the date on which it was to come into force. In the Court of Appeal A.L. Smith L.J. and Vaughan Williams L.J., treated the Act as an act dealing with procedure only and therefore retrospective. Romer L.J. expressed the opinion that the Act was retrospective but gave no reasons for his opinion.\nWith great deference, it is questionable, I think, whether the judgments in this case are of such a character as to afford any real guide for the interpretation of another statute in so far as they profess to lay it down that an Act attaching a time limit to the assertion of rights of action is within the rule an enactment relating to procedure only. Such a proposition is difficult to reconcile with Jackson v. Woolley[36], and it was not competent to the Court of Appeal in 1899 to overrule a decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1858. I am not suggesting that the decision in 1899 was an erroneous decision or that the Court of Exchequer Chamber would have decided that case otherwise. I am inclined to think that the language of the Public Authorities Protection Act points very clearly to an intention that the Act should apply to existing causes of action as well as to causes of action arising after the passing of the Act. But the judgment in the later case cannot, in face of Jackson v. Woolley36, be regarded as satisfactorily establishing the general proposition that such statutes are to be regarded as statutes dealing with procedure only and therefore prima facie retrospective. But a complete answer to all the reasoning based upon these decisions touching legislation upon limitation of actions is afforded by the decisions on the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds. The language of the statute now under consideration, so far as relevant to the present question, reproduces the language of that section almost ad rerbum; and if a decision upon one statute can ever be a conclusive authority for the construction of another statute these decisions upon the Statute of Frauds if not overruled would appear conclusive here. Of these there are two: Helmore v. Shuter[37], and Ash v. Abdy[38]. The first is a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the second of Lord Nottingham L.C. Both were decided in 1678. The second is never cited and its value as an authority, for the reasons given by Lord Campbell in the well known passage in vol. 4, Lives of the Chancellors, p. 271, may be slight. But no such doubt rests upon the decision of the King\u2019s Bench. In Moon v. Durden[39], Helmore v. Shuter37 was accepted expressly by three of the judges, Platt, Rolfe and Parke BB., as being unquestionably a sound decision. And Rolfe and Parke BB. explicitly treated it as an example of the application of the rule that prima facie statutes are to be construed as prospective, which indeed is the ratio upon which the decision was in terms put by the Court that pronounced it. It was accepted as not open to dispute that the rights of promisees would be prejudiced if the statute were held to relate to past promises. The view which appears to have decided Mr. Justice Middleton in declining to apply the principle of these decisions is that the authority of them disappears in consequence of the distinction which in modern times has been drawn between statutes directly invalidating contracts and statutes forming part of the lex fori as only affecting remedial rights; and the learned judge considers that because the effect of a statute is only to bar the\nlegal remedy by which a contract might otherwise have been enforced\nwithout directly invalidating the contract, it should for the present purpose be regarded as a statute relating to procedure only. The view of the 4th section which was taken in Leroux v. Brown[40] is that while contracts affected by it are not immediately vacated, the courts are prohibited from enforcing them, in other words, the right of action is taken away; this distinction was held to be sufficient to support the conclusion that the statute was a part of the lex fori. Upon that point the soundness of the decision has been doubted by at least one very eminent judge; see judgment of Willes J. in Gibson v. Holland, in 1865[41], at page 8 and 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 5th ed., p. 272, and Williams v. Wheeler, in 1860[42], at page 312.\nIt is quite clear, nevertheless, as Middleton J. says, that the rule of Leroux v. Brown[43], that the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds governs the proceedings on contracts in suit before an English court wherever made, is accepted law. Maddison v. Alderson, in 1883[44], and Morris v. Baron[45]. And it is quite true, also, that Lord Blackburn in Maddison v. Alderson44, seems to say that the effect of the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds is only to prescribe certain indispensable evidence \u201cwhen it is sought to enforce the contract.\u201d It may be doubted whether Lord Blackburn was for the moment adverting to the decisions in which (as Willes J. observed in Williams v. Wheeler[46], at p. 312, and in Gibson v. Holland41 at p. 9, it had been held that the existence of the memorandum at the time of the commencement of the action is a condition of the right to sue, a rule as Lindley L.J. said in In re Hoyle[47], at page 97, is \u201cfounded upon the words of the statute;\u201d and Lord Selborne, at all events, at p. 474 ascribes to the statute the wider effect of \u201cbarring the legal remedies\u201d which but for the statute might have been available.\nI will not repeat what I have said above in answer to the contention that a statute abrogating a right of action which otherwise a party to a contract might have asserted is not a statute prejudicially affecting an \u201cexisting legal right or status\u201d but an enactment relating merely to procedure. With great respect, I think for the reasons mentioned it is one thing to affirm that a statute is a part of the lex fori but to conclude that it is consequently retrospective as relating to procedure only involves a non sequitur. The appeal ought therefore to be dismissed.\nBut I am unable to concur with the view of the majority of the Court that the judgment of the court below is the right judgment. The appeal from the judgment of Middleton J. ought, in my opinion, to have been allowed and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action dismissed with costs.\nTwo paragraphs in the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell give the grounds upon which the Appellate Division proceeded:\u2014 In the view I take of the case the statutes have no bearing: the case has not been placed on the right basis. The real action is not to recover commission at all. Admittedly commission cannot be recovered under the contract between the parties and on its terms, for the money has not been received by the defendant, and therefore it is not payable to the plaintiff on the terms of the contract: Adlar v. Boyle[48]\nThe real cause of action is damages for breach of the implied agreement on the part of the defendant not to do anything to prevent the payment by the purchaser of the purchase money out of which the plaintiff was to receive his commission. I place this duty on a minimum basis when so expressing it,\nThe statement of claim alleged facts giving rise to a cause of action at least for damages on the principle stated by Willes J: in Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee &c. Co., in 1864[49], in a passage cited with the approval of the Judicial Committee in Burchell v. Gowrie & Blockhouse Collieries, Ltd.[50], at page 626 in the following words:\u2014\nI apprehend that whenever money is to be paid by one man to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay, is liable to the party who is to receive the money if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that he should receive it;\nand I have no doubt that the facts disclosed in the statement of claim prima facie establish the right of the plaintiff to have the damages measured by the commission he would have been entitled to receive had the business proceeded to its conclusion in the ordinary course. See per Lord Atkinson, Burchell v. Gowrie50, at page 626.\nI do not discuss the question whether the statement of claim does or does not disclose a cause of action for the commission itself. I think that may be an arguable question; see the judgment of Lord Watson, Mackay v. Dick, in 1881[51], at page 270, in addition to the judgment of Willes J. in the case already cited. I do not pursue the point, it is enough to say the statement of claim (whose function it is not to cast the plaintiff\u2019s right of action into formal legal shape but to state the constitutive facts giving rise to the right upon which he relies and to formulate the relief he demands), does state facts constituting a good cause of action and does ask for relief to which, as I have said, he is prima facie entitled, namely, the recovery of a sum equivalent to the amount of the commission to which he would have been entitled had matters proceeded in their normal course. True it is commission is claimed as commission and no doubt, if the view of the Court of Appeal be the right one, namely, that a right of action for the commission as such does not arise out of the facts stated, this in that view was not strictly accurate pleading; but there was a claim for \u201cfurther and other relief\u201d and, with all due respect, I am unable to perceive upon what ground it could be successfully contended that this claim for \u201cfurther and other relief\u201d would not embrace a claim for the amount of the commission as damages.\nWe have not been referred to the particular rule in the Ontario Rules of Procedure but no doubt under the Ontario practice as in the other judicature systems a prayer for further or other relief was unnecessary, the court having full power to grant such relief as it might deem to be just in addition to the specific relief claimed, this power being limited by two conditions as Fry J. said in Cargill v. Bower, in 1878[52], at page 508, 1st, that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief upon the facts alleged and 2nd, that it is not inconsistent with the relief specifically prayed. It is unnecessary to point out that no such inconsistency could be suggested as between the claim for commission as commission on the principle stated by Willes J. and a claim for damages measured by the amount of the commission which the plaintiff ought to have been allowed to earn. In Inchbald\u2019s Case[53], the plaintiff claimed payment of the commission as such and the court held that he was entitled not to the full amount of the commission but to the amount which, making allowance for the chances against him, it was probable he would have earned but for the conduct of the defendants.\nBut apart from all this, I cannot refrain from observing that the defendant\u2019s proceeding was a proceeding taken under consolidated rules 122 and 123, and that the point of law raised under the first mentioned rule was strictly limited to this, namely, that the statute was an answer to the action, and that the proceeding before Mr. Justice Middleton was a proceeding taken by consent for the purpose of having that specific question decided under that rule. And indeed as one might have expected in these circumstances the only point raised before Mr. Justice Middleton and the only point dealt with by him, indeed, the only point raised by counsel for the defendants prior to the judgment of the Appellate Division was that specific point.\nI assume that, in the proceeding under rule 122, a judge might (according to the Ontario practice) have power to dismiss an action on the ground that the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action; but that is a power which could not properly be exercised where the facts stated in the statement of claim did disclose a cause of action however inappro- priate the relief demanded might be unless it should appear that the action was brought solely for the purpose of obtaining some relief which the court had no power to grant, as in Dreyfus v. Peruvian Guano Co. in 1889[54].\nANGLIN J.\u2014A curious situation is presented by this appeal. The action is brought on a contract made in 1913, to recover commission on a sale of land. The facts stated[55], disclose rather a cause of action for damages for breach by the defendant of an implied term of the contract sued upon whereby it made the coming into existence of the state of facts on which the plaintiff would have been entitled to payment of the commission sued for impossible. Amongst other defences section 13 of the Statute of Frauds (R.S.O., c. 102), first enacted by 6 Geo. V, c. 24, s. 19, assented to on the 27th of April, 1916, and amended by 8 Geo. V, c. 20, s. 58, was pleaded. That provision is as follows:\u2014\nNo action shall be brought to charge any person for the payment of commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing (separate from the sale agreement) and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. This section shall come into force on the 1st day of January, 1917.\nThe words which I have put in brackets were added by the amendment of 1918.\nThe applicability of this statutory provision was brought before Mr. Justice Middleton for determination as a point of law, under Ontario Con. R. No. 122. That learned judge, while fully recognizing the general rule excluding retrospective construction, (Gardner v. Lucas[56], at page 601), on the authority of Towler v. Chatterton[57], and Grantham v. Powell[58], held the statute applicable, notwithstanding that the plaintiff was thereby deprived of a right of action, complete or accruing, existing when it was enacted. Moon v. Durden[59], and Gillmore v. Shooter[60], had been relied on by the plaintiff. The learned judge distinguished the former on the ground that by the statute there in question the contracts affected by it were declared null and void, and the latter he held in effect over-ruled by the distinction made in Leroux v. Brown[61], between statutes which avoid contracts and those that have to do merely with the enforcing of them by action. The statute now before us, says the learned judge,\nbars the legal remedy by which the contract might otherwise have been enforced, and so affords an answer to this action not by any retrospective effect but because it speaks from its date and prohibits the action.\nHe accordingly directed judgment dismissing the action\nOn appeal the Second Divisional Court of the Appellate Division made an order setting this judgment aside and allowing the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim within a stated period, but in default of such amendment being made confirmed the dismissal of the action. The amendment contemplated, as appears from the principal judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Riddell, and concurred in by Clute J., and sub modo by Sutherland J., was the substitution of the claim for damages, above indicated, for that to recover commission which, it was thought, must fail because the conditions on which the commission claimed would have become payable (through whose fault is not material) had not been realized. The making of this order would seem to imply that the Divisional Court, or at least a majority of the judges composing it, held the view that although the statute invoked would afford a defence to the action as presented it would not be an answer to it if amended as suggested. That was certainly the opinion of Mr. Justice Sutherland, who expressly states his agreement with Middleton J., and, unless it was shared by the learned Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division and Mr. Justice Masten, inasmuch as they also agreed with Mr. Justice Middleton, I find it difficult to understand their concurrence in the order allowing the plaintiff to amend.\nCounsel for the respondent, however, stated, with the assent of counsel for the appellant, that Mr. Justice Riddell had subsequently intimated that in his opinion the statute was not applicable to the action in either form. That may be what the learned judge meant when he wrote\nin the view I take of the case the statutes have no bearing; the case has not been placed on the right basis.\nCounsel for the respondent contended that section 13, if applicable at all, would afford the same defence to the action whether amended as proposed or as originally framed. With great respect for the learned judges of the Divisional Court who appear to have thought otherwise, I share that view. Both actions are based on the contract for payment of commission. Both alike require proof of it in support of the claim made. That proof under the statute, if it applies, must be made in writing and if such evidence be lacking any remedy by action is taken away.\nCounsel for the respondent (plaintiff) then stated that the determination of the issue as to the applicability of the statute to the action in either form is what his client really desires. But he omitted to give notice of intention to cross-appeal, as prescribed by our rule No. 100, from the portion of the judgment of the Divisional Court which directs the dismissal of the action in default of the amendment allowed being made.\nOn the other hand the only part of that judgment from which the defendant can appeal is that setting aside the judgment of Middleton J. and allowing the plaintiff to amend. In so far as that order may be regarded as discretionary an appeal from it does not lie. But if the action, in the form which the Divisional Court proposes it should take, would be equally open to the statutory defence invoked by the defendant, the order allowing the amendment could scarcely be upheld as an exercise of discretion. There can be no discretion to direct a futile amendment. It should be assumed that the amendment was allowed only because in the opinion of the court, or a majority of its members, the statute would not preclude the action so amended being maintained. On the questions whether the statute applies to an action based on a pre-existing contract and if so whether the claim, if amended as proposed, will be equally within its purview with that originally preferred, the defendant\u2019s appeal may be entertained and, the purpose of a cross-appeal by the plaintiff being thus attained, it probably becomes unnecessary to accede to his request for a dispensation from R. 100.\nI am, with great respect, of the opinion that the rule against the retrospective construction of statutes, which is fundamental in English law, Lauri v. Renad[62], at page 421, applies to this case. In the first place, section 13 of the R.S.O., ch. 102,\nis not retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment On the contrary the words\nunless the agreement shall be in writing\npoint rather to future contracts than to those already made. See observations of Baron Platt in Moon v. Durden[63], at page 30. The negative implication in section 5 of the Interpretation Act should also not be overlooked.\nThe language of section 13 is the same as that of the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds\u2014\nNo action shall be brought (whereby) to charge any person, etc., unless, etc.\nWe have in Ash v. Abdy (13th June, 30 Car. 2)[64], the view of Lord Nottingham (who states that \u201che brought the Bill into the Lords\u2019 House\u201d) that the Statute of Frauds (29 Car. 2) did not apply to an action which though begun after, was brought on a contract made before, its enactment. His Lordship overruled a demurrer based on the statute. It is no doubt to Gillmore v. Shooter[65] (30 Car. 2, Trin.) that Lord Nottingham refers as\nanother case in the King\u2019s Bench this very term where the same point being specially found was likewise adjudged upon argument.\nIt was there held that\nit could not be presumed that the Act has a retrospect to take away an action to which the plaintiff was then intituled.\nLord Nottingham naively adds\nwhich I was glad to hear of, but said, if they had adjudged it otherwise, I should not have altered my opinion.\nGillmore v. Shooter[66] has never been overruled. It is cited in many later cases without a question or adverse comment (e.g., Re Athlumney[67], at page 552), and is referred to as authority in such standard text books as Maxwell on Statutes, 6 ed., 384; Craies\u2019 Hardcastle on Statutes, 2 ed., 348, and Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, 163; see too 27 Hals. L. of E., No. 305. We thus have that \u201ccontemporanea expositio\u201d which the oft quoted maxim declares to be \u201coptima et fortissima, in lege\u201d (Maxwell, 6 ed., pages 531 et seq.)\nIt was as an addition to the Statute of Frauds, incorporated in the R.S.O. 1914 as c. 102, that the legislation now under consideration was enacted. The same form of words is used as is found in what is perhaps the most important provision of the principal Act. It is not unreasonable to assume, notwithstanding section 20 of the Interpretation Act, that these words were intended to bear the same meaning. Casgrain v. Atlantic & North Western Rly. Co.[68] At all events the construction put upon the like words used elsewhere in the same statute is perhaps the safest guide to their construction in section 13 (Blackwood v. the Queen[69]; Cox v. Hakes, in 1890[70]; and authorities dealing with them should be followed rather than decisions upon the language of other Acts however close the resemblance. I therefore abstain from examining numerous decisions upon other statutes in which the same construction as prevailed in the Gillmore and Ash cases was put upon provisions somewhat similar to that of the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds. A collection of them will be found in 27 Hals. L. of E. No. 305, note h.\nTowler v. Chatterton[71], and Grantham v. Powell[72], cited by Mr. Justice Middleton, deal with Lord Tenterden\u2019s Act, the latter merely following the former. Of Towler v. Chatterton71, Baron Rolfe says in Moon v. Durden[73], at page 36, that\nIt is worthy of remark that Lord Tenterden\u2019s Act points to a writing to be signed by the parties\u2014that is, to future Acts only; and consequently the decision giving to that section a retrospective effect was not a just one even if in conformity with the most narrow construction of its language.\nSome observations on one of the chief factors in the decision of the Towler and Grantham cases will be found in Re Athlumney[74], at p. 553.\nWhile Moon v. Durden[75] may not aid the respondent as much as it would if the action there dealt with had not been begun before the statute came into force, it is of value because Gillmore v. Shooter[76], is cited by Barons Platt, Rolfe and Parke as authority on the construction of the Statute of Frauds. Baron Parke certainly did not regard the second member of the section of the Gaming Act under consideration in that case\u2014\nno suit shall be brought or maintained in any court, etc.\u2014\nas an enactment merely affecting procedure, because he thinks (p. 44) that if it stood alone it would not apply to pending actions. The case of Knight v. Lee[77], dealing with a similar provision of the Gaming Act of 1892, may also be referred to. Bruce J. there says at page 44,\nHere the plaintiff had a vested right of action acquired before the statute came into force and it cannot be supposed that the statute was intended to take such right away. When carefully considered the foundation of Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s judgment holding the section now under construction applicable to the present action, seems to be that it falls within the exception made, in the case of statutes dealing with procedure, to the general rule prohibiting retrospective construction. The learned judge in his reference to Leroux v. Brown[78], indicates that he thought the effect of that decision was to bring the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds within that exception. What Leroux v. Brown78 actually decided was that as a provision dealing with and affecting merely the remedy for, and not the right created by a contract, the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds forms part of the lex fori and as such is applicable to all actions brought in English courts to enforce contracts within its purview wherever made. No doubt Chief Justice Jervis does say that the fourth section \u201crelates only to procedure,\u201d but he uses the word procedure in contradistinction to \u201cthe right and validity of the contract itself\u201d and probably meant no more than that it formed part of the adjective law. In the same sense Maule J. says:\nIt is part of the procedure and not of the formality of the contract;\nand Talfourd J.\nThat section has reference to procedure only and not to what are called by jurists the rights and solemnities of the contract.\n\u201cProcedure\u201d in the exception to the rule of construction under consideration is used in a more restricted sense. It has to do with the method of prosecuting a right of action which exists, not with the taking away of such right of action. As Lord Hatherly observes in Pardo v. Bingham[79], at page 741, referring to section 10 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act (19 & 20 Vic., ch. 97) which did away with the disability of absence overseas as an answer to the Statute of Limitations (21 Jac. 1, ch. 16).\nThere is a considerable difference between this case and a case where the right of action is actually taken away.\nAlthough statutes creating new remedies have sometimes been held available to enforce rights which had accrued before they were enacted, The Alex Larsen[80], at page 295; Boodle v. Davis[81], it is a very different thing to hold that a statute has, in the absence of express provision or necessary intendment, the effect of destroying an existing right of action. The taking away of a right of action is more than mere procedure and a statute which has that effect is prima facie within the general rule and not within the exception.\nIn dealing with Acts of Parliament which have the effect of taking away rights of action,\nsays Baron Channell in Wright v. Hale[82], at page 231,\nwe ought not to construe them as having a retrospective operation, unless it appears clearly that such was the intention of the legislature; but the case is different where the Act merely regulates practice and procedure;\nand Baron Wilde adds:\nThe rule applicable in cases of this sort is that, when a new enactment deals with rights of action, unless it is so expressed in the Act an existing right of action is not taken away. But where the enactment deals with procedure only, unless the contrary is expressed, the enactment applies to all actions whether commenced before or after the passing of the Act.\nThis passage from the judgment of Baron Wilde is expressly approved in The Ydun[83], at page 245. The thirteenth section under consideration prohibits the bringing of an action. Therefore, if retrospective, it takes away the right of action itself. It does more than prescribe\nwhat evidence must be produced to prove particular facts,\nwhich Pollock C.B. in Wright v. Hale[84] describes as a matter of procedure merely. It does not merely regulate the method or the means of enforcing the remedy; it takes the remedy wholly away. This subject is satisfactorily dealt with in Hardcastle on Statutes (Craies, 2 ed.), pages 343-355.\nWhen it is borne in mind that statutes excepted from the application of the general rule because they deal with procedure are held to apply to pending actions unless the contrary intention appears, RE Joseph Suche & Co., Ltd.[85], the decisions with regard to the operation of statutes taking away rights of appeal appear to be in point. Of these perhaps Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving[86], may best be referred to. The right to appeal from the Supreme Court of Queensland to His Majesty-in-Council given by the Order-in-Council of June 30th, 1860, was taken away by the Australian Commonwealth Judiciary Act of 1903 and an appeal to the High Court of Australia substituted therefor. This legislation was held not to affect the right of appeal to the King in Council in a suit pending when the Act was passed, but decided by the Supreme Court afterwards. Lord Macnaghten after adverting to the general rule and the exception and to the fact that\nthe Judiciary Act is not retrospective by express enactment or necessary intendment,\nproceeded as follows:\u2014 And therefore the only question is, was the appeal to His-Majesty-in-Council a right vested in the appellants at the date of the passing of the Act, or was it a mere matter of procedure? It seems to their Lordships that the question does not admit of doubt. To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a superior tribunal which belonged to him as of right is a very different thing from regulating procedure * * *. There is an interference with existing rights contrary to the well-known general principle that statutes are not to be held to act retrospectively unless a clear intention to that effect is manifested.\nThe same view had prevailed in this court in Hyde v. Lindsay[87], and their Lordships\u2019 decision was followed and applied in Doran v. Jewell[88]. If the right to appeal be a right of such a character that its abolition is not a matter of procedure, a fortiori the taking away of an existing right to bring an action would seem to be so and the construction of section 13 involving that result\nan interference with existing rights contrary to the well-known general principle.\nAs Baron Parke said in Moon v. Durden[89], at page 43:\nIt seems a strong thing to hold that the legislature could have meant that a party who under a contract made prior to the Act had as perfect a title to recover a sum of money as he had to any of his personal property should be totally deprived of it without compensation.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that section 13 of the Statute of Frauds, R.S.O., ch. 102, does not apply to this action either as originally framed or as it is proposed that it should be amended.\nRule 122, under which the proceeding now in appeal was instituted by consent, provides for the disposition before the trial of points of law raised on the pleadings. It is common ground upon the pleadings that the defendants have received only $244,000 (in payment in full for one parcel) of the purchase moneys payable under the agreement for sale in respect of which commission is claimed by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff has been paid $6,100, which exceeds the proportion of commission payable to him in respect of the moneys so actually received by the defendants. It is also common ground that as to the rest of the property the agreement for sale has been rescinded by mutual consent of vendor and purchaser. By the third paragraph of the statement of claim the plaintiff avers that the sum of $25,000 which he was to receive as a commission for affecting the sale, was made payable proportionately as the purchase money for the property should be paid. An issue of law is thus presented involving the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain this action in the form in which it was launched, i.e., to recover the balance of the $25,000 commission. If of the opinion that the position taken in the defence, that under the stipulation of the contract admitted in the third paragraph of the statement of claim, commission cannot be recovered on unpaid purchase money, is sound, it was within the discretion of the Appellate Divisional Court, instead of dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action because upon the facts stated by him it was wrongly conceived, to permit an amendment of the statement of claim. The exercise of that discretion, as already stated, is not a proper subject of appeal to this court. But, in so far as it may be appealable by the defendant I should incline to support the order made. I should have thought the allowance of such an amendment under the circumstances almost a matter of course in modern practice. There is no appeal by the plaintiff against the holding that he had misconceived his remedy. I am by no means so well satisfied, however, that, as Mr. Justice Riddell puts it,\nthe amount of money he (the plaintiff) would have received had the defendants not broken their implied contract with him, will give a very satisfactory measure of damages.\nIn the third paragraph of the statement of defence it is alleged that it was expressly stipulated and agreed by the plaintiff that in the event of the contract of sale being rescinded as to any portion of the lands embraced in it for any cause whatever, all right and claim of the plaintiff to commission in respect of such lands should be thereby determined and the contract therefor rescinded. This allegation is denied in the reply. The existence of the implied term of which the breach would be alleged in the action, if amended as proposed, is thus in issue. Moreover, other circumstances beyond the control of the defendants might have resulted in the purchase moneys not being paid in full. In this connection reference may be had to the recent decision of this court in Gold v. Stover[90], But these are questions with which we are not presently concerned. They will have to be considered when the action comes to trial.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014If the construction of the 13th section of the Statute of Frauds, R.S.O. 1914, ch. 102, added by 6 Geo. V, ch. 24, as amended by 8 Geo. V, ch. 20, be still open to us, in view of the decisions under section 4, my opinion would be that this section does not apply to actions brought after the statute on agreements for the payment of a commission on the sale of real property made before its enactment and which, before this statute, did not require to be in writing. This section reads as follows:\nNo action shall be brought to charge any person for the payment of a commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing separate from the sale agreement and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\nIf the question of the meaning of this provision be not concluded by authority, I would have no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, it applies to subsequent agreements only. The language of the statute clearly shows this.\nNo action shall be brought * * * unless the agreement * * * shall be in writing.\nI cannot conceive this language being applied to prior agreements, for if that had been the intention, the natural language would be \u201cunless the agreement is in writing.\u201d The word \u201cshall\u201d refers to the future, and is used in connection with both the bringing of the action and the form of the agreement. If saying that the agreement shall be in writing means past as well as future agreements, then stating that no action shall be brought unless the agreement shall be in writing would bar actions validly brought before the amendment but not decided at the time it came into force. Therefore if the appellant\u2019s counsel be right in applying the 13th section to an agreement made before, where the action is brought after, the statute, he would also be right in extending it to actions brought before the statute on a parol agree- ment for commission, where the action was still pending at the time of the enactment, that is to say to pending cases. I cannot think that such was the intention of the legislature.\nThis is my reading of the statute if its construction be still open to us. My brother Anglin has shewn that it is still open, his quotation of the words of Lord Nottingham in Ash v. Abdy[91], being especially illuminating. It is with considerable satisfaction, therefore, that I concur in my learned brother\u2019s judgment.\nI also agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Arnoldi & Grierson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lawrence & Dunbar.\n[1] 48 Ont.

Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLouis Boyer K.C. and Alphonse D\u00e9cary K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Oscar Dorais K.C. for the respondent. Idington J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of my brother Mignault and hence that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with Mignault J.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing this appeal. The mere taking of a transfer of property subject to a hypothec does not under the civil law of Quebec per se entail any personal obligation on the part of the transferee to pay the debt for which the hypothec is security. There is no implication that the transferee undertakes to indemnify the vendor against his personal liability such as the English equity system imports in the case of a purchaser subject to a mortgage. In Quebec the assumption of personal liability by the transferee must be clear and unequivocal in order that it may be judicially enforced. Ordinarily the words \"\u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que\" do not import it, but are regarded as merely intended to preclude any claim in warranty by the transferee against the transferor should the holder of the hypothec subsequently enforce it against the property. I do not find in the fact that these words are unnecessarily repeated in the provision for taking over the property in satisfaction in the event of default contained in the instrument executed to evidence the loan made by Des\u00e8ve to Lecavalier and Chass\u00e9 (which had already referred to the existing hypothec of $15,000 as a charge on the land) or in their repetition in the instrument executed by the curator of Lecavalier's estate in compliance with Des\u00e8ve's demand for a transfer \"\u00e0 titre de dation en paiement\" sufficiently clear and explicit evidence of an intention that Des\u00e8ve should on taking over the property in satisfaction of his claim assume personal liability for the debt as security for which the $15,000 hypothec was held. The phrase \"\u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que\" is at best equivocal. My brother Mignault, whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading, has discussed at some length the authorities bearing on its purview and effect. For the reasons I have indicated I agree in his conclusion that assumption of personal liability by the respondent has not been satisfactorily made out and that the appeal therefore fails.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Je suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Mignault.\nLes parties \u00e0 la dation en paiement et au pr\u00eat originaire pouvaient certainement stipuler que l'acqu\u00e9reur ne serait pas tenu personnellement au paiement de l'hypoth\u00e8que ant\u00e9rieure. Les contrats disent bien que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sera prise \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que, c'est-\u00e0-dire, comme dit l'article 2016 du code civil, \u00e0 la charge d'un droit r\u00e9el qui l'affectait. Et alors l'acqu\u00e9reur, dans ces conditions, pouvait \u00eatre tenu de d\u00e9guerpir si le cr\u00e9ancier de la dette hypoth\u00e9caire voulait proc\u00e9der contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais le tiers d\u00e9tenteur ne pouvait \u00eatre tenu de payer la dette que s'il s'y \u00e9tait personnellement oblig\u00e9.\nDans le cas actuel, l'obligation de payer que l'on rencontre d'ordinaire dans les actes notari\u00e9s (Marchand, Formulaire du notariat, vol. 2, p. 553; Lainey, Formulaire d'actes usuels, p. 552) ne s'y trouve pas. Le plus qu'on puisse dire, c'est qu'il y a doute; et alors le contrat doit s'interpr\u00e9ter en faveur de celui qui a contract\u00e9 l'obligation (art. 1019 C.C.).\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Mignault J.\u2014Cette cause\u2014o\u00f9 la seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est la port\u00e9e qu'il convient de donner \u00e0 une clause par laquelle l'intim\u00e9e se faisait transporter, en dation de paiement, un immeuble, qui lui \u00e9tait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 pour une somme de $6,200.00, \u00e0 la charge d'une premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 en faveur de l'appelant\u2014a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des d\u00e9bats qui ont dur\u00e9 une journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re. Dans cette discussion sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de ces cinq mots \"\u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que\", les avocats des parties ont fait preuve de beaucoup de talent et nous ont cit\u00e9 plusieurs vieux auteurs, en commen\u00e7ant par Loiseau, Ferri\u00e8re et Duplessis et en finissant par Pothier. De plus, alors que dans la cause que nous avons \u00e0 juger quatre juges se sont prononc\u00e9s en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 et deux juges contre lui, on nous a produit trois jugements rendus respectivement par les honorables juges Demers, Duclos et Martineau, o\u00f9 il s'agissait de la m\u00eame clause ou d'une clause identique, et chacun de ces jugements est favorable aux pr\u00e9tentions \u00e9mises par l'appelant. L'intim\u00e9 est partie dans les causes d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par les juges Duclos et Martineau et on nous informe qu'il a appel\u00e9 des jugements rendus contre lui. Des montants consid\u00e9rables sont en jeu et notre d\u00e9cision r\u00e8glera le sort non-seulement de la pr\u00e9sente cause, mais aussi des deux autres causes que je viens de mentionner. Pour cette raison, cette question d'interpr\u00e9tation a une importance capitale pour les parties et je n'ai voulu la r\u00e9soudre qu'apr\u00e8s l'avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9e \u00e0 fond.\nL'expos\u00e9 des faits essentiels peut se faire bri\u00e8vement. Par acte du 16 avril, 1914, pass\u00e9 devant Chauret, notaire, l'appelant avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 $15,000.00 \u00e0 Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9 sur premi\u00e8re hyopth\u00e8que portant sur l'immeuble connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme partie de la subdivision 3 de la subdivision 19 du lot 12 du cadastre du village incorpor\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te St-Louis, maintenant partie de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nLe 4 mai 1914, devant Rivest, notaire, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00eata $6,200.00 \u00e0 Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9, avec deuxi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8que sur le m\u00eame immeuble. L'acte stipulait que pour plus de garantie, et afin d'\u00e9viter les frais et d\u00e9lais d'une vente par le sh\u00e9rif, au cas o\u00f9 les emprunteurs feraient d\u00e9faut de rembourser la somme pr\u00eat\u00e9e, ou de payer les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme ou sur la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que, ou les taxes ou primes d'assurances, l'intim\u00e9 aurait droit de garder la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e et en deviendrait propri\u00e9taire absolu \u00e0 titre de dation en paiement du montant \u00e0 lui d\u00fb en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et accessoires, \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9e seulement (l'hypoth\u00e8que de l'appelant).\nL'intim\u00e9, qui avait stipul\u00e9 toutes les garanties possibles pour prot\u00e9ger sa cr\u00e9ance, ne s'est probablement pas dout\u00e9 que cette clause de dation en paiement, exig\u00e9e comme garantie additionnelle, renfermait le germe d'un gros proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame de plusieurs proc\u00e8s, comme je viens de le dire. Toujours est-il que Chass\u00e9 ayant transport\u00e9 ses droits \u00e0 Lecavalier, et ce dernier ayant fait cession de ses biens \u00e0 la demande de ses cr\u00e9anciers, l'intim\u00e9 a exig\u00e9 la passation en sa faveur d'un acte de dation en paiement.\nCet acte fut re\u00e7u devant Rivest, notaire, le 28 mai 1915, et le curateur de Lecavalier, St. Amour, c\u00e9da \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, avec l'autorisation judiciaire, et \u00e0 titre de dation en paiement, l'immeuble en question avec un autre immeuble sur lequel l'intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9galement une seconde hypoth\u00e8que. Il y fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la cession des deux immeubles \u00e9tait faite en consid\u00e9ration de la somme de $1,800.00 et en paiement complet des cr\u00e9ances hypoth\u00e9caires de l'intim\u00e9, et de plus \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 affectant remplacement en premier lieu d\u00e9crit (l'hypoth\u00e8que de l'appelant) et de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $25,000.00 affectant l'emplacement en second heu d\u00e9crit\n(une hypoth\u00e8que en faveur d'une Dame Alice Daoust, \u00e9pouse d'un nomm\u00e9 Viau).\nPlus tard, le 3 d\u00e9cembre, 1915, devant Labr\u00e8che, notaire, l'intim\u00e9 vendit l'immeuble pr\u00e9sentement en question \u00e0 Mr J. A. H. H\u00e9bert. Il fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte que la vente \u00e9tait faite pour le prix de $12,500.00 pay\u00e9s comptant par bonnes et valables consid\u00e9rations, et en plus\n\u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 grevant le dit immeuble en faveur de M. Joseph Legault.\nEn 1917, l'appelant poursuivit H\u00e9bert personnellement en recouvrement de sa cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire, et obtint, apr\u00e8s contestation, un jugement contre lui de l'honorable juge Demers. Il fit alors \u00e9maner un bref d'ex\u00e9cution contre H\u00e9bert, et ce bref ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 sur une ex\u00e9cution ant\u00e9rieure, l'immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 fut vendu par le sh\u00e9rif. Le prix de vente n'ayant pas suffi pour payer la cr\u00e9ance de l'appelant, celui-ci r\u00e9clame maintenant la diff\u00e9rence, soit $5,711.60 de l'intim\u00e9, all\u00e9guant que l'intim\u00e9 s'est rendu personnellement responsable du paiement de sa cr\u00e9ance.\nEn cour sup\u00e9rieure, l'honorable juge Greenshields donna raison \u00e0 l'appelant, mais ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel, l'honorable juge Pelletier diff\u00e9rant. De l\u00e0 le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nIl est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de dire que le d\u00e9biteur hypoth\u00e9caire demeurant propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 peut en disposer librement. S'il le vend, la vente n'affecte pas les droits du cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, qui peut poursuivre l'acqu\u00e9reur pour le forcer \u00e0 d\u00e9laisser l'immeuble, si mieux il n'aime payer la cr\u00e9ance du demandeur. Cette vente non plus n'engage la responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle de l'acqu\u00e9reur envers le cr\u00e9ancier que si l'acqu\u00e9reur s'est oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire. Il peut s'y obliger par une convention avec le vendeur sans l'intervention du cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire. Il y a alors d\u00e9l\u00e9gation ou indication de paiement, d\u00e9l\u00e9gation dite imparfaite parce qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ancier. Cependant, tant que cette d\u00e9l\u00e9gation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e par le vendeur, le cr\u00e9ancier peut l'accepter, ce qui cr\u00e9era un lien de droit entre lui et l'acqu\u00e9reur, et il est de jurisprudence que le seul fait de poursuivre l'acqu\u00e9reur en vertu de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement en comporte acceptation suffisante.\nReste \u00e0 savoir s'il y a eu d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement dans l'esp\u00e8ce, car si cette d\u00e9l\u00e9gation existe, l'appelant l'a accept\u00e9e par son action contre l'intim\u00e9.\nJ'ai cit\u00e9 la clause dont il s'agit et qui se trouve d'abord dans l'acte de pr\u00eat du 4 mai 1914, et ensuite dans l'acte de dation en paiement du 28 mai 1915. L'intim\u00e9, dans le premier acte, a stipul\u00e9, en cas de d\u00e9faut de paiement, le droit de garder l'immeuble, dont il deviendrait propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 titre de dation en paiement, et ce \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 de l'appelant seulement. Et, dans le deuxi\u00e8me acte, cet immeuble et un autre immeuble lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s en consid\u00e9ration de $1,800.00 et de plus \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 de l'appelant et de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $25,000.00 de Mme Viau.\nLes honorables juges qui formaient la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que par cette clause l'intim\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que seulement et n'a pas contract\u00e9 une obligation personnelle de payer la dette dont cette hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait l'accessoire. Or nul doute que l'obligation personnelle de payer la dette est essentielle, car sans elle il n'y a pas de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement que le cr\u00e9ancier puisse accepter. Et j'ajouterai qu'il faut que l'existence de cette obligation personnelle ne soit pas douteuse, car on n'est jamais pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 vouloir s'obliger; en d'autres termes, celui qui pr\u00e9tend qu'on s'est oblig\u00e9 envers lui est oblig\u00e9 d'en apporter la preuve, et cette preuve doit pleinement satisfaire la conscience du juge. Il doit en \u00eatre ainsi surtout dans une cause comme celle-ci o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 est un parfait \u00e9tranger pour l'appelant et o\u00f9 ce dernier, qui n'a pas exig\u00e9 dans son contrat de pr\u00eat que les acqu\u00e9reurs subs\u00e9quents de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s'obligeassent personnellement envers lui, veut profiter maintenant d'une clause ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans un deuxi\u00e8me contrat de pr\u00eat et dans un contrat de dation en paiement auxquels il n'\u00e9tait pas partie pour se faire donner un nouveau d\u00e9biteur. Assur\u00e9ment l'appelant certat de lucro capiendo, et dans le doute la clause qu'il invoque doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e contre lui.\nDonc l'intim\u00e9 a-t-il contract\u00e9 une obligation personnelle de payer la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire de l'appelant en achetant \u00e0 la charge de son hypoth\u00e8que?\nJ'ai lu bien attentivement l'opinion de l'honorable juge Martineau dans la cause de Pilon v. Des\u00e8ve, un des jugements dont l'appelant nous a fourni copie. On y cite de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s tir\u00e9es de l'ancien droit, savoir, l'article 102 de la Coutume de Paris, l'article 102 de la Coutume de Meaux, l'article 409 de la Coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans, Ferri\u00e8re, Grande Coutume, t\u00f4me 2, p. 67, Bacquet, Droit de Justice, ch. 21, no. 195, Henrys, t\u00f4me 2, livre 3, question 51, DeLalande sur l'article 409 de la Coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans, pp. 243 et suiv., et Duplessis, p. 607. Dans toutes ces autorit\u00e9s il est question de rentes fonci\u00e8res ou constitu\u00e9es assur\u00e9es par hypoth\u00e8que sur un immeuble, et on d\u00e9niait le droit de d\u00e9guerpissement \u00e0 celui qui, en achetant un immeuble, s'\u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de la rente, et \u00e0 qui on demandait le paiement des arr\u00e9rages \u00e9chus de son temps. A cela je puis ajouter une autorit\u00e9 plus moderne, bien qu'elle ne soit pas de fra\u00eeche date, o\u00f9 on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que lorsqu'il est exprim\u00e9 dans un acte de vente qu'on vend un immeuble avec ses droits et charges, l'acqu\u00e9reur est oblig\u00e9 personnellement \u00e0 payer les rentes auxquelles cet immeuble est hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9. Li\u00e8ge, 1er juin 1814, Dalloz, Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques, n\u00b0 1855, 3\u00b0.\nToutes ces autorit\u00e9s n'envisagent que la question des rentes, et on con\u00e7oit que lorsqu'on vend un immeuble tenu au paiement de prestations p\u00e9riodiques, comme les arr\u00e9rages de rentes, les taxes, les rentes seigneuriales, celui qui ach\u00e8te \u00e0 la charge de la rente soit oblig\u00e9 personnellement \u00e0 payer les arr\u00e9rages \u00e9chus de son temps. Mais l'appelant ne nous a cit\u00e9 aucune autorit\u00e9 o\u00f9 cette doctrine ait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 une cr\u00e9ance due par le vendeur et garantie par une hypoth\u00e8que sur l'immeuble vendu, et je n'en ai trouv\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame aucune, sauf le passage de Loiseau que je citerai tout \u00e0 l'heure et qui n'est pas favorable aux pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant.\nD'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui r\u00e9gissent la mati\u00e8re, il n'est nullement n\u00e9cessaire, pour prot\u00e9ger le cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, de stipuler dans la vente de l'immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 que cette vente est faite \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que, car le cr\u00e9ancier a le droit de suivre l'immeuble en quelques mains qu'il passe et de le faire vendre en justice et de se faire payer, suivant le rang de sa cr\u00e9ance, sur les deniers provenant de cette vente (art. 2056 C.C.). Il s'ensuit que la vente se fait toujours \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que. Quelle est alors Futilit\u00e9 de la clause expresse que la vente est faite \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que? Cette utilit\u00e9 ne peut exister que pour le vendeur, soit pour que l'acheteur paie la dette hypoth\u00e9caire et lib\u00e8re ainsi le vendeur de tout recours personnel contre lui pour cette dette, soit pour emp\u00eacher que l'acheteur ne le recherche en garantie \u00e0 raison de l'\u00e9viction qu'il souffre de la part du cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire.\nDans le premier cas, le vendeur impose une obligation que je pourrais appeler active \u00e0 l'acheteur, il l'astreint \u00e0 payer la dette hypoth\u00e9caire, et il faut que la clause par laquelle cette obligation est stipul\u00e9e ne soit pas \u00e9quivoque et ne laisse aucun doute sur l'intention du vendeur d'imposer et de l'acheteur d'accepter cette obligation.\nDans le second cas l'obligation de l'acheteur est passive. Il devra subir l'hypoth\u00e8que; et s'il est \u00e9vinc\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de cette hypoth\u00e8que, il n'a pas de recours en garantie contre son vendeur.\nMais on dira: pour exclure la garantie il suffit de d\u00e9clarer la charge dans l'acte de vente (art. 1508 C.C.). Or dans l'acte de pr\u00eat de Des\u00e8ve \u00e0 Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9 on a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 express\u00e9ment l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que de l'appelant et dans une autre clause on dit que la vente est faite \u00e0 la charge de cette hypoth\u00e8que. Le but de cette derni\u00e8re clause n'a donc pu \u00eatre d'emp\u00eacher le recours en garantie, car la d\u00e9claration ou d\u00e9nonciation de l'hypoth\u00e8que suffisait \u00e0 cette fin. La seule utilit\u00e9 de la clause par cons\u00e9quent est d'imposer \u00e0 Des\u00e8ve l'obligation de payer l'hypoth\u00e8que de l'appelant \u00e0 l'acquit de Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9.\nCet argument aurait beaucoup de force si les actes notari\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient d'ordinaire remplis de clauses inutiles et de r\u00e9p\u00e9titions, et l'acte en question n'est pas exempt de ce reproche, comme la clause de remboursement en bonnes esp\u00e8ces de monnaies ayant cours le fait voir. D'ailleurs la clause en question est \u00e9quivoque et peut tr\u00e8s bien signifier que l'intim\u00e9 prendra l'immeuble avec la charge de la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que qui le gr\u00e8ve, sans qu'il puisse demander \u00e0 Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9 de l'en indemniser. De plus, on dit dans l'acte: \u00e0 la charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9e, et plus loin on mentionne cette hypoth\u00e8que, de sorte que les deux clauses se compl\u00e8tent et ne font r\u00e9ellement qu'une seule stipulation. On aurait pu \u00e9viter toute \u00e9quivoque en disant: \u00e0 la charge de payer l'hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9e, et alors il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 certain que Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9 voulaient faire une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement, et non pas seulement se prot\u00e9ger contre un recours \u00e9ventuel en garantie de la part de Des\u00e8ve. C'est une clause de ce genre que vise Loiseau, dans son trait\u00e9 du D\u00e9guerpissement, (\u00e9dition de 1701), livre III, ch. VIII, p. 73, o\u00f9 il dit:\nAussi la discussion n'a lieu en faveur du tiers d\u00e9tenteur, qui a acquis l'h\u00e9ritage \u00e0 la charge expresse de payer la rente ou la dette \u00e0 une fois payer; car celui-l\u00e0 est tenu personnellement envers le cr\u00e9ancier, et m\u00eame sans cession d'actions du vendeur, comme nous le pratiquons en France, ainsi qu'il sera trait\u00e9 au livre suivant: aussi ne serait-il pas raisonnable qu'il p\u00fbt demander que celui qui a recours contre lui f\u00fbt discut\u00e9 auparavant lui. Autre chose serait en celui qui lors de l'achat aurait bien eu connaissance de la rente, mais ne serait nullement charg\u00e9 de la payer; et m\u00eame de celui qui aurait acquis l'h\u00e9ritage \u00e0 la charge, non de la rente, mais seulement de l'hypoth\u00e8que pour raison de la rente; car celui-l\u00e0 n'en est point tenu personnellement, ni envers le cr\u00e9ancier, ni envers le d\u00e9biteur, pour l'en acquitter, mais ce n'est qu'un avertissement et certioration de l'hypoth\u00e8que qui \u00e9tait sur l'h\u00e9ritage pour s'exempter du stellionat; de mani\u00e8re qu'avant que s'adresser \u00e0 lui, il faut discuter le d\u00e9biteur qui lui a vendu l'h\u00e9ritage.\nLes honorables juges de la cour d'appel interpr\u00e8tent le mot \"hypoth\u00e8que\" comme signifiant le droit accessoire que constitue l'hypoth\u00e8que, ce qui la distingue de la cr\u00e9ance dont elle n'est que la garantie. Cet argument aurait une plus grande force \u00e0 mes yeux si, dans le contrat de pr\u00eat, les parties n'avaient pas employ\u00e9 le mot \"hypoth\u00e8que\" pour d\u00e9signer la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire. Ainsi l'acte impose aux emprunteurs l'obligation de produire au pr\u00eateur les re\u00e7us d\u00e9montrant le paiement des versements de capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats \"sur les hypoth\u00e8ques ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9es,\" et s'ils font d\u00e9faut de payer \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance les versements \"sur les hypoth\u00e8ques ant\u00e9rieures affectant la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" et si le pr\u00eateur paie lui-m\u00eame \"les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les hypoth\u00e8ques ant\u00e9rieures,\" il peut en exiger le remboursement imm\u00e9diat avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de dix pour cent. Et il y a d'autres expressions du m\u00eame genre qui affaiblissent l'argument qui a pr\u00e9valu devant la cour d'appel. D'ailleurs je ne crois pas cet argument essentiel, et m\u00eame si la clause en question veut dire que l'intim\u00e9 prend l'immeuble \u00e0 la charge de la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire de l'appelant, il ne s'ensuit pas qu'il soit oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 payer cette cr\u00e9ance. Il a consenti \u00e0 subir l'\u00e9viction qui en r\u00e9sulterait, voil\u00e0 tout, et il me r\u00e9pugnerait de donner \u00e0 une clause aussi \u00e9quivoque une port\u00e9e qui d\u00e9passe, j'en suis convaincu, toutes les pr\u00e9visions des parties.\nDe part et d'autre on invoque l'article 2065 du code civil qui dit:\nLe tiers d\u00e9tenteur assign\u00e9 sur action hypoth\u00e9caire et qui n'est ni charg\u00e9 de l'hypoth\u00e8que, ni tenu personnellement au paiement de la dette, peut opposer, s'il y a lieu, outre les moyens qui peuvent \u00e9teindre l'hypoth\u00e8que, les exceptions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les cinq paragraphes qui suivent.\nMais ce texte est sans port\u00e9e sur la responsabilit\u00e9 du tiers d\u00e9tenteur qui s'est charg\u00e9 de l'hypoth\u00e8que ou qui est tenu personnellement au paiement de la dette. Il envisage le cas de l'assignation du tiers d\u00e9tenteur sur action hypoth\u00e9caire, partant sur une action qui lui donne la facult\u00e9 de d\u00e9laisser pour ne pas payer, et tout ce que l'article refuse \u00e0 ce tiers d\u00e9tenteur ce sont les cinq exceptions mentionn\u00e9es par le code, ainsi que la d\u00e9fense bas\u00e9e sur des moyens qui peuvent \u00e9teindre l'hypoth\u00e8que. Il n'en sera pas moins condamn\u00e9 hypoth\u00e9cairement seulement, suivant les conclusions de l'action prise contre lui. La question de savoir s'il aurait pu \u00eatre poursuivi personnellement reste ouverte, et pour admettre l'affirmative il faudrait trouver dans l'acte d'acquisition une obligation personnelle de l'acqu\u00e9reur de payer la dette hypoth\u00e9caire, ce que je ne puis trouver dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nJe suis donc d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: D\u00e9cary & D\u00e9cary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Dorais & Dorais.\n[1] Q.R. 29 K.B. 375.\n"}

(1906), c. 69, ss. 30 and 53.\nThe respondent, having a contract from the French Republic to construct twelve vessels at Fort William for use during the late war, agreed, by a supplementary contract, when the vessels were 95% completed, to install on each of the ships a wireless apparatus which the respondent claims to be an infringement of its patent. These apparatus were bought by the French Republic in New York and shipped to itself at Fort William. The respondent did nothing else than allow its men, under the direction of a naval officer of the French Republic, to install these apparatus on the vessels.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that the respondent did not \"construct or put in practice\" the invention of the appellant within the meaning of section 30 of the \"Patent Act,\"\nPer Mignault J.\u2014The terms of section 53 of the \"Patent Act,\" cover not only the case of a foreign ship visiting a Canadian port, but also the case of a foreign ship built in Canada.

R. 311) affirmed, Anglin J. dissenting, and Duff J. taking no part in the judgment owing to absence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an action for damages by infringement of the plaintiff's patent. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and Colville Sinclair for the appellant.\nArnold Wainwright K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant claims that because respondent having a contract from the French Republic during the late war to construct a dozen vessels at Fort William for use in that war, by a supplementary contract thereto, agreed to provide in each of said structures a space so framed and fitted as to receive a device or machine serviceable for wireless telegraphy, and permitted, and possibly assisted in removing them from the warehouse in which each of such devices or machinery was deposited, to each of the said vessels and placing it therein, there was such a breach of the \"Patent Act\" under and by virtue of which the assignors of the appellant had obtained a patent for such device that appellant is entitled to recover damages herein.\nThe \"Patent Act,\" by section 30, provides as follows:\u2014\n30. Every person who, without the consent in writing of the patentee makes, constructs or puts in practice any invention for which a patent has been obtained under this Act or any previous Act, or who procures such invention from any person not authorized by the patentee or his legal representatives to make or use it, and who uses it, shall be liable to the patentee or his representatives in an action for damages for so doing, and the judgment shall be enforced, and the damages and costs that are adjudged shall be recoverable, in like manner as in other cases in the court in which the action is brought. The respondent according to the evidence adduced herein certainly did not \"make or construct\" the devices or machines in question herein for they had been bought in New York, already made, and shipped by the French Republic to Fort William and all the respondent had to do with them was suffering its men under the direction of an officer of the French Republic to place them as he directed in the compartment built in each vessel, designed to receive some unspecified sort of wireless device.\nThe vessels were each so far finished that only five per cent of the work to be done, under the original contract, remained to be executed when this placing of each of the said devices or machines took place.\nIt is argued that inasmuch as the title to the property in and of the vessels remained in the respondent, therefore the title in and to each of these devices in question supplied by the French Republic became vested in the respondent.\nI cannot accept such a proposition as tenable under all the facts and circumstances in evidence.\nA perusal of the entire evidence here leaves me rather unenlightened as to the exact nature of the device or machine, but I infer that it was something portable and a piece of property belonging to the French Republic independently of the property in the vessel.\nThe respondent's relation to the article in question which I have designated a \"device or machine\" was analogous to that of the custom's agent in question in the case of Nobel's Explosives Co. v. Jones. Scott & Co.[2], whom the Court of Appeal refused to hold liable for damages. I am, therefore, not able to hold that the respondent in any way \"put in practice\" the invention in question.\nIt is not necessary, therefore, for me to pass any opinion upon the effect of section 53 of the \"Patent Act.\"\nAs I suspected during the argument the cases cited in support of appellant's contentions rest for the most part upon the right to an injunction which it is frankly admitted could not now be granted.\nNone of those cases cited maintain any such pretentions as set up herein.\nThey might support a claim to an injunction had that been applied for during the course of construction.\nBut this case is reduced, notwithstanding what is set up in the affidavit upon which leave to appeal was granted herein, to a bare right of claim for damages arising from an alleged tort.\nAnd to found that I find no evidence and hence I conclude this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. took no part in the judgment owing to absence.\nAngltn J. (dissenting).\u2014The novelty and utility of the plaintiff's patent, No. 74799, was prima facie established, if not by its production. (Electric Fire Proofing Co. v. Electric Fire Proofing Co. of Canada[3]; Fisher & Smart on Patents, p. 215; Fletcher Moulton on Letters Patent, p. 188, note (c), by the evidence of the witnesses Cann and Morse. The record contains nothing that rebuts the prim\u00e2 facie case thus made in this respect. Infringement is, I think, sufficiently established, as to the apparatus installed on the SS. Navarrine by the uncontradicted testimony of the witness Cann. By the 4th paragraph of its statement of defence the defendant admitted having installed wireless apparatus on 12 small war vessels being constructed by it for the French navy at Fort William, Ontario. The evidence sufficiently shews that the \"Navarrine\" was one of these vessels and there is no suggestion anywhere in the record that the apparatus installed on her differed in any respect from that placed on the other eleven ships. Indeed, Mr. Canfield, the defendant's superintendent, expressly stated that all the ships had the same installation although he admitted on cross-examination that he had not made personal investigation to ascertain that fact. He added that the vessels were all delivered by the defendant at Fort William. Mr. Atwood, assistant to the president of the defendant company, never heard of any difference in the apparatus installed on the several vessels and Mr. Lloyd McCoy, the General Master Mechanic who looked after the installation for the defendant, called as a witness on its behalf, is not asked whether there was any such difference. The apparatus was all obtained by the French Government from Emil J. Simon at New York and shipped to its representative at Fort William. I think it prim\u00e2 facie appears therefore that the apparatus on the twelve vessels was identical.\nThe only substantial defences are (a) that, if there were such user by the defendant of the apparatus purchased from Simon as would otherwise be an infringement of the plaintiffs' patent, it was upon foreign vessels and therefore fell within the protection of s. 53 of the \"Patent Act,\" R.S.C., c. 69; (b) that there was in fact no such use made of the apparatus by the defendant as would constitute a violation of the exclusive right of the plaintiffs under s. 21 of the \"Patent Act;\"\n(c) that the plaintiffs are at most entitled to nominal damages, any infringement by the defendant having been innocent.\n(a) Sec. 53 of the \"Patent Act\" was meant to cover the case of a foreign ship visiting a Canadian port and having on board some article the use of which in Canada would amount to an infringement of a Canadian patent, such as was the subject of litigation in Caldwell v. Vanvlissengen[4]. The section was not meant to, and does not, cover the installation in Canada on a visiting foreign ship, and a fortiori not on a ship built here for foreign owners, of a device the use of which is otherwise in violation of the exclusive right conferred by s. 21. The case of Vavasseur v. Krupp[5], cited by the learned Assistant Judge of the Exchequer Court is clearly distinguishable. The French Republic is not a party to this action and no relief is sought against it nor is interference with its property asked. Moreover, under the terms of the agreement between the defendant company and the French Government the property in the vessels had not passed to the latter but was still vested in the former when it did the work of installing the Simon apparatus. They were therefore not foreign ships at that time.\n(b) There was, in my opinion, user by the defendant of the infringing apparatus in violation of the plaintiffs' rights under s. 21. The installation was, and was intended as, a step towards the effective use of it and, in the absence of any evidence warranting such an inference, it cannot be assumed that there was to be no user of the wireless equipment until after the vessels should have left Canadian territorial waters. If such an intention would, if proven, have afforded a defence, the burden of establishing it satisfactorily was on the defendant. The French Government could not authorize the use in Canada of such apparatus. While it is not itself subject to answer in the courts of Canada for its acts or those of its agents, its Canadian contractors enjoy no such immunity. They are properly sued (Denley v. Blore[6], cited in Frost on Patents, vol. 1, p. 395 and Edmonds on Patents, p. 364) and are answerable for whatever damages were occasioned to the plaintiffs by the infringement of their rights which they aided, or helped to bring about. The principle of such cases as British Motor Syndicate v. Taylor & Son[7], and Upmann v. Elkan[8], applies.\n(c) Innocence of intention is immaterial in considering the question of infringement; Stead v. Anderson[9]. In the absence of a Canadian statutory provision corresponding to s. 33 of the \"Patents and Designs Act,\" 1907, (Imp.) 7 Ed. VII., c. 29, the fact that the defendant was an innocent infringer does not entitle it to relief from liability for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs\u2014(Nobels Explosive Co. v. Jones, Scott &. Co.[10]; Boyd v. Tootal Co.[11]\u2014the measure of which is the loss actually suffered by them as a direct and natural consequence of its acts, Boyd v. Tootal Co.11. This is not the case of an innocent defendant submitting and offering restitution as in Nunn v. D'Albuquerque[12]. The defendant here contests the plaintiffs' right. Proctor v. Bayley[13]. The appeal should be allowed and judgment entered declaring that there has been an infringement by the defendant company of the plaintiff's patent No. 74799 and referring this action to the Registrar of the Exchequer Court to inquire into and ascertain the amount of the plaintiffs' damages. The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs both of the action and of the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The mere fact that the respondent furnished certain labour and material in connection with the installation of wireless apparatus on mine sweepers which it was building for the French Government would not render it liable in damages. These wireless apparatus never were the property of the respondent, but belonged to the French authorities, had been bought by the latter in New York and had been shipped in to Canada at Fort William, where the ships were being built. There is no evidence that these apparatus were used or put in practice by the respondent before they delivered those ships. Terrell, 5th ed. p. 312. As far as the respondent company is concerned, there was no infringement of the patent claimed by the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014On one ground I think this appeal should be dismissed, that furnished by sec. 53 of the \"Patent Act\" (R.S.C., ch. 69) which says:\u2014\nNo patent shall extend to prevent the use of any invention in any foreign ship or vessel, if such invention is not so used for the manufacture of any goods to be vended within or exported from Canada.\nThis section, which has been in our statutes since at least 1872 (35 Vict., ch. 26, sect. 47), was apparently suggested by a provision of the English Act, now section 48 of 7 Edward VII., ch. 29, but is in somewhat wider terms. It is contended that it was meant to cover the case, not of a foreign ship built in Canada, for a foreign ship can undoubtedly be built here, but of a foreign ship visiting a Canadian port and having on board an article patented in Canada, and the use of which here would amount to an infringement of a Canadian patent. This, no doubt, may be the usual case, but there is no such limitation in section 53, which, in general terms, permits the use of any invention in any foreign ship or vessel, the only restriction being that the invention is not to be used for the manufacture of any goods to be vended within or exported from Canada.\nIt is further argued that the English Act was amended after the decision of Vice Chancellor Turner in Caldwell v. Vanvlissengen[14], which was the case of a visiting ship. The appellant also refers us to the Hansard Debates when the English Act was amended, as shewing the intention of Parliament in adopting this amendment. I am quite clear that we cannot look at these debates (Beal, Cardinal rules of Legal Interpretation, 2nd. ed., p. 288). And even granting that this amendment was made in view of the decision in Caldwell v. Vanvlissengen14, this should not, in my opinion, make us hesitate to give effect to the clear and unambiguous language of our statute.\nThe only \"use\" here relied on was the installation by the respondent of the wireless device. If the vessels in question were foreign vessels, no patent could extend to prevent the use of any invention therein, and when these vessels were on the way to the sea, it does not seem to me that the use by the foreign crew of this device could have been enjoined. The learned trial judge found that these vessels were foreign vessels. It is true that the respondent had a lien thereon, which lien went so far as to stipulate that property in the ships would not pass to the French Government until the price was fully paid, and it had been paid when the Navarine was inspected in the Montreal harbour. I think however that this clause was inserted in the contract for the protection of the respondent, and of course could have been waived by it. The vessels were constructed for the French Government as a part of its navy. The wireless apparatus was purchased by that Government in New York and was consigned to it at Fort William. All the respondent did was to instal it, being paid merely the actual cost of installation. Under these circumstances, I do not think the respondent should be treated as an infringer of the appellant's patent.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant:\nGreenshields, Greenshields, Langeudoc & Parkins.\nSolicitors for the respondent:\nDavidson, Wainwright, Alexander & Elder.\n[1] 19 Ex.

C. The appellant was convicted for having, under promise of marriage, seduced and had illicit connection with an unmarried female of previously chaste character under the age of 21 years. The girl complainant, at the trial, admitted that she had had illicit connection with the appellant on one previous occasion under mutual promise of marriage.\nHeld, Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the fact of the previous seduction did not preclude the jury from finding the complainant to be \"of previously chaste character\" within the meaning of article 212 Cr. C., the question whether or not the facts and surrounding circumstances could justify such a conclusion being one to be determined by the jury alone.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 313; [1920] 2 W.W.R. 251) affirmed, Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], dismissing, on equal division of the court, the appeal by the appellant from the refusal of Simmons J., at the trial with a jury, to reserve a case for the opinion of the Appellate Division. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. O'Connor K.C. for the appellant.\nW. L. Scott for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which, on an equal division of opinion, refused to quash a conviction against the appellant prisoner under section 212 of the Criminal Code for having, under promise of marriage, seduced and had illicit connection on or about the 27th day of March, 1919, with one Mary Kovack, an unmarried female under the age of 21 years.\nTwo questions only were raised and argued at bar: one, whether the evidence of Mary Kovack, the female in question, was corroborated or not; and the other, whether she was at the time of the alleged offence of previously chaste character.\nAfter hearing Mr. O'Connor, counsel for the appellant, on the question of corroboration, we were unanimously of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence of corroboration, and Mr. Scott was not called on to reply on that point.\nThe second question raised a much more delicate and difficult point: Was the jury justified in not finding the complainant Mary Kovack, at the time of the illicit connection of the 27th March between her and the prisoner, a girl of previously unchaste character?\nThe material facts necessary to reach a conclusion on that point are fully set in the learned judge's reasons given in the Appellate Division[2]. The parties were, at the time of the commission of the offence on the 27th March, and for some length of time before that, engaged to be married to each other. They were both of them foreigners whose parents had emigrated to Canada. At a date about the latter end of December previously or the beginning of January, and at a time when the marriage engagement existed, there had been on one occasion illicit connection between the prisoner and Mary Kovack, but at the time this prosecution commenced, more than twelve months having elapsed, that offence was barred by the statutory limitation of time.\nThe prosecution, therefore, was necessarily confined to the second offence of the 27th March, 1919, a date when the engagement for marriage still continued, and the question immediately arose whether on the admission by the complainant of the first offence having taken place in the latter end of December or the beginning of January previously she could be found by the jury to have been of \"previously chaste character\" on the 27th March when the second offence was committed.\nSome evidence was given in prisoner's behalf by some young men to the effect that the girl complainant was not chaste, but the jury disbelieved that evidence, and the sole question, therefore, remains whether the single lapse of virtue by her with the prisoner on or about the last of December when the parties were under a mutual promise of marriage prevented the jury finding her to be of \"chaste character\" when the offence of March 27th was committed.\nI am not able to accept the argument that such a single fall from grace of a woman, engaged to a man to whose solicitations she yields, either because of a weaker will than his or that combined with affection and a hope of their prospective marriage under his promise, necessarily stamps that woman as one of an unchaste character for all future time. That surely cannot be so. There must come a time when repentance and pureness of living can rehabilitate her as a chaste character within the meaning of the statute.\nWhether or not the facts and surrounding circumstances justify such a conclusion can only be determined by a jury.\nIn this case, the jury had the advantage of seeing the complainant in the witness box and hearing from her all the material facts necessary to enable them to reach a conclusion as to her family relationship, nationality, occupation, conditions and habits of life, marriage engagement with the promise and other material facts, and to determine from her manner, demeanour and evidence when examined and cross-examined, whether she should be believed in whole or in part.\nThe prisoner acting upon his rights remained mute.\nThe result was that they found her not to be of an unchaste character when the offence of 27th March was committed, and, unless I am compelled to find that one previous fall from virtue with the same man to whom on both occasions she was engaged to be married prohibits a jury from finding the same woman afterwards to be of a chaste character within the meaning of the Code, then I must accept the jury's finding. There is no arbitrary lapse of time which I can suggest as necessary before a jury can so find. It must be a case for determination on the facts and circumstances of each case. But assuming the jury to have been properly charged and directed upon the question, I think it would require a very extreme case to justify a court of appeal in setting aside their finding. In substance, then I conclude that if under such circumstances as we have in this case before us, a woman falls to the solicitations of a man to whom she is engaged to be married, she does not, from that single fact, necessarily become such an unchaste character within the meaning of those words in the section of the Code before us as prevents a jury finding her, three months afterwards, not to be unchaste in character. It must be in the very nature of things a fact for the jury, under all the proved facts and being properly directed, to find.\nThere is no statutory limit of time which must elapse in order that she may rehabilitate herself. There is no arbitrary time which the court may set up which must so elapse. I cannot set up my judgment, not having seen or heard the witnesses but simply from reading the record, against the findings under proper direction of the jury who did see and hear them.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The questions raised by the dissenting judgment so far as relevant to the requirement by the statute of corroboration \"in some material particular\" were practically disposed of on the argument.\nFor my part I am of the opinion that in such a case the previous relations of the parties concerned may well form the subject of inquiry and evidence adduced on such a basis become of the most cogent character for the purposes of corroboration.\nWhen that is applied herein there seems to be no reason for doubting the evidence of the girl.\nBut its very application and the mode of thought by which it becomes effective, tend to raise much doubt and difficulty in regard to the other question of the girl having at the time in question been of previously \"chaste character.\" The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stuart with which Mr. Justice Ives concurred, is the basis of any jurisdiction we may have to hear this appeal, and on this latter ground I have some difficulty in finding a clear and decided dissent.\nThe burden of his argument deals with the question of want of corroboration and all incidental thereto. He holds the evidence of what took place in December was inadmissable when presented, as it was, by the Crown.\nThe burden of proof relative to the want of previous chastity by the complainant is expressly cast, by section 210 of the Code, upon the accused.\nIf it was, however, admitted in evidence, then I think he had a right to rely upon it, for what it was worth, as fully as if adduced specifically on his own behalf.\nYet Mr. Justice Stuart contents himself with relying upon the non-admissibility of it relative to the question of corroboration.\nThe question of her previous chastity is presented by objections Nos. 3 and 4 of appellant's counsel at the trial, as follows:\n3. His Lordship should have withdrawn the case from the jury on the ground that there was evidence of previous unchastity.\n4. Assuming in the complainant's favour all the facts that the jury could upon evidence reasonably find in her favour, that is, assuming that the accused in undertaking the burden of proving the unchastity which section 210 casts upon him proved against the complainant the least that the jury could upon the evidence reasonably find against her, were those facts such as to constitute the complainant a girl of previously unchaste character?\nMr. Justice Stuart in his final disposition of this part of the appeal disposes of it as follows :\u2014\nAs to question 3, my view is that, under the existing authorities and precedents especially in the American States whence the law has come, the case should have been withdrawn from the jury and I would answer it in the affirmative. But in view of my much firmer opinion on questions 2 and 5 I do not think it necessary to discuss the matter more fully. This also makes an answer to question 4 unnecessary. These points though submitted as separate really in substance deal with one and the same issue in law. The learned judge appears to answer one hesitatingly and declines to answer the other.\nIs that such a dissent as to entitle us to speak? I have grave doubts as to its being so. We should have a clear and explicit dissent to rest our jurisdiction upon.\nThe majority of the court think it is, and answer accordingly.\nAs I understand the proposed answer it is to be that the question was one for the jury.\nAnd, as the learned trial judge left it to the jury in a way that cannot be complained of, unless that he should have withdrawn the case from the jury entirely, and the majority of this court hold he could not do so, I may say that I much doubt if that is a satisfactory view of the law applicable to the very peculiar facts in question herein.\nMany decisions have been given that tend to uphold such a ruling, but I doubt if any of them have gone quite so far as to justify the so holding in this peculiar case.\nI do not hold any such decided opinion as to warrant my dissent.\nI see no good purpose to be served by enlarging upon the matter.\nIndeed to meet the possibility of such a case as of this class again arising, enabling the offender to set up his own wrong as a means of defence, I submit the law might well be so amended as to prevent the possibility of such a curious means of defence.\nDUFF J (dissenting).\u2014This appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed on the short ground that evidence of previous conduct could only be admissible as tending to shew a reciprocal state of feeling between the two persons concerned making it not only probable that the prisoner would desire to have intercourse with the prosecutrix but a disposition on her part also to yield to him. It could not be admitted for the purpose of shewing merely that the accused was a person who was likely to try to commit the offence with which he was charged; and it could only be admitted as evidence of a reciprocal guilty inclination existing at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed. The result must be either that the prosecution alleging the woman was chaste on the occasion of the occurrence out of which the complaint arises could not be allowed to say that the evidence was admissible or that the evidence having been admitted upon assumptions inconsistent with \"chastity\" on any reasonable interpretation of the words used in the statute, a verdict against the accused involving a finding of chastity could not legally be based upon such evidence. To hold otherwise would be playing fast and loose with justice.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It was intimated on the argument that the court was of opinion that there was sufficient corroboration of the complainant's story to satisfy the statute (sec. 1002 of the Criminal Code). The King v. Shellaker[3], is direct authority for the admissibility of some of this corroborative testimony and The King v. Ball[4], indicates its value and effect.\nOn the other question I am of opinion that from the facts deposed to by the complainant\u2014that she had received many visits from the appellant and that they had spent many hours together between Christmas, 1916, and the 27th of March, 1917, when the act of illicit connection on which the present case rests occurred, and that there had been no illicit intercourse between them in that interval\u2014if believed by them, the jury might not unreasonably draw the inference that the complainant, although seduced by the appellant under promise of marriage about Christmas, 1916, had so far recovered herself on the 27th of March, 1917, as to have become at that time once more a woman \"of previously chaste character\" within the meaning of sec. 212 of the Criminal Code. If, as is practically conceded, that section does not require that the woman should be virgo intacta\u2014if, as I think, the doctrine of rehabilitation is admissible under it, I am unable to accede to the contention that the trial judge should, or could properly, have withdrawn this case from the jury. It was for them to determine what credit should be given to the complainant's evidence, and what inference should be drawn as to the chastity of her character\u2014for that was the issue\u2014on the 27th of March, three months after the one previous act of unchastity which she admitted.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014There was a question raised in this appeal as to whether the evidence of the complainant had been corroborated. It is not necessary on a charge of criminal seduction under promise of marriage that the corroboration should be as to every fact, it is sufficient if it confirms the belief that the prosecutrix is speaking the truth. Art. 1002 Criminal Code; The King v. Daun[5].\nThere are facts disclosed by other witnesses than the complainant which show conclusively that there was criminal intercourse between the complainant and the accused and that this intercourse took place at the time the promise of marriage was made. I have no doubt that there was sufficient corroboration.\nBut the main question is whether the complainant was of a \"previously chaste character,\" as required by section 212 of the Criminal Code.\nThe girl was seduced for the first time, according to her own story, by the appellant on Christmas Day, 1918. But she failed to lay any charge for this offence during the year which followed its commission and there was limitation of time for commencing a prosecution on this offence of Christmas 1918 (Sec 1140 s.s. e-5). Then she made a charge against the appellant that she was seduced a second time by him in March, 1919. During her evidence at the trial she had to admit that she had surrendered her chastity three months before March, 1919.\nHer own statement and admission as to having lost her chastity a few months before the relations of March, 1919, made it imperative on the trial judge to withdraw the case from the jury, because one of the essential ingredients of the crime which is charged did not exist, according to the statement of the complainant herself. She was no more a chaste woman in March, 1919. Of course, the burden of proof of previous unchastity was upon the accused (art. 210 C.C.); but the evidence of the girl herself rendered it unnecessary for the accused to bring any witnesses to prove her unchastity.\nIt is contended, however, that a woman who has been guilty of unchaste conduct may subsequently become chaste in legal contemplation and be seduced a second time. But no evidence was brought to show that this girl regained her chastity in the few months which elapsed between December, 1918, and March, 1919. The jury could not, with the evidence they had before them, declare that this girl was, in March, 1919, of a \"previously chaste character.\" Their verdict should be set aside and the prisoner should have been acquitted.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The only question on which this court found it advisable to hear counsel for the respondent was whether there was evidence on which the jury could find that the complainant; notwithstanding the fact of her seduction by the appellant under promise of marriage about the beginning of January, 1919, was an unmarried female \"of previously chaste character\" when she was seduced by the appellant on the 27th March of the same year. The evidence was that although the complainant met the appellant very frequently from January to the 27th March, she did not, after the first seduction, have any illicit connection with him until the latter date. From this evidence the jury could infer that notwithstanding her fall in January, she had rehabilitated herself and was on the 27th March an unmarried female \"of previously chaste character.\" It is not for us to say that we would have so considered her, but the question is whether the previous seduction of the complainant precluded the jury on the evidence from finding that she had rehabilitated herself, or, in the words of the statute, that she was then an\nunmarried female of previously chaste character under twenty-one years of age. This was eminently a fact for the jury's determination, and I cannot say that there was no evidence to go to the jury on which they could find this fact.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 15 Alta.

In March, 1914, St. D. declaring that he was acting personally and on behalf of the heirs L., rented the hotel to G. & S., the lease expiring on the 30th of April, 1920. On the 20th of February, 1920, St. D. acting as above leased the same property to the respondent for a term of five years. After having on the 24th of March, 1920, guaranteed the heirs L. against all losses and expenses, G. and S. obtained from them, on the 8th of April, 1920, a lease similar to the one given by St. D. to the respondent. On the 24th of April, 1920, G. and S. brought an action against St. D. as defendant and against the heirs L. and the respondent as mis-en-cause, asking for a lease on terms similar to those obtained by the respondent and for the annulment of the lease given to the latter; and on the same day, an action was instituted by the heirs L. against St. D. and the respondent attacking the lease which St. D. had granted in their name to the respondent. On the 14th of May, 1920, the respondent took the present action against St. D., the heirs L., and G. and S., asking to be put into possession of the hotel premises which were not vacated by G. and S. The three actions were united for enqu\u00eate; but three different judgments were delivered, the first two actions being dismissed and the third maintained. In the first action, the judgment, though not dealing with the lease given to respondent, declared that G. and S. had no status as lessees by virtue of the lease given to them by the heirs L.; in the second action, it was held that, St. D. being the authorized agent of the heirs L., the lease to the respondent was valid; and the third judgment gave the respondent the right to obtain possession of the hotel. These three judgments were inscribed in appeal before the Court of King's Bench; but later on, a declaration of discontinuance (d\u00e9sistement) was fyled in the first two actions. The respondent presented a motion before the appellate court to quash the appeal on the ground of chose jug\u00e9e; and a similar motion was made before this court.\nHeld, that it is chose jug\u00e9e against all the appellants that G. and S. had no rights as lessees of the hotel, and against the neirs L. that the lease given by St. D. to the respondent was valid.\nHeld, also, that the respondent, a subsequent tenant, had the right to maintain an action to eject G. and S., former tenants, as the respondent was thus exercising the rights of his lessors under Article 1031 C.C.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The right to have the lease given to respondent declared invalid for want of authority in St. D. belonging solely to the heirs L., the effect of chose jug\u00e9e on that point against them is equivalent to ratification of the lease by them before this action was begun; such lease thus became valid as against everybody who had not theretofore acquired an interest in the property inconsistent with its enforcement; and as it is chose jug\u00e9e against G. and S. that they have no such interest, the lease is valid against them.\nPer Mignault and Bernier JJ.\u2014Though the validity of the lease given to respondent is not chose jug\u00e9e as to G. and S., they cannot, for alleged want of concurrence by the heirs L., attack that lease which was declared valid as against the co-owners of the property, the general rule being that no one can set up a right belonging to another\u2014\"nul ne peut exciper du droit d'autrui.\"\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 31 K.B. 256) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial court, Maclennan J. and maintaining the respondent's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Thibaudeau Rinfret K.C. for the appellants.\u2014The lease given by St. Denis to Gari\u00e9py is not valid because St. Denis had no authority from the heirs Laferri\u00e8re: art. 1730 C.C. The respondent is not entitled to take an action to eject Samson and Gervais as exercising rights of his lessors under article 1031 C.C.; such right of action is not in the nature of those contemplated in this article and would come rather within the exception mentioned in the article as it is a right \"attached to the person.\"\nAim\u00e9 Geofirion K.C. and J. A. Prud'homme K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The judgment in the two first actions not having been appealed from, there is res judicata as to the entirety of the contract or relation among all the parties. Article 1241 C.C.\nThe respondent has a direct action to get possession of the hotel against Gervais and Samson who must be held to be trespassers unwilling to deliver; if a tenant has a right to sue a trespasser subsequently to delivery by the lessor under art. 1616 C.C, he must have the same right before delivery. Alternatively, the respondent has the right to take the present action under article 1031 C.C.\nThibaudeau Rinfret K.C. for the appellants.\nAim\u00e9 Geofirion K.C. and J. A. Prud'homme K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I am not entirely satisfied with the evidence of any authority empowering St. Denis to make the lease in question so far as respects the fractional part of the title not his own, and would prefer resting upon the res judicata invoked and relied upon in the opinion of my brother Mignault, and hence would prefer resting thereon in dismissing this appeal.\nMy only difficulty in doing so is that it has not by way of a plea been made part of this record upon which we have to pass. I think it might well have been allowed to be pleaded by the Court of King's Bench and thus rendered a foundation for the judgment appealed from.\nAnd our judgment dismissing the appeal may well proceed upon such possibility as within our jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment the court below should have pronounced.\nI agree with the judgment of the majority that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Mr. Geoffrion has, I think, succeeded in establishing his contention that res judicata in substance is an answer to this appeal.\nI assume, because it is a point of procedure upon which there was no question in the Court of King's Bench, that it was open to the respondent on the appeal to the King's Bench to bring before that court, in answer to the appeal, matters arising contemporaneously with or subsequent to the judgment appealed from, matters, that is to say, which by reason of the time when they arose could not form an element amongst those constituting the basis upon which the judgment of the trial court rested. I assume, in other words, that the judgments upon which Mr. Geoffrion now basis his averment of res judicata might properly have been brought before the Court of King's Bench for that purpose and might properly be considered by that court in passing upon the appeal; that is a point of procedure upon which I accept without hesitation the concurrent views of the judges in the court below.\nThat being so the judgments invoked are in the language of Art. 1241 C.C. conclusive as to all matters comprised within the \"object of the judgment\". Accordingly there are two questions upon which the appellants cannot be heard; the question of agency and the question of pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. As to the point raised respecting the identity of parties, that is to say, identity of quality\u2014it seems clear that in so far as the respondent's action is based upon article 1031 C.C. he seeks to enforce the rights of his debtors.\nThere is, I think, no substance in the contention that there is no identity of object because the judgments relied upon by the respondent were given in actions for a declaration of right while the action out of which the appeal arises claims executory relief. In substance the objects are identical and the form, I think, is therefore not material.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Mignault. As the material facts of this case are very fully stated by him it is unnecessary that I should repeat them.\nI agree with the views expressed by my learned brother on the issues of res adjudicata, which I think our broad powers of amendment allow us to entertain whatever may have been the jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench in regard to the respondent's motion before that court to dismiss the appeal to it on the ground of chose jug\u00e9e. It is now chose jug\u00e9e as against all the appellants that, when this action was begun, Gervais and Samson had no rights either as lessees or under the \"pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence\" which they invoke\u2014that their occupation of the Hotel Riendeau was merely that of overholding tenants under an expired lease. It is also chose jug\u00e9e as to the appellants, the Laferri\u00e8res, though not as against Gervais and Samson, that the lease under which the respondent claims was then valid and effectual. There remains the question whether, giving due effect to these premises, Gervais and Samson, who are themselves without any colour of right to retain possession, should be heard to challenge the validity of the respondent's title to recover possession, which, as against all the owners of the property, is no longer disputable.\nThat the respondent, if he is the holder of a valid lease, has the right to maintain this action exercising the rights of his lessors under Art. 1031 C.C. is demonstrated in the opinion of my brother Mignault. Although the validity of this lease be not chose jug\u00e9e as against the appellants, Gervais and Samson, if they are no longer in a position to challenge it, the respondent's status under Art. 1031 C.C. is, I think, equally established.\nThe right, if it ever existed, to have the Gari\u00e9py lease declared invalid and set aside for want of authority in St. Denis to make it, belonged solely to the Laferri\u00e8res. If they saw fit to ratify or acquiesce in that lease nobody else could attack it. As against them its validity is now conclusively established. It is therefore in the same position as if they had in fact so ratified it at the time the action was begun in which it became chose jug\u00e9e that they were bound by it.\nWhile, assuming for the moment that St. Denis lacked authority to execute the Gari\u00e9py lease on behalf of the Laferri\u00e8res, that fact might have afforded a defence to Gervais and Samson so long as the Laferri\u00e8res were in a position to take advantage of it, that in my opinion would not be the case in an action to recover possession begun by Gari\u00e9py against Gervais and Samson after the Laferri\u00e8res had lost their right to contest the authority of St. Denis. Since it became binding upon them the Gari\u00e9py lease is good as against everybody who had not theretofore acquired an interest in the property inconsistent with its enforcement. It is res adjudicata as against Gervais and Samson that they have no such interest. Therefore an action brought now by Gari\u00e9py to recover possession from them should succeed. Is the court bound, unless the evidence in the record before us affirmatively establishes the authority of St. Denis to bind the Laferri\u00e8res, to refuse that relief in the present suit and put the respondent to the expense and delay of taking fresh proceedings to enforce his now undoubted right to obtain possession of the leased premises because the right of the Laferri\u00e8res to contest that authority had not been actually judicially negatived when this action was begun? I think not. Gari\u00e9py is now in a position to exercise the \"right of action\" of the Laferri\u00e8res as well as of St. Denis (Art. 1031 C.C.). There can be no question of their right, acting together, to eject Gervais and Samson. That is the consequence of their ownership of the property and the determination that Gervais and Samson have no right to continue in occupation either as lessees or under the \"pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence,\" which is chose jug\u00e9e as against them. Under these circumstances, giving due effect to the fact that the other actions were begun before this one and that judgments in them were retroactive to the respective dates of the writs, I think Gervais and Samson should no longer be heard to question the plaintiff-respondent's status to exercise in this action the right of his lessors. If it were clear that the finding of the learned trial judge, affirmed by two of the learned judges of the King's Bench, that the evidence the present case sufficiently establishes the authority of St. Denis to bind the Laferri\u00e8res, could not be supported, and if that question should be entered upon merely to deal with a matter of costs, it may be that the appellants Gervais and Samson would be entitled to some relief in regard to costs incurred before the judgment in the Superior Court by which St. Denis's authority was established as against the Laferri\u00e8res. But I am not convinced that the finding of tacit mandate made by the learned trial judge and affirmed by Mr. Justice Martin and Mr. Justice Flynn in the Court of King's Bench was so clearly wrong that we should disturb it. Haying regard to the jurisprudence of this court, I would question the propriety of our entering upon such a question merely to adjudicate upon a matter of costs.\nMignault J.\u2014Les conclusions que je crois devoir adopter en cette cause seront plus intelligibles si je commence par un expos\u00e9 aussi court que possible des faits saillants que constate le volumineux dossier.\nMonsieur A. J. H. St. Denis, notaire de Montr\u00e9al, et feu Philippe Laferri\u00e8re \u00e9taient, en l'ann\u00e9e 1904, copropri\u00e9taires par indivis et par \u00e9gales parts de l'immeuble situ\u00e9 sur la Place Jacques Cartier \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et connu sous le nom d'H\u00f4tel Riendeau, et, par bail en date du 3 mai, 1904, ils l'avaient lou\u00e9, pour dix ann\u00e9es, au nomm\u00e9 J. Arthur Tanguay.\nPendant le cours de ce bail Philippe Laferri\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, laissant une veuve, depuis mari\u00e9e en secondes noces avec M. Pierre D'Auteuil, avocat de La Malbaie, et douze enfants dont trois seulement \u00e9taient alors majeurs. St.-Denis a achet\u00e9 de plusieurs des h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re leurs parts dans l'H\u00f4tel Riendeau, \u00e0 tel point que lors du bail sign\u00e9 par lui en faveur de l'intim\u00e9, il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de cet immeuble pour les sept-huiti\u00e8mes, l'autre huiti\u00e8me appartenant \u00e0 trois des h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re, dont deux mineurs, qui n'avaient pas dispos\u00e9 de leurs parts.\nLe 30 mars, 1914, St.-Denis, d\u00e9clarant agir tant pour lui que comme administrateur des int\u00e9r\u00eats des h\u00e9ritiers de feu Philippe Laferri\u00e8re, avait lou\u00e9 cet immeuble aux appelants Gervais et Samson, le bail, consenti pour six ann\u00e9es, devant expirer le 30 avril, 1920. Dans ce bail, il \u00e9tait dit que si le bailleur d\u00e9cidait de vendre l'h\u00f4tel, il donnerait la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux locataires sur tout autre acqu\u00e9reur.\nAu mois de f\u00e9vrier, 1920, St. Denis, qui administrait cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9tait m\u00e9content des locataires Gervais et Samson, qui devaient des arr\u00e9rages de loyer et qui avaient subi des condamnations pour infractions \u00e0 la loi des licences, et il cherchait un autre locataire. C'est dans ces circonstances qu'il s'aboucha avec l'intim\u00e9 Gari\u00e9py, et, le 20 f\u00e9vrier, 1920, il lui donna un bail pour cinq ans de l'H\u00f4tel Riendeau, d\u00e9clarant agir, comme dans le bail \u00e0 Gervais et Samson, tant personnellement que comme administrateur autoris\u00e9 de la succession Philippe Laferri\u00e8re. Le m\u00eame jour St. Denis consentit en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 une promesse de vente de l'h\u00f4tel pour $60,000. Cette promesse de vente \u00e9tait synallagmatique, l'intim\u00e9 promettant acheter, mais ce n'\u00e9tait que cinq ans plus tard, et apr\u00e8s avoir fait certains paiements, que l'intim\u00e9 pouvait exiger un contrat de vente.\nCe bail et les agissements des parties \u00e0 sa suite ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 trois proc\u00e8s. Il est \u00e9vident que les locataires Gervais et Samson, dont le bail expirait le 30 avril 1920, ne voulaient pas livrer \u00e0 un autre locataire la possession de l'h\u00f4tel. Ils pr\u00e9tendaient que le bail donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait nul parce qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par St. Denis sans l'autorisation de ceux des h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re qui \u00e9taient encore int\u00e9ress\u00e9s dans l'immeuble. Pour amener ceux-ci \u00e0 attaquer le bail de l'intim\u00e9, ils leur garantissaient, le 24 mars 1920, le remboursement de tous frais et d\u00e9penses et commen\u00e7aient par d\u00e9poser en banque une somme de $1,000.00 devant servir aux d\u00e9bours\u00e9s. Le 8 avril, 1920, sachant tr\u00e8s bien qu'une part minime seulement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 restait encore aux Laferri\u00e8re, ils se faisaient donner, aux m\u00eames conditions que celles stipul\u00e9es au bail et \u00e0 la promesse de vente de l'intim\u00e9, un bail et une promesse de vente de l'immeuble par Andr\u00e9 Laferri\u00e8re, \u00e9tudiant en droit, agissant comme procureur de Paul Laferri\u00e8re, majeur, et de Louis Laferri\u00e8re, tuteur de Marthe et Madeleine Laferri\u00e8re, mineures. Ils prenaient, le 24 avril 1920, une action contre St. Denis, comme d\u00e9fendeur, et contre l'intim\u00e9 et les h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re qui avaient encore des int\u00e9r\u00eats dans l'immeuble, comme mis-en-cause, r\u00e9clamant, vu le bail et la promesse de vente obtenus par l'intim\u00e9, un bail et une promesse de vente semblables, et demandant l'annulation du bail de l'intim\u00e9 et la radiation de son enregistrement. Et le m\u00eame jour, 24 avril 1920, une action fut intent\u00e9e par les h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re contre l'intim\u00e9 et St. Denis pour faire annuler le bail et la promesse de vente obtenus par l'intim\u00e9. Il est assez clair que, sans la garantie donn\u00e9e par Gervais et Samson aux Laferri\u00e8re, cette action n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e, de sorte qu'il est difficile de croire que Gervais et Samson n'en \u00e9taient pas les instigateurs, comme du reste la cour sup\u00e9rieure l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9. Enfin, lorsque l'intim\u00e9 voulut prendre possession de l'immeuble en vertu de son bail, Gervais et Samson, qui n'avaient aucun droit de l'occuper eux-m\u00eames, s'y oppos\u00e8rent, et l'intim\u00e9 dut intenter, le 14 mai 1920, une action (qui seule a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel) contre St. Denis, les h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re et Gervais et Samson pour obtenir cette possession. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leur r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 cette action\u2014qui est encore pendante et \u00e0 laquelle, il faut l'esp\u00e9rer, notre jugement mettra fin\u2014Gervais et Samson ont gard\u00e9 pendant dix-huit mois un immeuble auquel ils n'ont certainement aucun droit. Les d\u00e9lais de la proc\u00e9dure judiciaire leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi profitables qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nuisibles \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9.\nDe ces trois proc\u00e8s un seul, celui que nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 juger, a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Les trois actions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies pour l'enqu\u00eate, mais elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es par trois jugements s\u00e9par\u00e9s. L'action de Gervais et Samson contre St. Denis, Gari\u00e9py et les h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re et celle des h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re contre St. Denis et Gari\u00e9py ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es, et l'action de Gari\u00e9py contre St. Denis, les Laferri\u00e8re et Gervais et Samson a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue. Les appelants Laferri\u00e8re et Gervais et Samson ont port\u00e9 les trois jugements en cour d'appel, mais, dans les deux premi\u00e8res actions, se trouvant, nous dit-on, dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de fournir le cautionnement requis, ils se sont d\u00e9sist\u00e9s de leur inscription en appel. Il n'y a maintenant que la troisi\u00e8me action, celle o\u00f9 Gari\u00e9py est demandeur, qui ne soit pas d\u00e9finitivement jug\u00e9e.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui doive nous occuper, c'est celle de savoir si le bail consenti par St. Denis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 lie les h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re qui ont encore des int\u00e9r\u00eats dans l'h\u00f4tel Riendeau. A cet \u00e9gard, apr\u00e8s une longue enqu\u00eate, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait les constatations de fait suivantes que je cite de son jugement:\nAt the date of the execution of said lease and for many years prior thereto the defendant St. Denis was the administrator of said property, being himself sole owner of a portion of said immoveable and the owner of seven-eighths of the remainder of said property, the other one-eighth belonging to certain of the heirs of the late Philippe Laferri\u00e8re, and defendant was then and had been for many years the duly authorized agent of the said heirs and with their consent and on their behalf administered their interest in said property and the said heirs, by reason of their having allowed defendant St. Denis to manage and administer their interest in said property, gave reasonable cause for the belief that the said St. Denis was their agent in connection with said property, and the plaintiff in this case entered into said lease of 20th February, 1920, in good faith, believing that the said St. Denis was in fact the agent and representative of the said heirs of the estate of the said Philippe Laferri\u00e8re.\nLe jugement de la cour d'appel d\u00e9clare qu'il n'y a pas d'erreur dans le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et il en confirme le dispositif. Deux des juges qui formaient la majorit\u00e9 de la cour (les honorables juges Martin et Flynn) ont formellement reconnu l'existence d'un mandat au moins tacite des Laferri\u00e8re \u00e0 St. Denis, autorisant celui-ci \u00e0 louer l'h\u00f4tel \u00e0 Gari\u00e9py ; le troisi\u00e8me juge (l'honorable juge Tellier) s'est bas\u00e9; sur la chose jug\u00e9e pour se prononcer en faveur de l'intim\u00e9.\nDevant cette cour l'intim\u00e9 a produit une motion soulevant la question de chose jug\u00e9e. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il y a maintenant chose jug\u00e9e en sa faveur quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de son bail, cette validit\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9e, dit-il, par la cour sup\u00e9rieure sans appel ult\u00e9rieur dans les deux actions institu\u00e9es le 24 avril, 1920, et dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question plus haut.\nL'intim\u00e9 peut-il soulever cette question devant nous? Je le crois. L'appel met tout en question et il n'y aura jugement final que lorsque cette cour aura rendu sa d\u00e9cision. Le code de proc\u00e9dure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, art. 199, permet de faire valoir par plaidoyer suppl\u00e9mentaire, avec l'autorisation du juge, des faits essentiels arriv\u00e9s depuis la contestation. Du reste, les pouvoirs d'amendement que poss\u00e8de cette cour (r\u00e8gle de pratique 54) nous donnent une discr\u00e9tion absolue \u00e0 ce sujet, et dans les circonstances de cette cause je suis d'avis d'exercer cette discr\u00e9tion et de traiter la motion de l'intim\u00e9 comme un plaidoyer suppl\u00e9mentaire.\nReste \u00e0 savoir si ce plaidoyer est bien fond\u00e9.\nLa doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e repose sur une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure et m\u00eame d'ordre public que le fait constat\u00e9 par le juge est vrai: res judicata pro veritate habetur. Elle a pour fondement non pas l'acquiescement de la partie, acquiescement qui d\u00e9coulerait de la circonstance qu'elle n'a pas appel\u00e9 du jugement qui la condamne, mais la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 irr\u00e9cusable du fait que constate ce jugement, lequel, quand il est devenu d\u00e9finitif, ne peut plus \u00eatre mis en question. Et cette pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise pour emp\u00eacher de nouveaux proc\u00e8s entre les m\u00eames parties sur la m\u00eame question et pour rendre impossible que les parties puissent obtenir des arr\u00eats contradictoires.\nIl faut pour cela que ce qu'on a appel\u00e9 les trois identit\u00e9s se rencontrent: identit\u00e9 d'objet en ce sens, dit l'article 1241 C.C., que la demande soit \"pour la m\u00eame chose que dans l'instance jug\u00e9e\"; identit\u00e9 de cause, c'est-\u00e0-dire, pour citer le m\u00eame article, \"lorsque la demande est fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame cause:\" et identit\u00e9 de personnes, soit une demande \"entre les m\u00eames parties agissant dans les m\u00eames qualit\u00e9s.\"\nIci, dans les deux actions qui se trouvent jug\u00e9es d\u00e9finitivement, les demandeurs concluaient \u00e0 l'annulation du bail consenti \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, all\u00e9guant que St. Denis, en le signant, avait agi sans l'autorisation de ses copropri\u00e9taires, les h\u00e9ritiers Laferri\u00e8re. Le jugement dans l'action des Laferri\u00e8re contre St. Denis et Gari\u00e9py\u2014Gervais et Samson n'y \u00e9taient pas parties\u2014d\u00e9cide que, lors du bail Gari\u00e9py, St. Denis \u00e9tait l'administrateur de l'immeuble en question et des int\u00e9r\u00eats de ses copropri\u00e9taires, les Laferri\u00e8re, et l'agent d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 de ces derniers. Dans l'action de Gervais et Samson contre St. Denis, dans laquelle les Laferri\u00e8re et Gari\u00e9py \u00e9taient parties, le jugement ne se prononce pas sur la validit\u00e9 du bail Gari\u00e9py, mais se contente d'annuler celui que les Laferri\u00e8re avaient donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Gervais et Samson et de d\u00e9cider que ceux-ci n'ont pas droit \u00e0 un bail et une promesse de vente de l'H\u00f4tel Riendeau. Je crois donc que l'identit\u00e9 d'objet se rencontre dans l'esp\u00e8ce, eu \u00e9gard aux all\u00e9gations et conclusions de ces actions.\nJ'en dirais autant de l'identit\u00e9 de cause, car dans toutes ces actions on attaquait le bail Gari\u00e9py pour le motif qu'il \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 par l'un des copropri\u00e9taires sans l'assentiment des autres. Et ce bail fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 valable dans l'action des Laferri\u00e8re contre St. Denis et Gari\u00e9py.\nJ'ai plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'identit\u00e9 de personnes, car nous ne trouvons toutes les parties qui sont devant nous que dans l'action de Gervais et Samson contre St. Denis, comme d\u00e9fendeur, et Gari\u00e9py et les Laferri\u00e8re, comme mis-en-cause, et ce n'est que dans l'action des Laferri\u00e8re contre St. Denis et Gari\u00e9py, o\u00f9 Gervais et Samson n'\u00e9taient pas parties, que la cour sup\u00e9rieure a formellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que St. Denis \u00e9tait l'agent d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 des Laferri\u00e8re en consentant le bail Gari\u00e9py.\nJe conclus donc qu'entre les Laferri\u00e8re et l'intim\u00e9 Gari\u00e9py il y a chose jug\u00e9e sur la validit\u00e9 du bail que St. Denis accorda \u00e0 celui-ci. A F\u00e9gard de Gervais et Samson, il n'y a chose jug\u00e9e que quant \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 de leur propre bail consenti par les Laferri\u00e8re. Ce point cependant est important, car il en r\u00e9sulte que Gervais et Samson n'ont aucun titre \u00e0 l'occupation de l'immeuble.\nJ'\u00e9carte comme mal fond\u00e9e la pr\u00e9tention soutenue avec beaucoup de talent par M. Rinfret que Gari\u00e9py n'agit pas dans cette action dans la m\u00eame qualit\u00e9 que dans les deux autres, car outre que l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend exercer en vertu de l'article 1031 C.C. un droit que St. Denis refuse ou n\u00e9glige de faire valoir, l'expulsion de Gervais et Samson, il demande de son propre chef contre St. Denis et Gervais et Samson la possession de cet immeuble.\nS'il y a maintenant chose jug\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les propri\u00e9taires de l'H\u00f4tel Riendeau sur la validit\u00e9 du bail Gari\u00e9py, et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Gervais et Samson seulement sur la nullit\u00e9 de leur propre bail, doit-on permettre \u00e0 ces derniers\u2014ce point n'\u00e9tant pas chose jug\u00e9e quant \u00e0 eux\u2014de soutenir que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas un bail liant tous les propri\u00e9taires de l'h\u00f4tel Riendeau?\nJe suis d'avis que non. C'est un principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire qu'on ne peut exciper du droit d'autrui. Le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, dans l'action des Laferri\u00e8re contre Gari\u00e9py et St. Denis, a jug\u00e9 que le bail de l'intim\u00e9 est valable vis-\u00e0-vis tous les copropri\u00e9taires de l'h\u00f4tel, et a ainsi tranch\u00e9 cette question de validit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes les parties qui pouvaient la soulever. Permettre maintenant \u00e0 Gervais et Samson de renouveler le d\u00e9bat, quand tous les copropri\u00e9taires de l'immeuble sont li\u00e9s par le bail donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, serait non-seulement les autoriser \u00e0 exciper du droit d'autrui, mais aussi \u00e0 exciper d'un droit que les Laferri\u00e8re ne peuvent maintenant faire valoir. Je suis donc d'avis que la validit\u00e9 du bail de l'intim\u00e9 ne peut plus \u00eatre contest\u00e9e. Cette question \u00e9tant mise hors du d\u00e9bat, il reste \u00e0 voir si Gari\u00e9py pouvait, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il a un bail valide de l'H\u00f4tel Riendeau, et que les appelants Gervais et Samson n'ont aucun droit de l'occuper \u00e0 rencontre de son bail, prendre cette action et demander vis-\u00e0-vis de St. Denis sa mise en possession de l'immeuble, et, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Gervais et Samson, leur expulsion.\nTous les auteurs enseignent que le preneur, vis-\u00e0-vis de son bailleur, peut obtenir, manu militari s'il le faut, la possession de la chose lou\u00e9e. Voy. Baudry-Lacantinerie et Wahl, Louage, tome 1er, n\u00b0 308, o\u00f9 un grand nombre d'auteurs sont cit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de cette solution que je consid\u00e8re certaine.\nMaintenant Gervais et Samson \u00e9tant en possession de l'immeuble sans droit, Gari\u00e9py peut-il les en faire expulser?\nPour le faire, Gari\u00e9py invoque l'article 1031 du code civil permettant au cr\u00e9ancier d'exercer les droits et actions de son d\u00e9biteur, \u00e0 l'exception de ceux qui sont exclusivement attach\u00e9s \u00e0 sa personne, lorsqu'\u00e0 son pr\u00e9judice il refuse ou n\u00e9glige de le faire.\nOn pr\u00e9tend que cet article ne s'applique que pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats purement p\u00e9cuniaires, que c'est un droit analogue \u00e0 celui que consacre l'article 1032 quant \u00e0 l'action paulienne, et que le but de l'article 1031 est de faire rentrer dans le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur une somme d'argent ou une valeur qui en est sortie par fraude.\nA ne consid\u00e9rer que les termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l'article 1031, il comprendrait tous les \"droits et actions\" du d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 la seule exception de ceux qui sont exclusivement attach\u00e9s \u00e0 sa personne. Et il suffit de dire lex non distinguit. Mais les commentateurs de l'article 1166 du code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 notre article 1031, enseignent que sa formule est trop large. Ils disent que pour que le cr\u00e9ancier soit admis \u00e0 exercer les droits de son d\u00e9biteur, il faut qu'il s'agisse de droits compris dans le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur. Et ils ajoutent, ce qui para\u00eet clair, que l'article 1166 est \u00e9tranger \u00e0 tous les droits relatifs soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat des personnes, soit aux rapports de famille, alors m\u00eame que l'exercice d'un droit de cette nature devrait avoir pour cons\u00e9quence indirecte d'augmenter le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur ou d'en pr\u00e9venir la diminution. (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, tome 1er, n\u00b0 590).\nOn distingue encore selon qu'il s'agit d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire ou d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat purement moral, le premier entrant dans la r\u00e8gle de l'article 1166, l'autre dans son exception. Quant aux droits mixtes, c'est-\u00e0-dire les droits ayant leur fondement dans un int\u00e9r\u00eat moral et un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire tout \u00e0 la fois, si l'int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire domine, le cr\u00e9ancier pourra exercer l'action qui en r\u00e9sulte. (M\u00eames auteurs, n\u00b0 591).\nJ'avoue que je suis assez peu touch\u00e9 par l'objection que la formule de l'article 1031 serait trop large, car alors qu'on peut tr\u00e8s bien critiquer la loi, il faut l'appliquer, quand son sens n'est pas douteux, quelque large que soit sa formule, puisqu'elle est l'expression de la volont\u00e9 souveraine du l\u00e9gislateur. Du reste, m\u00eame en adoptant le criterium que j'ai emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 la doctrine fran\u00e7aise, le droit d'action de St. Denis pour l'expulsion de Gervais et Samson n'est certainement pas fond\u00e9 sur un int\u00e9r\u00eat moral, et, partant, ne tombe pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie des droits qui sont exclusivement attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne du d\u00e9biteur. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire de St. Denis d'intenter cette action est tr\u00e8s visible, car autrement il aurait \u00e0 paye de forts dommages \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et en l'exercant il emp\u00eache que son patrimoine ne soit notablement diminu\u00e9 par l'indemnit\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e0 donner au locataire \u00e0 qui il a promis la paisible jouissance de l'h\u00f4tel.\nMais ce qui me para\u00eet d\u00e9cisif, outre les termes formels de l'article 1031, c'est qu'on juge en France que le bailleur peut c\u00e9der \u00e0 son locataire son droit d'action tendant \u00e0 l'expulsion d'un autre locataire qui refuse d'abandonner la possession de la chose lou\u00e9e, bien que son bail soit expir\u00e9 (Dalloz 1895,1. 367; 1894.2.53; 1876.1.27), Si ce droit d'action peut \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9, si le bailleur peut en accorder la subrogation \u00e0 son locataire, et si la seule stipulation que le locataire se fera mettre en possession \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils comporte cette subrogation, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat rapport\u00e9 par Dalloz, 1876.1.27, on pourrait difficilement soutenir que ce droit ne forme pas partie du patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur. Et il para\u00eetrait peu logique de d\u00e9cider que le locataire peut, contre le bailleur, se faire mettre en possession de la chose lou\u00e9e manu militari, et de lui refuser, malgr\u00e9 la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des termes de l'article 1031, le droit d'exercer l'action en expulsion du bailleur quand celui-ci refuse ou n\u00e9glige de l'intenter lui-m\u00eame.\nJe suis donc d'avis que le droit que l'intim\u00e9 veut exercer rentre dans l'interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l'article 1031. Et j'ajoute que le texte de cet article suffit, sans autre argument, pour justifier le jugement dont on appelle.\nA l'audition, le savant avocat des appelants Gervais et Samson a pr\u00e9tendu que ceux-ci, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'autre bail, avaient un bail par tacite reconduction. Il suffit de r\u00e9pondre que Gervais et Samson se basent uniquement dans la plaidoirie \u00e9crite sur le bail que les Laferri\u00e8re leur ont donn\u00e9 et demandent un bail \u00e0 St. Denis. D'ailleurs on ne peut dire qu'ils aient gard\u00e9 la possession de l'h\u00f4tel du consentement du bailleur quand St. Denis leur a signifi\u00e9 par prot\u00eat d'avoir \u00e0 en d\u00e9guerpir le 1er mai 1920. Ce moyen, invoqu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant cette cour, doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9.\nJe suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel de tous les appelants avec d\u00e9pens.\nBernier J.\u2014Je concours dans les opinions exprim\u00e9es par Monsieur le juge Mignault dans ses notes de jugement en cette cause, et je ne vois rien qui puisse y \u00eatre ajout\u00e9.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Clovis Laporte.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Prud'homme.\n[1] [1921] Q.

Walking quickly with his head down he ran into a car travelling in the other direction and received injuries which caused his death. The latter car was going at excessive speed and its gong was not rung as the company\u2019s rules require. On the trial of an action by B\u2019s widow for damages the judge directed the jury that \u201cstop look and listen\u201d before crossing a railway track was not a prescribed rule of conduct in Canada; that they should find whether or not the excessive speed and non-sounding of the gong caused the accident which killed B.; and also whether or not B., when the gong could not be heard, acted as a reasonable and prudent man would in attempting to cross without ascertaining that it was safe to do so. A verdict was rendered against the company.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that there was no misdirection in the charge of the trial Judge that called for an order for a new trial.\nPer Davies C.J. The jury should have been told that whether the gong was sounded or not it was the duty of B. to look and listen before attempting to cross. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the head-note.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\nFripp K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the first Appellate Division of Ontario dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division, entered on the findings of the jury, awarding damages to the amount of $11,600 to the widow and children of Werner L. Booth for his death which the jury found to have been caused by the negligence of the defendants.\nWe have not the advantage of having any reasons given by the Appellate Division for the judgment appealed from, though the amount of $11,600 found by the jury and for which judgment was entered by the trial judge was reduced to $10,000.\nI understood from Mr. McCarthy, counsel for the appellants, that the same points in support of the appeal were taken and argued by him in the appeal court as were taken and argued before us.\nThere is a double track of the defendant\u2019s railway on Elgin Street, Ottawa, on which the cars of the defendants ran north and south, but no tracks on Slater Street which crosses it.\nThe facts and circumstances of the accident, as I gather them from the statements of counsel and from the trial judge\u2019s charge and the evidence are substantially these. The deceased was a clerk in the Militia Department which then occupied a building on the south side of Slater Street, about 150 feet east of Elgin Street, and, on the morning of the day in question for the purpose of reaching his office, two blocks distant, he, in company with two fellow clerks, William J. Peary and Theo. D. Deblois\u2014boarded a south bound Elgin Street car at the corner of Queen Street, all three having transferred from a Queen Street car.\nIt was then 8.12 or 8.13 a.m. and Booth and his fellow clerks were due at their office at 8.15 a.m., and there was a penalty attached to their being late. Consequently all three were \u201churrying\u201d.\nStreet cars in Ottawa stop at the opposite or far side of the street intersections and as the car approached Slater Street one of them signalled for it to stop and as it was slowing up preparatory to stopping but before it had been brought to a stop, that is while it was still moving, Booth and his companions alighted. Booth left the car a second or two before the others and had proceeded about three feet when the other two alighted. After leaving the car Booth \u201cran\u201d, according to some witnesses, \u201ctrotted\u201d according to another witness, or \u201cwalked briskly\u201d according to another witness, but whether he \u201cran\u201d, \u201ctrotted\u201d or \u201cwalked briskly\u201d he certainly, according to all, went rapidly with his head down or bent forward around the rear end of the car which he had left, towards the east and almost immediately came in contact with a north bound car on the east track, his head striking the car and sustained the injuries from which he subsequently died.\nWhen Booth alighted from the south bound car, it and the north bound car were \u201cpractically\u201d, that is almost, overlapping, and both cars were moving. Both cars are of the same type, being 30 feet in length with vestibules at either end and crosswise seats, and the bodies of both overhang the rail twenty inches, so that when both cars are overlapping, the devil-strip being 4 feet, eight inches wide, there is a space of only sixteen inches between them. When, therefore, after leaving the south bound car, Booth moved rapidly around the rear end of it with his head down or bent forward, he came almost immediately in contact with the north bound car, that is to say, he had to travel only some 7 or 8 or, at the most, 9 feet, that is the width of the western track (four feet eight inches) plus the width of the devil strip (four feet eight inches) less the overhang of the north bound car (20 inches) and of this distance he had travelled some 3 feet before his companions left the car.\nThere was no congestion of traffic at the street intersection at the time of the accident. There was neither vehicle nor pedestrian on the crossing. No one got on the south bound car and no one left it but Booth and his two companions and as these alighted while the car was in motion it went on over the crossing without stopping. No one got off the north bound car and as there was no one awaiting at the crossing to get on, it also passed over the crossing without stopping. As the morning was fine, there was nothing, therefore, in the condition of the weather, the traffic, the street, the tracks or the cars in any way contributing to the accident.\nBy Rule 5 of the schedule to chapter 76, 57 Victoria (Ontario), by which statute the operations of the defendants are governed, each car is required to be supplied with a gong which is to be sounded when the car approaches to within fifty feet of a crossing, but there is no requirement that the gong shall be sounded continuously until the crossing is passed. By Rule 99, however, of the Company\u2019s Rules and Regulations for the government of its employees, given in evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs, the motorman is directed to sound the gong on approaching a street crossing at least twenty-five yards therefrom, and to continue such sounding until the crossing is passed as a warning to the public who may be walking or driving on, or dangerously close to, the company\u2019s tracks.\nThe jury found the defendants guilty of negligence causing the accident, and that such negligence consisted in\nomittance of sounding gong and car travelling at excessive speed at crossing,\nand no negligence on the part of deceased causing or contributing to the accident.\nThe findings of the jury as to the negligence of the defendants which caused the accident are not and could not be called in question on this appeal.\nWhat is contended for, and it seems to me the only contention that can be successfully advanced here, is that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury on the point of the deceased\u2019s duty (when crossing around the rear end of the car he had left and before attempting to cross the devil-strip, as it is called, between the two tracks), to look and see whether any north bound car was coming along on that track.\nThe learned trial judge on this point charged the jury as follows:\u2014\nThen you come to question number three, as to the deceased man\u2019s conduct. If a man is walking along the street and he sees a street car coming in a way that is negligent, it is his duty to avoid, if he can, the consequence of that negligence. The duty of the deceased was to exercise care when seeking to cross the easterly track; he should be reasonably on the lookout but the law has never said, and it is not the law, that you are bound to stop, look and listen before crossing a track upon which there may be a train or a car. You must exercise reasonable care, and what would be \u201ccare\u201d under one set of conditions, might not be \u201ccare\u201d under another; so the test always is, where damage is sought to be recovered because of negligence in a railway accident, whether the plaintiff, under the circumstances of that particular case, was reasonably careful, was he acting as a man of ordinary prudence.\nIf the gong was not ringing, then what negligence was the deceased guilty of? If the gong was not ringing was that circumstance sufficient to tell him he might with safety cross those tracks; that there was no car coming? Is that the meaning to be attached to the non-ringing of the gong at a place where it ought to be rung? If the non-ringing of the gong, when it ought to be rung, is an invitation to cross, an intimation he might safely cross, then what negligence would the man be guilty of if, under those circumstances, he chooses to step across the tracks?\nI mention these matters for your consideration. You must determine questions of fact, and you have to ask yourselves, what would a reasonable man do under the circumstances what interpretation would he place upon the fact that a warning was not given\u2014if that was the case? I am not saying there was not a warning given; but if there was no warning, what interpretation would a reasonable man place upon that circumstance?\nAt the close of the judge\u2019s charge, the defendants\u2019 counsel took exception to that part of it relating to the deceased\u2019s negligence, saying:\u2014\nI submit your Lordship told the jury that if the gong was ringing and the man attempted to pass across the east track he was acting imprudently. I submit your Lordship should have told the jury, whether the gong was ringing or not, if he attempted to cross the east track at that point without care, without looking or listening, he was acting imprudently.\nThe answer of the learned judge was:\u2014\nGentlemen of the Jury; Mr. McVeity wishes me to tell you that whether the gong was ringing or not, it was the duty of the deceased to have exercised care in crossing the east bound track. The question of exercising care is a question of fact and you must say, assuming the gong was not rung, whether the deceased was acting reasonably in doing what he did. It is not a question of law whether he acted reasonably, it is a question of fact, and for you to determine. I cannot set up a standard, and the court cannot set up a standard of facts which become so rigid as to determine the law; it remains a question of fact always whether the party exercised reasonable care or did not. I respectfully submit that, under the circumstances, the general charge that, assuming the gong was not rung, the jury must find whether the deceased was acting reasonably in doing what he did without directing them specifically on the question of his duty to look and see whether there was a car approaching from the south along the eastern track was misleading, and the more especially as he had already told them \u201cthat the law has never said and it is not the law that you are bound to stop\nlook and listen before crossing a track on which there may be a train or a car.\nIt is true the American rule, adopted in several of the States of the Union, requiring a person about to cross a railroad or car track to stop, look and listen, has not, to my knowledge, been directly formulated or adopted by our courts, but that part of it requiring a person so situated to look and see whether a train or car is approaching has been adopted.\nNow in view of the deceased\u2019s knowledge that the cars of the company ran up the line he was about to cross every few minutes, I submit that the judge should have told the jury it was the duty of the deceased, after crossing around the rear end of his south bound car, not to attempt crossing the track of the north bound cars without looking to see if a car was approaching.\nIf there were any facts or circumstances which might excuse the deceased from discharging that duty, they might possibly be left to the jury under proper direction to determine. Here there were no such facts suggested.\nI respectfully submit that this court has already decided the very point in the case of the Wabash Railroad Co. v. Misener[1]. In that case, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court, I stated what we thought the law was, as follows:\u2014\nI do not desire, even by implication, to cast a doubt upon the reasonable and salutary rule so frequently laid down by this court as to the duty which the law imposes upon persons travelling along a highway while passing or attempting to pass over a level railway crossing. They must act as reasonable and sentient beings and, unless excused by special circumstances, must look before attempting to cross to see whether they can do so with safety. If they choose blindly, recklessly or foolishly to run into danger, they must surely take the consequences.\nI would not, of course, have quoted and relied upon an opinion of my own unless it had the approval of my colleagues, and in that case my opinion was expressly concurred in by my colleagues Idington and Duff JJ., constituting a majority of the court, which is my only reason for quoting it.\nIf that is a correct statement of the law respecting the duty of persons travelling a highway while passing or attempting to pass over a level railway crossing, how much stronger is the reason for applying that law to such a case as we have before us here where there are double tracks of a street railway, only a few feet apart, with cars passing each other north and south every few minutes and a passenger, with full knowledge of these facts, alighting from one car and passing around its rear either \u201cran\u201d or \u201ctrotted\u201d or \u201cwalked briskly\u201d across the devil-strip, whichever pace the jury accepted as his, in the attempt to cross the adjoining track without looking to see if a car was approaching.\nIt has been suggested that the often cited case of Slattery v. Dublin, &c., Ry. Co. decided by the House of Lords,[2] is in point and governs this case. I respectfully submit it does nothing of the kind. As Lord Cairns, the Lord Chancellor, who voted with the majority in dismissing the railway company\u2019s appeal, so clearly pointed out in his judgment at page 1162 and again at page 1165 of the report, the only question before their Lordships in that appeal was\nwhether the verdict should be entered for the defendants, the appellants, in the action.\nThere was no question before their Lordships as to whether the verdict was against the evidence or the weight of evidence or of misdirection by the trial judge, or of a new trial being granted. His Lordship at page 1166 says:\u2014\nIf a railway train, which ought to whistle when passing through a station, were to pass through without whistling, and a man were, in broad daylight, and without anything, either in the structure of the line or otherwise, to obstruct his view, to cross in front of the advancing train and to be killed, I should think the judge ought to tell the jury that it was the folly and recklessness of the man, and not the carelessness of the company, which caused his death. This would be an example of what was spoken of in this House in the case of The Metropolitan Railway Company, v. Jackson[3] an incuria but not an incuria dans locum injuri\u0153. The jury could not be allowed to connect the carelessness in not whistling, with the accident to the man who rushed, with his eyes open, on his own destruction.\nThat statement of his Lordship appears to me peculiarly applicable to the case now before us, and I think it clear from what he says on page 1165 of the report that, if the question of whether the verdict was against the evidence or the weight of evidence was open in the House of Lords, he would\nwithout hesitation be of opinion that a verdict more directly against evidence he had seldom seen. I do not think this Slattery Case[4] at all adverse to the appellants in the appeal at bar, but rather the contrary, as if it had been open to their Lordships to grant a new trial the Lord Chancellor would have undisputably voted for granting it.\nIf I am right, as I think I am, in my statement of the law as to the duty of a person attempting to cross one of the double tracks of car lines of the defendants, appellants, under the circumstances in which the deceased attempted to do, to look before crossing whether a car was approaching, then the defendants\u2019 right to have the jury specifically instructed on the point is clear, and the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the learned trial judge\u2019s charge was quite sufficient to enable the jury to understand their duties in regard to the question of contributory negligence, as well as all else in the case, even before counsel for the defence took the exception he did.\nAnd then the learned trial judge repeated concisely all that need, as matter of law, be said on such a subject. I do not think that there is any reasonable ground for complaint or any need for a new trial.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. No doubt there is evidence pointing with little uncertainty to the conclusion that the unfortunate victim of the accident out of which the litigation arose did pass behind the car from which he alighted and went towards the parallel track where the car was advancing by which he was struck without looking ahead of him or taking any precaution to meet the risk of collision with vehicles on that side. It was a question for the jury whether that was or was not negligence which was the causa causans of the accident; on the other hand it was for the jury in passing upon that question to consider whether or not the gong was rung and whether or not the north bound car was, having regard to the circumstances and the locality, moving at an excessive speed. I am inclined to think that the concrete question on which the jury ought to have been asked to concentrate their attention was whether if they found the issue of reckless want of precaution on the part of the victim in favour of the company, and the issues touching the ringing of the gong and the speed of the car in favour of the plaintiff, the real cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury was the recklessness of the victim, or the negligence of the company in respect of speed and failure to give warning. Whether or not, in other words, notwithstanding the recklessness of the victim he would probably have been roused to attention if the motorman had exercised proper prudence in respect of speed and given due warning by sounding the gong. The trial judge seems rather to have directed the attention of the jury to a somewhat different question, namely, whether the victim was misled by the fact that the gong was not sounded into thinking that the line on that side was clear. That was no doubt a proper point for the jury to consider but I am inclined to think, having regard to the evidence as a whole, it was not the precise point of fact on which the jury ought to have considered the case to turn. That question was, I think, to adopt the language of Lord Cairns in Slattery\u2019s Case[5] at page 1167, whether the failure to sound the gong coupled with the excessive speed of the car on the one hand or, on the other hand, the want of reasonable care on the part of the deceased, was the causa causans of the accident.\nThese considerations, however, do not afford a sufficient ground for allowing the appeal. There was no misdirection, that is to say, there was no misstatement of the law; on the contrary the trial judge\u2019s statement of the law was accurate, and the trial judge was not asked to suggest to the jury that they should consider the case from the point of view of the above observations. The counsel for the company evidently preferred to have the jury consider the case from the point of view suggested in the charge of the trial judge.\nANGLIN J.\u2014W.L. Booth, the husband of the adult, and father of the infant plaintiffs, died as the result of injuries sustained by his being struck by a tramcar of the appellant company. At a second trial of this action, brought under the Fatal Accidents Act (R.S.O. c. 157) the plaintiffs recovered a verdict for $10,000 for the damages resulting to them and $1,600 to cover cost of nursing, medical attendance and hospital expenses. By a unanimous judgment a divisional court of the Appellate Division upheld this verdict as to the award of $10,000, but disallowed the item of $1,600 because not covered by the statute.\nThe defendants now appeal from this judgment. Mr. McCarthy, representing them, very frankly conceded that he could not hope successfully to attack the findings of negligence against his clients\u2014excessive speed of a tramcar and omission to sound its gong when approaching a crossing\u2014but he contended that the proximate cause of the injuries to the late W.L. Booth which resulted in his death was not any fault of theirs but his own recklessness and he also strongly urged that there had been misdirection on the issue of contributory negligence raised by the defence.\nOn alighting from a south bound car at the corner of Elgin and Slater Streets, in the City of Ottawa, Booth crossed immediately behind it and was struck by a north bound car, which the jury found was travelling at an excessive speed and without sounding the gong as prescribed by the company\u2019s rules. Failure to take reasonable precautions before stepping on to the eastern or north bound track after passing behind the street car was the negligence charged by the defendants against the deceased.\nThe misdirection alleged by counsel for the appellant consists in the omission of the learned Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division, who presided at the trial, to instruct the jury that if the deceased failed to look and listen before attempting to cross the eastern tracks he was negligent.\nThe learned judge had told the jury that\nit is not the law that you are bound to stop, look and listen before crossing a track on which there may be a train or car.\nCounsel for the plaintiffs suggests that this observation was elicited by some statement to the contrary made by counsel for the defendants in addressing the jury\u2014and that was not improbably the case. The learned judge immediately added\nYou must exercise reasonable care, and what would be care under one set of conditions, might not be care under another; so the test always is, where damage is sought to be recovered because of negligence in a railway accident, whether the plaintiff, under the circumstances of that particular case, was reasonably careful, was he acting as a man of ordinary prudence. Afterwards he practically told the jury that if the gong of the north bound car was ringing and, presumably, was heard by him, there would be no excuse for the deceased doing what he did, but added that they should ask themselves whether the omission to ring the gong, if they should find it had not been sounded, might be regarded by the deceased as an intimation that he might safely cross; and he concluded this part of his charge with these words\u2014\nI mention these matters for your consideration. You must determine questions of fact, and you have to ask yourselves, what would a reasonable man do under the circumstances; what interpretation would he place upon the fact that a warning was not given\u2014if that was the case? I am not saying there was not a warning given; but if there was no warning, what interpretation would a reasonable man place upon that circumstance?\nCounsel for the defendant took the following exception to the charge:\nI submit your Lordship should have told the jury, whether the gong was ringing or not if he attempted to cross the east track at that point without care, without looking or listening, he was acting imprudently.\nThe learned Chief Justice thereupon added this observation\u2014\nGentlemen of the Jury; Mr. McVeity wishes me to tell you whether the gong was ringing or not, it was the duty of the deceased to have exercised care in crossing the east\u2011bound track. The question of exercising care is a question of fact and you must say, assuming the gong was not rung, whether the deceased was acting reasonably in doing what he did. It is not a question of law whether he acted reasonably, it is a question of fact, and for you to determine. I cannot set up a standard, and the court cannot set up a standard of facts which become so rigid as to determine the law; it remains a question of fact always whether the party exercised reasonable care or did not.\nCounsel for the appellants urges that the refusal to state explicitly that it was the duty of the deceased to look and listen as the standard of care which the circumstances imposed upon him was misdirection in view of the explicit statement that it was not the law that a person about to cross a track on which there may be an approaching train or car is bound to stop, look and listen and the distinction which was drawn between the case where the gong is sounded and that where it is not rung.\nThere is no authority for the proposition that a duty to look and listen before crossing a railway or tramway track exists under all circumstances. No doubt ordinary prudence would dictate such a precaution unless there were something exceptional to warrant a belief that it was unnecessary or to excuse its not being taken. But the direction of the learned Chief Justice was strictly in accord with the law. The only standard is \u201creasonable care, having regard to all the circumstances.\u201d If under the circumstances the duty of taking reasonable care involved looking and listening before attempting to cross, the existence of that obligation was necessarily implied in the direction given. For aught that we know the jury may have found that the deceased did in fact both look and listen so far as reasonable care required him to do so and that he nevertheless was not negligent in attempting to cross possibly because he failed to realize the excessive speed at which the north bound car was approaching. Toronto Rly. Co. v. King[6] at page 269. We should not assume the contrary. Neither should it be taken for granted that he did not in fact both look and listen.\nThe whole duty of the deceased was involved in the statement that he was bound to exercise reasonable care having regard to all the circumstances. There was, in my opinion, no misdirection\u2014and certainly none of which it can be predicated that\nsome substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nthe condition of granting a new trial for misdirection imposed by section 28 (1) of the Ontario Judicature Act.\nWhether the deceased was or was not negligent under the circumstances is eminently a question for the jury. While, if trying the case upon the printed evidence now before us, I should strongly incline to think that contributory negligence had been established and should probably on that ground have dismissed the action, I am not prepared to hold that on the undisputed facts contributory negligence of the deceased is so clear that no reasonable jury could refuse to find it proven\u2014that the verdict negativing it unanimously accepted by the learned judges of the Appellate Divisional Court is so perverse and contributory negligence so indisputably shown that the trial judge erred in failing to take the case from the jury and dismiss the action. That conclusion would be involved in directing judgment for the defendants non obstante veredicto either on the ground of contributory negligence or on the ground that the only possible conclusion from the evidence as a whole is that the sole proximate cause of the injuries sustained by W.L. Booth, which resulted in his death, was his own recklessness.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The main ground of appeal which was argued is that there was misdirection by the trial judge in his charge. It is claimed that he has not properly expressed the law nor declared that a person crossing a street car line is obliged to stop, look and listen. The trial judge in his charge stated in most emphatic terms that this rule\u2014stop, look and listen\u2014was not the law of the country, and he said that when damages are claimed because of negligence in a railway accident the true rule is that a person must exercise reasonable care and what would be care under one set of conditions might not be care under another; so the test always is whether the plaintiff, under the circumstances of that case, was acting as a man of ordinary prudence.\nIn the present case the plaintiff was alighting from a south bound car on Elgin Street, in Ottawa, and having passed behind this car he tried to cross over the other track on which a car was running by which he was struck.\nIt is also claimed on the part of the company that the man was negligent because he should have looked and listened.\nOn the other hand, it was stated that the failure to sound the gong on the part of the railway company was the real cause of the accident.\nAfter the jury was charged, objection was made and it was stated that the jury should have been told that whether the gong was rung or not if the victim attempted to cross the track at that point without care, without looking or listening, he was negligent. His Lordship, the trial judge, in view of this objection, took up the question again and stated to the jury\nthe question of exercising care is a question of fact and you must say, assuming the gong was not rung, whether the deceased was acting reasonably in doing what he did.\nIt seems to me that after such a charge it cannot be contended that there was misdirection.\nAs to the question of contributory negligence that is a question of fact which the jury had a right to decide as they did.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014The argument of Mr. McCarthy for the appellant was chiefly directed to show that there had been misdirection by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury, but he also argued that the verdict that the decased was not guilty of contributory negligence was one which the jury could not reasonably find and should be disregarded and the plaintiff\u2019s action dismissed.\nThe alleged misdirection was in reference to the duty of reasonable care incumbent upon the deceased when, after alighting from the south-bound tramcar on the west side of Elgin Street, Ottawa, at its intersection with Slater Street, he attempted to cross the tracks on the east side of the street in order to continue east on Slater Street to the building occupied by the Militia Department, and was struck by a car of the appellant going north. The jury found as a fact that the gong of the north bound car had not teen sounded as the car approached Slater Street and that it was travelling at an excessive speed at the crossing. The learned trial judge gave in his charge the following instruction to the jury as to the duty of the deceased to exercise reasonable care:\nThen you come to question number three, as to the deceased man\u2019s conduct. If a man is walking upon the street and he sees a street car coming in a way that is negligent, it is his duty to avoid, if he can, the consequence of that negligence. The duty of the deceased was to exercise care when seeking to cross the easterly track; he should be reasonably on the lookout but the law has never said, and it is not the law, that your are bound to stop, look and listen before crossing a track upon which there may be a train or a car. You must exercise reasonable care, and what would be \u201ccare\u201d under one set of conditions, might not be \u201ccare\u201d under another; so the test always is, where damage is sought to be recovered because of negligence in a railway accident, whether the plaintiff, under the circumstances of that particular case, was reasonably careful, was he acting as a man of ordinary prudence? And further on the learned judge said:\nNow as to the alleged negligence of the decased man. Was it negligence on his part to have stepped into a point of possible danger, under the circumstances of this case? What would a reasonable man have done under the circumstances that you may find to have existed at that time? Suppose that the bell was ringing; was Booth exercising reasonable care, under the circumstances, in stepping in front of that car, or running against it, or however it happened. It would seem to have been a highly dangerous and imprudent act, if the gong was ringing, and if he heard it, or ought to have heard it; it would be running a terrible risk on his part with the sound of the gong so near at hand for him to go beyond the protection of the car that was moving away and step across the devil-strip in front of the approaching northbound car. If that gong was ringing what excuse had he for putting himself in that place of danger; doing what led to his death?\nIf the gong was not ringing, then what negligence was the deceased guilty of? If the gong was not ringing was that circumstance sufficient to tell him he might with safety cross those tracks; that there was no car coming? Is that the meaning to be attached to the non-ringing of the gong at a place where it ought to be rung? If the non-ringing of the gong, when it ought to be rung, is an invitation to cross, an intimation he might safely cross, then what negligence would the man be guilty of if, under those circumstances, he chooses to step across the tracks?\nCounsel for the defendant, after the charge, objected that the learned judge should have told the jury that whether the gong was ringing or not, if the deceased attempted to cross the east track at that point without care, without looking or listening, he was acting imprudently, and the learned trial judge again addressed the jury as follows:\nGentleman of the Jury. Mr. McVeity wishes me to tell you whether the gong was ringing or not, it was the duty of the deceased to have exercised care in crossing the east\u2011bound track. The question of exercising care is a question of fact and you must say, assuming the gong was not rung, whether the deceased was acting reasonably in doing what he did. It is not a question of law whether he acted reasonably, it is a question of fact, and for you to determine. I cannot set up a standard, and the court cannot set up a standard of facts which become so rigid as to determine the law; it remains a question of fact always whether the party exercised reasonable care or did not. Taking all these passages of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge, together with the one I will quote further on, I am of opinion that the jury was not misdirected. The trial judge told them that the deceased was bound to exercise reasonable care, that what would be care under one set of conditions might not be care under another, that the question was whether the deceased, under the circumstances of this particular case, was reasonably careful, or was acting as a man of ordinary prudence would have done.\nIn Toronto Railway Co. v. King[7], a case where a man driving across a street in front of an approaching tramcar was struck and killed, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee were of the opinion that the deceased was not clearly guilty of that \u201cfolly and recklessness\u201d causing his death to which Lord Cairns referred in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[8] at page 1166, and they add, page 269, the following observations which are very pertinent to the present case:\nIt is suggested that the deceased must have seen, or ought to have seen, the tramcar, and had no right to assume it would have been slowed down, or that its driver would have ascertained that there was no traffic with which it might come in contact before he proceeded to apply his power and cross the thoroughfare. But why not assume these things? It was the driver\u2019s duty to do them all, and traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less upon the assumption that the drivers of all the other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets. To cross in front of an approaching train, as was done by the deceased in Slattery\u2019s Case (3 App. Cas. 1155, at page 1166), is one thing; to cross in front of a tramcar bound to be driven under regulations such as those above quoted, at such a place as the junction to these two streets, is quite another thing. Mr. McCarthy referred us to the decision of the Judicial Committee in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McAlpine,[9] where their Lordships found that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the duty to exercise care incumbent on persons crossing a railway track, and their Lordships (speaking by Lord Atkinson as in the case of Toronto Railway Co. v. King[10] observed that the trial judge had not pointed out to the jury that it was necessary, in order that the plaintiff should recover, that the omission to whistle or to give the warning or both combined, and not the folly and recklessness of the plaintiff himself, caused the accident, and they add, page 846:\u2014\nFor all that appears, the omission to whistle might not have contributed in any way to the happening of the accident. The jury, instructed as they were, may well have been under the impression that the two alleged breaches by the company of its statutory duties\u2014the two faults of which the jury found them guilty\u2014rendered them liable whether or not those faults caused to any extent the injury to the plaintiff or the contrary.\nHere the learned trial judge, after his charge, acceding to an objection made by counsel on behalf of the defendant that if the jury found the defendant guilty of negligence they should consider whether that negligence has caused the accident, stated to the jury as follows:\nGentlemen of the Jury: Mr. McVeity is quite right in the point he has taken. I thought I made it pretty clear but no doubt omitted to do so. Speaking of acts of negligence, I have all along had it in my mind, and referred to acts of negligence which caused this accident. The defendants are only liable for such negligent acts as caused the accident; so when I say if you find that the defendants omitted to ring the gong, or the north-bound car was going at too high a speed, you will only answer \u201cYes\u201d to question number one if you think that either of those acts of negligence caused the accident. I must therefore conclude that the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, measured by the test laid down by the Judicial Committee in both these cases, was a proper one and in effect left to the jury to decide, and it was eminently a question for them to determine, whether it was the negligence of the defendant or the folly and recklessness of the deceased which brought about the accident.\nOn the question whether the jury could reasonably find that the deceased was not guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident, while if I had to decide that question on my view of the evidence I would experience very great difficulty in arriving at the same conclusions as the jury, still this was a question for the jury to decide, and having held that they were properly directed by the learned trial judge, I cannot say that their finding is so perverse and unreasonable that it should be disregarded and judgment entered for the defendant.\nI think therefore that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Taylor McVeity.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fripp & Magee.\n[1] 38 Can.
