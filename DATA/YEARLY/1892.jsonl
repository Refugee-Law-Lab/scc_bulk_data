The evidence at the trial showed that the machine had been used for some time in connection with building cars, and evidence for defendant went to prove that the work was under the control of a contractor with defendant; that before the machine could be used a fan had to be attached to keep off the dust; that it spoiled the boards on which it was used; and that the contractor did not inform the defendant as to the defects and he knew nothing of them until the case came on for trial. It appeared, however, that the general superintendent of defendant's business watched the progress of the work in which the machine was used and inspected all the cars before they were delivered. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs and a new trial was refused, the court holding that the defendant must be held to be affected with the contractor's knowledge or, at all events, that the superintendent was in a position to know if the machine did not work properly.\nThe Supreme Court held, after hearing counsel for the appellant and without calling upon respondent's counsel, that the new trial was properly refused.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nMcLeod Q.C. for the appellant.\nAlward Q.C. for the respondent.\n"}

Ritchie C.J., and Strong Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR LOWER CANADA.\nElection petition\u2014Status of Petitioner\u2014Onus probandi.\nThe election petition was served upon the appellant on the 12th of May, 1891, and on the 16th of May the appellant filed preliminary objections, the first being as to the status of the petitioners. When the parties were heard upon the merits of the preliminary objections no evidence was given as to the status of the petitioners and the court dismissed the objections. On appeal to the Supreme Court:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below (Gwynee J. dissenting), that the onus was on the petitioners to prove their status as voters. The Stanstead Case (20 Can. SCR 12) followed\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada (Pelletier J.) dismissing the preliminary objections to the election petition filed against the appellant by the respondents.\nThe first preliminary objection was as to the status of the petitioners and read as follows:\u2014\nB Because the said petitioners and none of them are nor were at the lime of the election in question in this cause electors qualified to vote at said election, and that their names were not inscribed on the electoral lists.\"\nAt the hearing of the preliminary objections no evidence was tende red as to the status of the petitioners The appellant appeared in person and Belleau Q.C. appeared for respondent.\nThe appellant contended that this case ought to be governed by the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Stanstead Case ([1]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C J. The burden of proof was on the petitioner, and I am not prepared to reverse the judgment of this court in the Stanstead Case (1), and unless we do so this appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J. Following the Stanstead Case (1), we are bound to hold that the objection taken on this appeal is Good; that the onus was on the petitioner who was bound to prove his qualification; that not having done so the judge ought to have dismissed the petition and we must give the same judgment which he ought to have given. Therefore the appeal must be allowed and the petition dismissed with costs in all the courts.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred with Sir W. J. Ritchie C J\nGWYNEE J.1 am not satisfied that this case comes within the Stanstead Case (1). Of course although I differed from the judgment of the court in the Stanstead Case (1) I am bound by it but here as I understand the case the preliminary objection is that the petitioners were not entitled to vote and were not on the electoral list This was not the form of the preliminary, objection in the Stanstead Case (1), and I think the judgment in that case should be limited to cases identical. If the petitioners were not on the list, as the respondent alleged that issue in my opinion was upon the person making the averment. PATTERSON J,\u2014I think, irrespective of what was done or omitted to be done by the learned judge that under the statute it is perfectly clear that the status -of the petitioner can only be contested by a preliminary objection, and can never form an issue at the trial p Looking at the statute I think that appears very distinctly. The operation of the statute runs in this way. It provides by one section that the person complaining of an undue election may present a petition setting forth certain things, enumerating things which the petitioner may allege as grounds for avoiding the election. It goes on to state that notice of the petition must be served on the respondent within a prescribed time and then there is the further provision that certain preliminary objections may be taken including, in express terms, the status of the petitioner.\nThose are preliminary objections. Preliminary to what? That appears by the following section:\n13. Within five days after the decision upon the preliminary objections if presented and not allowed, or on the expiration of the time for presenting the same if none are presented, the respondent may file a written answer to the petition; hut whether such answer is or is not filed, the petition shall be held to be at issue after the expiration of' the said five days.\nThen what are the issues s They are the matters of complaint mentioned in section 5: An undue return or undue election of a member * or no return; or a double return; or any unlawful act by any candidate not returned, by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons, at any election.\nThe preliminary objections are objections which are preliminary to the necessity for putting in an answer; it is not until they are disposed of that the answer is to be put in. I take it that where section 12 allows the respondent to file a preliminary objection \" to the petitioner,\" it must mean that such objection is the subject of preliminary objection only, and is not one of the matters to be put in issue and heard on the trial of the petition.\nAppeal allowed with costs and petition dismissed.\nSolicitors for appellant : Amyot & Pinault.\nSolicitors for respondents : Belleau, Stafford & Belleau.\n[1] 20 Can.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR LOWER CANADA, DISTRICT OF MONTREAL.\nElection petition\u2014Preliminary examination of respondent\u2014Order to postpone until after session\u2014Effect of\u2014Six months' limit\u2014R.S.G. ch. 9 secs. 14 and 32.\nOn the 23rd April, 1891, after the petition in this case was at issue, the petitioners moved to have the respondent examined prior to the trial so that he might use the deposition upon the trial. The respondent moved to postpone such examination until after the session on the ground that being attorney in his own case it would not \"be possible for him to appear, answer the interrogatories and to attend to the case in which his presence was necessary before the closing of the session.\" This motion was supported by an affidavit of the respondent stating that it would be \" absolutely necessary for him to be constantly in court to attend to the present election petition \" aid that it was not possible e for him to attend to the present case for which his presence is necessary before the closing of the session, \" and the court ordered the respondent not to appear until after the session of Parliament. Immediately after the session was over, on the 1st October, 1891, an application was made to fix a day for the trial, and it was fixed for the 10th of December, 1891, and the respondent was examined in the interval. On the 10th of December the respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the trial had not commended within six months following the filing of the petition and the objection was maintained.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the order was in effect an enlargement of the time for the commencement of the trial until after the session of Parliament and therefore in the computation of time for the commencement of the trial the time occupied by the session of Parliament should not be included. R.S.C. ch. 9. sec. 32.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada (Bourgeois and Mathieu JJ.) dismissing the election petition in this case on the ground that the trial had not been commenced within six months from the time when such petition had been presented.\nThe petition was presented on the 16th April 1891, and the trial was fixed for the 10th December 1891 by order of Mr. Justice De Lorimier.\nOn the 21st of April, 1891, the respondent appeared personally and filed an election of domicile at his office 25 St. Gabriel Street, Montreal, and filed also a plea, in which he denied all the allegations of said petition.\nOn the 23rd of April, 1891, upon an application made by appellant the Honourable Mr. Justice Wurtele granted an order to examine the respondent on the 27th of the same month under the authority of section 14 of the Controverted Elections Act.\nOn the 27thof April 1891, the respondent presented to the Hon. Mr. Justice Wurtele the following motion:\n\"Whereas the session of Parliament is to be opened on Wednesday, the twenty-ninth of April instant at Ottawa, P.O.;\n\u201cWhereas he must leave to-morrow to go to Ottawa where he is called by his duties as a member of Parliament:\n\u201cWhereas he has not too much time to-day to prepare himself for his departure, and to attend to things which are absolutely necessary for such departure; \"Whereas it is impossible for him to appear before this honourable court, and to answer to the interrogatories which are to be put to him for the present without preventing the fulfilment of his duties as a member of the House of Commons:\n\u201cWhereas it is impossible for him to get ready for said session of Parliament and to fulfil its duties and to attend to the present case at the same time;\n\u201cWhereas he is himself the defendant's attorney;\n\u201cWhereas it is absolutely necessary for him to be constantly in court to attend to the present election petition;\n\u201cWhereas it shall not be possible for him to appear in answer to the interrogatories, and to attend to the present case in which his presence is necessary before the closing of said session;\n\u201cWhereas the notice of said interrogatories is irregular because it was served last Friday only, and that the hours of Sunday do not count when they serve to complete the delay;\n\"That the defendant should not be forced to appear before the closing of said session of Parliament.\"\nThat motion was supported by the following affidavit:\n\u201cThe said Louis Conrad Pelletier the defendant in this case being duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists depose and saith:\n\u201cThat the session of Parliament is to be opened on Wednesday, the twenty-ninth of April instant at Ottawa, P.O.\n\u201cThat he must leave to-morrow to go to Ottawa where he is called by his duties as a member of Parliament;\n\u201cThat he has not too much time to-day to prepare himself for his departure and to attend to things which are absolutely necessary for such departure; \u201cThat it is impossible for him to appear before this honourable court, and to answer to the interrogatories which are to be put to him for the present, without preventing the fulfilment of his duties as a member of the House of Commons\n\u201cThat it is impossible for him to get ready for said session of Parliament and to fulfil its duties and to attend to the present case at the same time;\n\u201cThat he is himself the defendant's attorney;\n\u201cThat it is absolutely necessary for him to be constantly in court to attend to the present election petition;\n\u201cThat it shall not be possible for him to appear, answer to the interrogatories, and to attend to the present case for which his presence is necessary before the closing of said session; and has signed.\"\nWhen that motion was presented the Honourable Mr. Justice Wurtele granted it generally.\nThe order signed by the judge is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cHaving heard the parties by their counsel on the respondent's motion asking not to be forced to appear and answer to interrogatories until after the session which commences on the twenty-ninth of April instant, having examined the procedure and deliberated, I, the undersigned order the said respondent not to appear until alter the said session of Parliament. Costs reserved.\n(Signed)\n\"J. WURTELE,\n\"J. C. S.\"\nOn the 1st of October, 1891, an application was made to the court to fix a day for trial, and it was fixed for the 10th December. The session of Parliament opened on the 27th April, and was prorogued on the 30th September\nMr disquette for appellant. On the 10th December the trial commenced but before the first witness was examined the respondent filed an objection to the jurisdiction of tie court and asked that the petition be dismissed because the trial had not commenced during the six months following the filing of the petition. The petition in this case was filed on the 16th April and was served on the same day.\nThis case comes within the exception contained in section 82 of the Dominion Controverted Election Act. The respondent appeared personally on the 21st April and filed an election of domicile at his office, 25, St. Gabriel Street, Montreal, and filed also a plea in which he denied all the allegations of the petition, and two days afterwards the appellant made an application to a judge in chambers for an order to examine the respondent under sec. 14 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act. This was two days after the petition was at issue.\nThe application to examine the respondent on the 27th April was granted, and on the same day a motion was made by the respondent which reads as follows: (The counsel then read the motion, ubi supra.)\nIt is upon this motion and the judgment rendered on it that the present appeal depends. It is important to consider attentively the motion and the affidavit of respondent in support of the motion and which is as follows: (The counsel then read the affidavit\u2014ubi supra.)\nFrom the evidence and the record in this case I submit it was shown conclusively to the court within the meaning of section 32 that the presence of the respondent at the trial was necessary and therefore the time occupied by the session should not be computed.\n(The Chief Justice.\u2014We would like to hear the counsel for the respondent.)\nMr. Lajoie for respondent: This case hinges upon the interpretation to be given to the judgment of Mr. Justice Wurtele. Unfortunately we have only a translation of it. In this case we rely upon the judgment of this court in the Glengarry case. There is no order of the court or evidence that the presence of the respondent was necessary at the trial. The application made by appellant was under sec. 14 for the preliminary examination of the respondent, a preliminary proceeding before the date of the trial independent of the trial, and I submit that the appellant had notwithstanding this order a perfect right to commence the trial during the session; and if he had applied for an order to fix the date of the trial, then the respondent might have moved for an order of enlargement under sec. 33 or sec. 32. I admit that he was not bound to go on, but he should have obtained the order of the court postponing the trial under secs. 32 and 33, notwithstanding the order postponing the preliminary examination.\n(TASCHEREAU J.\u2014The order in effect says that the examination preliminary to the trial shall not take place until after the session, and consequently that the trial shall be postponed until after the session.)\n(The Chief Justice.\u2014The moment the preliminary examination is postponed, ex necessitate the trial is postponed.)\nThere was no order saying the trial should not be commenced.\n(STRONG J.\u2014Suppose the court, upon the application of the respondent, gave time to put in an answer, and it is put in as directed but not within the six months, could the respondent then turn round and say the court has no jurisdiction? The postponement here has been at the instance and for the benefit of the respondent, and he now asks us to help him to evade the trial?) The appellant must come within the literal terms of the statute. See p. 459, 14 Can. SCR. Glengarry case. He should have obtained an enlargement.\n(STRONG J.\u2014Tie party who obtained this order was estopped from raising such objection, for if the appellant had given notice of trial he would have been met with this order.)\n(GWYNNE J.\u2014There is nothing in the statute showing the necessity of an order being taken out under sec. 32?)\nAccording to my reading of the decision of this court in the Glengarry Case ([1]), the appellant should have obtained a, formal order of enlargement under section 33\nThe court did not call upon the counsel for appellant to reply, but delivered judgment at once.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J. We have not the slightest doubt about this case The respondent made an affidavit in support of his motion that i it was not possible for him to appear to answer to the interrogatories (which the appellant had the right under the statute to put to him prior to the trial and to attend to the present case for which his presence was necessary before the closing of the session \" Then there was an order of the judge postponing the preliminary examination of the respondent until after the session of Parliament. The judge in my opinion was quite right in making the order, but now the respondent wishes us to hold that having obtained an order preventing the petitioner from proceeding during the session on a preliminary examination,\u2014preliminary to what? to the trial,\u2014 he, the petitioner, was still bound to go on with the trial during the session. The facts in the Glengarry Case ( I ) are quite different and the decision in that case has no applicability to the present. There i can, I think, be no doubt that this appeal should be allowed and the case sent hack in order that the trial should be proceeded with.\nSTRONG J.\u2014 Under section 32 what is necessary to be shown is that it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary, and that if the judge so considers then such trial shall not be commenced during any session of Parliament, and in the computation of any time or delay allowed for any step or proceeding in respect of the trial or for the commencement thereof, the time occupied by the session of Parliament shall not count. Then the respondent by his affidavit, shows that his presence was necessary at the trial because he distinctly swore that it was absolutely necessary for him to be constantly in court to attend to the present election petition, which would render it impossible for him to fulfil his duties as a member of the House of Commons, and he asked that he he not obliged to submit to examination, until after the session. Thereupon this preliminary examination was by an order of the court postponed until after the session. Now unless we can say that by that order the judge intended that the petitioner should be deprived of the statutory right of a preliminary examination of the respondent, it is a necessary inference that it appeared to him when he granted the order that the respondent's presence at the trial was necessary.\nI think there can be no doubt that the decision of the court below was wrong and that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. GWYNNE J.\u2014I think the order made by the judge might have been more accurately drawn up, yet the order shows that, in the opinion of the judge the presence of the respondent at the trial was necessary.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The respondent is not in a position to complain even if no order was made. It seems that on the 23rd April, 1891 an order was made for the preliminary examination of the respondent and upon the 27th April he made an affidavit in support of a motion to postpone his examination in which he stated that it was absolutely necessary for him to be constantly in court to attend to the present election petition, and that; it would not be possible for him to appear to answer the interrogatories, and to attend to the present case in which his presence was necessary, before the closing of the session.\nNow, looking at section 32, it enacts that if at any time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is necessary such trial shall not be commenced during any session of Parliament. There is nothing said about an order. In this case, admitting that no order was made, the respondent swore that his presence was necessary. He cannot now say the trial should have been \"proceeded with. He comes literally within the operation of the section, having made it appear that his presence was necessary at the trial. I am of opinion that under the circumstances of this case the time occupied by the session of Parliament should not be included in the computation of the delay for the commencement of the trial, and therefore that this appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Mercier, Beausoleil, Choquelte & Matineau.\nSolicitors for respondent : Bisaillon, Brosseau & Lajoie.\n[1] 14 Can.

C. ch. 9 ss. 12 and 13.\nAppeal from the judgment rendered on the 15th day of December, 1891, by the Honourable Justices Falconbridge and Street, maintaining the election petition filed against the return of the appellant and voiding the appellant's election as member for the House of Commons for the electoral district of Prescott.\nThe petition was filed in the Court of Appeal for Ontario on the 20th April, 1891.\nOn the 25th April a preliminary objection to the petition was delivered and filed on behalf of the respondent in the court below, in the words following:\u2014\n1. \"The petitioners were not, nor was either of them, duly qualified to vote at the said election, whereby they are, and each of them is, incapable of being petitioners; wherefore the said respondent, as a preliminary objection to the said petition, and before he can be compelled to answer the same, objects and demurs to the same as aforesaid, and prays judgment on the said objection, and that the said petition may be quashed and dismissed and no further proceedings may be allowed to be taken on the same.\"\nOn the 26th May notice was given and served on the appellant, of a motion to be made before the Honourable Mr. Justice McLennan, a judge of the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the petitioners in the court below, to set aside or dispose of the preliminary objection.\nIn support of that application there were filed the affidavits of the petitioners and the copies of the voters' lists for the polling districts in which the petitioners were voters, duly certified by the revising officer for the electoral district of the county of Prescott.\nNo affidavit or other evidence was filed or offered for argument.\nMr. Justice McLennan after hearing the parties on the said motion on the 6th June last, made the order setting aside and ordering to be taken off the files the said objection with costs to the petitioners in any event as follows: \"Upon reading the petition herein, the said preliminary objections, the affidavits of the petitioners respectively and the exhibits therein referred to, and upon hearing counsel for all parties and counsel for the respondent admitting that the matters and charges contained in the said preliminary objections cannot properly be disposed of on a summary hearing of preliminary objections:\n\"It is ordered that the said preliminary objections and the presentation and filing thereof be and the same are hereby set aside and ordered to be taken off the files of this court without prejudice to the right of the said respondent if so advised to raise the matters and charges contained in the said preliminary objections at the trial of the petition herein.\n\"It is further ordered that the costs of the said preliminary objections and of this motion be costs in the cause to the petitioners to be paid to them by the respondent in any event of the petition.\"\nUnder the general order made pursuant to sec. 2 of the act of 1887, chap. 7, for distribution of election petition for trial, this petition was assigned to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for trial.\nThe appellant filed an answer to the petition, and the petition being at issue, an order was made on 26th September by the Honourable Justices Falconbridge and Street, judges of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, fixing the 15th of October for the trial of the petition.\nAt the trial the counsel for the respondent renewed his objection as to the status of the petitioners, and after hearing counsel the court ruled that as the preliminary objections had been taken off the files of the court by order of Mr. Justice McLennan, there was an end of the matter and that it was not the duty of the petitioner at the trial of an election to prove his status, and after the trial the election was declared void by reason of corrupt acts by agents of the appellant.\nThe appellant thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBelcourt for appellant cited and relied on R.S.C. ch. 9, sec. 35 and subs. 12 of sec. 2, Rule 37 General Election Rules for Ontario; Rule 531 Cons. Rules for Ontario; Bigelow on Estoppel[1]. The Stanstead Case[2]. The L'Assomption Case[3], and the Quebec County Case[4].\nFerguson Q.C. for respondent contended that the trial judges ruled properly in regard to this question of the status of the petitioners, that it was not open for trial before the trial judges and that it had been disposed of by the order dismissing the preliminary objections, and cited and relied on The Charlevoix Case[5], the judgments of the Honourable the Chief Justice, and of the Honourable Mr. Justice Strong[6].\nThe Megantic Case[7]. The judgments of the Honourable the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Taschereau and Mr. Justice Gwynne. The Youghal Case[8].\nThe Glengarry Case[9], judgment of the Hon. Mr. Justice Gwynne,\nThe Stanstead Case (2), judgments of the Hon. Mr. Justice Gwynne and Mr. Justice Patterson.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014We do not desire to hear the respondent's counsel in this case. We have heard the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant who has said all that could be said in the matter, but really, I think, there was nothing for him to say. There has been a full adjudication upon this matter. The objection came at the proper time before Mr. Justice McLennan and the affidavits showed that the petitioner was on the list and duly qualified to vote. Whether that was so or not is not material. The judge read the affidavits and after hearing both sides he adjudged that the preliminary objections should be dismissed, and further that they should be taken off the files of the court. The counsel for the sitting member acquiesced in that decision and took no exception to the ruling. Then, because the learned judge has chosen to attach to his judgment a permission, or whatever it may be called, to the parties to bring the question up on the trial, though the statute says it must be dealt with as a preliminary objection, it is claimed that the trial judges have jurisdiction to deal with it and there is an appeal from their decision. That cannot be so. The statute is clear and there has ceased to exist in this case any preliminary objections as they have been dismissed and taken off the files of the court.\nUnder these circumstances, I think there is nothing for us to do but to dismiss this appeal with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appellant insists that at the trial of this petition the learned judges in refusing to entertain his objection that the petitioner was not qualified to maintain the petition for the reason that he had not the status of an elector, ruled erroneously.\nSuch a point must be taken by way of preliminary objection. It was so taken in the present case, but the preliminary objection was ordered to be taken off the file by a judge having undoubted jurisdiction to make that order. Therefore the learned judges at the trial, having no preliminary objection before them, could not do otherwise than they did in refusing to adjudicate upon the objection to the petitioner's status.\nFurther, Mr. Justice McLennan having dealt with the preliminary objection by ordering it to be taken off the file could not confer any larger jurisdiction than the statute itself conferred on the trial judges by delegating to them the decision of a question raised by the objections which had been set aside and ordered to be taken off the files.\nI will not express any decided opinion as to the right generally of the judges at the trial of an election petition to decide preliminary objections. The words of section 12 are \"the court or judge shall hear the parties\" on such objections, and by section 2, subsection (k) \"the judge\" is interpreted as meaning the judge trying the election petition. It would, however, certainly seem from the expression \"preliminary objection\" that a question so raised was intended to be decided in some proceeding anterior to the trial. Moreover, unless this construction were adopted the object for which certain objections are required to be taken in this preliminary form would not be attained.\nAlthough under the circumstances of this case it is not necessary to decide the point I incline to think that, notwithstanding the interpretation clause, the context indicates that by \"judge\" in section 12 is meant not the judge at the trial, but a judge who shall adjudicate previously to the trial, that is a judge of the court in which the petition is filed, sitting in Chambers. If this is the proper construction it follows that the judges at the trial have no jurisdiction to deal with preliminary objections at all. The Youghal Case[10] cited by Mr. Ferguson, though deciding nothing positively, favours this view.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entertain not the slightest doubt that the course pursued by the learned judges at the trial of this cause was the only course that under the circumstances appearing, they could have legally pursued and that they would have erred if they had entertained as matter before them at the trial upon the merits, the matter which had been raised by preliminary objection to the status of the petitioner.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I have nothing to add to what I have said to-day in the Bellechasse Case[11], and what I said in the Stanstead Case[12].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: N.

J. Ritchie C. J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynee and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAction for call of $1,000\u2014Future rights\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act sec. 29 subsec. (b.)\nThe company sued the defendant B. for $1,000, being a call of ten per cent on 100 share's of $100 each alleged to have been subscribed by B. il the capital stock of the company, and prayed that the defendant be condemned to pay the said sum of $1000 with costs. The defendant denied any liability and prayed for the dismissal of the action\nDuring the pendency of the suit, the company's business was ordered to be wound up under the Winding-up Act, 45 Vie. ch. 23 (D.), and the liquidator was authorized to continue the suit. The Superior Court condemned the defendant to pay the amount claimed but on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) the action of the plaintiff company was dismissed. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the appeal would not lie, the amount in controversy being under $2,000 and there being no future rights as specified in subsec. (6.) of sec. 29 c. 135 R. S. C, which might be bound by the judgment. Gilbert v. Gilman (16 Can. S.C.R. 189) followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe suit was brought by the company plaintiff against defendant Alfred Brown to recover the sum of one thousand dollars being a call of ten per cent on one hundred shares of one hundred dollars each which plaintiff alleged Brown subscribed in the capital stock of the company.\nThe declaration set out the undertaking which Brown signed and that one hundred shares were allotted to Alfred Brown and that a call of ten per cent was made on the second of November, 1881, of which he was notified but which he failed and neglected to pay, and prayed for a condemnation to the extent of one thousand dollars against said defendant.\nDefendant pleaded, denying any liability as a share-holder in the company plaintiff, &c.\nDuring the pendency of the suit Alfred Brown died and the instance was taken up by the present respondents.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court condemned the respondents to pay the amount claimed by the suit, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench and the action dismissed.\nGOLDSTEIN for appellant\u2014\nBy his pleas the respondent has denied his liability for any part of his subscription of $10,000 to the capital stock of the company, and therefore the amount in controversy between the parties is over $2,000; in any case the decision in this case would in effect be res judicata between the parties as to any future call, and therefore the case was appealable under sec. 29 lb.) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nS. H. BLAKE Q.C. for respondent was not called upon, and the court proceeded to deliver judgment.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J - In this case I am obliged to follow the judgment I delivered in the case of Gilbert v. Gilman ([1]), where the same argument was urged before us in support of the jurisdiction. In this case the only amount claimed, is $1,000 a sum not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction. If hereafter a case should arise on other calls on this subscription in which the amount in controversy is two thousand dollars, and the judgment is against the appellant, then as this court would have jurisdiction, he could come before this court and we should not be bound by the decision of an inferior tribunal.\nAs in this case it does not appear that the objection to the jurisdiction was taken in the -respondent's factum, or by motion, the appeal will be quashed hut without costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be quashed. This case comes under the provision of the statute which requires that the amount in controversy on an appeal to this court should be $2,000. Here the amount in controversy is only $1,000 and this is ascertained by the conclusion of the declaration The plaintiff does not claim and could not get judgment for more than $1,000, and all the defendant is defending himself against is this claim of $1,000. Then does this case involve the question of future rights, so as to give appellant a right of appeal l For the reasons stated in Gilbert v. Gilman ([2]) I am of opinion that it does not. The exceptions in the statute are of certain specified future rights mentioned in sub-sec. (b.) of sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and do not include such claims as are contended to be future rights in this case, as future liability for calls on shares. The appeal should be quashed without costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree. GWYNNE J.\u2014With great deference, this case is appealable; The amount in controversy although but one call of the $100000 alleged to have been subscribed, is in my opinion nothing less than the whole amount of stock in respect of which the call sued for is made. The defence is, and the judgment has held, that no subscription for stock ever was made which imposed any liability whatever upon the person who subscribed his name for the stock whom the defendant represents. That judgment in my opinion can be relied upon as res judicata to the effect that no liability in respect of the $100000 ever accrued and would be a complete answer to any action for any future call. The case is in my opinion quite distinguishable from every case in which this court has held that no appeal lay.\nPatterson J. I do not dissent from the majority of the court. When there is a debt asserted for say $10,000 payable by instalments of $1,000 each\u2014debilum in presenti, solvendum futuro\u2014and an action to recover one instalment is defended on grounds that involve the liability for the whole debt the amount in controversy in the action, and on an appeal would be, in my opinion, the $10,000 and not merely the $1,000 instalment. The judgment in the action would be conclusive of the liability in any action for other instalments. On the same principle I should hold that in an action by a joint stock company for calls amounting to less than $2,000 upon stock subscribed exceeding that amount the full amount of the subscription, and not merely that of the particular calls, would be in controversy upon a defence going to the whole liability, such for example as that the subscription had been procured by fraud. But the present claim is by the liquidator of a company which is being wound up, and it does not appear that as between him and the defendant there is any claim beyond the amount sought to be recovered in this action notwithstanding that the defendant might have been liable to the company, if it had maintained itself as a going concern, for the amount of $10,000 for which his name appears in the stock book I am, therefore, not prepared to say that the matter in controversy in this appeal amounts to the sum or value of $2,000.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Carter &c Goldstein.\nSolicitors for respondent : Lacoste, Bisaillon, Brosseau & Lajoie.\n[1] 16 Can S C.

C.\nThe parties to a gift inter vivos of certain real estate with warranty by the donor did not register it, but by a subsequent deed which was registered changed its nature from an apparently gratuitous dona\u00adtion to a deed of giving in payment (dation en paiement).\nIn an action brought by the testamentary executors of the donor to set aside the donation for want of registration:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the forfeiture under art. 806 C. C. resulting from neglect to register applies only to gratuitous donations, and as the deed in this case was in effect the giving of a thing in payment (dation en paiement) with war\u00adranty, which under article 1592 is equivalent to sale, the testa\u00admentary executors of the donor had no right of action against the donee based on the absence of registration of the original deed of gift inter vivos\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada district of Montreal.\nThe appellants as executors and administrators of the estate of the Hon. Chas. Wilson brought an action against the respondents to have a certain deed of donation executed on the 7th of July, 1872 before Norman-dean, N.P., by which the donor gave and made over to the respondent Anna Maria Wilson the usufruct and. enjoyment of certain immovable property in Montreal, with a clause of substitution in favour of the children of the donee set aside and. declared null and. void for want of registration.\nTo this action the respondent pleaded that by a subsequent deed of renunciation on 26th June, 1875, executed before Normandeau, N.P., the respondent Anna Wilson gave the Hon. Chas Wilson a final receipt and acquittance of $2,000 and interest which Was due to her by the said Hon. Chas. Wilson by virtue of her marriage contract dated 4th July, 1859, declaring that the receipt was given in consideration of the donation above mentioned and that this donation was thereby changed in its nature from a gratuitous donation into a contract of giving in payment (dation en paiement) which deed was registered; and also a plea of compensation by moneys due to her under the will. The parties agreed to submit the case on the merits, viz. whether on the documentary evidence filed in the case the plaintiffs were entitled to succeed.\nLajoie for appellant relied on the following points of argument:\u2014\n1st. Article 806 of the Civil Code applies to all donations and not only to those which are gratuitous or remuneratory. Pothier, Donations ([2]); Laurent ([3]); Dalloz. vo. Dispositions entre vif ([4]).\n2nd. The donation of the seventh of June 1872 was not converted into a contract of giving in payment. Championni\u00e8re & Rigaud ([5]).\n3rd. The registration of the deed of renunciation of the 26th of July, 1875, does not meet the requirements of the law concerning the registration of donations. Pothier, Donations ([6]); Merlin, Vo. Donation ([7]).\n4th. Respondent has not the right to demand interest on the sum of $ 1,800-which she claims was due her for interest on the 26th of July, 1875.\n5th. Respondent has not shown that she had any right to a larger sum than that which she admits was paid her by appellants for her under legacy the will of the Hon. Chs. Wilson * arts. 760 1069 C.C.; Dalloz ([8]).\n6th. Appellants have shown that they have a sufficient interest to bring the present action.\nGeoffrion Q.C. relied on the following propositions in support of the judgment appealed from:\u2014 1st. That the deed of the 7th June 1872, was a donation under an onerous title and did not require enregistration to render it valid.\n2nd. That the enregistration- of the deed of the 26th July 1875 covered the default of enregistration of the first deed of donation; and\n3rd. That if this donation is not held to be a donation under onerous title then it becomes by the deed of the 26th July, 1875, a giving in payment, dation en paiement, a sale, and as between the parties it was made with warranty; even if not registered it was a valid transaction and could not be set aside by the testamentary executors of the person giving.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J. \u2014The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in this case seems to me entirely reasonable. I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.I am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons to be given by my brother Taschereau.

Plus la somme de $5000 par ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter de la mort de Madame Wilson le 7 f\u00e9vrier 1879, faisant un total de $37,500 sur lequel elle n'a re\u00e7u que $31,500, laissant une balance de $6,000 qui, ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la balance cidessus, forme la somme de $7,274.64.\nL'intim\u00e9e a aussi fait un plaidoyer r\u00e9clamant les d\u00e9penses et am\u00e9liorations faites sur l'immeuble donn\u00e9 ce plaidoyer a \u00e8t\u00e8 r\u00e8serv\u00e8 du consentement des parties pour n'y \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement que dans le cas o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e serait condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 donner l\u2019immeuble r\u00e9clame pour \u00eatre alors r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e e des experts.\nLes pr\u00e9tentions, des appelants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admises par le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par celui de la cour du Banc de la Reine dont ii v a pr\u00e9sentement appel a cette cour.\nLa question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir quel doit \u00eatre l'effet de l'acte du 26 juillet 1875 sur la donation du 7 juin 1872. A-t-il pu rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement de cette donation et ne comporte-t-il pas en lui-m\u00eame une confirmation de la dite donation et n'est-il pas dans tous les cas une dation en paiement du m\u00eame immeuble par le dit Chs. Wilson \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle il devait la somme de $3,800 en vertu du contrat de mariage de cette derni\u00e9re? Il est vrai que la donation entre vifs devient nulle faute d'enregistrement du vivant du donateur. Mais pendant la vie de celui-ci, n'\u00e9tait-il pas libre aux parties de changer la nature de l'acte du 7 janvier 1872? En apparence c'\u00e9tait une donation gratuite, mais les parties qui \u00e9taient alors toutes en \u00e9tat de contracter librement n'avaient-elles pas le droit d'annuler on de modifier cette donation qui \u00e9tait encore dans toute sa force quoique non enregistr\u00e9e, et d'en faire un tout autre acte? C'est ce qu'elles out fait par l'acte du 26 juillet 1875.\nComme on l'a vu plus haut par la citation d'un extrait du dit acte du 26 juillet 1875, le dit honorable Chs. Wilson se reconnaissait d\u00e9biteur de l'intim\u00e9e pour la somme de $2000 qu'il avait promis lui payer par son contrat de mariage du 4 juillet 1879. Ladite somme se montait alors avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 $3,800.\nLes dites parties d\u00e9claraient et reconnaissaient en m\u00eame temps par le dit acte et par la donation faite devant Normandeau, N. P., le 7 juin 1872, que le dit Chs Wilson avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite intim\u00e9e un montant beaucoup plus consid\u00e9rable que celui de la r\u00e9clamation qu'elle avait contre lui en vertu de son contrat de mariage et qu'en cons\u00e9quence de cette donation la dite intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait convenue d'acquitter le dit Chs. Wilson de la somme qu'il lui devait par son contrat de mariage. En cons\u00e9quence, avec l'autorisation de son mari, la dite intim\u00e9e renon\u00e7a, tant pour elle-m\u00eame que pour ses enfants qui pourraient na\u00eetre de son mariage, \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation de $2000 qu'elle avait contre le dit Chs. Wilson, par son contrat de mariage, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat. \u00e9chu.\nIl r\u00e9sulte clairement de cette citation que l'intention du testateur, an temps de la donation, \u00e9tait d'obtenir une d\u00e9charge de l'obligation de payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e les $3800 qu'il lui devait par son contrat de mariage. Cette d\u00e9claration des parties est une preuve suffisante de leur intention de faire une donation on\u00e9reuse. Rien dans cette cause ne la contredit et sil en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 besoin on aurait encore pu en faire la preuve par l'interrogatoire de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLors de cette d\u00e9claration les choses \u00e9tant encore enti\u00e8res entre les parties, et les tiers n'ayant non plus acquis aucun droit quelconque contre l'immeuble donn\u00e9 il n'y avait aucun obstacle contre la validit\u00e9 de l'acte qui la contient.\nLa d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement prononc\u00e9e par l'art 806 C C. \u00e9tant de droit \u00e9troit ne s'applique qu'aux donations gratuites et r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires. L'acte de donation ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 quand il \u00e9tait encore loisible aux parties de le faire, et qu'au lieu d'une donation gratuite il est prouv\u00e9 que les parties avaient l'intention et que de fait elles en ont fait un acte de dation en paiement par l'acte du 26 juillet 1875, la question d'enregistrement ne peut plus affecter Ta transaction des parties que comme dation en paiement. D'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1592 0.0., Ta dation d'une chose en paiement \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente et rend celui qui la donne ainsi sujet \u00e0 la m\u00eame garantie. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'enregistrer un acte de vente ou dation en paiement n'existe que vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers acqu\u00e9reurs et des cr\u00e9anciers; elle n'existe pas vis-\u00e0-vis du vendeur de ses h\u00e9ritiers on l\u00e9gataires qui sont garants de Ta vente et de la dation en paiement. La question d' enregistrement dans les circonstances de cette cause ne pouvant \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e que par les h\u00e9ritiers on l\u00e9gataires de feu l'hon. Chs. \"Wilson qui, comme tels, sont les garants de Ta dation en paiement ii est clair qu\u2019ils n'ont aucun droit de s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Mais ind\u00e9pendamment de ce fait ii est prouv\u00e9 que l'acte du 26 juillet 1875 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 du vivant des parties contractantes, ce qui met fin \u00e0 toute difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Sans entrer dans l'examen des autres d\u00e9fenses de l'intim\u00e9e, je suis d'avis que ces pr\u00e9tentions au sujet de l'acte 26 juillet 1875 sont bien fond\u00e9es et l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Par le contrat de mariage de l'intim\u00e9e avec J. H. Masson en date du 4 juillet 1859 son p\u00e8re Charles Wilson, partie \u00e0 l'acte, lui fit donation de la somme de $2,000 qu'il promit lui payer sous un an avec int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nPlus tard par acte de donation, en date du 7 juin 1872 le dit Charles Wilson fit donation \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de l'usufruit viager d'un certain immeuble.\nCet acte ne fut pas enregistr\u00e9 du vivant du donateur, et sur ce d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement, les demandeurs en qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritiers fiduciaires et d'ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires du dit feu Charles Wilson d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 4 mai 1877 en demandent la r\u00e9siliation par leur pr\u00e9sente action Les parties sont convenues de traiter l'action comme Si elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en 1877, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la mort du dit Charles Wilson.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette action que bien qu'en apparence, l'acte de donation en question soit une donation gratuite, qui, faute d'enregistrement, serait peut-\u00eatre nulle, cependant, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elle n'\u00e9tait qu'une dation en paiement, tel que ce fait fut plus tard constat\u00e9 entre elle et le donateur par acte du 26 juillet 1875, que cc dernier acte fut d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 le 15 novembre 1875, et que c'est en vertu dit celui qu'elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 jouir et jouit encore du dit immeuble.\nUne simple r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cet acte d\u00e9montre que le plaidoyer de l'intim\u00e9e est bien fond\u00e9. tel que l'a jug\u00e9 la cour dont est appel.\nLes parties y d\u00e9clarent que la donation du 7 juin 1872 fut faite \" with the view and intention of compensating the said Anna Maria Wilson for her claim \" under her marriage contract, that is to say, her claim \u201cagainst her father to the sum of $2000 with interest \"from the 4th July, 1860,\" et en cons\u00e9quence la dite intim\u00e9e donna quittance pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00e0 son p\u00e8re de la dite somme.\nJe ne lis pas cet acte comme apportant, entre les parties, aucun changement \u00e0 l'acte de donation de 1872, mais simplement comme d\u00e9clarant entre elles, ce qu'elles avaient bien le droit de faire quels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 des son origine son caract\u00e8re le but des parties et leurs motifs pour son ex\u00e9cution. Le fait qu'en 1875 comme en 1872 ils aient appel\u00e9 cette cession une donation n'en change pas le caract\u00e8re. C'est bien de fait une donation mais une donation en paiement. Ceci pose, comme fait ii en r\u00e9sulte comme cons\u00e9quence l\u00e9gale que le titre de Charles Wilson \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une vente, art. 1592 C. C, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, une vente n'\u00e9tant pas nulle entre les parties par d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement, l'action des demandeurs doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e. 11 m'est inutile d'ajouter qu'ils n'ont pas qualit\u00e9s pour attaquer l'intim\u00e9e. Ils sont ses garants, aux lieu et place de Charles Wilson, son vendeur. L'article 806 C.C. qui donne aux repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux d'un donateur li droit d'invoquer le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement ne s'applique qu'aux donations gratuites, et sans garantie de la part du donateur. Si leur auteur \u00e9tait garant ils le sont eux-m\u00eames.\nLes demandeurs out dit :\nSi cette donation est devenue par l'acte de 1875 une dation en \"paiement, ce ne peut \u00eatre que pour une faible partie; car la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9e vaut de beaucoup plus que les $20000 et int\u00e9r\u00eats que devait Charles wilson \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e * or pour cet exc\u00e9dent le titre de l'intim\u00e9e ne repose donc que sur une donation gratuite; or faute d'enregistrement cette donation est nulle et l'article 806 du code civil nous donne le droit d'invoquer cette nullit\u00e9.\nCette objection m'a paru s\u00e9rieuse. Mais apr\u00e8s l'avoir bien pes\u00e9e, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle ne peut pr\u00e9valoir. D'abord ces actes de 1872 et 1875 doivent \u00eatre entre les parties, pris comme un seul et m\u00eame acte; et c'est une dation en paiement \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 une vente, je l'ai dit que constitue l'acte de 1872.\nJe ne vois pas comment on peut le scinder de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y appliquer la r\u00e8gle de droit \u00e9troit sur l'enregistrement particulier aux donations, m\u00eame si, pour partie, ii n'est qu'une donation. Si cet acte au lieu de prendre la forme d'une donation eut eu la forme de ce que les parties out plus tard d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait une dation en paiement, les appelants auraient-ils Pu en demander la nullit\u00e9 faute d'enregistrement, la seule base de leur pr\u00e9sente action? Je ne le crois pas. Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 l'action qu'ils auraient eu m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 ils en auraient eu une quelconque, Charles Wilson lui-m\u00eame n'aurait pu se pr\u00e9valoir de la simulation d'une partie de cet acte, et les appelants n'ont pas plus que lui le droit de le faire B\u00e9darride Dol et fraude ([9]). Et puis, comme le remarque bien le jugement dont est appel, la diff\u00e9rence de valeur entre l'immeuble donn\u00e9 et la dette qu'a pay\u00e9e Charles Wilson en le donnant n'est pas une cause suffisante pour le faire annuler. Elle ne l'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus pour Charles Wilson lui-m\u00eame; elle ne peut donc non plus l'\u00eatre pour les appelants qui le repr\u00e9sentent. Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 d'ailleurs l'action des appelants ou la contestation li\u00e9e entre eux et l'intim\u00e9e.\nJ'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 remarqu\u00e9 que l'acte du 26 juillet 1875 dont les demandeurs il ne faut pas l'oublier, n'ont pas demand\u00e9 l'annulation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 du vivant de Charles Wilson Les vices qui peuvent se trouver dans cet enregistrement, en supposant l'enregistrement n\u00e9cessaire, ne me paraissent pas pouvoir \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s par les parties m\u00eames \u00e0 l'acte, quelles que soient les cons\u00e9quences qui en r\u00e9sulteraient vis-\u00e0-vis de tiers int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Or, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, les appelants sont aux lieu et place de Charles Wilson et l'article 806 C. C. ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 qu'aux donations sans garantie. Or, ceci n'est pas, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, une donation pure et simple mais une donation en paiement, \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 une vente.\nJe suis d'avis que sur la contestation telle que li\u00e9e dans l'instance entre les appelants et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, leur action doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e, en supposant m\u00eame, ce qui me parait tr\u00e8s douteux, que, comme ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires une action de cette nature leur compete.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nPatterson J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Lacoste Bisaillon, Brosseau & Lajoie.\nSolicitors for respondents : Geoffrion, Dorian & Allan.\n[1] M.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynee and Patterson JJ,\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAppeal\u2014Action to set aside municipal by-law\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, sec. 24 (g).\nIn virtue on a by-law passed at a meeting of the council of the corporation of the city of Quebec in the absence of the mayor, but \"presided, over by a councillor elected to the chair in the absence of the mayor, an annual tax of $800 was imposed on the Bell Telephone Company of Canada (appellant), and a tax of $1,000 on the Quebec Gas Company. In actions instituted by the appellants for the purpose of annulling the by-law the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the actions holding the tax valid.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2014\nHeld, that the cases were not appealable, the appellants not having taken cut or been refused, after argument, a rule or order quashing the by-law in question within the terms of sec. 24 (g) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act providing for appeals in cases of municipal by-laws. Varennes v. Verch\u00e8res (19 Can. S.C.R. 365); Sherbrooke v\u201e McManamy (18 Can. S.C.R. 594) followed.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada reversing the judgments of the Superior Court, which had set aside the by-law of the corporation of the city of Quebec. The question of the validity of the same by-law under which the appellants were taxed being raised in both appeals, they were argue d together.\nIn March, 1889, in the absence of the mayor, and no pro-mayor having been elected, a by-law was passed at a meeting of the council presided over by a councillor, imposing a personal, fixed and annual tax of $800 on telephone companies operating in the city of Quebec, and a personal fixed and annual tax of $1,000 on every gas light company operating in the city of Quebec.\nThe appellants in January, 1890, instituted actions in the Superior Court of Lower Canada, district of Quebec, praying that the by-law be declared null and void by judgment of the court. The Superior Court, following; the decision rendered in the Quebec street Railway Co. v. The City of Quebec ([1]) and not appealed from, declared that the mayor being an integral part of the council, and his presence, except in the cases provided for being essential to the lawful exercise of the legislative powers of the council, by-laws passed in his absence, and in that of the pro-mayor if there be one, are invalid.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada the majority of the court held that the council was regularly constituted, a councillor having been elected to the chair in the absence of the mayor, and that the by-law was valid. Although the case was argued upon the merits the appeal was decided upon the question of jurisdiction which was raised during the argument by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nIrvine Q.C. and G. Stuart Q.C. appeared for the appellants. P. PELLETIER Q,C for the respondent.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C. J. stated that he had written an opinion on the merits affirming the decision of the court below but in View of the decision of this court in the case of Sherbrooke v. McManamy([2]) it was clear the appeal must be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU J. delivered the judgment of the court\nThese two appeals must be quashed, as we intimated at the argument. The appellants had to concede that they could not base their right to appeal on sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act Gilman v. Gilbert ([3]) as the matter in controversy, though perhaps affecting future rights, does not relate to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements annual rents or \" such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound,\" but they contended that their cases were appealable under sec. 24 of the act, subsec. g, which gives to this court jurisdiction in any case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule or order of court or the rule or order to quash it has been refused after argument. This contention, however, cannot prevail. We have already disposed of a similar question in the two cases of Sherbrooke v. Mc Manamy (1) and Verch\u00e8res v Varennes ([4]) wherein we quashed the appeals. Sherbrooke v. McManamy (1) is particularly in point. The corporation of Sherbrooke had there sued the defendant for a tax of $100 as compounders of liquors. The defendant pleaded to that action that the said tax had been illegally imposed, because no power to impose it had been conferred upon the said corporation by the legislature, and concluded that \" the said by-law may be declared to have been and to be irregular, illegal, null and void, and to have beer and to be ultra dries of the powers of the said municipal council, and that the same be set aside.\" The Court of Appeal granted the conclusions of the said plea. \" Considering,\" said the court, \" that the legislature hath not delegated by either of the said Q acts or otherwise to the corporation respondent, the power to impose the said tax of $100 upon appellants as compounders, and that in passing the said by-law in so far as relates to and concerns the said tax of $100, the respondent has acted ultra vires, and without right or authority so to do, and that the same is null and void in respect of and as regards the imposition of the tax of $100 upon appellants as compounders doth dismiss this action in so far as it claims the said tax of $100.\" From that judgment the corporation of Sherbrooke instituted an appeal to this court but as I have said the appeal was quashed. Now here, the plaintiffs asked that \"by the judgment of this honourable court the said by-law be adjudged and declared to be unjust, unreasonable and oppressive, that it be further declared that the said by-law was irregularly and illegally passed, and was and is null, void and of no effect, and that the said by-law he by the judgment of this honourable court annulled and set aside.\" And the judgment appealed from dismisses the action. We could clearly not entertain these appeals without overruling Sherbrooke v. Mc Manamy ([5]). There is the greatest difference between an action like the present one to have a by-law declared null and void, and the proceedings under the English system to have a by-law quashed by rule or order. On an action, as this one the judgment declaring a by-law void is res judicata only between the parties, but under the English system, a by-law quashed, by order of court is quashed to all intents and purposes whatever. The fact that there may be no such proceedings possible in the province of Quebec cannot have the effect to extend by interpretation the right of appeal to a case not clearly provided for by the act.\nThe case of Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques v. The City of Montreal ([6]) was a case of taxes on real property and was therefore held to have been appealable as coming within the words \"any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\" I refer to the authorities cited in Langevini v. Les Commissaires ([7]) and Verch\u00e9res v. Vareunes ([8]).\nAppeals quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitors for respondent : Bailliage & Pelletier.\n[1] 1\u00df Q.L.R. 11.\n[2] 18 Can. S. C.

(B.C.) certain land conveyed to the E. & N. Ry. Co. was, for four years from the date of the act, thrown open to actual \"settlers for agricultural purposes,\" \u2014coal and timber land excepted. H. and W. respectively claimed a right of pre\u2014emption under this act.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, that the act did not confer a right of pre-emption to lands not within the pre-emption laws of the province; that only \" unreserved and unoccupied lands \" came within those laws and the lands claimed had long before been reserved for a town site ; and that the claimants were not upon the lands as \" actual settlers for agricultural purposes,\" but had entered with express notice that the lands were not open for settlement.\nAPPEALS from decisions of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment at the trial for the defendants in each case respectively.\nIn each of these cases the respective parties were represented by the same solicitors and counsel ; the cases were argued together and one judgment was given as deciding both. The following statement of facts from one of the cases will suffice to explain the position of them both before this court.\nThis is an action brought by the appellant for a declaration that he is entitled under the act chapter 14 of the Provincial Legislature of British Columbia passed on the 19th day of December, 1883, section 23 and sub-section f, therein mentioned, and under the act chapter 6 of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, passed on the 19th day of April, 1884, section 7, subsection 1, to acquire and purchase from the respondents a certain parcel or tract of land for the sum of $160, and that the respondents may be decreed to convey, &c., or for a declaration that the appellant is entitled under said section 23 of the said chapter 14 and section 7 subsection 2 of said act chapter 6, to acquire and purchase from the respondents the freehold of the surface rights of the said parcel of land on payment to the respondents of the sum of $160, and that the respondents may be decreed to convey.\n47 Vic. ch. 14 subsec. f, one of the acts referred to, contains the following provision, the prior sections providing for a conveyance of certain lands from the crown to the defendant company in consideration of their having constructed a railway from Esquimalt to Nanaimo in the said province :\n\" (f.) The lands on Vancouver Island to be so conveyed shall, except as to coal and other minerals, and also except as to timber lands as hereinafter mentioned, be open from four years from the passing of this act to actual settlers, for agricultural purposes, at the rate of one dollar an acre, to the extent of 160 acres to each such actual settler ; and in any grants to settlers the right to cut timber for railway purposes and rights of way for the railway and stations and workshops, shall be reserved. In the meantime and until the railway from Esquimalt to Nanaimo shall have been completed the Government of British Columbia shall be the agents of the Government of Canada for administering for the purposes of settlement, the lands in this subsection mentioned ; and for such purposes the Government of British Columbia may make and issue, subject as aforesaid, pre-emption records to actual settlers of the said lands.\"\nThe plaintiffs respectively claim the right to have a conveyance from the defendant company of a piece of land, for many years prior to said act known as the Newcastle town site reserve, lying within the land conveyed by said act. They first applied for them under the pre-emption laws of the province, but their applications were refused and no appeal from such refusal was taken to the Supreme Court of the province, as such laws allow. They then brought these actions.\nThe actions were dismissed by the trial judge on the grounds that the cases were res adjudicata by the refusal for pre-emption without appeal ; that the lands in question were reserved lands, being reserved for a town site, and so not subject to pre-emption ; and that plaintiffs never were \" settlers for agricultural purposes \" under clause f of 47 Vic ch. 14. The decision of the trial judge was affirmed by the full court. The plaintiff appealed.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for appellant.\nDavie, Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Moss Q.C. for respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I agree with the court below that the plaintiffs in this case and in that of Waddington against the same defendants have shown no claim whatever to the lands in question in this case, and that the decision of the trial judge and that of the full court were correct and the actions were properly dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I intimated at the conclusion of the argument of this case that the appeal should be dismissed, and on considering the case since I adhere to that opinion.\nFOURNIER J. concurred in the appeal being dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014These appeals must, in my opinion, be dismissed. I cannot entertain a doubt that the Dominion Government, as trustees for the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company, took the lands vested in them by the provincial act, 47 Vic. ch. 14, in the character in which those lands then were, namely, as lands set apart for suburban park lots of from 3 to 5 acres each, and that such lands were not open for settlement as agricultural lands, nor did they become so by anything which took place subsequently. It is also, in my opinion, free from doubt that when the Dominion act, 47 Vic. ch. 6, placed the lands vested in the Dominion Government by the provincial act in the hands of the Provincial Government, as agents of the Dominion, for purposes of settlement, the effect and intent of the Dominion act was to place the lands for disposition under the laws of the province, and that no claim against the railway company could be maintained, except in right of a title, which would have been good against the Provincial Government, under the laws of the province, if the lands had not become the property of the railway company. The evidence clearly shows that the lands were never open for settlement by actual settlers as agricultural lands at all, and that the plaintiffs did not enter upon the lands as actual settlers upon agricultural lands, believing themselves entitled to acquire 160 acres in virtue of the laws in force in the province, but on the contrary that they entered against express notice given to them, that the lands were not open for settlement as agricultural lands, or so as to enable the plaintiffs to acquire any claim by possession.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: S.

C. c. 38\u201450-51 Vic. c. 16 s. 18\u2014Retroactive operation.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, that even assuming 50-51 Vic. ch. 16 gives an action against the Crown for an injury to the person received on a public work resulting from negligence of which its officer or servant is guilty (upon which point the court expresses no opinion), such act is not retroactive in its effect and gives no right of action for injuries received prior to the passing of the act.\nHeld also, that even assuming that under the common law of the province of Quebec, or statutes in force at the time of the injury received, the Crown could be held liable, the injury complained of in this case having been received more than a year before the filing of the petition the right of action was prescribed under arts. 2262 and 2267 C.C.\nPer Patterson J.\u2014The Crown is made liable for damages caused by the negligence of its servants operating government railways by 44 Vic. c. 25 (R.S.C. ch. 38), but as the petition of right in this case was filed after the passing of 50-51 Vic. c. 16 (1887) the claimant became subject to the laws relating to prescription in the province of Quebec, and his action was prescribed.\nAppeal and Cross Appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1].\nThis was a petition of right for injury to the suppliant's minor son received on the Intercolonial Railway. The facts and pleadings appear in the report of the case in 2 Can. Ex. C. R. p. 328 and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRobinson Q.C. and Hogg Q.C. for appellants.\nThe object and effect of subsection c of sec. 16, ch. 16 of 50-51 Vic. is to confer upon the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to hear and determine all cases of the classes indicated therein, in respect of which the Crown was liable before the passing of the act, and in cases where the Crown has been or may be rendered liable by legislation. It affects matters of procedure only, and not the legal rights of the Crown.\nThe heading of sections 15 and 16 of this act is \"Jurisdiction\" and in considering the proper construction to be placed on subsection c the heading should be looked to as not only explaining, but as affording a key to the constriction of the said subsection.\nThe Eastern Counties v. Marriage[2]. Lang v. Kerr et al.[3]. Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes sec. 69. Wilberforce on Statute Law[4]. Wood v. Hurl[5].\nThe question therefore is: Is the Crown liable in tort because a court is given jurisdiction to hear and determine such cases; and is the defence of the Crown that it cannot be sued in tort, no longer a defence because of this subsection c?\nThe Crown cannot be deprived of any prerogative right unless by express legislative enactment, subsec. 46 of sec. 7, Dominion Interpretation Act, and it is clear that there are no words in subsection c s. 16 of the Exchequer Court Act creating an express liability against the Crown in cases arising by or through the negligence of the Crown's officers or servants, and without such express words in this subsection no extension of liability can be presumed.\nSee Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes[6], and Maxwell on Statutes[7].\nThe jurisdiction conferred on the Exchequer Court by this subsection c differs from any jurisdiction which the official arbitrators of the Dominion had under the statutes which governed that body. Under 33 Vic. cap. 23, 41 Vic. cap. 8, 44 Vic. cap. 25, only such claims arising out of death or injury on a public work as the head of a department was instructed by the Governor in Council to refer, could be referred to the arbitrators, and under the two latter statutes the reference was only for investigation and report, and cap. 40 Revised Statutes of Canada is the same, and the fact that the Crown referred such cases to the Official Arbitrators for adjustment and settlement, forms no argument that the Crown had prior to the passing of 50 & 51 Vic. cap. 16 admitted or created any legal liability for the class of claims mentioned in subsection c.\nThe learned counsel also cited and relied on The Queen v. McLeod[8]; The Queen v. MacFarlane[9], and on the question of contributory negligence; Beach on Negligence[10]; Clerk & Lindsell on Torts[11]; Radley v. The L. & N. W. Ry. Co.[12]; Seymour v. Greenwood[13]; Rounds v. Delaware Railroad Co.[14].\nBelcourt and Tach\u00e9 for respondent, cited and relied on Farnell v. Bowman[15]; Atty. Gen. of the Straits Setllement v. Wemyss[16]; 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16 sec. 16; Government Railway Act R.S.C. ch. 38, sec. 50; arts 1053, 105.4 C.C.; Toullier[17]; Pothier, Obligations[18]; and The Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. Lareau[19].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I express no opinion as to whether 50 & 51 Vic. cap. 16 gives a new jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court in respect of cases where no liability previously existed against the Crown. But assuming it does, how can this act have a retroactive operation, and make the crown liable for the acts of their officers or servants which happened prior to the passing of the act and for which the Crown was not liable at the time of the happening of, the events complained of? Surely it can only apply if at all to acts of negligence committed after the passing of the act. The accident happened on the 18th July, 1884, the statute was not passed until the 25th June, 1887. Then again the petition of right was not filed till the 27th March, 1888. So that if the act had reference to the time when the act was committed the action was prescribed before the act was passed. For these reasons I think the appeal should be allowed. It is not necessary and would not be proper for me to discuss the merits of this case, which to my mind are by no means clear against the employees of the Intercolonial Railway.\nFOURNIER J. concurred with Taschereau J.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this suppliant's claim must be dismissed. First, if as he contended at the argument, he had, in 1884, by the laws of the province of Quebec a right of action against the Crown for the damages he now claims, his action was prescribed, when he filed his petition, by one year under articles 2262, 2267, 2188 and 2211. I do not wish, however, to be understood as conceding that he had such an action at common law.\nSecondly\u2014If he had a right of action under section 27 of the statute of 1.881, the Government Railways Act, which I very much doubt[20], his action was also prescribed in 1887 by one year under the same articles. The contention that these were continuous damages is unfounded. The tort which he complains of was not a continuous act.\nThirdly\u2014The statute of 1887, assuming, without deciding, that it now gives a petition of right against the Grown for damages such as those claimed here, arising out of any death or injury to the person happening since the passing of the said act, which may be doubtful does not revive claims against the Crown which had previously been extinguished either under the common law of the province or under section 8, ch. 40 of the Revised Statutes, or for any cause whatsoever. It may be that under this statute of 1887 no petition of right at all lies for such damages arising out of any death or personal injury antecedent to the said act, even if the claim was not previously extinguished by prescription, though a reference to the Exchequer Court upon such a claim might perhaps be made under section 58 of the act, a point, however, which it is unnecessary to decide here.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is unnecessary in the present case to determine whether or not the main point relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant is well founded, namely, that the Dominion statute 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16 gives no action against the Dominion Government for an injury to the person assuming such injury to have been caused in the manner charged in the petition of right in this case. That act enacts that the Court of Exchequer shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment; and the contention is that this provision in the act operates merely as giving to the Court of Exchequer jurisdiction to try all cases wherein by law, independently of that statute, parties had a claim for compensation to be given to them by the Crown as representing the Dominion Government for injuries received from the negligence of the servants of that government, but not as giving any new cause of action or demand against the government, and that as, independently of the above statute, it had been held by this court that the Crown as representing the Dominion Government was not responsible for injuries to the person caused by the tort, default or neglect of the persons employed on the Intercolonial Railway, that therefore the petition of right in the present case could not be maintained.\nWhatever may be the operation of the statute under consideration in respect of injuries occasioned to any person subsequently to the passing of the act it is sufficient for the determination of the present case to say that the act has no operation in respect of an injury sustained three years before the passing of the act, all right of action in respect of which injury, if any had existed independently of the above statute, as is contended there had by the law of the province of Quebec in which province the injury complained of was sustained, had been prescribed by the law of that province long previously to the passing of the statute 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16. The evidence also, although in the view which I have taken it is not necessary to rest my judgment upon this point, fails to satisfy my mind that the brakesman Belanger, whose alleged negligence is relied upon as having caused the injury complained of, can be properly charged with any negligence whatever as causing the injury, which seems to have been wholly caused by the wrongful conduct of the boy who suffered the injury by falling from a train of cars on the Intercolonial Railway while in the act of committing in company with several other boys a wilful trespass thereon.\nThe appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014On the 19th July, 1884, a son of the petitioner, 13 years old, was, with other boys, amusing himself by riding on a freight car of the Intercolonial Railway as it was moving along the track at the station of Rimouski. He fell off the step of the car and was injured. It is charged that his fall and the consequent injury were caused by the improper conduct of a brakesman upon the car, and that charge has been held to be established by the evidence. That conclusion of fact has been challenged and we have had a full discussion of the evidence bearing upon it. The conclusion depends upon the weight attached to parts of the evidence in which there is not perfect agreement among the witnesses, and is a matter of inference quite as much as of direct proof. Therefore, while there may be room for the conclusion that the boy's misfortune was either an accident for which no one was to blame, or was brought on him entirely by his own doings, I cannot say that the finding of the learned judge is not warranted or that it is so clearly wrong as to make it our duty to reverse it. The important question upon the appeal is the liability of the Crown for the negligence or misconduct of the brakesman.\nOn the part of the Crown it is denied that any liability exists; and secondly, that if there is a liability, it can be enforced by petition of right.\nThe position is pleaded in these terms:\nHer Majesty's Attorney General for a further defence says that the said petition of right does not disclose any claim which the suppliant can enforce by petition of right, nor does the said petition disclose any cause of action for which Her Majesty can be rendered liable, inasmuch as the claim and cause of action therein alleged and set out are founded upon the negligence and misconduct of the servants and employees of Her Majesty upon the said Intercolonial Railway; and it is submitted that the control and management of the said Intercolonial Railway being vested by statute in the Minister of Railways and Canals, Her Majesty cannot be made liable upon petition of right because of any negligence or misconduct in the management thereof; and that even assuming the said railway to be under the management and control of Her Majesty, no negligence can be imputed to her, and Her Majesty is not answerable by petition of right for the negligence and misconduct of her servants, and no action will lie against Her Majesty for damages in consequence of such negligence and misconduct on the part of her servants; and Her Majesty's Attorney General claims the same benefit from this objection as if he had, on behalf of Her Majesty, formally demurred to the said petition of right.\nThe accident happened, as I have said, on the 19th of July, 1884. The cause of action, if any, accrued then and once for all, notwithstanding that the extent of the damages may not have been fully ascertained until some time afterwards.\nThe petition of right bears date in December, 1887.\nThe question is: What right of action or claim had the plaintiff in December, 1887?\nThe jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, under the act of 1887[21], extends to\nEvery claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment:\n\"The Crown\" meaning the Crown in the right or interest of the Dominion of Canada; s. 1 (c.)\nThis is one of the heads of jurisdiction enumerated in section 16 of the act, and it is framed in language taken from the act respecting Official Arbitrations which is repealed by the act of 1887, the Exchequer Court being substituted as a tribunal in place of the arbitrators.\nA petition of right presented under any of the statutes regulating that proceeding, e.g., the Petition of Right Act, Canada, 1875[22], or the Petition of Right Act, 1876[23], or the Petition of Right Act as contained in the Revised Statutes[24], was a process by which a subject could obtain relief in respect of any claim against the Crown. In each of those statutes the word \"relief\" included every species of relief claimed or prayed for in a petition of right, whether a restitution of any incorporeal right[25], or a return of lands or chattels or a payment of money or damages, or otherwise.\nIt was declared in the act of 1875 that nothing therein contained should prejudice or limit, otherwise than therein provided, the rights, privileges or prerogatives of Her Majesty or her successors, or apply to any claim, matter or thing which under the Public Works Act of 1867[26], or under any acts amending or extending the same, might be referred by the Minister of Public Works to arbitration, and that no court should have jurisdiction under the Petition of Right Act in any such claim, matter or thing.\nThe subjects thus excluded were confined to claims for property or damage to property arising from the construction of public works, or claims under contracts for the construction of public works[27].\nThe act of 1875 was repealed by that of 1876. The latter act declared that nothing therein contained should\u2014(1) prejudice or limit otherwise than therein provided, the rights, privileges or prerogatives of Her Majesty or her successors; or (2), prevent any suppliant from proceeding as before the passing of the act; or (3), give to the subject any remedy (a) in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England, under similar circumstances, by the laws in force there prior to the passing of the Imperial statute, 23 & 24 Vic. ch. 34; or (b), in any case in which either before or within two months after the presentation of the petition, the claim was, under the statutes in that behalf, referred to arbitration by the head of the proper department, who was thereby authorized with the approval of the Governor in Council to make such reference upon any petition of right.\nThe Revised Statute has the same restrictions as the act of 1876.\nThe Government Railways Act, 1881, was in force when the accident in question occurred. That act made some important changes, or at all events removed some questions that previously existed, with respect to the liability of the Crown for the acts or defaults of the persons employed in the actual working of the road.\nThe general railway law of the province of Canada was adopted, with some modifications, as the general law of the Dominion by the Railway Act, 1868. The first part of that act, including, amongst others, the heads of \"working of the railway\" and \"actions for indemnity,\" were declared to apply to the Intercolonial Railway, the construction of which was then contemplated, so far as applicable to that undertaking. That law was repeated, with some changes, in the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879. Under the general law a railway company was liable for damages caused by the negligence or other torts of its servants or officers operating the road. Did a similar liability attach to the Crown? That question was raised and was debated in this court in an action that arose out of an accident in 1880, upon the Prince Edward Island Railway, a Government railway to which the general act had been declared to apply, and it was decided by three judges against two that the principle of respondeat superior did not apply and that the Crown was not liable[28].\nThe Government Railways Act, 1881, 44 V. c. 25, if I correctly interpret it, placed the Crown on very much the same footing with regard to the liability in question as a railway company under the general act.\nWe may give a fair and liberal construction to the statute, understanding the legislature to mean what is said in plain terms or conveyed by reasonable implication, without fear of doing violence to any constitutional principle, or any doctrine touching the prerogative, or any such maxim as \"the King can do no wrong.\"\nThe two recent decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, viz.: Farnell v. Bowman[29] in 1887, and Attorney General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[30], in 1888, leave no ground for hesitation or reluctance on that score.\nIt has been argued that an important distinction exists between a government railway and one constructed by a railway company in the fact that the former has a high political object, in view of the public good, and is not a commercial enterprise undertaken with a view to profit. The distinction, so far as it is supposed to bear on the rights of persons who find one road conducted just like the other and have to deal with both in precisely the same way, is not at once apparent, but whatever force the suggestion may have had when the relation of the Crown to the undertaking, and to the public in respect of the undertaking, was to some extent a matter of argument and deduction, as it was before the passing of the Government Railways Act, it must, as I apprehend, be regarded as now beside the question.\nThe act is, by section 2, to apply to all railways which are vested in Her Majesty and which are under the control and management of the Minister of Railways and Canals.\nI do not know that the rights of Her Majesty are affected by the act in the sense in which those words are to be understood in the Interpretation Act[31], but if they are affected then I hold that the effect of section 2 is to declare that Her Majesty is bound by the act in respect of all railways vested in her and under the control and management of the minister. But this is not the only declaration to that effect, as we shall find when we examine some of the provisions of the act.\nBy section 4, whenever the powers given to the minister are exercised by the chief superintendent or superintendent, or by any other person or officer, employee or servant of the department thereunto specially authorized by the minister, acting minister or his deputy, or an acting deputy, they shall be presumed to be exercised by the direction of the minister, unless the contrary be made to appear.\nThe words \"the department\" used in this section and in some other places in the act obviously signify the Crown, just as if the words \"Her Majesty\" had been used. In fact we find the latter term substituted in the revised statute in some sections to which I shall refer which relate to liability for damages. In some other places the word \"minister\" is used in place of \"department.\"\nVarious powers are conferred and duties imposed on the minister eo nomine. In many of these the public or individuals are interested, and the effect is to create rights which must be capable of being enforced. Proceedings for that purpose must be against the Crown and not in general, if in any case, against the minister who is merely the representative of the Crown.\nLet us see how this is illustrated by some specific provisions of the statute. Take the heading \"Fences.\" By section 55 the minister is to make certain fences when required by proprietors of lands adjoining the railway, and also cattle guards, and until they are made (s. 56) the department, or as in the revised statute, Her Majesty, not the minister, is to be liable for all damages which may be done by trains or engines to cattle, &c., on the railway which have gained access thereto for want of such fences or cattle guards. This liability is declared to be subject to the provisions of sections 60, 62 and 64. By section 62, the owner of cattle which are at large contrary to the mandate of section 60,\nshall not have any action or be entitled to any compensation in respect of the same unless the same are killed or injured through the negligence or wilfulness of some officer, employee or servant of the department.\nThe revised version has officer, employee or servant of the minister. Here is expressly the doctrine of respondeat superior. Who is the superior against whom the action will lie, or who is to make compensation? It is the action mentioned in section 56, not against the minister, nor against the impersonation called the department, but, as expressed in the revised statute, Her Majesty. So with section 57\u2014all these being parts of the one enactment:\nAfter the fences or guards have been duly made and while they are duly maintained, no such liability shall accrue for any such damages unless negligently or wilfully done.\nBut if a liability does accrue by reason of negligence or failure to maintain the fences against whom does the action lie? Obviously against Her Majesty. It seems to me perfectly clear that section 56 does not, as has been in effect contended, impose a liability on the Crown in an arbitrary or capricious manner, but the whole series of sections form one enactment in which the liability of the Crown for the acts or defaults of its servants is expressly recognized. The object of section 56, and of the corresponding section of the general railway act, is not to create a liability, but, assuming the principle of the liability of the Crown, to define or limit the range of inquiry in the particular circumstances.\nSo under the head \"working the railway\" we have the same regulations as those contained in the general act. There are the same provisions for the safety of passengers and of the public in respect of moving trains; as to servants of the department, (in revised statute, the minister) wearing badges; as to running trains at regular hours and carrying passengers and goods on due payment of the toll, freight or fare legally authorized. Then by section 74, the department (in revised statute, Her Majesty) shall not be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration, in case of damage arising from any negligence, omission or default of any officer, employee or servant of the department (in revised statute, of the Minister). Section 76 gives the department (revised statute, Her Majesty) a lien on goods for freight and charges, and sec. 77 provides for the sale of unclaimed goods remaining in the possession of the department (revised statute, of Her Majesty). Sec. 78 requires that every locomotive shall have a bell and whistle, and sec. 79 makes the department (revised statute, Her Majesty) liable for all damages sustained by any person by reason of any neglect to ring the bell or sound the whistle at level crossings of highways, giving a remedy over for half the damages against the engineer who neglected to give the signal Sec. 80 allows a passenger to be put off the train in pertain circumstances. If this power is improperly exercised there must be a right of action, and doubtless the action must be against Her Majesty.\nSec. 81 declares that any person injured while on the platform of a car, or on any baggage, wood or freight car, in violation of the printed regulations posted up at the time in a conspicuous place inside of the passenger cars then in the train, shall have no claim for the injury, provided room inside of such passenger cars, sufficient for the proper accommodation of the passengers, was furnished at the time. There may, as is here admitted, be a claim by the man who stood on the platform, and of course by passengers seated in the cars, for injury caused, let us say, by the misplacing of a switch which wrecked the train, or by a collision with another train. The claim thus recognized is a claim against Her Majesty, not against the pointsman who failed to turn the switch, or the yardsman, who, as in a disastrous case which we recently read of, loitered on his way to signal danger to a following train.\nThe liability of the Crown thus distinctly appears from the whole scope of the statute.\nIt is recognized in an earlier section than those to which I have now been referring in terms that expressly cover claims like that before us. I allude to section 27 which relates to arbitrations, and I have now to consider whether under that branch of the statute a remedy is given which precludes the remedy by petition of right.\nThe first part of section 27 relates to claims for property taken or damaged arising from or connected with the construction, repair, maintenance or working of a government railway, or out of a contract for the construction or maintenance of any such railway, made and entered into with the minister, either in the name of Her Majesty or otherwise. The second part requires security to be given by the claimant before any claim under that or any other section of the act shall be arbitrated upon; and then the third part enacts that if any person or body corporate has any supposed claim upon the Government of Canada (an expression which, as we lately held in a case of Grant v. The Government of the Province of Quebec, means Her Majesty) fox property taken, or alleged damage to property arising from the construction or connected with the maintenance or repair of any government railway, or connected with any contract for the construction, maintenance or repair of any government railway, or arising out of any death or injury to person or property on any such railway, such person or body corporate may give notice of such claim to the minister, stating the particulars thereof, and how the same has arisen; and in case the minister, from want of reliable information as to the facts relating to the claim, does not consider the case one in which a tender of satisfaction should be made, he may refer the claim to one or more of the official arbitrators for examination and report, both as to matters of fact involved and as to the amount of damages sustained. And thereupon the arbitrators shall have all the powers in reference thereto as if the claim had been one coming within the purview of the first part of the section and had been referred after tender of satisfaction made; but the arbitrators' duty in such case shall be confined to reporting his or their findings upon the questions of fact, and upon the amount of damages, if any, sustained, and the principles upon which such amount has been computed.\nCases within the purview of the first part of the section, viz., those relating to property taken or damaged or to contracts, might, by section 28, be referred by the minister to arbitrators whose award was declared to be binding. Under the third part of the section a report only and not an award was to be made.\nIt may be noticed that the class of claims dealt with in this third part is the same which might have been referred to arbitration under the act 33 Vic. ch. 23 sec. 1, which formed section 6 of the revised act respecting official arbitrators[32], the provisions of the third part being found in section 11, and that that class is far from embracing all the claims that may arise under the Government Railways Act. As one example not reached by it, we may instance claims for damages suffered by reason of neglect to ring the bell or sound the whistle at a level crossing of a highway such as that which was the subject of Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Rosenberger[33], where the injury was not to person or property on the railway. Claims for damage by reason of detention of a train and others in great variety will be readily thought of.\nThe provision confers a certain permissive power in a limited class of cases, and cannot be construed to exclude the remedy by petition of right, while on the other hand the provisions of the Petition of Rights Acts which I have quoted give power to the minister with the approval of the Governor in Council, to cause the matter to be referred either before or after the commencement of proceedings by petition.\nIn my view, therefore, the plaintiff might at once, after the happening of the accident in 1884, have taken proceedings by petition of right. He would have been of course subject to any limitation or prescription applicable to the case. There was the six months' limitation under section 108 of the act of 1881, and there may have been obstacles under the laws of the province. I have not considered to what extent, if at all, the provincial laws would have affected his action if it had been brought before the year 1887. By delaying his action until after the passing of the act of that year[34], he became subject under the express terms of section 18 to the laws relating to prescription in force in the province of Quebec; and by article 2262 of the Civil Code actions for bodily injuries are prescribed after one year. The defence of prescription is not pleaded, but it seems that it may be taken by the court of its own motion. Article 2188 declares that the court cannot of its own motion supply the defence resulting from prescription, except in cases where the right of action is denied. This means, as I understand, denied by law, not denied on the record. The French version so expresses it: \"Sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 la loi d\u00e9nie l'action.\" By article 2267 the right of action under article 2262 is absolutely extinguished after the delay for prescription has expired. I refer to Leduc v. Desmarchais[35] decided by Mr. Justice Johnson; Pigeon v. Mayor, &c., of Montreal, before the Queen's Bench in appeal[36]; and Breakey v. Carter[37] in this court, as cases in which the duty of the courts to give effect to the defence of prescription, though not pleaded, was acted on. Another case in this court was Dorion v. Crowley[38], which is also a precedent for the course which I think is the proper course in this case, viz., to give no costs of defence in any of the courts.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed without costs, and judgment should be given for the Crown without costs.\nAppeal allowed, no costs, cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor, Hogg & Balderson.\nSolicitor for respondent: L.

Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rosenberger (9 Can. S.C.R. 311) followed:\nThe decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Divisional Court were affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe actions in this case were brought for damages claimed in consequence of an accident caused, as was alleged, by the negligence of the servants of the defendant companies in not ringing the bell and sounding the whistle on approaching a crossing, and, also, for negligence in the construction of the railway at the place where the accident occurred. The one action was brought by the executors of a Mrs. Anderson who was killed, and the other by the plaintiff, Sibbald, who lost an arm, by such accident. The facts disclosed by the evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action are as follows:\u2014\nThe deceased Mrs. Anderson, on account of whose death the second above-mentioned action is brought, was on the morning of the 11th October, 1888, being driven with her younger son Allan by the plaintiff in the first mentioned action along the highway known as the Town Line, between the townships of Georgina and North Gwillimbury, in the county of York. The plaintiff, Dr. Sibbald, was driving two horses in a wagonette towards the south with his coachman, Lonergan, on his left, and Mrs. Anderson and her son Allan seated behind, with their backs to the driver. The defendants were propelling a locomotive engine with tender foremost along their line of railway towards the north.\nThe said line of railway in crossing the said highway for a distance of about 500 feet, entering upon it from the south at the distance of some 420 feet south of the point where the accident occurred, and continuing upon the highway for the distance of about 80 feet north of the point where the accident occurred, the accident occurring at a point within the limits of the road allowance. The distance between the north and south cattle guard at this crossing is some 592 feet. The plank crossing where vehicles pass over the defendants\u2019 track is distant about 195 feet south of the point of the accident. It will thus be seen that the railway is carried along the highway in crossing it for the said distance of 500 feet, and that an engine being propelled along the said railway and a person driving along the said highway are proceeding on almost parallel lines.\nAt the plank crossing the highway and the railway are practically on a level. To the south of the plank crossing the railway is above the level of the highway, but a few feet north of the plank crossing the land commences to rise, and in order to have the railway on a level the road allowance was cut into, and at the point of the accident the railway company has excavated a considerable portion of the highway for the purposes of the railway, leaving the railway at this point below the level of the highway two feet six inches. Dr. Sibbald, Mrs. Anderson, the doctor\u2019s boy, and Mrs. Anderson\u2019s little boy Allan were driving towards the south down this hill when they discovered a train coming from the south towards them, and, as soon as it was discovered, Dr. Sibbald told his man to get out and go and hold the horses by the head; then the engine came on slowly; the man was unable to hold the horses; the horses turned round and down the slope to the left, which was close to the railway track; the carriage or wagonette was upset, and two at least of the occupants of the carriage were thrown on to the track close to, if not under, the wheels of the engine which was coming along. The doctor\u2019s man was left safe in the road; Mrs. Anderson\u2019s little boy had got down out of the carriage, and was also safe: the doctor was thrown with his arm across the rail, and got that arm crushed so it had to be amputated, and Mrs. Anderson received such injuries there on the track at that time as resulted in her death the next morning.\nThe following are the questions put to the jury at the trial and the answers given thereto by them:\u2014\nFirst. Did the Lake Simcoe Junction Railway Company, at the place where the accident happened, excavate a portion of the highway, and carry its line of railway across the highway through the excavation? A. Yes.\nSecond. If so, how much lower is the line of the railway, in consequence of the excavation, than the highway at the point where the accident happened? A. Two feet six inches.\nThird. Was the highway rendered less safe by reason of the difference in level, caused by the excavation between the highway and the railway, at the point where the accident happened? A. Yes, by reason of the fact that the legal allotment for the public highways in the said township is sixty-six feet, which has been reduced by said excavation.\nSixth. Was the whistle sounded or the bell rung at least eighty rods from the crossing? A. That the engineer did give the three sounds of the whistle somewhere about eighty rods south from the crossing.\nSeventh. Was the bell rung, at short intervals, for a distance of about eighty rods from the crossing, until the engine reached the crossing? A. No; the bell did not ring; nor was it. sounded by the fireman.\nEighth. Could the plaintiff, Dr. Sibbald, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident, which happened to him? A. He could not have avoided the accident; he did exercise reasonable care in the course of it. Ninth. Could Mrs. Anderson, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident which happened to her? A. She could not have avoided the accident by any special care of her own.\nTwelfth. In your opinion, was the accident caused by negligence on the part of the defendants? A. Yes.\nThirteenth. If so, what was the negligence of the defendants which caused the accident? A. Their negligence consisted in not constructing any fence or other protection on the portion of the road or highway, and that the non-ringing of the bell was contributory to it.\nOn these findings a verdict was entered for the plaintiffs in each action, which was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. The defendants appealed.\nThe accident occurred on the line of the Midland Railway Company, which, by agreement, was being operated by the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe duty to protect the public by fencing the road was on the municipality and not the company. Wilson v. City of Watertown[3].\nThe company cannot be held responsible under the circumstances. Cracknell v. The Mayor, &c., of Thetford[4]; commented upon in Geddes v. The Proprietors of Beauce Reservoir[5]; Whitmarsh v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[6]; Hill v. The New River Company[7]; Simkin v. The London & North-western Railway Company[8].\nThe learned counsel referred also to The Railway Act[9], sec. 6 subsection 4 and section 12, and 51 Vic. ch. 20 section 90 sub-section 8 and sections 91 and 184.\nBurns for the respondent. The company was under an obligation to make the highway safe. Fairbanks v. The Great Western Railway Company[10]. The engine should have been stopped when the driver saw the plaintiff\u2019s horses. Tyson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[11]. See also Lister v. Lobley[12].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think these appeals must be dismissed for the reasons given by the majority of the Court of Appeal, namely, the Chief Justice and Osler and McLellan JJ.\nSTRONG J.\u2014At the opening of the argument by the respondents\u2019 counsel, I intimated the opinion that these appeals were entirely unfounded and ought to be dismissed, and I adhere to that opinion.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred in the appeals being dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I think these appeals must be dismissed upon the short ground that the railway company had no authority to interfere with the highway as they did, unless upon the express condition that they should restore it so as not to impair its usefulness. This the jury found that they did not do, and they have attributed the injuries received by the plaintiff to this default.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am of opinion that we should affirm this judgment for the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario\u2014and I shall add only a few observations. Two features of the case are somewhat unusual. One is that the accident and injury occurred without any collision between the locomotive engine and the vehicle in which the injured persons had been driving, and the other is that the negligence in respect of the alteration, which made the highway dangerous and led to the accident, was in the first place the fault of the company that constructed the railway and not that of the defendant company. These features do not, however, involve questions which are new to this court. The former existed in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rosenberger[13], and the latter in Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[14] In both cases the defendant companies were held to be liable.\nAs to the first point, the case of Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas[15] does not appear to me to aid the defendants. The Judicial Committee did not decide in that case that \u201cimpact\u201d was necessary, holding merely that a nervous shock sustained by a lady whose carriage was safely driven across a railway in front of an approaching train, but who was frightened by the proximity of the train, was a cause of damage that was too remote to sustain an action. The case of The Nutting Hill[16] is referred to as containing a correct statement by the Master of the Rolls (Lord Esher) of the rule of English law as to the damages which are recoverable for negligence, viz., that the damages must be the natural and reasonable result of the defendant\u2019s act; such a consequence as in the ordinary state of things would flow from it.\nThe jury found in this case that the proper signals required by the railway law had not been given when the engine was approaching the crossing, and the judgment of the Divisional Court[17] appears to have been rested to a great extent upon that finding and on the authority of Rosenberger\u2019s case. I do not find fault with that judgment, but I think that the defendants are liable to these plaintiffs, even if the statutory-signals were regularly given.\nThe signal would have enabled the driver to stop in good time. Grant that in this case the driver did stop his horses far enough from the crossing to have been, in ordinary circumstances, free from danger. Grant further that the railway engine was lawfully moving, after passing the planked crossing, along the road allowance almost parallel with the travelled track on which the horses were, very much as we sometimes find a railway running alongside a travelled road, or even along the road itself. The tendency in every such case is to frighten horses that are not trained to the phenomenon.\nThe railway company being in the exercise of a right conferred by law will, in the absence of negligence, be free from responsibility for any such casualty. But if a horse in such circumstances takes fright at a passing engine and, by reason of the defective state of the highway, damage is sustained, there must be a remedy against the party by whose act or neglect the highway was insecure. Such was the case of Toms v. The Township of Whitby[18], in which the law on this subject was much discussed in two of the Ontario courts, the Queen\u2019s Bench and the Court of Appeal. The horse of the plaintiff in that case was accidentally startled and backed the carriage over a declivity which the township ought to have protected by a fence. See also the later case of Steinhoff v. Corporation of Kent[19]. The accident in the case before us would not have happened if the railway had not encroached upon the highway or if the declivity formed by the railway cutting had been guarded by a fence or other protection. The jury so found, and the force of their finding is not weakened by the proof, to which our attention is called by the defendants in their factum, that a man coming to the place to make the experiment found that a carriage could be turned on the narrow road that was left, even if the forewheels did not turn under the carriage as they did in Dr. Sibbald\u2019s wagonette. Experiments of that kind seldom reproduce the situation. Important data are apt to be absent, as, in this case, the suddenness of the emergency and the fright of the animals. It is not surprising that the jury paid little attention to the experiments.\nThe unsafe condition of the road was caused by the railway company which is therefore liable for the individual injury even though it may have been caused by what is a public nuisance. The law was so laid down nearly four hundred years ago[20]:\nIf one make a ditch across the high road, and I come riding along the road at night, and I and my horse are thrown into the ditch so that I have thereby great damage and annoyance, I shall have my action against him who made the ditch, because I am more damaged than any other man.\nThe liability under this rule of law would probably not be confined to cases where the working of the railway was concerned in causing an accident, but would embrace other casualties incident to travel upon any road but which do no harm when the road itself is sufficient. In such cases there would be more room than in the present case for arguing that the liability was upon the company that made the cutting and not upon the defendant company. The damage here is caused by the passage of the engine along the road allowance while that portion left for the public remained in the unsafe condition produced by the construction of the railway, or conversely, by leaving the highway in that unsafe condition while the engine moved along the rails beside it.\nThe damages were\u2014to adopt the definition already quoted\u2014\nThe natural and reasonable result of the defendants\u2019 act; such a consequence as in the ordinary state of things would flow from it.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeals.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitors for respondents: McCullough & Burns.\n[1] 18 Ont.

Cette objection fut maintenue par le jugement de l'honorable juge B\u00e9langer qui d\u00e9clara que la cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'avait pas juridiction. La cour de Revision si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montreal, fut unanime \u00e0 renverser le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui fut plus tard remis en force par celui ] de la cour du Bane de la Reine. C'est de ce dernier jugement qu'il y a maintenant appel \u00e0 cette court\nToute cette difficult\u00e9 au sujet de la juridiction de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure cu de la cour de Circuit, pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause provient d'une m\u00e9prise sur le caract\u00e8re de l'action du demandeur. Son action avait double conclusion, 1o pour condamnation au paiement d'une somme de $46000 pour arr\u00e9rages de loyer; 2\u00b0 pour condamnation \u00e0 remettre au demandeur la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e.\nLes $46.00 de balance de loyer n'\u00e9tant pas l'objet principal de la. contestation, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et pay\u00e9es en cour. Il ne reste qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9cider sur la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend avoir droit de retenir pour l'avoir achet\u00e9e. Tel \u00e9tait le but principal de l'action. Le demandeur aurait Pu limiter sa demande \u00e0 la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et son action e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment de la juridiction de Ta cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Est-ce parce qu'il y a ajout\u00e9 la demande de $46.00 que la cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit perdre sa juridiction sur l'objet principal de la demande? Il y aurait absurdit\u00e9 \u00e0 le pr\u00e9tendre.\nL'action est prise conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 1624 C.C qui donne au locataire le droit d'action suivant le cours ordinaire de la Loi ou par proc\u00e9dure sommaire, tel que r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par le code de proc\u00e9dure civile, pour les diverses causes y \u00e9nonc\u00e9es et pour entre autres\u2014\nSous-article 2: rentrer en possession deslieux lou\u00e9s lorsque le locataire continue de les occuper contre le gr\u00e9 du locateur, plus de trois jours \u00e0 l'expiration du bail.\nComme dans la pr\u00e9sente action il ne s'agit ni du loyer dont la balance est pay\u00e9e, ni de dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison d'infraction aux obligations du bail ni de r\u00e9siliation du bail qui avait pris fin avant l'\u00e9ma nation de l'action, mais uniquement de la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont la valeur est suffisante pour donner juridiction \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ii est \u00e9vident que l'action v a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien port\u00e9e.\nOn a cite la cause de Voisard v. Saunders ([11]) pour prouver que la cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'avait pas juridiction. Ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent na aucune application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. Il ne s'agissait l\u00e0 que d'une demande de $60 dont le d\u00e9faut de paiement \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 comme raison pour demander l'annulation du bail. Pans ce cas le montant demand\u00e9 devait r\u00e9gler la juridiction.\nMais ici il n'y a pas demande d'annuler le bail ii avait pris fin,\u2014il n'est question que d'une demande de la possession d'un immeuble d'une valeur suffisante pour rendre l'action de la comp\u00e9tence de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLe d\u00e9faut de paiement n'a rien \u00e0 faire avec la pr\u00e9\" sente demande. Il ne s'agit que d'une revendication d'immeuble.\nLes opinions sont bien partag\u00e9es sur cette question. La cour de Revision, compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Grill Tait et Tellier a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime \u00e0 maintenir la juridiction de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure la cour du Banc de la Reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9e trois contre deux les honorables juges Tessier et Baby en faveur de la juridiction. Pans les deux cours il avait une majorit\u00e9 en faveur du maintien de la juridiction. Il en est autrement dans celle-ci.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2011Je suis d'avis de renvoyer cet appel L'action de l'appelant est pour obtenir la possession d'un certain immeuble par lui lou\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de $138.00 par an \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, qui en retient la possession ill\u00e9galement, malgr\u00e9 que le bail soit expire. Il y joint une demande pour $46.00, valeur d'apr\u00e8s le bail m\u00eame, de cette occupation ill\u00e9gale, et une saisie-gagerie. Par l'article 1624 du code civil, l'appelant pouvait \u00e0 son choix exercer son droit d'action soit en suivant le cours ordinaire de la loi soit par proc\u00e9dure sommaire suivant les dispositions concernant les locateurs et locataires contenues au code de procedure. Il a choisi ce dernier mode. Il est peut-\u00eatre douteux, si maintenant, vi l'article 5977 des Statuts Reviss\u00e9, cette option donn\u00e9e par l'article 1624 du code civil existe en pareil cas. Mais, l'appelant ayant suivi les dispositions de cet amendement et pris une action sommaire, cette question ne se pr\u00e9sente pas dans l'esp\u00e8ce. C'est donc tant sur l'inex\u00e9cution de .l'obligation qui incombait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de lui remettre les pr\u00e9misses \u00e0 l'expiration du bail que sur sa cr\u00e9ance de $46.00 que l'appelant a intent\u00e9 cette action devant la c Dur Sup\u00e9rieure. Et la cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait-elle juridiction dans l'esp\u00e8ce, ou n'est-ce pas la cour de Circuit qui seule pouvait en connaitre\u2014est le seul point en litige ici entre les parties. Cinq des savants juges devant lesquels la cause est venue dans les cours de la province out d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait la cour de Circuit, et quatre que c'\u00e9tait la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure elle-m\u00eame, Belanger J., a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que c'\u00e9tait la cour de Circuit, et, ex proprio motu, a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 l'action \u00e0 raison d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence, ratione materia. La cour de Revision, Tait, Grill et Tellier JJ., a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire; et la cour d'Appel, Dorion, Boss\u00e9 et Doherty JJ., a adopt\u00e9 l'opinion de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure et renvers\u00e9 le jugement de la cour de Revision, monsieur le juge Tessier et monsieur le juge Baby dissentientibus. C'est de ce jugement dont le demandeur se plaint.\nLa cause est d abord venue devant nous sur une motion de l'intim\u00e9 pour renvoi de l'appel, (quash) fond\u00e9e sur ce que cette cour n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence. Nous avons rejet\u00e9 son application sur le motif que, comme il avait par son plaidoyer mis en litige le titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question, ce fait \u00e9tait suffisant, en vertu de la section 29 de l'acte qui r\u00e9git cette Cour, pour nous donner juridiction ([12]).\nMais, maintenant, la question est toute autre, et ii ne s'agit plus de l'acte de la cour Supr\u00eame, mais purement et simplement de 1 interpr\u00e9tation a donner aux statuts de la province sur la question. Et ce n'est pas la mati\u00e8re mise en litige par le plaidoyer de l'intim\u00e9e qui a pu donner \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure juridiction: mais c'est par l'action seule du demandeur qu'il nous faut d\u00e9cider, si, des le d\u00e9but, il \u00e9tait rectus in curi\u00e2.\nLa solution de la question ne m'a pas paru des plus facile. Elle est compliqu\u00e9e par la variance qui existe entre les deux versions de l'article 5977 des Statuts Refondus, comme elle existait dans les deux versions de l'article 887 du code originaire, dont il n'est que la reproduction. La version fran\u00e7aise du nouvel article 888 dit que l'action entre locateurs et locataires est intent\u00e9e devant la cour de Circuit, ou la cour Sup\u00e9rieure suivant la valeur ou le montant du loyer r\u00e9clam\u00e9, et la version anglaise, dit: according to the amount or the value of the rent \" \" suivant la valeur ou le montant du loyer \" omettant le mot claimed \" \" r\u00e9clam\u00e9.\" Suivant la version anglaise ii est \u00e9vident que l'action de l'appelant, qui all\u00e8gue un loyer de $138000 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien prise devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, vu que la cour de Circuit par l'article 5994 des Statuts Refondus n'a pas juridiction au chef-lieu d'un district au-dessus de $100. C'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 ce que disait clairement la section 4 du chapitre 40 des Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada de 1860 en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que l la valeur annuelle ou loyer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e d\u00e9terminera la juridiction de la cour quel que soit d'ailleurs le montant des dommages et du loyer r\u00e9clam\u00e9s.\" Sous cette loi, si un locateur r\u00e9clamait $50.00 sur un loyer de $400.00, son action. \u00e9tait du ressort de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et s'il r\u00e9clamait $400.00 sur un loyer de $50.00, son action tombait Sous la juridiction de la cour de Circuit. Et la section 19 ordonnait que dans ce dernier cas c'est-\u00e0-dire quand une action exc\u00e9dant $200.00 \u00e9tait intent\u00e9e devant la cour de Circuit, les frais pouvaient \u00eatre taxes conform\u00e9ment au tarif le la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Mais cet acte fut amend\u00e9 en 1862 par la 25 V. c. 12 qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que dans le but de diminuer les frais, toute action entre locateurs e locataires serait intent\u00e9e devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure ou la cour de Circuit pour le montant du loyer ou des dommages demand\u00e9s, les frais \u00e0 \u00eatre tax\u00e9s suivant le montant du jugement. Puis est venu l'article 887 du code de proc\u00e9dure donn\u00e9 comme loi pr\u00e9existante, maintenant 888, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te comme la 25 V. c. 12 le faisait mais en termes plus heureux, que les actions entre locateurs et locataires sont intent\u00e9es soit devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure soit devant la cour de Circuit suivant la valeur ou le montant du loyer r\u00e9clam\u00e9. C'est donc la version fran\u00e7aise de l'article qui doit pr\u00e9valoir: car la version anglaise laisserait la loi telle qu'elle \u00e9tait en 1860. Or, je l'ai dit, la 25 V., que le code a reproduit, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e sp\u00e9cialement pour l'amender. Quand, dans une action pour expulsion, aucun loyer n'est r\u00e9clam\u00e9, cet article pris seul, peut laisser des doutes: mais quand comme dans le cas actuel, ii y a une conclusion pour $46.00, que ce soit pour le loyer convenu, ou pour usage et Occupation suivant l'article 1608 du code civil ne fait aucune diff\u00e9rence ii me semble impossible de dire que la cour Sup\u00e9rieure a juridiction. Ce serait rayer du code l'article entier.\nL'appelant, par un argument reductio ad absurdum, dit que s'il n'avait pas conclu \u00e0 une condamnation pour $46.00, son action serait clairement du ressort de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, puisque son bail est de $138.00, et qu'il est absurde pour l'intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9tendre que parce qu'il a ajout\u00e9 une demande de $46.00 \u00e0 une action du ressort de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure cette action est par l\u00e0 devenue une action de la cour de Circuit. Cela peut bien \u00eatre la cons\u00e9quence, ou pour mieux dire l'incons\u00e9quence de la loi; mais ne prouve pas que telle n'est pas la loi.\nUne action sous l'acte des locateurs et locataires en expulsion d'un immeuble de quelque valeur qu'il soit, et quel que soit le montant du bail, doit, lorsque le demandeur v joint des conclusions pour loyer ou dommages, \u00catre prise soit \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. soit \u00e0 la cour de Circuit suivant le montant du loyer ou des dommages demand\u00e9s. L'article 888 s'applique \u00e0 toutes les actions entre locateurs et locataires. S'il ne s'y trouve aucune telle conclusion, cas qui sera toujours bien rare, alors, la juridiction serait peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la valeur ou le montant du loyer. Ce serait l\u00e0 il me semble, la seule interpr\u00e9tation dont l'article du code soit susceptible, si l'on explique les deux versions l'une avec l'autre ou l'une par l'autre et sans perdre de vue la l\u00e9gislation pr\u00e9existante et l'article 1105 du code de proc\u00e9dure.\nSi comme le soutient l'appelant, c'est le montant du loyer dans tous les cas et non le montant demand\u00e9 qui doit r\u00e9gler la juridiction, il s'en suivrait qu'une action de $300 pour dommages ou pour arr\u00e9rages sur un loyer de $80 serait du ressort de la cour de Circuit. C'\u00e9tait l\u00e0, je l'ai dit, la loi de 1860; mais c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le contraire qui est maintenant d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9\nNous n'avons cependant pas \u00e0 prononcer sur le cas o\u00f9 la demande ne comporte pas de conclusions \u00e0 une condamnation p\u00e9cuniaire.\nici l'appelant a demand\u00e9 $46 par son action et, je suis d'avis avec la cour du Bane de la Reine, que la cour de Circuit seule avait juridiction, malgr\u00e9 que le bail fut de $138 et qu'il eut aussi conclu \u00e0 l'expulsion de l'intim\u00e9e des pr\u00e9misses.\nQu'il ait demand\u00e9 l'un avant l'autre, on n'ait conclu que subsidiaire ment ou accessoirement \u00e0 $46 ne me parait faire aucune diff\u00e9rence. L'article 1105 du code de proc\u00e9dure invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelant comme appuyant sa doctrine me semble tout au contraire militer fortement contre lui. Il peut se lire de deux mani\u00e8res. La premi\u00e8re, et la plus grammaticale peut-\u00eatre d'apr\u00e8s la ponctuation, serait de ne pas connecter le mot \" loyer \" avec le mot \" r\u00e9clam\u00e9s.\" Dans ce cas l'article dirait que dans tous les cas o\u00f9 le loyer n'exc\u00e8de pas $200 la cour de Circuit a. juridiction, quelque \u00e9lev\u00e9 que soit le montant demand \u00a7 pour arr\u00e9rages. Mais l'article, ici aussi, est donn\u00e9 comme la loi existante lors de la mise en force du code. Or cette loi je l'ai dit, \u00e9tait l'acte de 1862 qui d\u00e9cr\u00e9ta.t pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que c'\u00e9tait le montant demand\u00e9, et non le montant du loyer, qui d\u00e9terminerait la juridiction dans toute action sans restrictions entre locateurs et locataires. Et puisque le l\u00e9gislateur a non seulement par le code civil originaire, mais depuis par les Statuts 'Refondus de 1888, statu\u00e9 en termes qui ne pr\u00eatent \u00e0 aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, que c'\u00e9tait le montant demand\u00e9 qui devait contr\u00f4ler, il faut donner \u00e0 l'article 1105 une interpr\u00e9tation qui le concilie avec cette l\u00e9gislation et y lire avec elle que, dans tous les cas o\u00f9 le loyer demand\u00e9 n'exc\u00e8de pas $200.00, la cour de Circuit a juridiction et que, quel que soit le montant du loyer, c'est le montant demand\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre le guide. C'est, de fait, pour les actions purement pour dette, rien autre chose que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur la mati\u00e8re, que le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter sp\u00e9cialement, parce qu'en 1860 on l'avait modifi\u00e9e.\nJ'ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 .a question au point de vue de l'appelant et comme \u00a1si tel qu'il le soutient, l'article 5994 des Statuts Refondus s'applique, aux chefs-lieux, aux. actions entre locateurs et locataires: en sorte que la cour Sup\u00e9rieure ait juridiction dans ces actions comme dans toutes autres pourvu qu'elles exc\u00e8dent $100.00. Il peut y avoir des doutes l\u00e0-dessus cependant; v\u00fb surtout l'article 1105 du code de procedure qui est rest\u00e9 intact. Mais la question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, et l'ayant prise comme r\u00e9solue dans le sens favorable \u00e0 l'appelant ii me serait oiseux de consid\u00e9rer si elle n'est \"pas susceptible d'une solution contraire\nL'appelant a \u00e9mis la proposition, qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendamment du montant de son loyer annuel son action est du ressort de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure comme \u00e9tant r\u00e9elle, immobili\u00e8re; par le seul fait qu'il conclut \u00e0 la possession d'un immeuble dune valeur d'au-dessus de $2000. Cette proposition, me para\u00eet erronn\u00e9e. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour donner juridiction \u00e0 la cour de Circuit sur ce genre d'actions que l'article 1105 du code de proc\u00e9dure est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9; autrement il n'a pas sa raison d'\u00eatre. Quelle serait la cons\u00e9quence directe de la doctrine de l'appelant? Evidemment, que toute action en expulsion ou en r\u00e9siliation de bail, quelle que f\u00fbt l'exiguit\u00e9 et du montant r\u00e9clame et du loyer serait du ressort de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Ne serait-ce pas. l\u00e0 ignorer la loi, et entraver l'action du l\u00e9gislateur qui afin d'en diminuer les frais, et dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat tant des propri\u00e9taires souvent en pr\u00e9sence de locataires insolvables que des locataires eux-m\u00eames, a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 ces dispositions sp\u00e9ciales sur leurs contestations devant les tribunaux et investi par exception la cour de Circuit d'une juridiction dont, suivant les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, sur la mati\u00e8re la cour Sup\u00e9rieure seule serait rev\u00eatue?\nL'appelant a de plus dit que, son bail avec l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tant expire les relations de locateur et locataire entre eux n'existaient plus Mais l'art 1624 du code civil dit express\u00e9ment que l'action en expulsion apr\u00e8s l'expiration du bail peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e par proc\u00e9dure sommaire. Et d'ailleurs, le demandeur a r\u00e9pondu d'avance; lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 sa proposition, d'abord en prenant une saisie-gagerie; en second lieu, en prenant des proc\u00e9dures sommaires sous les clauses concernant les locateurs et locataires et signifiant le douze septembre une action rapportable le seize; et, en troisi\u00e8me lieu, en ne payant la taxe judiciaire et les honoraires des officiers de la cour que sur une action de la classe de $100000 \u00e0 $200.00, et non ceux d'une action de premi\u00e8re classe.

The manager of the company acknowledged receipt of proofs of death which were subsequently sent without complaining of want of notice, and ultimately declined to pay the claim on the ground that the death was caused HIV disease and therefore the company could not recognize their liability. At the trial there was some conflicting evidence as to whether the erysipelas resulted solely from the wound but the court found on the facts that the erysipelas followed as a direct result from the external injury. On appeal to the Supreme Court:\nHeld reversing the judgment of the Court below, Fournier and Patterson JJ. dissenting that the company had not received sufficient notice of the death to satisfy the requirements of the policy and that by declining to pay the claim on other grounds there had been no waiver of any objection which they had a right to urge in this regard.\nPer Strong Fournier and Patterson JJ. that the external injury was the proximate or sole cause of death within the meaning of the policy.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) rendered on the 21st March, 1891, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court (Mr. Justice Tellier) ([1]) of the 13th September, 1889, condemning the defendants to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $5,000 with interest and costs of suit.\nThe action was brought to recover from the defendants the sum of $5000 under and by virtue of a certain policy of insurance issued by the said defendants insuring one William Wilson, against death by accident.\nThe material clauses of the policy and the facts and pleadings are sufficiently stated in the head note and in the judgments hereinafter given ([2]).\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Cross for appellant, cited and relied on Porter's Laws of Insurance ([3]) Cawley v.

([35]) Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. The appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) rendered on the 21st of March, 1891, unanimously confirming a judgment rendered by the Superior Court, in the district of Montreal, on the 13th September, 1889 which condemned the defendants (now appellants) to pay the plaintiff (now respondent) the sum Of $5,000 claimed by her upon the death of her husband under the provisions of an accident policy issued by the defendants\nI am not by any means satisfied on the evidence that the deceased died solely in consequence of the external bodily injuries which he had sustained ( Smith v. Accident Ins. Co. ([36]) but assuming that he did as alleged in plaintiff's declaration, I think, no immediate or due and sufficient notice was ever given as provided for by the policy.\nThe accident happened upon the 21st of March 1886 the insured died on the 13th of April following; the notice of the accident and death was only sent to the company on the 29th of April one month and eight days after the accident; and sixteen days after the death and notice was only received in Montreal on the 1st of May. I cannot think that this was any compliance with the express provision of the policy, which is as follows:\nCONDITIONS.\u20111 In the event of any accident or injury for which claim may be made under this policy, or in case of death resulting therefrom IMMEDIATE NOTICE must be given in writing addressed to the manager of this company, at Montreal, stating the full name, occupation and address of the insured, with full particulars of the accident and injury; and failure to give such immediate written notice shall invalidate all claims under this policy; and unless direct or affirmative proof of the same and of the death or duration of total disability shall be furnished to the manager of the company within three months from, the happening of such accident in the event of death or SIX months in the case of non-fatal injury, then all claims accruing under this policy shall be absolutely invalid and of no effect.\nIt appears that the policy had been lost this perhaps may account for the neglect to give the notice, but it does not dispense with the necessity of a compliance with the terms of the policy. Mr. May lays it down that inability by reason of the loss of the policy, is no excuse and Mr. Crawley in his work on Life Insurance says ([37]):\nWhere it is a condition precedent to the right to recover on an accident policy that notice giving particulars of the accident should be delivered to the head office of the company within nine days, the principle of Taylor v. Caldwell ([38]) does not apply, and the condition is not discharged by the fact that the accident resulting in instaneous death, and no other person knowing of the existence of the policy, notice could not be given. It is not a case of impossibility owing to the act of God; the insured might have provided for the Contingency by informing others of the policy Gamble v. Accident Insurance Co., Limited ([39]).\nI do not think mere silence is enough to constitute a waiver there was no admission or act done with the intention of influencing the conduct of the holder of the policy or by which he could be prejudiced.\nMr. May shows very clearly the distinction between a failure to give notice within the time required and to give the notice in form. He says ([40]):\nA failure to give notice within the time required stands upon a different ground from the failure to give the notice in due form. The latter defect may be remedied by a new and more accurate form but the former if insisted upon by the insurers is irremediable. It may, indeed, be waived, but it would be reasonable to require a different kind of evidence from that which ought to be satisfactory in cases of a mere defect in form The silence of the insurers upon a mere defect of form might be very injurious to the assured, since, if the defect were pointed out to him, he might at once supply the deficiency, and save himself from loss A. failure to give the notice in due time on the contrary, leaves the insured entirely at the mercy of the insurers, and to point out to him the fact will not in the least aid him to remedy the defect. The omission to point it out to him is therefore no wrong, or prejudice or want of good faith towards him, nor is the insurer under any legal obligation so to do. Patrick v. Farmers' Ins. Co. ([41]); St. Louis Ins. Co. v. Kyle ([42]); Edwards v. Bait. Fire Ins. Co. ([43]); Post par. 471. In American Express Co. v. Triumph Ins. Co. ([44]), it is said that the acceptance of proofs without objection had never been held a waiver of neglect in point of time, when the policy provided that the proofs should be presented as soon as possible. But see contra Palmer v. St. Paul. &c., Ins. Co. ([45]).\nThere are no facts in dispute. I am unable to understand how it can be said that a delay of one month and eight days after the accident, and sixteen days after the death was a compliance with the provision requiring immediate notice.\nThe plaintiff's declaration does not directly set forth the clause of the policy we are now considering. It is as follows :\nThat both before and after the said accident the said William Wilson had used all due diligence for his personal safety, protection and preservation, and had. in every way complied with the clauses and conditions of the said policy of insurance\u00bb and his said accident and subsequent death were covered by the said policy;\nThat within due time after the death of the said William Wilson, the plaintiff furnished the defendants with sufficient proof of said accident and death according to the conditions of said policy, and then and ever since conformed herself to and fulfilled all the requirements of said policy, and duly demanded payment of the sum of five thousand dollars which became due and payable to her in virtue of said policy upon the happening of the aforesaid events;\nThat the defendants illegally and without just cause or reason, refused and still refuse to pay plaintiff the said sum or any part thereof, though they have frequently acknowledged their liability thereof.\nNow, it is abundantly clear that no notice as required was given after the accident and before the death and none was furnished to defendants within due time after the death of Mr. Wilson according to the conditions of the said policy nor did plaintiff conform herself to, nor fulfil all the requirements of the said conditions, nor is there any evidence that the defendants frequently as alleged, or at any time, acknowledged their liability; on the contrary, the proof is directly the opposite.\nNow it is clear, that having made these allegations the burden was on the assured or plaintiff, to show that she has complied with the requirements of the policy which she has failed to do\nBut it is alleged that defendants waived the fulfillment of the conditions of the policy but this is not the case set up by the plaintiff in her declaration, or that which the defendants were by the pleadings called on to answer. It is true that the plaintiff, in answer to the defendant's pleas which are as follows:\u2014\nThat in and by one of the conditions contained in the said policy of insurance declared on by the said plaintiff and forming part of the contract thereby entered into, it was specially stipulated and agreed as follows, and in the words following: I In the event of any accident or injury for which claim may be made under this policy, or in case of death resulting therefrom, immediate notice must be given in writing, addressed to the manager of this company, at Montreal, stating full name occupation and address of the insured, with full particulars of the accident and injury; and failure to give such immediate written notice shall invalidate all claims under this policy; and unless direct or affirmative proof of the same, and of the death or duration of total disability shall be furnished to the manager of the company within three months from the happening of such accident, in the event of death or six months in the case of non-fatal injury, then all claims accruing under this policy shall be absolutely invalid and of on effect.\nThat the death of the said William Wilson occurred on the thirteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six. as alleged in the plaintiff 's declaration, but the said plaintiff wholly failed and neglected to notify the said defendants as required by the said above recited condition until long after the death and burial of the said William Wilson, to wit, on the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, a period of sixteen days thereafter and which notification was only received by the said defendants at their head office in Montreal on the first day of May one thousand eight hundred and Eighty-six.\nThat the said plaintiff has wholly failed and neglected to comply with the terms and conditions of the said policy of insurance\nThat by reason of the said above recited condition and of the premises all claims under and by virtue of the said policy became invalidated and the same are invalid and of no effect and cannot be enforced against the said defendant.\nReaffirmed the performance of this condition, and at the same time set up a waiver. Assuming that there was no necessity for plaintiff to allege waiver in her declaration and that it was sufficient for her to do it in the replication I can discover nothing to justify me in saying that the company waived the performance of this condition of the policy. It appears to me to have been a case of all others requiring immediate notice, and the company appears to have had an agent at Wilmington, to whom no notice appears to have been given, even if that would have been sufficient, which I do not think it would under the terms of the policy. I am therefore of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am clear to allow this appeal. No doubt that erysipelas immediately resulting from the accident was the proximate cause of death, and the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover if he had brought himself within the conditions But he did not give the notice required by the condition unless as argued the word i immediate \" has reference only to death, an interpretation which is, however, totally inadmissible. There is no ground whatever for saving there was any waiver. The loss of the policy could not prejudice the company or dispense with the conditions against them. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs. FOURNIER J.\u2014was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court below and also for the reasons stated in the judgment of Patterson J.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action dismissed upon the company's plea of want of due notice.\nIt was specially stipulated and agreed in the contract between the parties that\nIn the event of any accident or injury for which claim may be had. under this policy or in case of death resulting therefrom immediate notice must be given in writing, addressed to the manager of this company, at Montreal, stating full name, occupation and address of the insured, with full particulars of the accident and injury.\nIt is in the evidence that the accident from which the late William Wilson died happened on the 21st of March 1886 and that he died on the 13th day of April following but that notice thereof was only sent to the company on the 29th of April, sixteen days after the death which notice was only received by them in Montreal on the 1st day of May.\nNow by the law which rules this case there can be no doubt that the aforesaid condition of the said policy must be given its full force and effect.\nDalloz Repertoire Vo.

The respondent certainly brought to our notice some cases which \"would appear to support her contention on this point. But however this maybe, the law on the question is in my opinion entirely against her. Certainly such conditions can be waived. Article 2478 C. C. expressly recognizes it, but of such a waiver, there is in my opinion not a title of evidence in this case. The respondent cannot deny it, but she wants us to presume or infer waiver from the conduct of the company. But the company did nothing here to mislead her. When on the 29th day of April she for the first time, notified the company at their head office in Montreal, her right of action was then gone and nothing that the company did afterwards can have revived it. It is a well established proposition of law that a renunciation to a right is never to be presumed.\nComme personne n'est facilement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 renoncer \u00e0 son droit, les renonciations expresses ou tacites doivent dtre strictement resserr\u00e9es dans leurs termes, jamais on ne doit les \u00e9tendre d'un cas \u00e0 un autre.

Solon, nullit\u00e9s ([53]).\nSee also Lancashire Ins. Co. v. Chapman ([54]) where the Privy Council, in a case, it is true, from Quebec, held that a notice had been waived but upon acts by the company which necessarily implied an acknowledgment of their liability.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nPATTERSON J.__I remain of the opinion which I was inclined to at the hearing of this appeal, that there is no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment in which the courts below have concurred.\nThe more formidable of the two main grounds of appeal is that which relates to the somewhat tardy notice of the accident. The condition calls for immediate notice, but the word \" immediate \" cannot be taken in its strict etymological meaning. The absurdity of that is easily shown It would require a man who gets hurt, say e. g. in a railway accident, to give notice before doing any intermediate act. He must get home first or to some place where a notice can be written, and when there he would to a certainty do some other intermediate thing, if it were only to get his hurts attended to. How then is the word to be understood in a contract like this, or in a statute which requires an immediate notice or something to be done immediately after something else ? We shall find a sensible and practical answer to the question given by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in The Queen v. Justices of Berkshife (1) :\n\"The question\" he said \" is substantially one of fact. It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to what is the meaning of the word 'immediately' in all cases. The words 'forthwith' and 'immediately ' have the same meaning. They are stronger than the expression 'within a reasonable time,' and imply prompt, vigorous action without any delay and whether there has been such action is a question of fact, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.\"\nIf the appellants had said when they received the notice in this case that it was not the notice they bargained for because it did not enable them to make prompt inquiry into the facts while they were fresh or to take such steps as they might have taken to prevent serious consequences, it is not likely that any court would have said they put too strict a construction on the condition as applied to the circumstances The sufficiency of the notice as a compliance with the condition was a question of fact, and the company's view of the fact may not improperly be gathered from its conduct. What was done was precisely what would (1) 4Q.B.D. 469. have been done if an unobjectionable notice had been given\u2014receiving proofs of the claim, investigating the particulars, and intimating the decision to resist on the ground that the accident or injury was not covered by the policy.\nNow whether we regard the company as having conceded the sufficiency of the notice as a question of fact and acting on that concession, hold the condition satisfied, which is the formal finding of the court below; or hold that the company waived the giving of the notice in the precise terms of the condition, which is the view intimated by Mr. Justice Cross s or that the company is estopped from insisting upon the condition, which might not be a strained conclusion; the result is the same. I see no good reason to find fault with the conclusion, nor do I think it important to examine the grounds of it more closely.\nAs to the other ground of appeal which has afforded room for some ingenious discussion, I cannot see my way to question, much less to reverse, the decision of the courts below.\nThere is ample evidence to sustain the finding of fact that the bruise or abrasion or wound on the leg of the deceased caused by the accident of his falling off the verandah, led to his death.\nThe medical evidence cannot be taken to establish any facts inconsistent with the findings of the court below. Much stress has properly been laid upon the post-mortem examination. The facts ascertained upon that examination by the pathologist who made it and the local physician who assisted him are, of course, beyond the reach of dispute. But the deductions from those facts stand on a different footing and as to them the doctors differ. The autopsy revealed some pneumonic consolidation of one lung and traces of a disease of the kidneys. Three opinions, more or less divergent, are given respecting these discoveries. One is that they may indicate some debilitating disease that may have predisposed the patient to erysipelas another makes them account for the attack of erysipelas; and the c third treats them as either of no significance in connection with the erysipelas, or as secondary to or resulting from it is plain that those differences are not for us to reconcile, and that for the purpose of this appeal the broader facts alone can be looked at. These are that in consequence of the injury to the leg of the deceased erysipelas set in, involving the whole of the limb from the foot upwards. The examination did not disclose any indications of pyaemia poisoning\", but the presence of considerable quantities of pus in the leg, in conjunction with the evidence furnished by the absence of surgical incisions which would have promoted the discharge of the pus led to the inference that the treatment of the patient had not been skilful\nThe conclusion of fact that the erysipelas from which the insured died was due directly to the injury and not to any diseased condition of the system was as I have said fully warranted by the evidence, and must be accepted by us.\nThe contusion of law, against which the appellants contend is that under the circumstances it was not a case of death caused (within the words of the policy) \" wholly or in part by bodily infirmities or disease existing prior to or subsequent to the date of this contract,\" but that the injury was \" the proximate or sole cause of the death\"\nThere is frequently some difficulty in satisfactorily interpreting the language of provisos like that from which. I quote these words. I cannot say that that is so in the present instance. As soon as we abandon the notion than other diseases such as the diseases of the lungs or kidneys of which traces were found, produced or aided in producing the erysipelas, the reference to \" bodily infirmities or disease existing prior or subsequent to the date of this contract\" becomes inapplicable to the case. It would be straining the language and giving a delusive character to the contract to understand a disease produced by an accident against which the company insures to be included in the reference.\nIt would be straining the language if we had nothing but the words of the proviso to guide us. But the contract itself helps to define the extent of these words. The insurance applies in cases of death whenever the fatal result follows within ninety days of the accident. During that interval it is obvious that the insured is contemplated as suffering from the effects of the accident, and it must be also contemplated that his sufferings may take the form of a disease that has a name of its own, it may be pyaemia, or tetanus, or erysipelas, or congestion of the brain, or something else, but still the direct consequence of his injury and the path by which the fatal result is approached. It would make the contract a delusion to hold that in any such case the liability of the company was gone by reason of the exception of death from bodily infirmity or disease existing subsequent to the date of the contract.\nA force is claimed for the word \" proximate,\" which again would reduce the contract to a delusive pretence of insurance. Leave erysipelas out of view for the moment. A disease more readily recognized, at least in popular estimation, as the result of an injury is tetanus, one development of which is lock-law. Can it be contended that a person whose hand or foot is injured and who in consequence dies of tetanus, did not die from the injury as, within the meaning of this policy, the proximate cause of his death? It might as well be argued that in the case of a gunshot wound that severs an artery and the man bleeds to death because no one happens to be present with the means or the skill to stop the flow of blood the proximate cause of death was not the wound, but the exhaustion from loss of blood.\nThe construction of the proviso for which the appellants contend seems to treat the word \" proximate\" as referring only to the order of time That is not its meaning here. The contract is to pay if the death happens within ninety days. During that interval secondary or resulting c causes of death,\" as that expression might be used in the report of a post-mortem examination mast often intervene nearer in point of time to the death, but still not the proximate cause.\nThe proviso in the policy distinguishes between death from an injury, as a direct consequence, and death from bodily infirmities and disease not caused by the injury. The latter cause of death gives no claim under the policy, the former, which is designated the proximate cause, gives a claim. The word \"proximate\" I understand to be used in the sense of \" direct,\" which seems to be the word employed in English policies. It is so in the policies which were in question in Fitton v. Accidental Death Ins. Co. ([55]) Smith v. Accident Insurance Go ([56]) in Winspear v The Accident ins, Co. ([57]) and in Lawrence v. The Accidental Ins. Go ([58]).\nIn this sense the word has a useful and sufficient signification. For example, a man suffering from some disease brought on by an accidental and violent injury, involving perhaps congestion, or suppuration, or inflammation like the peritonitis discussed in one of the American cases N. American Life and Accident Go. v. Burroughs ([59]), and threatening a fatal termination, happens to die from heart disease with which the injury had nothing to do, although the condition of the patient may have made him more liable to an acute attack. The proviso would protect the company, while if the death had been from the peritonitis or other effect of the injury the injury would have been the proximate .cause of it within the meaning of the policy.\nI do not think it necessary to go into a detailed discussion of the cases cited to us though I have not failed to examine them. I may say generally that the principle on which the policies and facts in the various cases have as a rule, been discussed is that which I have applied to the construction of the policy before us. I have already incidentally mentioned the principal English cases. Several of the American decisions are direct authorities for the construction contended for by the respondent.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants : Selkirk Cross.\nSolicitor for respondent : E.

Sale of timber limits\u2014 Licenses\u2014Plan\u2014Description\u2014Damages\u2014Art. 992 C. C. Prractice\u2014Title of cause.\nWhere the holder of a timber license does not verify the correctness of the official description of the lands to be covered by the license before it issues, and after Its issue works on lands and makes improvements on a branch of a river which he believed formed part of his limits, but was subsequently ascertained by survey to from part of adjoining limits, he cannot recover from the Crown for losses sustained by acting on an understanding derived from a plan furnished by the Crown prior to the sale. Fournier J. dissenting.\nPer Patterson J. The licensee's remedy would be by action to cancel the license under art. 992 C. C. with a claim for compensation for moneys expended. .\nIn this case the action was instituted against the Government of the province of Quebec, but when the case came up for hearing on the appeal to the Supreme Court, the court ordered that the name of Her Majesty the Queen be substituted for that of the Government of the province of Quebec.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, by which judgment the petition of the said appellant was dismissed with costs\nThe petition of the appellant was made under section 5976 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec and was granted by the Lieutenant Governor of the province of Quebec in accordance with article 886 d. C. C. P. amended.\nThe circumstances which gave rise to the litigation are briefly as follows:\u2014\nOn the 15th August 1880 the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the province of Quebec advertised in the public newspapers that he would sell at public auction on the 15th October following, 1880, certain timber limits in conformity with the Provincial Act, 36 Vic, ch. 9.\nAmong the limits mentioned in the said public notice was the following: \" Rimouski Agency, Limit River St. Pierre, 26 square miles.\" The following also former part of said public notice: \"Plans exhibiting these timber limits will be open for inspection at the Department of Crown Lands in this city (Quebec) and at the agent's office for these localities from this day (14th August, 1880) to the day of sale.\" This notice was signed by Mr. E. E. Tach\u00e9, Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands On the said 15th October 1880, the said timber limits were adjudged to Messrs. King & Bros., they being the highest bidders.\nA plan of these limits was exhibited at the Crown Lands Department offices, which previous to the sale was inspected and examined by the subsequent purchasers Messrs. King & Bros. This plan showed that the River St Pierre traversed the 3rd and 4th ranges of the township of Awantjish.\nThe following license was subsequently issued;\u2014\nDESCRIPTION OF LIMIT NO. 56.\nN. B.\u2014To be dated and signed by the agent.\nRIVER ST. PIERRE.\nTo commence from the rear line of the Seigniory of Lake Metapedia, to extend thence up the River St. Pierre a distance of six and \u00e0 half miles measured on a due south-west course and to include in breadth the first, second, third and fourth ranges of the township of Awantjish. The said timber limit being bounded to the north-east by the line of Seigniory of Lake M etapedia to the south-west by the township of Cabot and to the south-east by the line between the fourth and fifth ranges of Awantjish Township, containing an area of twenty-six and half square miles, more or less.\nCrown Timber Office,\nRimouski, 2nd December, 1880.\nGeo. Sylvain,\nCr. Tr. Agt.\nOn the 24th November following (1881) these limits were transferred by King & Brothers to the present petitioner Mr. Grant. This transfer was duly accepted\" by the Crown Lands Department and a new license in similar terms was issued to Mr. Grant signed by the said Crown Timber Agent and dated 6th December, 1881.\nIn the year 1885, Messrs. Martin & Lebel acquired by public auction from the Government of the \"province of Quebec, the remainder of the said township of Awautish, namely the fifth, sixth and seventh ranges of the said township. A survey was then caused to be made by Messrs. Martin & Lebel to ascertain the dividing line between the fourth and fifth ranges of the said township that is the line dividing the limits of Mr.Grant from those of Messrs. Martin & Lebel. Mr, John Hill was the surveyor employed. From his survey it was ascertained that the principal branch of this river St. Pierre did not run through the third and fourth ranges of this township, but that it ran through and across the fifth range, namely, through the limits that had been subsequently purchased by Messrs. Martin & Lebel. In the interval the appellant, viz., for four years from 1881 to 1885 carried on successful lumbering operations on this branch of the river, when Messrs. Martin & Lebel seized a large quantity of timber that Mr. Grant had cut near this river on the fifth range and appellant was obliged to pay $5,000 for its release. Thereupon the appellant brought a petition of right claiming $100000 damages.\nThe respondent pleaded: that the Rivi\u00e8re St., Pierre limit was described in the license according to the notice published in the Official Gazette, and according to the deposited plan; King Brothers never made any complaint about their license in virtue of the rules of the department, the purchaser must verify the correctness of the official description before the issuing of the license the bounds of the Rivi\u00e8re St. Pierre limit are visible and were so at the time of the sale and the Crown has always been ready to refund any money unduly exacted by the agents of the Lands Department.\nIssue being joined the evidence taken at the trial showed that the River St. Pierre has, two branches, one running through the Grant limit with almost no current, and the other, wider and deeper, more suitable for lumbering operations, running through the Martin & Lebel limit.\nThe Superior Court whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) dismissed the petition, holding that the principal branch of the river flowed through the limit granted to the appellant, and that it had been correctly described.\nWhen the case first came before the Supreme Court it was objected that the defendant being styled the Government of the province of Quebec, no judgment could he entered against the Government, and by consent it was agreed that Her Majesty the Queen be substituted as the respondent in the case.\nHutchinson appeared for the appellant and contended that the principal river which was purchased on the Crown's representation was the branch running through Martin & Lebel's limits, and therefore he should recover the difference of value in the two limits and the expenses (1). Addison on Contracts (1).\nBedard for respondent contended there was no error and that the Profits made on the Crown's domain during four years by the appellant more than compensated any damage suffered by reason of any error as to the location of the river.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Notwithstanding the forcible judgment of my brother Fournier which he has permitted me to read, and which 1 have very carefully considered I hare not been able to come to the conclusion at which he has arrived. I cannot think that the Government guaranteed in any way the position of the River St. Pierre on the limits.\nThe boundaries of the limits are clear and distinct, and their position admits of no doubt. If petitioner made improvements or works on any other lands than those confined within the boundaries of the limits granted to him he did it at his own risk and peril and can impute the loss only to himself.\nI am not satisfied that if the Crown incurred any liability by reason of the position of the river as designated on the plan the petitioner would have any substantial cause of complaint, because the purchaser had delivered to him all the department sold viz., the four first ranges and he has not been disturbed in the enjoyment of the limits described in his license, and because it appears that the branch of the river containing the most water, and which the Crown's witness, Hill, says is wider and deeper, though perhaps not the most useful for driving logs by reason of the sluggishness of the current, is in the limits of the petitioner as described in the license and in accordance with the notice published in the Official Gazette and according to the deposited plan, and because in accordance with the rules of the department the purchaser is required to verify the correctness of the official description before the issuing of the license. It seems to me that this is the very object of depositing the plan for two months in the department and with the local agent viz., to enable the would-be purchaser to do this, and it is hardly to be supposed that any party would purchase limits without having taken the precaution of examining by himself or his agent the limits, or making such other inquiries as would make him acquainted with the exact position and capabilities of the limits for lumbering operations.\nUnder these circumstances I think the judgment of the court of first instance, confirmed by the unanimous jndgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the conclusion at which the Chief Justice has arrived is the only proper one and would dismiss the appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Par sa petition de droit, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour le district de Qu\u00e9bec, l'appelant demandait \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 le montant des dommages que lui avait caus\u00e9s une erreur commise par le d\u00e9partement des terres publiques de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la description d'une limite \u00e0 bois qu'il avait achet\u00e9e du d\u00e9partement \u00e0 une vente \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re publique.\nLe 14 ao\u00fbt 1880 le commissaire des terres de la province de Qu\u00e9bec avait annonc\u00e9 qu'il vendrait \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re publique le 15 octobre suivant (1880), un certain nombre de limites \u00e0 bois, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'acte 36 Vic. c. 9. Parmi les limites mentionn\u00e9es dans cet avis se trouvait la suivante\nRimouski Agency, Lirait River St. Pierre, 26 square miles.\nDans cette annonce se trouvait la declaration suivante:\nPlans exhibiting these timber limits will be open for inspection at the Department of Crown Lands in this city (Quebec) and at the Agent's Office for these localities from this day (14th August, 1880) to the day of sale.\nCet avis \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 E. E. Tach\u00e9 assistant-commissaire des terres de la couronne.\nLe 15 octobre 1880 la limite ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e fut adjug\u00e9e \u00e0 MM. King et Freres qui \u00e9taient les plus hauts ench\u00e9risseurs. Une licence fat \u00e9mise en leur faveur en date du 2 d\u00e9cembr\u00e9 1880.\nLe 24 novembre 1881, cette limite fut transport\u00e9e par MM. King et Fr\u00e8res \u00e0 l'appelant. Le transport fut accep\u00e9\u00e9 par le d\u00e9partement et une nouvelle licence sign\u00e9e pa,r l'agent de la couronne, en date du G d\u00e9cembre 1881 fut accord\u00e9e au nom de l'appelant.\nEn conformit\u00e9 de l'avis de la vente, un plan de la limite en question fut expos\u00e9 pour l'information des acheteurs Ce plan est intitul\u00e9:\nPlan de 1881 de la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre et ses limites \u00e0 bois.\nEt au bas se trouve la signature de E. E. Tach\u00e9 assistant-commissaire.\nLa limite en question est indiqu\u00e9e sur le plan comme se trouvant entre les lignes rouges et comprenant les ler, 2e, 3e et 4e rangs du township d'Awantjish. Sur ce plan la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme passant \u00e0 travers les 3e et 4e rangs de la limite en question.\nSur le dos de la licence accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant la limite est d\u00e9crite comme suit:\u2014\nRiver St. Pierre. To commence from the rear line of the Seigniory of Lake Metapedia, to extend thence up the river St Pierre a distance of six and a half miles measured on a due south-west course and to include in breadth the first, second, third and fourth ranges of the township of Awantjish. The said timber limits being bounded to the north-east by the line of the Seigniory of lake Metapedia, to the south-west by the township of Cabot, and to the south-east by the line between the fourth and fifth ranges of .Awantjish township. Containing an area of twenty-six and a half square miles more or less. Crown Timber Office Rimouski, 2nd December 1880 George Sylvain, Crown Timber Agent.\nL'appelant prit possession de sa limite et l'exploita pendant quelques ann\u00e9es. Des chantiers furent \u00e9rig\u00e9s pour loger les ouvriers, des chemins construits et la rivi\u00e8re nettoy\u00e9e pour le transport du bois manufactur\u00e9. Ces divers travaux se mont\u00e8rent \u00e0 une somme de $1,328688. L'appelant se croyait bien certain de les avoir faits sur sa limite.\nMM. Martin et Lebel ayant, en 1885, acquis du gouvernement de Qu\u00e9bec, le reste du township Awantjish, savoir, les 5e, 6e et 7e rangs, firent tirer la ligne de separation entre le 4e et le 5e rang, c'est-\u00e0-dire la ligne qui devait s\u00e9parer la limite de Grant de la leur. M. Hill arpent\u00e9ur, qui fut employ\u00e9 pour cette operation, constata pour la premiere fois que la rivi\u0141re St-Pierre ne passait pas \u00e0 travers les 8e et 4e rangs de ce town-ship tel quo montr\u00e9 sur le plan exhib\u00e9 au bureau du d\u00e9partement des terres, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la vente de la dite limite, mais qu'elle passe \u00e0 travers le 5e rang, sur la limite subs\u00e9quemment achet\u00e9e par MM. Martin et Lebel. Ce fait est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par le plan de M. Hill produit comme exhibit n 7 de l'appelant.\nL'appelant qui faisait alors faire du bois sur le 5e rang, pr\u00e8s de la rivi\u0141re, apprit. alors par le r\u00e9sultat de cette op\u00e9ration qu'il se trouvait en dehors de sa limite, et sur celle de MM. Martin et Lebel. Ceux-ci firent saisir son bois et l'appelant fut oblige de le racheter en payant $500000 et perdit en outre tons ses frais d'ouverture de chemins et de nettoyage de la riviere. La rivi\u00e8re ne passait pas sur le 4e rang, dans sa limite, la valeur de celle-ci en \u00e9tait par l\u00e0 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 peu de chose. Il estime ses dommages \u00e0 $10,000.\nL'existence d'une rivi\u00e8re flottable pour l'exploitation du bois est une des consid\u00e9rations qui donnent le plus de prix \u00e0 une limite \u00e0 bois. Sans cela il serait trop dispendieux de Tendee le bois au march\u00e9 par transport de voiture La rivi\u00e8re est pour cela consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments principaux de la valeur d'une limite.\nCelle-ci fut d\u00e9crite et vendue comme la limite \" sur la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre\" s'\u00e9tendant le long de la riviere (up the river) une distance de six milles \u00e9t demi dans la direction du sud-ouest. L'appelant en suivant la rivi\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e sur le plan et la description donn\u00e9e dans sa licence ne pouvait faire autrement que de se croire dans sa limite.\nL'intim\u00e9e dans sa d\u00e9fense a admis l'achat de la limite en question par MM.' King et Fr\u00e8re et l'\u00e9mission de la licence en leur faveur, ainsi qu\u00e9 la description, tel que ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e; mais elle all\u00e8gue que cette description est correcte et conforme \u00e0 l'avis public donn\u00e9 par le d\u00e9partement des terres, et que les limites, telles que d\u00e9crites\u00bb dans la dite licence \u00e9taient faciles \u00e0 verifier\nLa question soulev\u00e9e par cette contestation est de savoir si l'erreur commise dans la description de Ia dite limite et le plan indiquant la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre comme traversant les 3c et 4e rangs, tandis que par la preuve ii est constat\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9vidente qu'elle n'y passe pas, mais qu'elle se trouve sur le 5e rang du m\u00e9me township, dans la limite accord\u00e9e depuis \u00e0 MM. Martin et Lebel; la question, dis-je, est de savoir si cette erreur portant sur une des consid\u00e9rations principales qui. oat d\u00e9cid\u00e9 l'appelant \u00e0 faire l'acquisition de Ia dite limite n'est pas suffisante pour lui donner droit dc demander l'annulation de la vente et des dommages lui resultant de cette erreur. 2\u00b0 Est-il vrai, comme l'a plaid\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e, qu'en vertu des r\u0141glements du dit d\u00e9partement en force lors de la vente et adjudication de la dite limite et lors de l'\u00e9mission de la dite licence, l'adjudicataire d'icelle devait verifier l'exactitude de la description officielle de la dite limite et informer le dit d\u00e9partement de toute erreur contenue en icelle et ce avant l'\u00e9mission de la dite licence.\nIl est important de citer la preuve pour d\u00e9montrer l'erreur de cette conclusion qui, quoique confirm\u00e9e par la cour du Banc de la Reine, n'en est pas moins 'en flagrante contradiction avec la preuve.\nL'appelant a fait la preuve la plus positive de l'erreur commise dans la description de sa limite, et dans le plan qui a servi de base pour la vente. L'arpenteur Hill qui a fait le plan, exhibit no.7, lorsqu'il a fait le trace de la ligne de separation de la limite de l'appelant de celle de MM. Martin et Lebel, entre les 4e et .5e rangs du township, est le premier qui ait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la v\u00e9ritable position de la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre Il a constat\u00e9 qu'elle se divise en deux branches sur le quatri\u00e8me rang. L'une passe sur le 5e rang et se trouve tr\u00e8s avantageuse pour le flottage des bois, tandis que l'autre continue au sud-ouest sur le de rang o\u00f9 elle s'\u00e9tend comme un lac dans lequel ii n'y a pas de courant et n'offre aucun avantage pour le flottage des bois.\nCependant c'est cette derni\u00e8re que le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, tout en admettant qu'elle est moins avantageuse pour le flottage des bois, declare \u00eatre la branche principale, et elle en conclut que partant la description de la limite et, du plan se trouve correcte, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'appelant n'a aucun sujet de se plaindre.\nCe n'est, ii est vrai, qu'une question de faits, mais c'est toute la cause. Un examen s\u00e9rieux des faits est donc indispensable pour la decision de ce litige. La vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9tuent au plan exhibit n 2, indiquant que la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre traverse les de et e rangs du township Awantjish. M. King, l'acqu\u00e9reur originaire de cette limite, dit que lors de la vente il avait examine le plan en question n 2 exhib\u00e9 pour l'information des acheteurs, et que c'est le plan qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement des Terres de la Couronne.\nlans la vente \u00e0 King comme dans celle faite \u00e0 l'appelant, le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1881, la limite est design\u00e9e principalement sous le nom de \" rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre.\" Dans l'avis de vente du d\u00e9partement (n\u00b0 54) elle est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e uniquement sous le nom de River St-Pierre. Avis est aussi donn\u00e9 que les plans des limites offertes en vente seront expos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'inspection des acheteurs jusqu'au moment de la vente.\nLes conditions de la vente mentionnent la mise \u00e0 prix des limites qui doivent \u00eatre vendues dans les diff\u00e9rentes agences du d\u00e9partement. Les autres conditions sont que les limites seront adjug\u00e9es \u00e0 ceux qui offriront le plus haut montant de bonus. Le bonus et la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de rente fonci\u00e8re de $2.00 par mille carr\u00e9 devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9is imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la vente\nLes dites limites \u00e0 bois seront sujettes \u00e0 tous les r\u00e8glements concernant Ia vente des bois actuellement en force, ou qui pourront \u00eatre adopt\u00e9s ci-apres.\nCes ventes sont faites p\u00e9riodiquement en vertu des r\u00e8glements du d\u00e9partement dont on trouve la refonte \u00e0 la page 78, du dossier. Elles doivent \u00eatre faites \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re publique, apres avis public contenant description des locations \u00e0 vendre leur situation et mise \u00e0 prix, apr\u00e8s qu'elles auront \u00e9t\u00e9 explor\u00e9es et \u00e9valu\u00e9es approximativement avec un plan du territoire o\u00f9 se trouvent les dites limites et celles environnantes; ce plan devra demeurer sujet \u00e0 l'examen du public durant tout le temps compris entre la publication de. l'avis et le jour fix\u00e9 de la vente. Le plan exhibit n 2 d'aprss lequel la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite se trouve confirm\u00e9 par un autre plan exhibit ne pr\u00e9pare parle d\u00e9partement en 1884. Un autre plan, exhibit A de l'intim\u00e9e date de 1878 aussi pr\u00e9pare par le d\u00e9partement, se rapproche beaucoup des deux autres. plans.\nTous ces divers plans prouvent d'une mani\u00e8re certaine que lors de la vente de la limite en question, le d\u00e9partement ne possedatt aucun\u00ba information contredisant l'exactitude du plan n\u00b0 2, d'apr\u00e8s lequel la vente fut faite.\nCe n'est qu'apr\u00e8s la vente faith \u00e0 MM. Martin et Lebel en 1885, du reste du township Awantjish, des 5e, 6e, et 7e rangs qu'il fut d\u00e9couvert que le plan n\u00b0 2 \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait erron\u00e9 D\u00e9sirant faire tirer la ligne de separation entre leur limite et celle de l'appelant, MM. Martin et Lebel employ\u00e8rent M. Hill, arpenteur, qui constata que la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre ne passe pas sur les 3e et 4e rangs de la limite de l'appelant, tel qu'indique sur le plan n\u00b0 2, niais qu'elle passe sur le Se rang du township dans la limite acquise par Martin et Label Le plan, exhibit n\u00b0 7, produit par le t\u00e9moin Hill fait en avril 1885, Constatant que la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre passe sur le 5e rang a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour le d\u00e9partement comme pour l'appelant la premiere information de l'erreur commise dans le plan n\u00b0 2 de la description de la limite.\nUn autre plan exhibit A de intim\u00e9e \u00e9manant du d\u00e9partement des Terres, date 17 ao\u00fbt 1888, diff\u00e8re aussi du pian n\u00b0 2, ii correspond presque exactement avec celui de M. Hill exhibit n\u00b0 7. Ce plan \u00e9videmment calqu\u00e9, sur celui de Hill, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait qu'apr\u00e8s coup et pour les besoins de la cause, puisque le gouvernement, avant l'op\u00e9ration de Hill, ne, poss\u00e9dait aucune information au sujet de l'erreur du plan n\u00b0 2, La petition de droit est dat\u00e9e le 29 juillet 1887 mais les plaidoyers sont dat\u00e9s du 23 ao\u00fbt 1888, six jours seulement apr\u00e8s la dale du plan fait pour le besoin de la cause.\nDans le plan no 2, toute Ia rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant dans les limites de l'appelant, et comme n'ayant pas de branches, except\u00e9 deux petites fourches qui s'\u00e9l\u00e9vent l'une vers la fin du 3e rang et l'autre vers l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du 4e rang, toutes deux tr\u00e8s courtes et formant la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sur le dit plan de la limite appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant. Mais d'apr\u00e8s le plan de M. Hill presque toute la rivi\u00e8re se trouve sur les 5e et 6e rangs, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de MM. Martin et Lebel, et elle ne passe que sur un coin du 4e rang dans la limite de l'appelant. Il y a, cependant, une certaine \u00e9tendue d'eau dans le 4e rang, au-dessus du. point o\u00f9 la principale branche de la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre fait un detour et continue vers les 5e et 6e rangs.\nVoyons maintenant par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hill laquelle des deux branches dont il parle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre. Il dit:\nR. Quand je suis all\u00e9 sur le terrain, j'ai d\u00e9couvert que la vraie rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre se divisait en deux branches, que Ia principale branche courait sur la limite en courant au sud, sur la limite de M Martin au sud; l'aurre branche, l y avait une autre branche qui se joignait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 dix arpents en bas du fronteau, entre le quatri\u00e8me et le cinqui\u00e8me rang; c'est une rivi\u00e8re qui ne coule pas beaucoup, ce n'est pas une rivi\u00e8re qu'on peut driver dire dribble.\nR. J'ai trouv\u00e9 que le camp de M. Grant \u00e9tait \u00e0 trois arpents ou \u00e0 pen pr\u00e8s trois arpents de la ligne sur la branche principale suivant moi.\nQ. Courant dans le sud? R. Oui courant dans le sud J'ai relev\u00e9 cette rivi\u00e8re-l\u00e0 j'ai relev\u00e9 la rivi\u00e8re principale suivant moi \u00e0 environ treize arpents j'ai rencontr\u00e9 une \u00e9cluse qui suivant moi a d\u00fb co\u00fbter trois cents piastres suivant ce que je puis conna\u00eetre dans ces affaires-l\u00e0, a d\u00fb co\u00fbter \u00e0 pen pr\u00e8s trois cents piastres ($300) \u00e0 celui qui l'avait b\u00e2tie e je ne sais pas si c'est M. Grant, je ne l'ai pas vu faire. Celui qui a b\u00e2ti cette \u00e9cluse \u00e7a d\u00fb lui co\u00fbter $300 pour en b\u00e2tir une pareille dans tous les cas. Ensuite j'ai rencontr\u00e9 du boss fait le long de la rivi\u00e8re jusqu'\u00e0 une distance \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s depuis la fourche des deux rivi\u00e8res, \u00e0 peu pres uno distance do quatre Mlles et demi, par la rivi\u00e8re, par les croches de la rivi\u00e8re c'\u00e9tait plus court que \u00e7a en I assant en ligne droite, mais en passant par la rivi\u00e8re, c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s quatre milles et demi. Il y avait l\u00e0 un camp, un grand camp, pour tenir vingt hommes, puis un camp pour les chevaux; enfin il y avait des travaux l\u00e0 qui co\u00fbtaient une centaine de piastres pour b\u00e2tir. Il y avait un po\u00eale l\u00e0-dedans, \u00e7a prenait deux chevaux pour le monter l\u00e0. Je dis ce que j'ai vu\u2014un po\u00eale qui \u00e9tait \u00e7a d'\u00e9pais, cinq pieds de long. \u00c7a devait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ce camp-l\u00e0\u2014et le po\u00eale...... C'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au moins cinq ou six ans avant. Nous avons couch\u00e9 l\u00e0 ce soirl\u00e0, tous mes hommes, on a couch\u00e9 l\u00e0, ace camp-l\u00e0; c'est tout ce que je sais.\nQ. Vous connaissez tr\u00e8s bien, vous avez fait l'exploration de la limite rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre, la limite de M. Grant\u2014R. Je la connais autant qu'un homme peut la conna\u00eetre.\nQ. Voulez-vous dire ou \u00e9tablir approximativement la valeur de cette limite, rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre, la limite du p\u00e9titionnaire qu'elle est la valeur. \u2014R. D'apr\u00e8s ce que je connais depuis ce temps-l\u00e0. J'ai pa conna\u00eetre depuis ce temps-l\u00e0, et dans ce temps-l\u00e0 si r\u00e9ellement Ia branche prin cipale Ia blanche qui court sur la limite de M. Grant c'est une rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 eau morte; je pense bien qu'il y a plus d'eau, mais elle ne coule pas, elle est plus large, et c'est une esp\u00e8ce de lac tout le temps.\nJ'ai explore depuis ce temps-l\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re St. \u2014 Pierre, presque depuis son embouchure avec l'autre branche de M. Grant jusqu'au lac M\u00e9tap\u00e9diac c'est toujours un courant \u00e9gal.\nSuivant mon opinion je pense que la principale branche de la rivi\u00e8re descend du sud de la limite de MM. Martin et Label.\nQ .Avez-vous remont\u00e9 bien haut la branche qui court sur la limite de M. Grant ?\u2014R. Je ne l'ai pas remont\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame, mais j'ai tire le fronteau le long de la branche' de M. Grant M. Martin qui \u00e9tait avec moi\nPar moi-m\u00eame j'ai vu que \u00e7a coulait dans une c\u00e9driere et que Ia branche ne pouvait pas avoir de courant, il n'y avait pas moyen.\nVoici le t\u00e9moignage d'un homme competent en ces mati\u0141res, qui a fait l'exploration de la rivi\u00e8re en question et qui dit la conna\u00eetre autant qu'un homme peut la conna\u00eetre, qui prouve que la branche principale passe en courant sud sur la limite de Martin et Lebel. Celle qui passe sur Ia limite de l'appelant est une rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 eau morte, dit-il, o\u00f9 ii y a plus d'eau, mais elle ne coule pas, elle est plus large. C'est une esp\u00e8ce de lac. Son opinion est que la principaee branche de la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre descend du sud de la limite de MM. Martin et Lebel. L'autre: celle de Grant, coule dans une c\u00e9dri\u00e9re o\u00f9 ii n'y a pas de courant. Ces faits coustatent \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence que la rivi\u00e8re principale, celle qui passe sur la limite de Martin et Lebel, la seule qui soit utile pour l'exploitation du bois ne se trouve pas sur la limite de l'appelant.\nL'autre t\u00e9moir. qui parle de la rivi\u00e8re est Edward Grant, fils de l'appelant, qui dit que son p\u00e8re s'\u00e9tait \u00e9tabli sur la principale branche de la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre do\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9 par MM. Martin et Lebel qui depuis 1885 ont la possession de la branche sud, celle sur laquelle \u00e9taii \u00e9tabli son p\u0141re, qui est Ia branche principale de la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre. C'est, ajoute-t-il, ce qu'on consid\u00e8re Ia rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre proprement dite.\nVoil\u00e0 avec le t\u00e9moignage de M. King toute la preuve an sujet du caract\u00e8re de la rivi\u0141re. Les autres t\u00e9moins n'en font pas me:ation. La d\u00e9fense n'a rien prouv\u00e9 au contraire.\nAinsi l'erreur sur laquelle l'appelant fonde sa p\u00e9tition est d\u00e9montree \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence. La rivi\u0141re, St-Pierre n'est pas sur la limite vendue \u00e0 l'appelant elle se trouve en dehors, sur la limite de Martin et Lebel. Le fait qu'il se trouve sur le 4e rang, dans la limite de l'appelant, une esp\u00e8ce de lac on \u00e9tendue d'eau morte, dans laquelle il n'y a aucun courant et qui ne peut nullement servir an transport des bois ne peut pas raisonnablement \u00catre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, ainsi que l'a fait la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, comme la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre on son equivalent. Bien que le jugement comporte la declaration \" que le t\u00e9moin du p\u00e9titionnaire (de 1 appelant) dit que cette esp\u00e8ce de lac est plus large et contient plus d'eau que l'autre, et que pour ces raisons, ii dit qu'elle est la branche principale\u2014je dois dire qu'on ne trouve cependant rien de semblable dans les t\u00e9moignages.\" J'ai vainement cherch\u00e9 cette declaration. Elle n'exstte pas dans la preuve. Aucun t\u00e9moin n'a confondu la branche principale de la rivi\u00e8re avec l'autre et n'a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une \u00e9quipollence entre les deux. Ce finding, cette declaration du jugement de premiere;instance est tout \u00e0 fait contraire \u00e0 l'a preuve Il n'est pas surprenant qu'apr\u00e8s cela, la cour ait adop\u00e9\u00e9 comme conclusion le consid\u00e9rant suivant \" que d'apr\u00e8s la preuve la branche de 1a dite rivi\u00e8re contenant le plus d'eau est sur la limite du p\u00e9titionnaire et que par l\u00e0 m\u00eame la d\u00e9signation de la limite dans les licences est fid\u00e8le et. correcte.\"\nPour en arriver \u00e0 une telle conclusion ii faut absolument ne donner aucune attention \u00e0 Ia preuve des t\u00e9moins sur le caract\u00e8re de Ia rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre ni \u00e0 celle faite au sujet de i'importance qu'il y a, pour l'exploitation d'une limite, \u00e0 poss\u00e9der un cours d'eau pour le transport des bois. Il est inutile dc revenir sur les avantages mentionn\u00e9s par plusieurs t\u00e9moins dont quelques-uns consid\u00e8rent que c'est un des principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la valeur d'une \"limite. M. King dit positivement qu'il n'aurait pas achet\u00e9 cette limite s'il avait su que la rivi\u00e8re ne Ia traversait pas tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 sur le plan n 2, quia avait particuli\u00e8rement examin\u00e9. Cette erreur reposant sur une des consid\u00e9rations principales de la vente, dolt la rendre nulle. (Voir art. 992, c. c.)\nLa pr\u00e9tention \u00e9mise par l'intim\u00e9e que d'aprss les r\u00e8glements du d\u00e9partement en force lors de l'adjudication et de l'\u00e9manation de Ia licence, l'adjudicataire d'icelle devait verifier l'exactitude de la description officielle- de Ia dite limite et informer le d\u00e9partement de toute erreur avant l'\u00e9manation de la licence Estelle r\u00e9ellemont fondee en fait?\nL'assistant-commissaire des terres dans son examen comme t\u00e9moin a soutenu cette proposition. Il cite comme autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet Ia 4e clause de la refonte des r\u00e8glements, mais cette clause ne dit absolument rien do semblable. Elle ne concerne que les rentes fonci\u00e8res auxquelles les limites nouvellement acquises. seront sujettes. Il n'est l\u00e0 aucunement question des ventes des limites ni de leurs conditions, excep\u00e9\u00e9 en ce qui concerne Ia rente fonci\u00e8re au sujet de laquelle elle fait cette restriction, \"et apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9mission de la licence aucune r\u00e9ciamation ne sera admise pour le remboursement de rente fonci\u00e8re provenant de surcharge faite dans le calcul de superficie des limites.\" Ni d\u00c6ns les conditions de l\u00e0 licence ni dans les articles concernant la vente des limites on ne trouve aucune condition soumettant l'adjudicataire \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier l'exactitude de la description officielle de Ta limite et d'informer le d\u00e9partement de toute erreur en; icelle. Il est \u00e9vident que l'assistant-commissaire s'est tromp\u00e9 en voulant \u00e9tendre \u00e0 la vente des limites la restriction impos\u00e9e au sujet de la rente fonci\u00e8re* Ti n'y a pas d'autres conditions quo celles ci-dessus \u00e9nonces, la vente publique \u00e0 l'ench\u00e8re, apr\u00e8s avis de deux mois, avec d\u00e9p\u00f4t du plan de la limite chez l'agent local pour l'information de l'acheteur. Telles sont les precautions prises pour la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du d\u00e9partement et pour celle de l'acheteur. Pour le reste la vente est r\u00e9glee par les principes ordinaires du contrat de vente, qui sont parfaitement applicables au cas actuel.\nS'il est certain que les commen\u00e7ants de bois font souvent des d\u00e9marches pour conna\u00eetre Ia valeur deslimites \u00e0 vendre, c'est pour avoir des informations que Ie d\u00e9partement n'est pas en \u00e9tat do leur donner sur la qualit\u00e9 et la quantit\u00e9 du bois, sur les dommages qui peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s dins les limites par Ie feu ou par les voies de faits des voisins cu autres. Mais dans le cas actuel, le gouvernement a donn\u00e9 par l'avis public et par son plan de la limite toutes les informations que les r\u00e8glements l'obligeaient \u00e0 donner, et ii est tenu \u00e0 en garantir l'exactitude. Il ne devait faire cette vente qu'apres exploration do la limite et le plan qu'il en a donn\u00e9 lors de la vente n'a d\u00fb \u00eatre fait que sur exploration et n'a \u00e9te exhib\u00e9 aux acheteurs que pour leur faire croire que la rivi\u00e8re St-Pierre passait \u00e0 l'endroit indiqu\u00e9 sur le plan. A moins de croire que le plan n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi exhib\u00e9 que pour tromper les acheteurs, quelle raison y avait-il pour M. King ou pour l'appelant de faire inutilement une op\u00e9ration co\u00fbteuse, lorsqu'ils ne pouvaient aucunement supposer qu'il se trouvait une erreur aussi grave dans le plan d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Il n'est pas possible, je crois, de faire aucun reproche \u00e0 l'appelant de ne pas avoir agi comme s'il e\u00fbt connu l'erreur. Il est trop positivement \u00e9tabli qu'il l'ignorait et qu'il ne l'a connu qu'apr\u00e8s que M. Martin et Lebel eurent acquis Ia limit\u0141 voisine. Le seul coupable de cette erreur est le d\u00e9partement qui affait faire le plan sans avoir fait d'exploration, et c'est \u00e0 lui d'en porter la responsabilit\u00e9. Dans tous les cas, le r\u00e8glement lui d\u00e9fendatt de vendre une limite avant de l'avoir fait explorer.\nLes dommages r\u00e9sultants \u00e0 l'appelant sont consid\u00e9rables. Il se trouve \u00e0 perdre tous les travaux qu'il avait faits pour chantiers, chemins et nettoyage de la rivi\u0141re. En outre une somme de $500, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 obligee de payer \u00e0 Martin et Lebel pour le bois qu'il croyait avoir fait chez lui tandis qu'il se trouvait dans la limite de ces derniers. Avant la d\u00e9couverte de cette erreur sa limite valait $8,000, depuis elle vaut \u00e0 peine $1,500.\nMalgr\u00e9 la \"justice \u00e9vidente de cette reclamation le d\u00e9partement des terres, pour \u00e9viter la responsabilit\u00e9 de son erreur refus\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 la demande de l'appelant pour obtenir une rectification de l'erreur. On a bien vu dans les r\u00e8glements deschoses qui n'y existaient pas pour s'excuser de ne pas rendre justice et on a ferm\u00e9 les yeux sur une disposition formelle qui existe leur donnant tout le pouvoir de r\u00e9parer leur erreur; c'est celle-ci, \u00e0 l'article 28 de la refonte des r\u00e8glements: et dans le cas o\u00f9 il serait constat\u00e9 que, soit par erreur ou par d\u00e9faut dans sa description, aucune licence est \u00e9videmment incompatible avec l'intention ou avec les r\u00e9glemenss en vertu desquels elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, le commissaire des Terres de Ia Couronne pourra la faire annuler ou amender.\nUne application au d\u00e9partement pour le redressement de cette erreur n'ayant obtenu aucun r\u00e9sultat, l'appelant a eu recours \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition de droit. Il est evident que le d\u00e9partement dans Ces circonstances avait droit' de r\u00e9silier ou annuler la license de MM. Martin et Lebel. Ceux-ci n'avaient encore fait aucuns travaux,\u2014ils \u00e9taient seulement en possession de ceux faits par l'appelant. L'indemnit\u00e9 qu'ils auraient Pu obtenir ne pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9rable. Un r\u00e8glement equitable e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 facile alors, mais on a injustement et contrairement au r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 imposer une perte consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 l'appelant. J'esp\u00e8re que cette injustice sera r\u00e9par\u00e9e par cette cour qui accordera l'appel de ce jugement\u2014et condamnera le d\u00e9partement au paiement de la somme de $6,868, et lesd\u00e9pens,\u2014mais je regrette de voir qu'il en doit \u00eatre autrement par le jugement de la majorit\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appellant's claim against the Crown is utterly unfounded and was rightly dismissed by the two courts below. He complains that in the sale of a certain timber limit made to one King by the Quebec Government in 1880 which said King he now represents, he was deceived by a false description of the locality given by the plan of the Government, and bases his claim for damages upon the ground that owing to such false description he located his lumbering operations not in the limits he had so bought bat erroneously on another adjoining limit, then belonging to the Crown, upon which he carried his operations till 1885; he then alleges that in 1885 the Crown having conceded to a firm of Mart\u00edn & Lebel the limit upon which he had so worked up to this time, he was forced' to give it up to the said Martin & Lebel and to pay them $500 for damages. Assuming it to be true that the appellant was led into error by the Crown's agents as to what was really, the situation in that wilderness of the limit he had bought, I fail to see upon the evidence of record that he has suffered any damages thereby. On the contrary that error seems to have been a very beneficial one to him as he netted a clear profit during the four years of over $8,800. Now here is a man who, after having illegally and without any right whatever trespassed on the Crown's domain for four years carried away from it the best timber he could find and made thereby a profit of over $2,000. a year who claims from the Crown a sum of over $10,000, for damages resulting to him from the error into which he was led by the alleged false representations of the Crown's agents. It is to my mind a most extraordinary claim. The timber limit he actually bought was delivered to him or was there for him. The river St. Pierre crosses it as indicated on the, government's plan. If the appellant thought that it was another branch of the said river that crossed it the error was his he should have taken some trouble to ascertain, on the ground what were the facts relating to it. I do not see that the Government led him into error, but, however as I Said if that were so it was for him an error from which he certainly has no reason to complain. As to the difference in value of the said limit, between what it actually is and what he thought it to be\u2014between as it is actually located and where he thought it to be located\u2014 the evidence of record establishes clearly that it is more than covered by the profits he received from his illegal operations on the Crown's domain. PATTERSON J.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading my brother Fournier's full and careful discussion of the facts connected with the purchase of the limits by Messrs. King Bros and of the regulations of the department touching such transactions, and I adopt his conclusions regarding those matters without attemping an independent examination of the evidence. I agree that the suppliant has sustained the allegation that the purchaser was misled by the plan exhibited by the Crown Lands Department, and purchased believing that the territorial description of the. limits included land through which ran a river available for lumbering purposes. The river St. Pierre is a river available for lumbering purposes, but not that branch of it which alone runs through those limits. I think that as my learned brother has pointed out, the judgment of the courts below proceeds, in this respect, on an assumption of fact that is not borne out by the evidence.\nThere was, in my Opinion, such an error as, under article 992 of the Civil Code was a cause of nullity of the contract. The law is the Name indicated in an English treatise cited by the appellant in his factum, on the authority of a case in which, an analogous error having occurred, the court refused to decree specific performance of the contract,\nBut my chief difficulty arises from the fact that the suppliant does not ask to have his contract declared null He now wishes to adhere to his bargain but to be compensated because it is not as good a bargain as if he had the more effective facilities which the main branch of the river would have afforded, I do not see my way to assess damages against the Government on that basis. If the relief indicated by article 992 had been what was asked for, namely, the declaring the contract null by reason of the error there would doubtless have been added a claim for compensation for losses sustained by acting on the understanding derived from the erroneous representations before the error was discovered.\nIt has been shown that money was expended to the amount of over $1,300, besides $500 paid to the lawful owners of the limits where the timber was cut. I suppose the $500 was not more than the timber was worth, and the appellant got the timber. He had to give up the works on which he had spent the $1,300, but then he made a large profit by his lumbering operations during all the years he worked there. Deducting the $1300 there would still be a large profit.\nTherefore it seems that a claim for compensation merely would be without foundation in fact, and the demand comes to be for special and unliquidated damages for breach of a warranty that the river ran through the limits.\nThus, differing though I do from the court below in the grounds of the decision, I have to agree that the action fails and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Hutchinson & Oughtred.\nSolicitor for respondent : J. B. Bedavd.\n"}

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAppeal\u2014Acquiescence in judgment\u2014-Jurisdiction\u201438 Vic. ch. 81, P.Q.\u2014 Charges for boomage\u2014Agreements\u2014Renunciation to rights\u2014Estoppel by conduct 'Renonciation tacite.'\nIn an action in which the constitutionality of 36 Vic. ch. 81 (P.Q.) was raised by the defendant the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec intervened, and the judgment of the Superior Court having maintained the plaintiff's action and the Attorney-General s intervention the defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) but afterwards abandoned his appeal from the judgment o:i the intervention. On a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench on the principal action the defendant claimed he had the right to have the judgment of the Superior Court on the intervention reviewed.\nHeld that the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench from the judgment of the Superior Court on the intervention having been abandoned the judgment on the intervention of the Attorney-General could not be the subject of an appeal to this court.\nF. McC. brought an action against G. B. for $4,464 as due him for charges which he was authorized to collect under 36 Vic. ch. 81, P.O. for the use by G. B. of certain booms in the Nicolet river during the years 1887 and 1888. G. B. pleaded that under certain contracts entered into between F McC. and G. B. and his auteurs, and the interpretation put upon them by F. McC. the repairs to the boons were to be and were, in fact, made by him, and that in consideration thereof he was to be allowed, to pass his loss free; and, also, pleaded compensation of a sum of $9,620 for use by F. McC. of other booms and repairs made by G. B. on F. McC's booms and which by law he was bound to make.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that there was evidence that F. McC. had led G. B. to believe that under the contracts he was to have the use of the booms free in consideration for the repairs made by him to the pie\u0155s, &c,, and that F. McC. was estopped by conduct from claiming the dues he might otherwise have been authorized to collect.\nHeld, further, that even if F. McC.'s right of action was authorized by the statute the amount claimed was fully compensated for by the amount \u00e9xpended in repairs for him by G. B.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting at Montreal, condemning the appellant to pay the respondent $4,186.-55.\nThe action was for the recovery from the appellant of the sum of $4464700 for the use of certain booms and piers lying on the river Nicollet, in the springs of 1887 and 1888.\nThe plaintiff (respondent) in his declaration, after referring to the act of the Quebec Legislature, 36 Vic. ch. 81, by which he, Antoine Mayrand and Charles McCaffrey were authorized to construct booms and other works on the river Nicolet, and to charge .persons using them according to ,a tariff allowed by the act, alleged in substance that the works so authorized were constructed, that he stood in the rights of Antoine Mayrand and Charles McCaffrey as respects the collection of the charges authorized by the act, and that defendant (appellant) was indebted to him in the sum of $4464.70 for the use he made of the booms during the years 1887 and 1888.\nPlaintiff further set up that by deed of transfer from him to Mayrand dated the 19th of April, 1873, he transferred to the latter, without warrant, all his rights and privileges, under titles, leases and permits to all the piers of the islands, including the booms, &c, constructed on the river above the ferry of the old Catholic Church, called the upper booms, upon condition that Mayrand should, at his own expense, perform the obligations, including the maintenance of the booms to which plaintiff was bound, and in consideration, among other things, that the said Mayrand should have no claims for any work he might so perform against whomsoever sous litre de frais ou co\u00fbt du boomage but that plaintiff alone should collect the charges authorized from the act from all persons using the booms free, the revenue derived therefrom to be his property, and further, that Mayrand, his heirs and assigns, should be entitled to use all the booms free. That said Charles McCaffrey, mis en cause although not a party to this deed, abandoned all his rights under the act to plaintiff.\nThe defendant filed four pleas which may be summarized as follow:\n1. That the river Nicolet is navigable over that portion of it referred to in said act and that such act was ultra vires of the Legislature of Quebec. That Mayrand by transfer dated 31st of July, 1876, transferred to J. G. Ross all that he acquired from plaintiff under the deed of 18th of April, 1873; that Ross, by transfer dated 23rd June, 1886, ratified by deed dated 4th January, 1839, transferred to defendant what he had acquired from Mayrand; that the defendant, during the years 1887 and 1888, was proprietor and in possession of the upper booms, which were the only essential ones, and that he did all the work necessary to be done in connection with them to the knowledge and with the acquiescence of plaintiff incurring expense to the extent of $4,626.24; that plaintiff cannot make defendant pay for using his own property, that plaintiff and others use the booms, and plaintiff derived all the benefit resulting from defendant's work, which was greater than any amount he can claim from defendant for the latter's use of said booms, and there ought to be at least compensation;\n2. That plaintiff did not perform the work he was bound to do under the act, during the years 1887-88, although put in default, and that consequently he has lost the privileges to which he was entitled.\nThat defendant's, as standing in the rights of Ross, acquired the right to pass his timber free, and that the parties, by their conduct, put this interpretation upon the contracts; that from 1873 to 1875 both the Mayrand and Ross logs were passed free with the knowledge and acquiescence of plaintiff, and repairs were done with Ross's money; that by deed of 31st July, 1875, Mayrand gave Ross the right to pass logs free, and he did so, except during the years 1880 and 1881 when Hall & Co. were his transferees and passed their timber free; that by the transfer from Ross to defendant, the latter acquired all the rights Ross had.\nThat plaintiff's claim is compensated by the two sum of $5,000 and $4,620, the first as the value of the use and revenues of the upper booms to plaintiff for 1887 and 1888; the second as the cost of urgent and necessary repair made by the defendant, which plain-\u00bb tiff should have made.\nBy his answers plaintiff alleged in effect, that by the terms of plaintiff's transfer to Mayrand and Mayrand's to Ross, Mayrand was bound towards both of them to maintain and repair the upper booms, and that defendant as transferee of Ross could only look to Mayrand to do the work; that if any repairs were made, plaintiff was not put in default and they were not necessary, and in any case in making them, they merely carried out Mayrand's obligation; that Mayrand never transferred to Boss, but expressly reserved his right to pass his logs free; that Ross never acquired such right and could not give it to defendant.\nThere was also an action in warranty taken by the plaintiff against Michael O'Shaugnessy but the court below dismissed the action in warranty and no appeal was taken.\nThe attorney-general, having been notified of the conclusion taken by defendant to have the act of the Quebec Legislature, 38 Vic. c. 81, declared ultra vires intervened and by his intervention claimed that the act was not ultra vires of that legislature.\nThe following correspondence between the respondent and the appellant's predecessors in title, Messrs. W. G. Ross & Son, was put in evidence:\n\u201cNicolet, 27th March, 1887.\n\u201cMessrs. W. G. Ross & Son\n\u201cSt. Nicholas.\n\u201cGentlemen,\n\u201cAs the season is fast approaching I consider it my duty to learn of you as soon as possible what you intend to do about the piers and booms on the Nicolet. It will soon be time for some one to take care of booms and piers. Please let me know what you intend to do about placing said booms &c. or if you have given authority to some one to act for you in said affair.\n\u201cRespectfully yours,\n\u201cF. McCaffrey.\"\nThe following letter was sent in reply:\n\u201cYours of 17th to hand and should have been answered sooner. I am not using the river now and I don't intend to put up my booms this spring for the use of others bit in the meantime I am anxious of re lieving the interested parties from their natural anxiety and act fairly. I think we ought to meet and take some steps to secure the putting up of the booms by Mr. Ball or some one else you must understand that it is necessary for you to help me as your interest is much greater than mine as I have no logs in the river this spring.\" Laflamme ,Q.C. and Charbonneau for appellant, contended that by his conduct the respondent was estopped from collecting dues on the lower booms from the party who spread the boom, and that in any case the appellant was entitled to succeed on his plea of compensation having done work which the respondent was bound to do under his charter, and on the question of the constitutionality of 36 Vic. ch. 81, cited Queddy River Boom Co. v. Davidson ([1]).\nGeoffrion Q. C. and Honan for respondent, cited and relied on arts. 443 447 483, 1992, 1973, and 1977 C. C.\nBrodeur for Attorney-General contended that the question of the constitutionality of the provincial statute was not a proper subject of appeal, as the appellant had not appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court on that point.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by,\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J. The first point which comes up for our determination in this case is as to the right of this appellant now to appeal from the judgment upon the intervention of the Attorney-General on the constitutionality of the act in question in the case. In the Superior Court this intervention was maintained. The case was then carried to the Court of Appeal on the final judgments both on the intervention and on the action. Subsequently however the appellant abandoned his appeal as to the intervention and the Court of Appeal, consequently, gave judgment only upon the issue between plaintiff and defendant. Since the inscription of the present appeal from that judgment the appellant has given notice to the Attorney-General that he would claim before this court the right to have the judgment of the Superior Court on the intervention reviewed. Clearly, he has no such right. There was and there could have been no judgment by \u2014 the Court of Appeal on that issue and therefore there is no appeal to this court thereon. The Attorney-General's motion to have the appeal as to the intervention dismissed must be allowed with costs.\nAnd neither can, on the principal appeal, the constitutionality of the said act be questioned before this court by the appellant, as he has acquiesced before the court below in the judgment of the Superior Court on that issue.\nNow, as to the issues between the parties in the action. The plaintiff, present respondent, by his action instituted before the Superior Court, at Montreal, in November, 1883, claims from the defendant, present appellant, the sum of $4,464600 for the use of certain booms on the Nicolet river during the years 1887 and 1888, under the authority of an act of the Quebec Legislature, 36 Vic. ch. 81,1872, which authorized him and others, to erect and maintain booms and other works on said river, and to charge boomage for use thereof during twenty-one years according to a tariff allowed by said act, as an indemnity for the cost of said erecting and maintaining.\nThe Superior Court at Montreal gave judgment against the appellant for the sum of $4,186.55. The Court of Appeal affirmed that judgment, and he now appeals to this court.\nBy certain deeds with his co-grantees the respondent became vested, soon after the passing of the said act, with the exclusive right to the said charges for boomage authorized thereby. In 1873 he transferred all his rights of ownership in a part of the said booms called the upper booms to one Mayrand, upon condition that he, May-rand, should, at his own expense, be bound to perform all the obligations to which he, the respondent, was bound for the maintenance and repairs of the said upper booms, in consideration of which obligation so assumed by him it was covenanted that the said Mayrand, his heirs and assigns, should be entitled to use all the booms, both upper and lower, free of boomage for his own lumbering operations, the said respondent, however, reserving to himself exclusively the boomage and the revenues thereof on both upper and lower booms from all other parties lumbering on the said river, the repairs and maintenance of the lower booms to be at his charge. By a deed dated the 31st July, 1875, Mayrand assigned to one Ross all the rights he had acquired from the respondent, the said Mayrand, reserving for himself, however, his heirs and assigns, the free use of the said booms conceded to him by respondent as aforesaid, and remaining charged with the obligation of maintaining and repairing the same imposed upon him by the respondent.\nIn 1886 Ross assigned his rights as collateral security to the present appellant, who, in 1887 and 1888, boomed a large quantity of logs for which the respondent now claims that he is liable. There appears to have been another deed of assignment executed on the 24th of January, 1889, betwenn Ross and the appellant. I do not refer specially to it, however, as it was passed since he institution of this action; moreover, there is nothing in it that could affect this case. The appellant is undoubtedly, as the respondent contends, in Ross's position, entitled to all his rights and liable to all his obligations.\nIt appears by the evidence that in 1875 Mayrand became insolvent. In fact he was so since 1873, and had since been making logs mainly for the account of Ross. In 1875, however, he had to. give up business, and, of course, having no logs to pass, abandoned the care of the upper booms altogether. Ross, then, for eleven years, from 1875 to 1886, either by himself, or in 1880 and 1881 by Hall Bros., for him and in his name, assumed the obligation, to the knowledge of the respondent and of O'Shaughnessy, and with their tacit acquiescence, to maintain and repair the said upper booms, in consideration of which the respondent during the said eleven years never charged him boomage. In March, 1887, the respondent wrote to Ross as follows:\nNICOLET, 17th March, 1887.\nMessrs. W. G. Ross & Son,\nSt. Nicholas.\nGentlemen,\u2014As the season is fast approaching, I consider it my duty to learn of you as soon as possible what you intend to do about the piers and booms on the Nicolet. It will soon be time for some one to take care of booms and piers. Please let me know what you intend to do about placing? said booms, &c, or if you have given authority to some one 1 o act for you in said, affair.\nWhy did the respondent write this letter to Ross and not to O'Shaughnessy? And how can he now argue that he was not put en demeure to make these repairs after having himself so thrown the liability thereto on Ross, and put him, Ross, en demeure to make them?\nThat letter, it seems to me, is clear evidence that he, the respondent, Looked to Ross, and to Ross alone, for the maintenance and repairs .of the booms. For eleven years, by his course of conduct, he leads Ross to believe that the party who makes the repairs has the use of the booms free. Ball is thereby induced, as Ross has been, to make large repairs and disbursements, and now the respondent would make him pay boomage. I would think that, granting that he would have had the right in 1875 by assuming himself the cost of repairing and maintaining, to Charge any such boomage to Ross, he is now estopped by his line of conduct from claiming any from the appellant. He has ratified the understanding that he who made the repairs was entitled to pass his logs free. In 1875 and afterwards Ross was not obliged to make these repairs; and Mayrand or his assignee, not making them, the respondent would have been obliged to make them himself, otherwise his rights would have been gone; and\" he could not have claimed to be reimbursed from Ross, but only from Mayrand or his assignee Renunciation to a right is not to be presumed, argues the respondent. As a general proposition of law that is unquestionable. But first, what rights to boomage would the respondent have had at all against Ross if these booms had not been maintained and kept in repair.? Then if a party entitled to certain rights acts, in his dealings with any one, inconsistently with such rights, and thereby, knowingly, induces that other one to alter his position or to submit to obligations or liabilities from which he would otherwise have been free, or to do that from which he might otherwise have abstained that is evidence of renunciation or abandonment of his rights.\nBecause Mayrand remained liable for the repairs by his agreement of 1875 with Ross that did not free the respondent from his obligations towards the public and Ross himself. Ross, when Mayrand gave up business, as I have already remarked, assumed Mayrand's obligations to the repairs in consideration of which he exercised Mayrand's rights to free boomage; and such is the interpretation given to these deeds, and acted upon, during thirteen years by the respondent himself and Mayrand and his representative. Respondent says that he has not charged boomage to O'Shaughnssy who represents Mayrand under an assignment of June 15th, 1877. I do not see how that can affect the appellant. That does not concern him. Neither he nor Ross were made aware of that assignment, and this O'Shaughnessy himself not only never expended a cent on these booms, but, when repairs were necessary, himself called on M C Ross or Ball to make them. The respondent's action should on these grounds be dismissed. If Ross was not liable the appellant is not. But assuming that his claim could at all be entertained he must fail on the appellant's Plea of compensation.\nIf he collects boomage from the appellant he must reimburse him his expenses for repairing and maintaining these booms. He cannot claim the profits and at the same time free himself from his obligations.\nHis contention against the appellant's plea as to this, that he was not put en demeure or that the appellant might have recovered against Ross or against Maynard or O'Shaughnessy, cannot prevail against the principle that nemo alterius detrimento locupletari debet. The deeds moreover between Mayrand and Ross, and Ross and the appellant, are, towards him the respondent res inter alios acta. He coulld not, as against the public free himself from the obligation imposed on him by the legislature of maintaining and replacing these booms. That was the express condition upon which this privilege was conceded to him, a condition precedent to any claim for boomage against Ross or any one else. If neither the appellant, nor Ross nor Mayrand had made these repairs, upon the necessity and urgency of which there is ample evidence, where would he, the respondent, have been with his privilege if he had not made these repairs himself? He clearly benefited from the appellant's disbursements and it seems to me but just on the principle of the action de in rem verso, that he should be held liable therefor. Then Mayrand; it is true, was obliged towards him to make these repairs, hut, on the other hand he had the use of the booms free; and the appellant must likewise have had the booms free or be reimbursed his expenses. Ross had previously made the necessary disbursements for the annual repairs, &c., &c, but the respondent, as I have already said, never charged him boom-age. I do not doubt that, as found by the learned judge of the Superior Court, the appellant never, at the time, contemplated to charge these disbursements to the respondent, but it is, in my opinion, as evident that he then thought himself not liable for boomage at all. In fact the respondent himself did not then think he could claim such boomage from the appellant as I have shown. And he could not have been very confident of his rights even when he determined to take proceedings against the appellant, as he previously took the precaution to assign his property to his brother.\nHe would leave the appellant to exercise his recourse against Mayrand or his estate. Now, Mayrand died long ago, an insolvent. Or against O'Shaughnessy? But there is no privity of contract between appellant and O'Shaughnessy.\nIt may be that part of the appellant's bill of particulars should not be charged to the respondent; however it is unnecessary for me to enter into an examination of its details as I am of opinion that the action is unfounded.\nWe are of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs on this appeal and in Queen's Bench against respondent and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : L. Charbonneau.\nSolicitor for respondent : M. Honan.\n[1] 10 Can. S.C.R. 222.\n"}

W. not having the money at the time applied to S., an agent of the respondent, who was present in the room, for the money, telling him he wanted it to lend to G. to enable him to go to Listowel to vote. S. the agent, lent the money to W. who handed it over to G. W. returned the two dollars to S. the day before the trial. The judges at the election trial held that it was a bon\u00e2 fide loan by S. to W. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that as the decision of the trial judges depended on the inferences drawn from the evidence, their decision could be reversed in appeal, and that the proper inference to be drawn from the undisputed facts in the present case was that the loan by S. to W. was a mere colourable transaction by S. to pay the travelling expenses of G. within the provisions of sec. 88 of the Dominion Elections Act and a corrupt practice sufficient to avoid the election under sec. 91 of the said act.\nStrong J. dissenting was of opinion that there was no evidence that the loan of $2 was, made to G. with the corrupt intent of inducing him to vote for the respondent. Patterson J. dissenting, on the ground that as the decision of the Court below depended on the credibility of the witnesses it ought not to be interfered with.\nPer Strong and Patterson JJ. affirming the judgment of the court below, that, upon the evidence which is reviewed in the judgments, the Grand Trunk railway tickets issued at Toronto and Stratford for the transportation of voters by rail to the polls in this case were free tickets and that as the free tickets had been given to voters who were well known supporters of the respondent prepared to vote for him and for him alone if they voted at all, it did not amount to paying the travelling expenses of voters within the meaning of sec. 88 of the Dominion Elections Act. Berthier Election Case, 9 Can. S.C.R. 102, followed.\nAppeal from the judgment of Rose and MacMahon JJ. dismissing the election petition of the appellant with costs.\nThe appeal was confined to the cases or group of cases dealt with by the learned judges in their judgments of the 19th December, 1891, viz.:\n1. The Grand Trunk ticket case.\n2. The Gowing cases, Nos. 195 et al.\n3. The Lavelle cases, Nos. 115 and 120.\nThe Railway Ticket cases.\nRailway tickets were furnished by the railway upon the requisition of W. T. R.

The Gowing Case, Nos. 195, 295, 296, 303, 375, 408 and 472 in the particulars.\nWilliam Gowing was a voter who voted in Listowel, who, at the date of the election lived in Stratford. He received from Duncan Hay one of the Hanna-McPherson Grand Trunk tickets, and used it in going to and returning from the polling place at Listowel. In the different particulars it was charge that he received money for his vote or for expenses in travelling to and from the polling place, and the charge which the appellant argued had been proved is the one which alleged the corrupt act to have been committed by James Stock an agent of the respondent, by advancing to one Winters, a bar tender at Stratford, to whom Gowing had applied for a loan of two dollars to pay his expenses while away from home, the said two dollars, which were immediately handed over to Gowing. This charge was held by the court below to have been a bon\u00e2 fide loan by Stock to Winters.\nThe evidence relied on in support of this charge is also reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\n3. The Lavelle Case, Nos. 115 and 120 in the particulars, were as follows:\nJohn Duggan, being an agent of the respondent, corruptly gave or provided, or caused to be given or provided, to one Anthony Lavelle, on the polling day of the said election, drink and refreshment, for the purpose of corruptly influencing the said Anthony Lavelle to vote for the respondent, and to refrain from voting for the said S. R. Hesson, at the said election.\nWilliam Daly, an agent of the respondent, corruptly gave or provided, or caused to be given or provided, to one Anthony Lavelle on the polling day of the said election, drink and refreshment for the purpose of corruptly influencing the said Anthony Lavelle to vote for the respondent and to refrain from voting for the said S. R. Hesson, at the said election.\nOn the contradictory statements of the witnesses examined to support this charge, the trial judges dismissed the charge with costs.\nOsler Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C. with him for appellant referred to sec. 9, ch. 110 of R.S.C; secs. 86 and 88 of ch. 8, R.S.C., the Bolton Case[1]; the Lisgar Election Case[2]; the Haldimand Election Case[3]; the West Simcoe Case[4]; the Norwich Case[5] and the Cashel Case[6].\nGarrow Q. C. for respondent cited and relied; the Montcalm Case[7]; the Berthier Case[8]; the Haldimand Case[9]; the Blackburn Case[10]; the Wigan Case[11]; the Staleybridge Case[12]; the Londonderry Case[13]; and Leigh and LeMarchant on Election Law[14].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The charge in this case was number 375, which is as follows:\nJames Stock, of the City of Stratford, in the County of Perth, dealer in liquors, being an agent of the respondent, wilfully, illegally and corruptly paid or caused to be paid the travelling and other expenses of Henry Go wing, of the City of Stratford, in the County of Perth, laborer, a voter who voted at said election, in going to and returning from the polling booth at polling district No. 5 to vote at the said election for the respondent.\nThe facts in reference to this charge can hardly be said to be in dispute, nor is there any conflict of testimony. The only witnesses examined were Gowing the voter, the witness Winters who, it is alleged lent the money to the voter, and Stock who advanced the money to enable the alleged loan to be made to the voter. The determination of the case therefore depends upon whether or not proper inferences have been drawn by the court below, and the case is therefore open to the reconsideration of the appellate court.\nBaggallay J. A. in the Glannibanta Case[15] says:\u2014\nIn the course of the argument on behalf of the plaintiffs we were much pressed with the language from time to time made use of by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Admiralty cases, and particularly in the cases of the \"Julia\"[16] and the \"Alice\"[17] to the effect, that if in the Court of Admiralty there was conflicting evidence, and the judge of that court having had the opportunity of seeing the witnesses and observing their demeanour, had come, on the balance of testimony, to a clear and decisive conclusion, the Judicial Committee would not be disposed to reverse such decision, except in cases of extreme and overwhelming pressure; and it was urged upon us that in the present case there was no such extreme and overwhelming pressure as should induce us to reverse the decision of the Admiralty Division as to the question of fact upon which its decision was based.\nNow, we feel, as strongly as did the Lords of the Privy Council in the cases just referred to, the great weight that is due to the decision of a judge of first instance whenever in a conflict of testimony, the demeanour and manner of the witnesses who have been seen and heard by him are, as they were in the cases referred to, material elements in the consideration of the truthfulness of their statements. But the parties to the cause are nevertheless entitled, as well on questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand the decision of the Court of Appeal, and that court cannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions, though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses, and should make due allowance in this respect.\nIn the present case it does not appear from the judgment, nor is there any reason to suppose, that the learned judge at all proceeded upon the manner or demeanour of the witnesses; on the contrary it would appear that his judgment in fact proceeded upon the inferences which he drew from the evidence before him, and which we have really the same means of considering that he had, and with this further advantage, that we have had his view of the inferences to be drawn from the evidence as well as the evidence itself made the subject of elaborate and able discussion on both sides.\nGowing admits he got a return ticket from one Duncan Hay to go to Listowel to vote, for which he does not pretend he paid or was expected to pay. Now as to the alleged borrowing of two dollars by Gowing I think the fair inference from Gowing's testimony is that he did not consider he was really borrowing the money when he asked for it.\nQ. Did you get any money the day before the election? A. No.\nQ. The day before that again? A. No.\nQ. What? A. No.\nQ. No money? A. Do you mean given to me? Q. Yes, or lent? A. I had no money given to me.\n* * *\nQ. Any lent to you? A. I borrowed two dollars the day before the election.\nQ. From whom? A. I borrowed it from a friend named Tim Winters, at least I got it from him; it was from him I got it.\nQ. Where did the money come from; who did Tim get it from? A. I think he got it from Mr. Stock.\nIs this the way he would have spoken of the transaction, if it had been a fair bon\u00e2 fide loan? When the money was applied for there was no secrecy as to what it was wanted for. Gowing is asked:\nQ. How did you come to get Tim Winters to go to Stock to get you this money? A. I went to Tim as a friend\u2014he was the only friend I knew in Stratford\u2014and he said he was a little short, but he would get a couple for me, and I had to go up and vote.\nQ. You told him you had to go up and vote? A. Yes, or I wanted to go, at least.\nQ. And you went to see him to see if you could get the money to go up and vote? A. Yes, to see if he could let me have a couple of dollars.\nIt appears that at this time there was plenty of money in his house to enable him to go to Listowel; with reference to this he says:\nQ. You had some money of your own, had you not? A. Well, no, I hadn't.\nQ. Was there any money in your house? A. Yes.\nQ. If you wanted to go up to Listowel to vote you had plenty of money in the house to do so, hadn't you? A. Yes.\nQ. But you didn't want to pay your expenses? A. I didn't want to borrow the Missus' money to go on that business. I thought if I could get a couple of dollars it would be better.\nThe inference I draw from this, if he could get the money without any idea of returning it, it would be better, or in other words he did not want to spend his own or his wife's in the operation which he evidently thought should te paid for by some one more interested in the election, and this view is strongly confirmed by his reply to the next question. Q. Have you paid back Tim Winters or James Stock? A. No.\nO. You have not been asked for it? A. No.\nBut he does not give the slightest intimation that he ever expected or intended to pay it back. And again he admits he brought the biggest part home; he says:\nMr. Osler\u2014The money and ticket got you to go? A. I didn't require very much.\nQ. Still, you required a little? A. Yes, and I brought the biggest part of it home with me.\nAnd yet not a word about returning the unexpended amount. And all this also shows that neither Stock nor Winters looked on it as a loan to be returned. And read in the light, of Gowing's account of his obtaining the money which is as follows:\nQ. That money was for your expenses going voting, was it not; it looked like it? A. Well, I don't know; to my knowledge it was not.\nQ. You have not paid it back; you had money of your own; you wanted it for election purposes and you told it? A. This money of mine was not mine.\nQ. You bad earned it? A. No, it was money given to my Missus.\nQ. Were you earning money at this time? A. No.\nQ. But you told Tom Winters and Stock what you wanted to do was to go and vote? A. I didn't tell Stock anything about it.\nQ. Did you see Stock in the matter? A. No, not until I got the money.\nQ. Stock gave you the money? A. Yes. I am not sure whether Stock gave it to me or Winters handed it to me.\nQ. You and Winters went to Stock's together? A. No, he came to us.\nQ. Stock came to you where? A. At the bar in the Windsor Hotel.\nQ. And you were talking about your vote? A. I was talking to my friend Winters.\n* * *\nQ. And talking about your vote? A. Yes.\nQ. And you were saying how you had no money to go up and vote? A. No, I wasn't saying just that.\nQ. What were you saying? A. Just in the act of asking my friend for a couple of dollars. He says, \"I am a little short.\" And he says, \"Maybe I can borrow a couple of dollars for you,\" and just at that this gentleman came in.\nQ. And then you told him what your trouble was about going up to vote? A. Yes.\nQ. And Stock pu: his hand in his pocket and handed you the money? A. I am not sure whether he handed it to me or Winters.\nQ. You got the money? A. I got the money.\nQ. And it was the day before the election? A. Yes.\nQ. And on that money you went up and spent that on your way up and down? A. No, I went up on my ticket.\nQ. Had you got your ticket at this time? A. Yes.\nQ. And you could not go on a dry ticket? A. I didn't like to.\nQ. Were you going if you hadn't got the money? A. Yes.\nQ. What did you tell Tim Winters about that, that you could not go without money? A. No, I did not. I merely said I would like to have a shilling in my pocket to go up with.\nQ. This was after Stock came in? A. No.\nQ. What did you say after Stock came in? A. I cannot say.\nQ. Stock was a stranger to you? A. Yes.\nQ. You didn't know him? A. No.\nRemembering Stock was the agent of the candidate, I have been unable to raise a doubt in my mind that Stock and Winters both knew that Gowing required something in addition to the ticket to enable or induce him to go to vote, and that the object of giving these two dollars to Gowing was to secure his attendance to vote at Listowel.\nNow let us see what Stock says:\u2014\nJames Stock, called by respondent.\nQ. Were you present on the occasion that he refers to when some money was got from some person? A. Tim Waters came to me at the Windsor Hotel, when I came in from the store, and he asked me if I would lend him two dollars to lend a man of the name I think of Gowing, to go to Listowel to vote, and I said certainly; I lent him two dollars; I lent Tim Winters two dollars.\nPage 105.\nQ. You pulled out the two dollars and handed it to Winters? A. I gave it to Winters.\nQ. For the purpose of giving it to this man? A. No, not necessarily. Q. That is what he asked it for? A. He said, lend me two dollars, I wish to lend this man two dollars to go to Listowel to vote.\nQ. Lend me two dollars that I may lend it to this man to go to Listowel to vote. Have you got the money back since? A. Yes.\nThere can be no clearer admission that here an agent of the candidate knew that this money was handed over to Gowing to enable or to induce him to go to Listowel to vote. And we have this equivocating testimony as to when he got the money back. He is asked:\u2014\nQ. Since you got your subpoena? Before I got my subpoena.\nQ. When? A. I don't know when it was I got it back.\nQ. When? A. I got it back, it is immaterial when. Two dollars is a very small item.\nQ. It is nothing at election times. When did you get it back? A. I got it back some time last week or this week. Tim told me it was about time to pay it back.\nPage 106.\nQ. Was it not this week? A. I would not say it was this week or last week.\nQ. Will you swear it was not this week? A. I would swear it was not this week or last; at least I would swear it was either this week or last week.\nQ. What about yesterday? Will you swear you didn't get it yesterday? A. No.\nQ. Will you swear you didn't get it this morning? A. I don't think I got it this morning.\nQ. Will you swear you didn't? A. I would not swear I didn't get it this morning.\nQ. I won't try you about to-morrow. Are you sure you have got it? A. Well, I got two dollars back from Tim Winters. It is immaterial when I got it. I could have got it at any time.\nQ. You never asked him for it, did you? A. For the two dollars?\nQ. Yes? A. It was immaterial with regard to asking him.\nQ. You never asked him for it? A. I never asked him for the two dollars.\nQ. Did you ask him for it? A. Yes, I did; I thought it was time to pay it back.\nQ. When? A. Last week.\nQ. You got it this morning or yesterday or last week, or something? A. Or this week. I cannot read this without drawing the inference that this money would never have been returned but for the proceedings taken in this case, and that at the time it was advanced it never was intended to be repaid.\nIt would appear to have been a great object to secure this vote, for not only was the ticket given and two dollars advanced, but this Mr. Winters loaned Gowing his own coat and had to borrow another for himself to enable him to go to vote.\nMr. Winters is asked, \"Have you been repaid the money?\" He replies, \"Not yet,\" and does not express the idea or expectation that it ever would be repaid, or that there was any intention that it should be repaid. This is the account he gives of the transaction:\u2014\nTimothy Winters (formerly sworn). By Mr. Garrow:\nQ. You are the bar tender at the Windsor Hotel in this place? A. Yes.\nQ. And you were in the month of March last? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you ever lend any money to a man called Gowing? A. I did.\nQ. The witness who was in the box? A. Yes.\nQ. How much was it? A. Two dollars.\nQ. Just state the circumstances? A. I think it was the evening before the election he came in, and he said that he had been sick for sometime, and he asked me if I would lend him two dollars. I told him I hadn't it on me just at the time, but said I will borrow it for you, and borrowed it from Mr. Stock, who appears to have arrived very opportunely, just in the nick of time, and gave it to him. I also lent him my overcoat to go to Listowel.\nQ. Was anything said between you and Stock, as to what the money was wanted for? A I don't know whether there was or not. I would not be positive whether there was anything said or not.\nQ. You borrowed the money? A. Yes. It would not have made any difference anyway. I would have lent him the money, for I have lent him money before, in Listowel.\nQ. You both came together from Listowel? A. Yes.\nQ. Have you been repaid the money? A. Not yet.\nQ. Have you paid the money back? A. I have.\nQ. To Mr. Stock? A. I did. Q. When did you pay it back? A. Not very long ago, either the latter part of last week or the beginning of this.\nCross-examination:\nQ. Since you were subpoenaed in this case, you paid the money back? A. No, I was subpoenaed since I paid the money back.\nQ. Since the last sitting of this court? A. Yes.\nQ. And the voter has not paid you back? A. No.\nQ. You knew he was going to Listowel to vote? A. I did.\nQ. And he could not go without an overcoat, and without money? A. Well, I suppose he could have gone on without money, for he told me he had his ticket, but I knew that he had always voted Liberal, and his father had always voted Liberal.\nQ. And you thought it would be a nice thing to hand him two dollars to pay his way up? A. I didn't give it to him for that at all.\nQ. It was the same occasion that he got the overcoat? A. Yes.\nQ. And the overcoat was got to go to vote? A. I guess it was.\nAs to the witness Winters loaning Gowing money, it seemed to resolve itself pretty much to this:\nQ. When he was down at heel, you would give him a quarter? A. Yes.\nQ. How long ago? A. At different times; I suppose 3 or 4 years ago, 5 years ago.\nQ. You didn't have any money dealings with him for months and months? A. No.\nQ. Might we say years? A. No, not years.\nQ. Inside 2 years? A. Probably 2 years.\nAfter giving the case every consideration of which I am capable, and examining the evidence with the greatest care, I am unable to escape the conclusion that this alleged loan was nothing more nor less than a mere colourable transaction; that the only fair inferences to draw from the evidence are that the admitted agent of the candidate knew the object of the supposed loan; that the money was not returned by Winters to Stock until after the commencement of these proceedings; that it was only then done in consequence of these proceedings and to disguise the transaction; that Stock advanced the money for the purpose for which it was applied for, namely, to secure Gowing's attendance at the polls; that there was no loan to the voter; that the money never was returned by the voter, and it never was contemplated by Stock or Winters, that it should ever be returned or repaid. Under all these circumstances I think the inevitable inference is that Stock advanced the money knowing full well the purpose for which it was applied, namely, to secure the vote, and that the whole transaction was merely colourable and plainly intended to disguise the corrupt practice of which, in my opinion, the agent was guilty under section 88 of the Dominion Elections Act (37 Vic. ch. 9) which declares that, \"The payment by any candidate or by any person on his behalf of the travelling or other expenses of any voter in going to or returning from any election, is an unlawful act\"; and section 91 which declares that, \"Any offence against any one of the seven sections of this Act next preceding are corrupt practices within the meaning of this Act.\"\nOn the whole, therefore, I do not think it can be reasonably doubted that these two dollars were given to Gowing by an agent of the candidate for the purpose of paying his travelling or other expenses in going and returning from the election at Listowel, and that such payment was, therefore, an unlawful act and consequently a corrupt practice, and having been committed by the acknowledged agent of the canditate, the election of such candidate, under section 94, is void, and should be so reported to the honourable the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The first and most important case presented by this appeal is that of a charge of paying the travelling expenses of certain electors, by means of railway tickets, by Mr. Preston, the secretary of the Ontario Reform Association, who it is contended was an agent of the respondent. A similar charge was also made in respect of tickets furnished to voters by Mr. Macpherson, an admitted agent of the respondent at Stratford. It was decided by the learned judges who tried the petition that the tickets issued by the Grand Trunk Railway Company to Mr. Preston and Mr. Macpherson, and by them through their sub-agents given to electors were gratuitously issued by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and that consequently the charges of paying travelling expenses by means of these tickets were not established.\nIn the view I take of this case it is not necessary to decide the question of Mr. Preston's agency, and I express no decided opinion as to it. I propose, however, to deal with the case upon the assumption that Mr. Preston was an agent, for whose acts the respondent is responsible.\nThe facts established by the evidence relating to the tickets issued to Mr. Preston may be summarily stated as follows:\u2014\nA few days before the polling day at the last general election in February and March, 1891, Mr. Ryan, a member of the Reform Club at Toronto, who is not proved to have been an agent of the respondent, had an interview with Mr. Arthur White, an officer of the Grand Trunk Railway Company stationed at Toronto, who describes his office as being that of \"District General Freight Agent.\" At this interview Mr. Ryan stated to Mr. White (to use the words of the latter) that the Canada Pacific Railway Company were issuing free tickets to voters that had to be moved,\" to which Mr. White replied that he was quite confident that if the Canada Pacific Railway Company did so the Grand Trunk Company would do so likewise. Mr. White further says, in his examination as a witness at the trial, that although he could not make a bargain or agreement with Mr. Ryan, he thinks he led Mr. Ryan to think that would be the policy of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, although he had no authority whatever for saying so. Then, in answer to the question, \"Did the conversation go further than this, did it take any practical form?\" The witness answers, \"I think the practical form it took I suggested to him that he should give an order or get the party to give an order on our agent, and it would be honoured the same as any other large body of excursionists would have been honoured.\" Then, we find in Mr. White's deposition, further material evidence which I extract:\nQ. What was to be done with the tickets afterwards? A. The question of settlement for tickets would be an after-consideration, and I thought the Grand Trunk would not charge for them.\nQ. What did you tell him as to the settlement as to them? A. I said \"the question of settlement will be an after-consideration, and I imagine the Grand Trunk will not charge you anything for them.\"\nQ. And you told him to send in requisitions to ticket agents? A. Yes.\nQ. That the question of settlement would be an after-consideration? A. Yes, but leading him at the same time to think that the Grand Trunk would not charge him.\nQ. Did you tell him what authority you had for thinking so? A. I was traffic manager on the Midland division, and where I was then I had power to give free tickets, and I gave free tickets to a great many people.\nThen on cross-examination the same witness states:\nI did not say anything about payment. I thought the Grand Trunk would surely give them free if the Canada Pacific was doing the same thing.\nQ. Then they were to have free transportation? A. That was the effect of it. I think that was the effect on Mr. Ryan's mind.\nQ. That was the effect on Mr. Ryan's mind? A. I fancy Mr. Ryan had that impression.\nQ. And Mr. Ryan tells us in the box he left you from these interviews with the understanding they were to have free transportation for voters? A. I think Mr. Ryan may very well have gone away with that impression. I am saying that all along.\nQ. So far as that conversation at all events was concerned, there was not a word about payment in it? A. I said the question of settlement would be an after-consideration, and certainly I led Mr. Ryan to think there would be no after-settlement.\nThen Mr. Ryan, in his evidence says Mr. White told him to forward these requisitions to Mr. Slatter, the Grand Trunk Railway's ticket agent at Toronto, which was done, Mr. Ryan writing out several of these requisitions himself. This witness also says referring to his interview with White:\u2014\nFrom what he said I had the impression we would get the privilege and requisitions were then made on Mr. Slatter for tickets and railway passes.\nAnd on being asked\u2014\nWas there any bargain as to the price or payment, or anything of that kind? Mr. Ryan answers: \"No, no bargain at all, no price, it was without money and without price.\"\nAnd then the examination thus proceeds:\nQ. Was anything said about that? A. Yes, I said the Reform committee was in no position to pay for anything, that they had no exchequer to draw upon. The Grand Trunk should extend to us the same privilege that the Canada Pacific were extending to the Conservative electors.\nQ. What did you mean by that? A. I meant to say that we had no money to pay.\nQ. The same privilege? A. Of forwarding electors to support the Conservative candidates all over the Dominion of Canada without price, free.\nQ. That was the same privilege you wanted from the Grand Trunk? A. Yes.\nThe witness also swears that he has never been asked to pay for the tickets and never had any intention of doing so. And he adds that the understanding was \"they should be conveyed for nothing, no charge whatever.\" Immediately after the interview with Mr. White, Mr. Ryan returned to the Reform Club, saw Mr. Preston and told him that he had made an arrangement to have the voters conveyed free of charge and that free tickets were to be procured from Mr. Slatter. Preston's own words are Mr. Ryan, as soon as he came into the room, said we could get our free tickets. Mr. Ryan when he came back told me that Mr. White told him to tell me if I would send round to Mr. Slatter we could get tickets or transportation as we wanted.\nPreston further says that he believed all the time he was using free tickets, and that he would not have used the order for a single one if he had thought they were not free. Moreover, independently of what was said to Mr. Ryan by Mr. White there was a direct communication by him to Mr. Preston which warranted the latter in believing that the tickets were to be issued gratuitously Mr. Preston says:\nWhen Mr. White came into my office, I think perhaps an hour or two after Ryan returned from his visit, and I said to him then, I think I commenced the conversation by saying I am very glad the Grand Trunk is giving us transportation, allowing us to get our voters out, or we would not be able. His reply was\u2014Well, the Grand Trunk could not do less.\nActing upon what had been said by Mr. White to himself and to Mr. Ryan, Mr. Preston then saw Mr. Slatter, the ticket agent, whose account of what took place is as follows:\nQ. Did you have any communication with Mr. Preston yourself? A. Yes, Mr. Preston saw me and told me he was going to draw orders on me for tickets, and I told him I would accept them.\nQ. Then you did see Mr. Preston? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you arrange about the price or anything? A. No.\nQ. Nothing said atout excursion prices? A. No.\nQ. Had you any instructions from headquarters about this time about tickets? A. At the commencement I had not when Mr. Preston first drew on me, but after he had sent several orders I wired my general passenger agent and he instructed me to continue honouring the orders.\nActing upon the arrangement thus made with Mr. White and Mr. Slatter, Preston made requisitions on Slatter for, and there were issued to him, tickets amounting in the aggregate at a mileage rate of charge to $3,384.13. The requisition upon which these tickets were issued was addressed to Mr. Slatter and was in the following form:\nPlease issue to bearer ticket from to and return and charge to the account of .\nAnd were either signed by Preston or stamped with his name by his authority.\nApart altogether from the tickets issued to Mr. Preston under the arrangement with White and Slatter, Mr. Preston had other transactions with the Grand Trunk Railway Co. during, the course of the election. These had nothing whatever to do with the election for North Perth. For certain special trains hired during the election, and for some fares from Chicago to Cayuga and from Chicago to Kingston an account was furnished to Mr. Preston by the Grand Trunk Railway Co. on the 21st March, 1891, the amount being $463.90. It was accompanied by a letter from Mr. J. F. Walker, traffic auditor, in which it was stated that a supplementary account might follow.\nOn the 25th March, 1891, a letter asking for payment of this account was sent to Mr. Preston by Mr. Wright, the treasurer of the Grand Trunk Company. On the 4th of May, 1891, a further account headed \"Supplementary Account\" amounting to $18.80 was sent to Mr. Preston by Mr. Walker for certain specified tickets furnished to Mr. Preston, none of which had any connection with this election. Both these accounts were paid by cheque in one sum. No account in respect of the tickets issued at Toronto by Slatter under the arrangement before mentioned was furnished until the 28th of August, 1891, when an account for $3,384.13 was sent by Mr. Walker to Mr. Preston. This account has never been paid and no notice of the demand for payment of it was taken by Mr. Preston. It is to be observed that Mr. White did not communicate to Mr. Ryan or to Mr. Preston his want of authority to enter into an arrangement to have free tickets issued. And although nothing was said as to it by Mr. White, the question not having been asked by counsel on either side, I think from the circumstances that it is a reasonable inference that Mr. White saw Slatter the ticket agent and gave him instructions, or at least informed him of what had passed between himself and Mr. Ryan before any tickets were issued. Further, Mr. Ryan did not inform Mr. Preston that Mr. White had made any allusion to any subsequent settlement or that any question as to it would be considered; on the contrary he told him that the tickets would be absolutely free.\nUpon this state of facts the learned judges who tried the petition came to the conclusion that the tickets were issued as free tickets, and that at all events Mr. Preston so believed and had reasonable grounds for that belief. In this conclusion I entirely agree. It is, in my opinion, the only just inference from the facts in evidence. It cannot be presumed that Mr. Ryan knew that Mr. White had no authority to make the arrangement he did, and when Slatter acted upon the arrangement, Mr. Preston, even if he had had the whole conversation communicated to him would have been justified in assuming that Mr. White either had power to issue passes or tickets free of charge, or that he had before communicating with Slatter, obtained authority to do so. Again, it is to be remembered that Mr. Ryan distinctly told White that there were no funds to pay for these tickets, and it is out of the question to suppose that White could have thought that either Mr. Preston or Mr. Ryan were undertaking a personal responsibility to pay for them. The conclusion is inevitable that Ryan must have supposed that the tickets were to be free, as White very candidly says he led him to think they would be. Under these circumstances there could have been no contract either with Ryan or Preston, for the tickets being referrable to the agreement with White, no court could hold Preston liable merely on the strength of the words \"charge to the account of\" contained in the printed form of requisition. All the circumstances are to be considered together, and when this is done, these words are immaterial. Moreover, as I shall point out, there are other reasons why these tickets could not legally be treated as issued otherwise than gratuitously, which would have alone, irrespective altogether of any specific agreement, debarred the Grand Trunk Railway Company from recovering the price of them from Preston.\nAs regards the tickets issued at Stratford to Mr. Macpherson, the chief agent of the respondent there, they were undoubtedly issued free of charge. With these Mr. Preston had nothing to do. Mr. Hanna, an officer attached to the department of Mr. Wainwright, the assistant general manager of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, who was sent up from Montreal, supplied with tickets in blank, saw Mr. Macpherson, asked him what tickets he wanted and gave him such as he required, no requisition being signed for them. The facts regarding the issue of these last tickets are not only conclusive to show that these particular tickets were intended to be free, but they also reflect light upon the intention of the Grand Trunk Company's authorities with regard to the tickets issued at Toronto. They show that the Grand Trunk Company were issuing free tickets and no reason is suggested why any difference should be made between the tickets issued at Stratford and those issued at Toronto to Preston. On the whole the conclusion is, in my opinion, irresistible that all the tickets were issued with the intention that they should be free of charge, and the learned judges were perfectly right in so holding.\nThen to consider the application of the law to the facts so found. The judgment appealed against decides that the tickets having been virtually railway passes, no corrupt act avoiding the election was committed in furnishing them to voters in the way in which the evidence shows them to have been dealt with. In this I also agree.\nIn the Berthier Election Appeal[18] I had occasion to consider the state of the law applying to the case in which railway passes or free tickets are furnished to voters by a candidate, or his agent. I adhere in all respects to what I there said.\nBy the 88th section of the Dominion Elections Act, (37 Vic. chap. 9, sec. 96) the payment of travelling expenses of a voter in going to or returning from an election is declared to be an unlawful act without regard to any condition being either expressed or implied as to whom the voter is to cast his vote for. By the 91st section of the same act (37 Vic. chap. 9, sec. 98) any wilful offence against the provision of section 88 is declared to be a corrupt act which under section 93 of the same act (37 Vic. chap. 9, sec. 101), if committed by a candidate or his agent is to avoid the election of such candidate.\nIn the Bolton Case[19] it was held that furnishing free railway passes to voters did not amount to paying travelling expenses, and this having been approved and followed in the Berthier Case (1), has, I consider become the law of this court, and is not now open for reconsideration. Assuming therefore, the learned judges who tried this petition were right in their finding on the facts that the tickets in question furnished to Preston were issued without charge, a finding which I entirely adopt, the law is plain, and no offence has been committed against the provision contained in section 88 of the statute.\nFurther, even if this view of the facts should be erroneous, and even granting that the Grand Trunk Railway Company should all along have intended to exact payment for the tickets, yet Mr. Preston having procured the tickets to be issued to him, believing, and having reasonable grounds for so believing, that no payment was to be exacted for them, it cannot be said that he wilfully committed an offence prohibited by the 88th section, and therefore the condition of a wilful breach of the prohibition of section 88, which is under section 91 indispensable to the act being corrupt, is not established, and the election could not therefore be avoided for it.\nFurther, whatever may be the proper conclusions from the evidence, and assuming that those I have already stated are erroneous, yet by the express provision of the law, the Grand Trunk Railway Company could not recover the price of these tickets, for by the 131st section of the statute (The Dominion Elections Act) it is enacted that\nEvery executory contract or promise, or undertaking in any way referring to, or arising out of, or depending upon any election under this act, even for the payment of lawful expenses or the doing of some lawful act shall be void in law.\nIf there had been an agreement by Mr. Preston with the Grand Trunk Railway Company, explicit in all its terms to pay for the tickets in question, they having notice they were to be used as they were in fact used, I am of opinion that this section would have applied, and would have constituted a defence to the action. The consequence of this is that even if the tickets were not in fact issued, as I think they were, upon an understanding that they were to be free, there being by the operation of this plain, clear and express provision of the law no liability to pay for them, the result must be the same as if they were issued as free tickets.\nIn the judgment I delivered in the Berthier Case[20], it is pointed ou: that even though railway tickets or passes are not paid for but are issued gratuitously, yet such a use may be made of them as to constitute an offence within section 84, subsec. (a) of the statute. And such a use is made of a ticket of this kind if it is given to a voter upon the understanding, express or implied, that he is to vote for a particular candidate. In that case the offence of bribery is committed. The analogy between the use of free railway passes and a candidate or agent taking a voter to the poll in his own carriage seems to be perfect. As regards this last case, the law is thus summarized in a Treatise on Election Law of approved authority, Leigh and Le Marchand[21]. The authors say:\nThere is still no objection to a candidate or his friends taking voters to the poll in their own carriages provided no money is paid on account of such conveyance. On the other hand an offer to convey a voter to the poll even in a private carriage on condition of his voting for a particular candidate (e. g. I will give you a ride to the poll if you will vote for A.B.) is clearly an offer of valuable consideration and as such amounts to bribery.\nIn the present case, however, there is not even a suggestion that any of the tickets which passed through Mr. Preston's hands were used in this way. They appear all to have been given to persons who were well known supporters of the respondent and prepared to vote for him and for him only if they voted at all.\nTHE LAVELLE CASE.\nThe second case which is made the subject of appeal is that of Anthony Lavelle, a voter who is charged to have been treated by John Duggan and William Daly, alleged agents of the respondent. The only evidence in support of the charge is that of Lavelle himself, whose testimony was, as the trial judges have found, and as appears from his deposition itself, unsatisfactory and contradictory, so much so that the learned judges entirely discredited him. Such being their decision it must be regarded as final and conclusive and the case may be dismissed without further comment.\nTHE GOWING CASE.\nThe charge in the particulars applicable to this case is that of the payment of the travelling expenses of a voter named William Gowing, by James Stock an agent of the respondent. The evidence, however, if it could be said to establish anything against the respondent, would not be a case of payment of travelling expenses but a case of bribery by lending. Strictly speaking the evidence might have been rejected, but as the learned judges admitted the evidence and the objection as to the inaccuracy of the particulars does not seem to have been taken, it will be better to consider it on the merits, more especially as there can be no pretense of any surprise, the three persons who alone could speak as to the facts having all been very fully examined.\nThe agency of Stock is, I think, established by the evidence of Mr. Climie, the secretary of the North Perth Reform Association, who proves it in this way. Stock was a delegate to, and in that capacity attended, the convention by which Mr. Grieve, the respondent, was nominated as a candidate. The witness says that Mr. Grieve on accepting the nomination addressed the meeting of delegates, and urged them to work for him, saying he wanted all their assistance; and this mandate was accepted by Mr. Stock as is shown by his having, as he himself proves, canvassed for the respondent.\nThe voter, William Gowing, was a bricklayer living in Stratford and having a vote at Listowel. He was a pronounced supporter of the respondent, and a free ticket had been furnished to him enabling him to go to Listowel to vote. On the day before the polling he went to Timothy Winters, who was the bar-keeper at the Windsor Hotel in Stratford, who himself came from Listowel and was an old friend and associate of Gowing's, and asked him to lend him $2, as he had no money and did not like to ask his wife for any, and yet did not want to go to Listowel without anything in his pocket. He seems to have appealed to Winters, who was also a supporter of the respondent but not an agent, not in any way as a political friend of the respondent but as an old personal friend of his own. He also asked Winters to lend him an overcoat. Winters lent him the coat but said he had not the money; just at that time, Mr. Stock, who boarded at the hotel, passed the hotel office in which Gowing and Winters were talking, and Winters appealed to him to lend him (Winters) $2, that he might lend it to Gowing to go and vote. Stock at once complied and handed over the $2 to Winters who immediately gave it to Gowing. The learned judges seem to have considered that if it was established that the loan was in truth a loan to Winters and not by Stock to Gowing, but by Winters to the latter, that the case failed. And they do find with some hesitation that the loan was not to Gowing but to Winters. I cannot, however, see that this is conclusive.\nBy section 84 subsection (a) every person who lends any money to a voter to induce him to vote is guilty of bribery. And by subsection (e) of the same section any person who advances money to any other person with the intent that such money shall be expended in bribery or corrupt practices is guilty of bribery.\nTherefore if Stock, an agent of the respondent, advanced $2 to Winters who was not an agent, with the intent that Winters should expend it in bribing the voter Gowing, Stock himself upon the plain words of the act would be guilty of a corrupt practice which, Stock being an agent, would avoid the election.\nTherefore the real question is whether Winters in lending the $2 to Gowing, intended it as a bribe or was merely doing a kindly act to accommodate an old friend. Winters says he was in the habit of lending Gowing money, that they were old friends and that he would have lent him the money any way irrespective altogether of the election. His own words are:\u2014\nI would have given it to Mr. Gowing if there had been no election at all if he came and asked for it.\nAnd again:\u2014\nAny way I would have lent him the money for I have lent him money before in Listowel.\nIt is true that the money was not paid back until just before the trial and probably not until the attention of Winters was called to it by the knowledge that it was made the subject of a charge to be investigated. But on the whole, considering the old friendly relationship between Winters and Gowing, the smallness of the sum, the fact that Gowing was already a declared supporter of the respondent's, and that as he had a free ticket to take him to Listowel and back the strong presumption is that he would have gone to vote whether he got the $2 or not, I think it would not be safe to say that the evidence establishes that the loan was made by Winters to Gowing in order to induce him to vote for the respondent or that the loan by Stock to Winters was made with any corrupt object in view. This last mentioned loan, that by Stock to Winters, may reasonably be attributed to a willingness on the part of Stock to accommodate Winters whom he seems to have known well, and whom he was probably accustomed to see several times a day at the Windsor Hotel at which he boarded, and with whom he was evidently on familiar terms of acquaintanceship. If these are correct inferences then, the learned judges having found that there were in fact two distinct loans, there is nothing in this case warranting any interference with the judgment of the Election Court. And in coming to this conclusion I place much reliance on the Youghal Case[22] as a strong authority in point. In that case an agent of a candidate canvassed C. an elector, who said that he could not vote for the candidate as he was under an obligation to D. (an agent or friend of the other candidate) who had a judgment against him for rent. The agent upon this said he would pay it off and went to D.'s office and tendered it on behalf of C. the voter, but D. the creditor not being at home his clerk refused to take it. It appeared, however, that the agent of the candidate who offered to pay the debt was also agent to a brewer who supplied porter to the publicans of the town and amongst them to C. the voter canvassed, and that it was customary with him to assist the publicans who dealt with him when they were pressed, by advances of money to pay off claims. Both C. the voter and the agent swore that the loan contemplated had nothing to do with the vote. It was held under these circumstances that there was not sufficient evidence of a corrupt intention. It should be remarked of this case that it is only referred to in the head-note and not in the body of the report, but it appears to have been reported by Mr. Cunningham who was himself one of the counsel in the case, and it is referred to by the reporter in his own work on corrupt practices as an authority[23]. I think therefore it is a safe authority to follow, more especially as it seems to be a decision supported by a reasonable view of the law.\nThen applying the principle of the Youghal Case[24] to the facts in evidence in the present, I think there is much more reason here for attributing the trifling loan to Gowing to the relationship of old friendship existing between the parties, and not to any corrupt intent, than there could possibly have been in the Youghal Case, more especially as we have the fact, which did not exist in the Youghal Case (2), that the voter here was not canvassed, but was already a declared supporter of the respondent, who had the means of going to vote for him and would, there is every reason to presume, have so done even if he failed in getting the sum he wanted to borrow. I must therefore hold there is no evidence of corrupt intent, and that this charge also fails.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs, and a certificate sent to the Speaker that Mr. Grieve was duly elected.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the Gowing charge 375, there is, it seems to me, only one fair inference to be drawn from the evidence as a whole, and that is that the payment of the $2 by Stock was to pay Gowing's travelling expenses and to aid in procuring the vote. All leads to this. Winters had never made to this man a loan of such an amount before, he had had no dealings with him for two years, he was not a man able or likely to return a loan. The money was never returned by Gowing, never was asked for. After the beginning of the trial, some seven months after, Winters paid Stock back, but evidently only to protect the respondent's case. If there had been no petition against him Winters would not have returned this $2 to Stock. Do we hear of any so-called loans except in election times? Would Gowing have thought of his old friend Winters if it had not been election day? I agree with the Chief Justice upon his reasoning that the appeal should be allowed. I need not restate the facts; it has been done twice just now, and probably will be repeated twice again. That ought to be sufficient.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In all cases of mere matters of fact, the finding upon which depends upon the credibility of witnesses or upon the due balancing of contradictory evidence, the judgment of the learned judge who hears and sees the witnesses should never, in my opinion, be reversed by an appellate court, and the more especially is this the case with the judgments rendered upon these election petitions, the trial of which takes place before two judges whose concurrent opinion is necessary to the avoiding of the election; but where the question in issue depends upon the proper inference to be drawn from undisputed facts the appellate court equally as the trial court is bound to exercise its independent judgment.\nNow, the question in the present case is not whether one or another state of facts existed, but what is the proper inference to draw as to the intention of the parties to the transaction in question as to the facts of which there is no dispute\u2014namely, was the handing of the two dollars by Stock to Winters intended as a bon\u00e2 fide loan from Stock to Winters, and was the handing of that same two dollars directly by Winters to Gowing, if that was the form of the transaction which is not quite clear, intended to' be a bon\u00e2 fide loan from Winters to Gowing with which Stock had no concern, or on the contrary was the advance by Stock an advance made for the purpose and with the intention of Stock, who was an agent of the respondent, thus contributing to the paying of Gowing's travelling and other expenses from Stratford to the poll to vote for the respondent? And I must say that I concur with the Chief Justice in thinking that the latter was the intention of the parties is the only reasonable conclusion which the acts of the parties in evidence warrant and the only one which, having due regard to the object and intent and letter of the statute, can with propriety be drawn from those acts and the evidence. I therefore concur in the opinion that the appeal must be allowed and the election avoided upon this case.\nAs the majority of the court concur in thinking the election must be voided upon this case I abstain from the expression of any opinion whether the Grand Trunk Railway tickets were issued gratuitously or not, and the more especially so because it was said in evidence in the case that the Grand Trunk Railway Co, intend suing for the amount of the tickets in which case will necessarily arise the question whether they were issued gratuitously or not.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The most important questions on this appeal arise in the cases called the Grand Trunk ticket cases.\nUpon these cases we have distinct findings of fact.\nMr. Preston, who is secretary of the Reform Association, an organization which appears to exist for the purpose of promoting the interests of the political party to which the respondent belongs, is held to be an agent of the respondent. He obtained from the Grand Trunk Railway Company a large number of passenger tickets upon requisitions addressed by him to the company, and several of these tickets were given to voters to enable them to travel free of cost to themselves to and from their polling places.\nThe principal question of fact concerning these tickets is whether they were to be paid for by Preston to the company, or whether they were not given gratuitously by the company, the passengers being really carried free.\nMuch of the discussion before us, as well as at the trial, turned upon the form of the requisitions signed by Mr. Preston, and certain correspondence with and accounts kept or rendered by the company's auditor, and upon the effect of these and some other things as evidence of a personal liability of Mr. Preston for the price of the tickets.\nThat gentleman had, no doubt, furnished evidence that was capable of being used to establish a prim\u00e2 facie case agains; him if he were sued by the company; possibly a strong prim\u00e2 facie case, but one which might be met by other evidence, some of which is found in the record before us. The result of such a suit must at present be a matter of speculation only. The learned judges did not assume to decide it, but they agreed that the tickets were obtained by Preston under the belief that they were not to be paid for but that the railway company was to carry the voters gratuitously.\nTaking that to be the fact, what is the law?\nIt is found in the group of sections of the Dominion Elections Act[25] beginning with section 84 and headed \"Prevention of Corrupt Practices and other Illegal Acts.\"\nSection 84 declares that \"the following persons shall be guilty of bribery and shall be punishable accordingly,\" going on to define various acts and to enact that \"every person so offending is guilty of a misdemeanour and shall also forfeit the sum of $200,\" &c. Section 85 is similar in its structure, describing other persons who are to be held guilty of bribery and punished in the same way as under section 84.\nNow it is to be noted that these sections do not deal with the effect of bribery, as there defined, upon the election or upon any vote thereat. They merely prescribe the penalty upon the offender. They follow the English enactment under which the case of Cooper v. Shade[26] was decided, and which is found in the second section of The Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, 1854,[27].\nThat was an action for penalties, not a contest as to the validity of any vote or of any election.\nSection 86 deals with corrupt treating by a candidate, imposing on the candidate a penalty of $200 in addition to any other penalty to which he may be liable under any other provision of the act, and providing for striking off one vote for every person corruptly treated. The second part of the section is not confined to candidates. It declares that giving refreshments to a voter on nomination day or polling day on account of the voter having voted or being about to vote is an illegal act and entails a penalty of $10.\nSection 87 defines the offence of undue influence, making it a misdemeanour and subjecting the offender to a penalty of $200.\nSection 88, to which I shall by and by refer more particularly, deals with the conveyance of voters, characterising the acts it forbids as unlawful acts, subjecting offenders to a penalty of $100, and if the offender is a voter disqualifying him from voting at the particular election. Section 89 defines personation, and attaches to that offence a penalty of $200, with liability to imprisonment.\nSection 90 deals with subornation of personation or inducing any one to take a false oath, making the offence a misdemeanour, and further subjecting the offender to a penalty of $200.\nThen section 91 declares that bribery, treating, or undue influence as defined by that or any other act of the parliament of Canada, personation or the inducing any person to commit personation, or any wilful offence against any one of the seven sections next preceding are corrupt practices within the meaning of the act, and by section 93 a corrupt practice committed by a candidate or his agent avoids the election.\nIt will be noticed that while section 91 designates by name bribery, treating, undue influence, personation, and inducing to commit personation, five of the sixclasses of offences dealt with in the preceding seven sections, as corrupt practices, it does not specifically name any offence against section 88, but covers offences connected with the conveyance of voters only by the general reference to any wilful offence against any of the seven sections. It may perhaps be the proper construction of section 91 that the five enumerated classes of offences, so far as they depend on this act and are not offences under any other act, do not become corrupt practices unless committed wilfully, but it is clear that no contravention of section 88 is made a corrupt practice unless it is a wilful offence. An offender against that section may, like the defendant in Cooper v. Slade[28], be liable to the penalty, no matter how innocent he may be of any intention to disobey the law, but unless he offends wilfully his act is not corrupt practice. Take Mr. Preston's case. He may possibly have become legally liable to pay for the tickets by reason of the form of the transaction, or for want of written evidence of the concurrence of the railway company in the understanding on which he acted, or because no one who could bind the company in fact agreed to carry the voters free of charge, and if that should be held to be so the logical result might be that he is liable to the pecuniary penalty under the terms of section 88. But becoming liable by reason of his want of care and his neglect to have his real understanding properly expressed, yet contrary to his intention as well as to his understanding of the transaction, he could not be held guilty of a corrupt practice without striking out of section 91 the important word \"wilful.\"\nThe position is very different from that in question before this court in Young v. Smith[29]. The person who in that case was held by a majority of the court to have committed a corrupt practice had hired a team to bring voters to the place where the poll was to be held. What he did was exactly what he intended to do, though he had assumed that the act was not illegal except when done on polling day, while he had sent for the voters a day or two earlier.\nIt is unnecessary to say anything about some of the tickets which did not reach the voters through Mr. Preston.\nThe charges, then, are reduced to this, that the railway company, being owner of vehicles, carried voters in them to the polls or to the neighbourhood thereof. Whether that should be permitted or not, as a matter of policy, is not for the consideration of this tribunal. The owner of a carriage may lawfully drive voters to the poll. So may the owner of many carriages, like a livery stable-keeper, our law differing in this respect from the English Act of 1833[30] which does not allow public stages or vehicles kept for hire to be used in that way. As a question of the interpretation of the statute, there is no sound reason for applying a different rule to a railway company which chooses to employ its carriages in the same way.\nI believe the charges touching these railway tickets are all framed on the particulars under section 88, for paying the traveling and other expenses of voters, with the exception of the charges relating to two brothers named Ruhl. As to each of these men there is the further charge that an agent of the candidate gave or agreed or offered or promised to give money or valuable consideration to induce the voter to vote for this particular candidate, and to refrain from voting for the other. This is a charge of bribery under section 84, and the valuable consideration relied on (there being no pretense of bribery with money) is the same free ticket on which the charge under section 88 is based.\nI have not been able to find a note of any remarks made by the learned judges concerning these charges, and I do not think we were referred to any such note. The charges are negatived by the dismissal of the petition, and we are now asked to characterize the handing of the railway tickets to these men as bribery on the evidence that the tickets were given to them under the circumstances thus spoken of by one of the brothers.\nQ. What was the ticket given for? A. It was given to me to come up here and vote.\nQ. Who told you that? A. The way it was, they sent a telephone down for me to come up to vote here, and I did not want to go, but then I said if they will drive me down free, down to Berlin and then if they give me a free ticket up and fetch me back here, Sebringville, and bring me back again, I go up and vote, but not no other way. I would not have gone with my own money for I had no money to go with.\nQ. They telephoned to George in the same way? A. They telephoned for both of us.\nQ. What did George say about coming down? A. He did not say much at all; all he said, \"if I will go, he will go too.\"\nThis appears to me the ordinary case of conveying a voter to the poll, and is not the less so by reason of the circumstance that the voter did not want to go, but would have stayed at home if he had not been carried free. That circumstance, if it has any significance, shows that the ticket was not, to a voter of this disposition, a valuable consideration in the sense of saving his money. It is a case that in my opinion has to be dealt with under section 88. To attempt by refining upon some turn of expression in the evidence, or on the meaning to which the term \"valuable consideration\" is capable of being extended, in order to make out an offence under the other section is to strain the language of the statute and not to give their fair effect to its purpose and intent. Bribery may, no doubt, be committed under colour of paying travelling expenses, and courts are expected to see through that or any other pretense resorted to for the purpose of disguising the real transaction; but when the real transaction is apparent we have no right to make something else of it, something unreal, by means of ingenious reasoning.\nIn connection with the charge now under discussion we have been referred to Cooper v. Slade[31], a case in which letters were written to electors, on behalf of a candidate, asking them to come and vote for that candidate and promising that their travelling expenses should be paid. The question, which came before the courts on a bill of exceptions, was whether there was any evidence for the jury that (within the words of the statute) the electors were promised money to induce them to vote. It was held in the Exchequer Chamber that there was no evidence for the jury, but that decision was reversed in the House of Lords. I may quote a few words from the opinion delivered by Lord Cranworth, partly by way of introduction to a remark which I have to make:\n\"Now surely,\" His Lordship said, \"if I say to a person 'If you come to Cambridge and vole for me, I will give you money, being the amount of whatever expense you may pay for coming up to vote,' that is giving money bo the voter for the purpose of inducing him to vote; it is giving money to him to indemnify him for something which, but for giving the money, he would have to pay out of his own pocket? It may be a matter for your Lordships and for the other house of Parliament, in your legislative capacity, to consider whether it would not be reasonable to alter this enactment and to say that money bon\u00e2 fide paid, which is no more than an equivalent for the expense of coming to vote, ought not to be considered as a bribe.\"\nThe enactment thus referred to has not been altered by any statute directly professing to do so. It is the same law which we have in section 84. But in England there was in 1883 the enactment with respect to parliamentary elections[32], and in 1884 with respect to municipal elections[33], that made any payment or contract for payment of any kind made on account of the conveyance of electors to or from the poll, whether for the hiring of horses or carriages or for railway fares or otherwise, for the purpose of promoting the election of any candidate, an illegal practice. The same acts made it illegal to let, lend, or employ, or hire, borrow or use, for the conveyance of electors, any public stage or hackney carriage or other vehicle kept for hire, though it left electors, singly or several at their joint cost, at liberty to hire carriages, &c., to convey themselves.\nSome things which these statutes declare to be illegal practices might by a very literal reading of the definition of bribery, as in our section 84, be construed to be an offence of that kind, as being payment or promise of money to some person in order to induce voters to vote, but it may be reasonably doubted whether, in the absence of actual intention to commit the graver offence, a prosecution for bribery by paying travelling expenses, the payment not being excessive, would now be sustained in any English court.\nIn Cunningham on Elections the author or editor[34], speaking, as I understand him, of the time before 1883, founds upon the case of Cooper v. Slade[35] the remark that the law on the subject of travelling expenses had been in a state of great uncertainty. He follows this remark by a reference to the acts of 1883 and 1884. There had been also other legislation on the subject after the cause of action in Cooper v. Slade (2) had arisen. That case was decided under the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, 1854[36]. The election in question was very shortly after the passage of the act. It occurred in August, 1854. The trial took place in 1855, the decision of the Exchequer Chamber was given in 1856, and the appeal to the House of Lords was argued in July, 1857. In 1857[37] it was declared to be lawful for the candidate or his agent by him appointed in writing to provide conveyance for any voter for the purpose of polling at an election and not otherwise, but not lawful to pay any money or give any valuable consideration to a voter for or in respect of his travelling expenses for such purpose; and the Representation of the People Act, 1867[38], enacted that it should not be lawful for any candidate or any one on his behalf at any election for any borough, except five which were named, to pay any money on account of the conveyance of any voter to the poll, either to the voter him- self or to any other person, making such payment an illegal payment within the meaning of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, 1854.\nMr. Justice Williams, who dissented from the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Cooper v. Slade[39] holding the opinion that was afterwards affirmed by the House of Lords, said:\nI am quite aware that the statute, as I have construed it, will act harshly, and apply to cases which can hardly have been in the contemplation of the legislature. But the language of the act appears to me so plain and unambiguous that these considerations afford only an argument to prove that the statute was inconsiderately passed and ought to be amended.\nThis suggested amendment of the law seems to have been made in England by the effect of the acts of 1857, 1867 and 1883, which, providing specially for the class of cases, modified the application to that class of the bribery clauses of the act of 1854. It left those clauses to apply to actual bribery committed under cover of paying travelling expenses, but provided a way for dealing with those payments which were not meant for bribes though perhaps capable of being brought literally within the statutory definition of bribery.\nIn the Domini on Elections Act we have both sets of provisions.\nSection 88 of the Revised Statute follows section 96 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874. Familiar as the provision may be, we may as well look at the exact language of section 96:\nAnd whereas doubts, may arise as to whether the hiring of teams and vehicles to convey voters to and from the polls, and the paying of railway fares and other expenses of voters be or be not according to law, it is declared and enacted that the hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab or other vehicle by any candidate or by any person on his behalf to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighbourhood thereof at any election, or the payment by any candidate or by any person on his behalf of the travelling and other expenses of the voter in going to or returning from any election are and shall be unlawful acts.\nHaving regard to this recital as well as to the enactment to which it is introductory, and bearing in mind that in section 91, as already noticed, the word \"wilful\" is applied to the bribery clauses as well as to those relating to other offences, and that whatever may be the proper force of the word in relation to bribery, &c., it must be held, on ordinary principles, to have some meaning, we have sufficient reason to be cautious before finding constructive bribery in transactions specially provided for by section 88, where no intentional bribery is shown.\nThe cases of the brothers Ruhl may perhaps hardly require a discussion of the matters to which I have been adverting, because those men, like the other free ticket voters, received their tickets, or were supposed by the agents of the candidate to have received them, in effect, though indirectly, from the railway company.\nHowever this may be I see no ground for finding the charges established.\nThere are two other cases to dispose of. One is that of a man named Lavelle who was given a glass of whiskey by a woman named Mrs. Daly in her husband's house. The charge is that the whiskey was given by Daly the husband as a bribe. The question is purely one of fact, and it has been decided against the petitioner upon evidence quite sufficient to sustain that conclusion.\nThe other charge is that one Henry Gowing was paid his travelling and other expenses by one James Stock, an agent.\nThe charge is under section 88. Stock appears to have been an agent, and if by what he did he offended against section 88 he certainly did so wilfully. The learned judges agreed in holding that the charge was not established although the circumstances were very suspicious. Gowing had a free ticket but he wanted some money, apparently for the purpose of having it to spend while away from home. He asked one Winters for money, and Winters got from Stock $2 which was handed to Gowing.\nThe answer to the charge is two-fold. It is asserted that the money was merely lent to Gowing, and not given to him under colour of lending it but really by way of paying his expenses; and further that Stock neither lent nor gave the money to Gowing but lent it to Winters.\nIf the finding had been against these allegations no one could say that it was not justified. The question, however, is one of fact. It has been tried by two experienced judges who have had the witnesses before them and who agree in their conclusion. All the considerations that have been urged before us have been weighed by them, including the probability of the account given and the credibility of the witnesses. Mr. Justice Rose is reported as having made these observations:\nThe case is full of suspicion, and there is one fact, which is also very full of suspicion, that the money was not repaid till the day before election trial began, and possibly not paid until the morning of the day upon which investigation of this case was entered upon. The only question is whether the surrounding facts and circumstances are so strong as to lead us to disregard the statement of each of the parties to the transaction, and to require us to find that they are not telling what is true, and that the transaction was not a loan from Stock to Winters and from Winters to Gowing. I do not feel justified in saying more than that it is a casts full of suspicion, saying, further, that I am unable to find that a corrupt practice has been proven by the evidence.\nMr. Justice MacMahon made observations to the same effect. The case is thus correctly put by the learned judges as depending on the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses. It has been suggested that that is not a proper way to regard it, but that the court is asked merely to draw inferences, not to pronounce on the credibility of the witnesses. I confess my inability to understand the distinction. Three men swear to a certain fact. If they swear truly it was the fact. But it is said they do not swear truly, though no one swears to the contrary. There are circumstances: one man asks another to lend him money; the second man, not having any, asks number three for it; and number three supplies the money which is handed to number one who wants it for spending money at the election. These facts are all consistent with what the three men swear to, viz., that the money was merely lent. So are the other facts which throw suspicion on the reality of the alleged loan. It may be that all the story of the loan is utterly untrue. In other words it may be that the three men swore falsely. It may be very unlikely, or may seem so, that it should be only a loan. You may infer from all the circumstances that it was not a loan. That is to say, you may infer that the men swore falsely. The suspicious aspect of the transaction and the difficulty of accepting the sworn testimony as outweighing the inferences one might be otherwise inclined to draw from the circumstances do not touch the principle which would be the same if the sworn testimony and the inferences were more nearly balanced. It is to my mind a case simply of weighing probabilities against the oaths of witnesses. Is it our duty under the circumstances to do that?\nThere is of course no question of our jurisdiction or of our duty to hear appeals on questions of fact as well as of law. So it was in all the cases in which it has been laid down in this court that a decision depending on a conflict of evidence or on the credibility of witnesses ought not to be interfered with. The rule has been acted on in election cases tried before a single judge. It should a fortiori apply under the present law when the trial is before two judges.\nAn early case in this court in which the rule was enunciated and acted on was The Picton[40]. In one of the judgments delivered in that case a passage is quoted from the judgment of Lord Chelmsford in Gray v. Turnbull[41]. I may quote another passage in which the reason of the rule is neatly expressed:\nDifferent minds will of course draw different conclusions from the same facts; and there is no rule or standard which can be referred to by which the correctness of the decision either way can be tested.\nIn the head note to the case of Grasett v. Carter[42] in this court the doctrine is very clearly stated:\nWhen there is a direct conflict of testimony, the finding of the judge at the trial must be regarded as decisive, and should not be overturned in appeal by a court which has not had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and observing their demeanour while under examination.\nThe cases of The Picton (1) and Gray v. Turnbull (2) are relied on in one of the judgments in Grasett v. Carter (3) as supporting that doctrine, and they are direct authority for it as a general proposition and as a rule of convenience and expediency, which I understand it to be, not in the nature of a rule of law limiting the jurisdiction of the appellate court. But the case of Grasett v. Carter (3) is capable, as it strikes me, of being understood, or perhaps misunderstood, as carrying the rule farther than that. The Picton (1) was a direct appeal from the court of first instance, and Gray v. Turnbull (2) was an appeal from the unanimous judgments of two courts, while in Grasett v. Carter (3) the court of intermediate appeal Lad reversed the finding of the primary court, which finding was restored by this court; and the statement of the doctrine, being addressed to the duty of the intermediate court, seems to me to involve the proposition that if an intermediate court reverses the decision of the primary court on a question depending on conflicting evidence, its judgment is, for that reason alone, liable to be in its turn reversed. This savours of a rule of law affecting the jurisdiction of the court. I may be wrong in supposing such a rule to be in effect laid down, and I do not understand the judgment of the court to have turned upon it.\nI have always thought that the proper principle on which appeals should be dealt with when the judgment directly appealed from has reversed a decision on a question of fact was stated by Lord O'Hagan in a case of Symington v. Symington[43] some five years later in date than Gray v. Turnbull[44], but found in the same volume of the reports.\nOn the first question we have been fairly pressed by the argument that the Lord Ordinary, who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and judging of their veracity from their demeanour before himself, should not have his decision lightly set aside. And undoubtedly the value of viv\u00e2 voce testimony can be much better ascertained by those who hear it than by those who know it only from report. But there is this peculiarity in the present case, that the Lord Ordinary has put us somewhat in his own position and enabled us, so to speak, to see with his eyes when he states the impression produced upon him by the principal witness * * * Besides we are concerned, directly, not with the judgment of the Lord Ordinary, but with that which overruled it; and the latter we ought to affirm unless we are satisfied of its error.\nThis is, however, somewhat aside from the immediate question of the disposal of the present appeal from a court of first instance.\nFor my own part I am not disposed to lay down or to acknowledge the authority or the value of rules or formulas for the decision of questions of fact. Evidence, particularly viv\u00e2 voce evidence, will in general be best appreciated when looked at as an ordinary juror will look at it, with the mind free from theories and arbitrary rules, and by those who, like a jury, see and hear the witnesses.

J. Ritchie C.j., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF ROSE AND MacMAHON JJ. AT TRIAL OF PETITION.\nElection\u2014Promise to procure employment by candidate\u2014Corrupt practice\u2014Finding of the trial judges\u201449 Vic. ch. 8, sec. 84 (b).\nOn a charge by the petitioner that the appellant had been guilty personally of a corrupt practice by promising to a voter W. to endeavour to procure him a situation in order to induce him to vote, and that such promise was subsequently carried into effect, the trial judges held on the evidence that the charge had been proved.\nThe promise was charged as having been made in the township of Thorold on the 28th February, 1891. At the trial it was proved that W. some time before the trial made a declaration upon which the charge was based, at the instance of the solicitor for the petitioner, and had got for such declaration employment in Montreal from the C.P.R. Co. until the trial took place, and W. swore that the promise had been made on the 17th February. G. the appellant, although denying the charge, admitted in his examination that he intimated to W. that he would assist him, and there was evidence that after the elections G. wrote to W. and did endeavour to procure him the situation, but the letters were not put in evidence having been destroyed by W. at the request of the appellant.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as the evidence of W. was in part corroborated by the evidence of the appellant, the conclusion arrived at by the trial judges was not wrong, still less so entirely erroneous as to justify the court as an appellate tribunal in reversing the decision of the court below on the questions of fact involved.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Honourable Justices Rose and MacMahon who tried the election petition in this case and found the sitting member, the present appellant, guilty personally of a corrupt practice.\nThe election petition in this case charged the appellant with being guilty of corrupt practices by himself and by his agents and prayed that the appellant be unseated and disqualified.\nThe particulars of the charges furnished by the petitioner upon which the evidence with respect to the disqualification of the appellant was given at the trial were as follows\n\"3. On or about the 28th day of February, 1891, at the township of Thorold, the said respondent gave to one Joseph B. Wood, of the Village of Niagara Falls, in the said electoral district, agent, the sum of $10, in order to induce the said Wood to vote for the said respondent at the said election.\n\"4. On or about the 28th day of February, 1891, at the said township of Thorold, the said respondent agreed to procure and offered and promised to procure or to endeavour to procure place or employment for the said Joseph B. Wood, in order to induce the said Wood to vote for the said respondent at the said election.\n\"5. Some time after the said election, at the City of Buffalo, in the State of New York, one of the United States of America, the said respondent corruptly promised to procure and to endeavour to procure a place or employment for the said Joseph B. Wood, on account of the said Wood having voted for the said respondent at the said election.\" After hearing of the evidence, which is reviewed in the judgments hereafter given, the learned trial judges found the appellant W. M. Grerman guilty of having agreed to procure, and having offered and promised to procure or to endeavour to procure, a place or employment for one Joseph B. Wood, a voter entitled to vote at the said election, in order to induce the said Wood to vote for the appellant at the said election.\nThe appellant limited the subject of this appeal to so much of the judgment as granted that portion of the prayer of the petition which related to the personal charges against the present appellant, and found and declared the present appellant (the respondent in the court below) guilty of a personal corrupt practice at the said election.\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Rose on the personal charges was as follows:\u2014\n\"ROSE J.\u2014With reference to the personal charges against the respondent the facts appear, as far as may be necessary to consider them, somewhat as follows: The respondent accompanied the witness Wood to Buffalo for the purpose of obtaining a situation for him. This was possibly some two or three weeks after the election, within that time certainly. Now the respondent was in Buffalo very active in endeavouring to procure a situation for Wood. The evidence does not disclose what claim Wood had upon him, outside of the election, to demand or receive the assistance that he was then obtaining. True the respondent had acted as solicitor for Wood and his brother; but as far as the evidence discloses the witness Wood was not brought into close personal intercourse with the respondent, and there is no such personal claim shown in the evidence as would cause one to expect that the respondent would make much effort to obtain a situation for him. We then look for a cause for this action. We find that the parties met at Thorold. Now the relations between them were such as provoked words of caution from the supporters or friends of the respondent, warning him not to have anything to do with Wood, that he would get him into trouble. Exactly what conduct caused this warning is, perhaps, not made very clear unless we adopt the statement of the witness Wood; but it is clear, I think, upon the evidence, that there was then and there discussed the question of obtaining a situation for the witness Wood. We have then during the election a conversation between the respondent and the witness Wood at which was discussed the obtaining of a situation, and we have after the election the endeavour to obtain that situation by the respondent. Whether at this meeting in Thorold, owing to circumstances which were detailed in evidence, the respondent was acting incautiously, and whether under the circumstances to which I am referring his memory is not very clear as to what then did take place, and whether he was led to do and say something then that was imprudent, is perhaps a matter of surmise; but we find that after the meeting in Thorold the respondent wrote a letter to Wood. In that letter some statement was made. Wood says that it was a request to see another voter and wound up by a reference to a previous promise, and a further promise to fulfil that previous promise. Subsequently another letter was written by the respondent to the witness Wood, and in that subsequent letter without doubt upon the evidence there was a request that the previous letter should be destroyed, and that the subsequent letters should be destroyed. Both these letters were destroyed by Wood. Now everything must be presumed against one who destroys written evidence. Why were these letters destroyed? The respondent says because he had been warned against Wood. The letters therefore, and especially the first letter, must have contained something the disclosure of which would prejudice the respondent. How could a letter written under such circumstances prejudice the respondent? Only by affecting his election. How could it affect his election? Only by furnishing evidence of the commission of some corrupt practice. If the letter had reference to a corrupt practice what corrupt practice? The only practice, upon this evidence suggested, apart from other evidence to which I am not now referring, is the obtaining of employment or promising to endeavour to obtain employment for the witness Wood. I come to the conclusion as to that charge that the respondent did at Thorold for the purpose of influencing the vote of the witness Wood promise that if he would vote for him he would after the election endeavour to obtain a situation for him, and that, in pursuance of that promise given, he did endeavour to obtain a situation for the witness Wood. This evidence of a corrupt practice by the respondent compels us to grant the prayer of the petition and to find the respondent guilty of personally corrupt practice. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the other charges made, or the charge that is involved in this charge as to witness Wood. And we are glad to be relieved from further consideration of the evidence, and we have not so considered it as to come to a final and definite conclusion as to the credibility of the witnesses, If in the further history of this case we are called upon to examine that evidence and to express our opinion as to the credit to be attached to the various statements, we shall be of course compelled to enter upon an inquiry which will be unpleasant to ourselves, but we think we have sufficiently discharged our duty when we express the opinion that we are expressing in regard to this corrupt practice, declaring that the respondent is guilty of a corrupt practice, namely, a promise to the witness Wood to endeavour to procure a situation for him if he would vote for him, the respondent, and that that promise was subsequently carried into effect as far as the respondent was able to perform it.\"\nW. Cassels Q.C. appeared on behalf of the appellant, and\nBlackstock Q.C. appeared on behalf of the responddent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014All we have to deal with in this case are the following charges, namely that:\n4. On or about the 28th day of February, 1891, at the said township of Thorold, the said respondent agreed to procure, and offered and promised to procure or to endeavour to procure a place or employment for the said Joseph B. Wood, in order to induce the said Wood to vote for the said respondent at the said election.\n5. Some time after the said election, at the city of Buffalo, in the state of New York, one of the United States of America, the said respondent corruptly promised to procure and to endeavour to procure a place or employment for the said Joseph B. Wood, on account of the said Wood having voted for the said respondent at the said election.\nOn these charges the learned judges who tried the case came to the conclusion as to that charge,\nthat the respondent did at Thorold for the purpose of influencing the vote of the witness Wood promise that if he would vote for him he would after the election endeavour to obtain a situation for him, and that, in pursuance of that promise then given, he did endeavour to obtain a situation for the witness Wood. This evidence of a corrupt practice by the respondent compels us to grant the prayer of the petition and to find the respondent guilty of a personally corrupt practice.\nThis finding we are now asked to reverse.\nThe evidence of the witness Wood, as to what the appellant promised him in regard to getting a situation, is as follows: He had said he saw appellant in Thorold.\nQ. When was that? What was going on there? A. He had a meeting in Thorold the night I saw him there.\nQ. And where did you see him? A. At Hammond's hotel.\nQ. And what took place between you? A. I told him there that I had considered the thing over again and if he would give me something to do I would much rather have it than the ten dollars. Why, he says, \"I will do both.\"\nQ. Then is that all that took place on that occasion? A. Yes.\nQ. Then when did you next see him? A. At Port Robinson.\nHe then describes the circumstances under which he met appellant and is asked:\nQ. What happened? A. Well, he came in; I asked him to sit down; he said he would not sit down, he was in a hurry to get back to the meeting. He gave me the ten dollars he promised me, and told me, he says \"I give you the ten dollars now; you vote for me and after the election I will get you the situation.\"\nThen he is asked:\nQ. Did he write you a letter during the election? A. He did.\nQ. Have you got that letter? A. No, I have not.\nQ. Where is it? A. It is burned up.\nQ. Why did you burn it up? A. He asked me to.\nQ. What was in that letter? A. Well, I don't remember what there was in the first letter; I told him that day of a man named Watson that lived below there, and he wrote me the first time to see Watson and see if I could do anything with him; I could not do anything with Watson; I had no influence with any person in a political contest. He requested me to see Watson and do what I could for him, and he said he would do what he promised me.\nQ. What else? A. That was about all there was in the letter.\nQ. He said he would do as he promised you? A. Yes.\nThe appellant's testimony to a certain extent corroborates the witness Wood's, though he certainly denies that he said he would endeavour to get him a situation. This is the account which he gives of the matter:\nQ. Then, when you saw him down at Thorold, did you have any conversation with him? A. Yes, shortly. Q. Who were present on that occasion? A. There were several in the bar, but I do not think there was any person near enough to hear any conversation we had.\nQ. What was the conversation? A. Well, I think that he spoke to \"me; I think it was on that occasion that he called me to one side, and he said, Don't you know some one in Buffalo that you can introduce me to, who will help to get me a situation over there; he says, I want to get out of this conntry; I am in debt, and they are bothering me, and I want to get away. I told him I thought I did, and that was all.\nQ. You did say that you would endeavour to get him the situation? A. No, he asked me if I knew any people in Buffalo that could get him a situation. I told him I thought I did, and that was all that was said. He may have asked me when I would be going to Buffalo, and I told him I did not know, but not until after the elections anyway; that might have been said.\nQ. Did he speak to you about getting a situation, and did you intimate that you would assist him in that respect? A. There was just that of it; he asked me if I knew any people in Buffalo that could assist him.\nQ. Did you intend to represent that you did not intimate to him that you would assist him? A. There was the intimation of course.\nIs not this directly confirmatory of Wood. How should this intimation be given to Wood without conveying to Wood that he relied on his assistance. Then as to the letters he is asked:\nQ. Did you during the election write a letter to Wood? A. Don't know that I did during the election.\nQ. Will you swear that you did not? A. No.\nQ. Have you any recollection of whether you did or not? A. I have a recollection that Wood asked me here in Welland when I would be going to Buffalo, I think it was in Welland; if it was not on the Thorold occasion, and I don't think it was; I think it was in Welland he asked me when I would be going to Buffalo, he wanted to go with me. I said I didn't know, but I would let him know, and I might have dropped him a line telling him when I would be going to Buffalo; whether that was before election day or after I would not be positive.\nThe statement of Wood was certainly corroborated by the undoubted performance of the alleged promise in Buffalo; and then we have the statement by Wood that a letter was written by appellant to him, in which he says: \"He requested me to see Watson, and do what I could for him, and he would do what he promised me.\" This letter could not be produced because it had been destroyed, at appellant's request, as the following evidence clearly shows.\nWood swears:\u2014\nQ. You say that you destroyed that letter because Mr. German asked you to; how did he ask you? A. By another letter.\nQ. When? A. Before the election.\nQ. What did you do with that letter? A. I destroyed the both of them.\nQ. What were the contents of the second letter? A. He asked me if I had seen Watson and what he was going to do.\nQ. And what else? A. And if I had the first letter, why to destroy it, it wasn't necessary for any person to know anything about the first letter at all.\nQ. Did you then destroy it? A. I did.\nThe appellant's testimony as to the letters is very unsatisfactory.\nQ. Will you undertake to say that you did not write him a letter during the election? A. The only recollection I have is what I told you.\nQ. Have you any recollection of writing him a letter telling him not to tell anyone the conversation that you had with him? A. No.\nQ. Will you swear you did not? A. It is quite unlikely, there is no reason why I should.\nQ. Will you swear you did not? A. If there is such a letter I wrote it, but\u2014\nQ. Will you swear that you did not? A. No, I won't swear positively; I don't believe I did, but still if there is such a letter produced, of course it is there.\nQ. I did not ask that. Will you swear that you did not, yes or no? A. I will not swear absolutely that I did not.\nQ. If you wrote him such a letter why did you write it? A. Well, if I wrote him such a letter it would be for this reason, that I was warned by some parties here in Welland to beware of Joe Wood. Mr. Sidey, Mr. Cowper and several others saw he was with me, and they warned me to be careful of Joe Wood, that he would get me into trouble, and if I wrote the letter at all, it was with a desire to influence him not to say anything about any conversation that there was so that there could be no trouble. Q. Does that now come back to you? A. It does not.\nQ. Have you any recollection upon that subject now? A. I have not any recollection of writing the letter, I don't believe I wrote it, but if a letter of that kind is produced, then I say that is the explanation that I give of writing it.\nQ. Did you recollect writing him a letter after the election was over? A. I have no recollection as to any letter positively, excepting the one I have told you about, the day I would be going to Buffalo.\nQ. You do recollect writing him that letter? A.I think very likely I did.\nQ. And that must have been after the election? A. Well, I am inclined to think it was after the election.\nQ. It must have been, because you did not make any appointment with him to go to Buffalo until after the election? A. I made no definite appointment at all to go to Buffalo with him, and this letter, if I wrote a letter, was a letter fixing the day.\nQ. In that letter written after the election was over and making the appointment to go to Buffalo, did you add to the letter a request to Wood that he should destroy your former letter to him written to him during the election? A. I don't know.\nQ. Will you swear that you did not? A. I don't believe\u2014I don't know, I would not swear that I did not.\nQ. Have you any recollection upon that subject? A. I have no recollection excepting the recollection as to going to Buffalo.\nQ. Have you any recollection upon the subject upon which I am now asking you? A I have not.\nQ. If you wrote and was asking him to destroy your former letter, why did you do so? A. Well, I can only tell you what I have told you, that it was because I had been warned that Wood was a dangerous man, and that I had better be careful of him; that was all.\nQ. When were you warned that Wood was a dangerous man? A. I was warned that night in Thorold.\nQ. And you say you were warned by Mr. Sidey, Mr. Cowper, and who else? A. There were others, but I don't remember their names.\nThe appellant was re-called and examined by his own counsel two or three hours later, and after giving all his former evidence in such examination, deposed, in answer to the interrogatories of his own counsel, as follows:\u2014\nQ. In regard to the letters to Wood, have you any recollection about that? Mr. Blackstock\u2014He was asked all about that and he said he had no recollection.\nMr. Cassels\u2014Since your examination have you thought it over? A. After Mr. Blackstock began to examine me about writing a letter it came to my mind that I remembered writing Joe Wood a letter to destroy some letter that I had written him previously, but without any reference to the election at all. T have been trying to remember what it was. It was something regarding some private business that I had quite forgotten, but I do remember writing Joe Wood to destroy some letter that I had previously written.\nThe letters unquestionably were destroyed at appellant's request and can any one doubt that the reason why appellant wished these letters destroyed was because they, or one of them, contained matter in connection with the election, compromising the appellant? And is not the observation of the learned judges with reference to the destruction of these letters most apposite?\nThey say everything must be presumed against one who destroys written evidence. Why were these letters destroyed? The respondent says because he had been warned against Wood. The letters therefore, and especially the first letter, must have contained something the disclosure of which would prejudice the respondent. How could a letter written under such circumstances prejudice the respondent? Only by affecting his election. How could it affect his election? Only by furnishing evidence of the commission of some corrupt practice. If the letter had reference to a corrupt practice, what corrupt practice? The only corrupt practice upon this evidence suggested, apart from other evidence to which I am not now referring, is the obtaining of employment for the witness Wood. I come to the conclusion as to that charge that the respondent did at Thorold for the purpose of influencing the vote of the witness Wood promise that if he would vote for him he would after the election endeavour to obtain a situation for him, and that in pursuance of that promise then given he did endeavour to obtain a situation for the witness Wood. This evidence of a corrupt practice by the respondent compels us to grant the prayer of the petition and to find the respondent guilty of a personal corrupt practice.\nIt cannot be denied as has been repeatedly held that in cases which turn on conflicting evidence the judge, who has the witnesses before him hears the testimony and sees the manner in which they answer questions, and as my learned and lamented predecessor said in the Jacques Cartier Case[1], \"sees whether they are prompt, natural and given without feeling or prejudice, with an honest desire to tell the truth, or whether they are studied, evasive and reckless, or intended to deceive, &c.,\" is much more competent to appreciate the evidence and determine on the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight due to the statements than those who merely read the statements of the witnesses as they have been taken down.\nIn the Bellechasse Case[2], after referring to my predecessor's remarks in the Jacques Cartier Case (1), I went on to say that \"A case such as this is very different from a case at common law; there the witnesses are in general disinterested parties unconnected with the case, and so more or less impartial, while in election cases the witnesses are generally strong partisans, or more or less mixed up with the election. The opinion of the learned judge who has heard the case is entitled to great weight, and before his decision can be set aside we must be entirely satisfied that he is wrong. In affirmance with this view we have the repeated declaration of appellate courts, that on questions of fact such tribunals must be clearly satisfied that the conclusion at which the judge who tried the case arrived, was not only wrong, but entirely erroneous.\"\nTo this opinion I adhere. I am by no means prepared to say that the conclusion arrived at by the learned judges was wrong, still less, \"entirely erroneous;\" on the contrary I cannot see how they could have arrived at any other conclusion.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appellant has been unseated on a personal charge of bribery, and if the judgment against him is maintained on this appeal he will, by the express provision of section 96 of the Dominion Elections Act, be incapable for the next seven years of being elected to and of sitting in the House of Commons and of voting at any election of a member of that House, and of holding any office in the nomination of the Crown or the Governor General in Canada.\nThese serious penal consequences call for the most careful examination and scrutiny of the evidence upon which such a judgment is founded.\nThe charge which the learned judges before whom the petition was tried have found to be established is, as stated in the particulars delivered by the respondent, that of having on or about the 28th day of February, 1891, at the township of Thorold, agreed to procure, and offered and promised to procure, or to endeavour to procure a place or employment for Joseph B. Wood, an elector, in order to induce the said Wood to vote for the appellant at the election.\nThere were two other personal charges relating to the same voter, one of bribery in having given the same Joseph B. Wood ten dollars to induce him to vote for the appellant, and the other a charge of having at the city of Buffalo promised to procure and to endeavour to procure employment for Joseph B. Wood, by reason of his having voted for the appellant. The learned judges have, however confined their judgments exclusively to the first mentioned charge. The judgment of the court, which was delivered by Mr. Justice Rose, concludes in these words:\nWe think we have sufficiently discharged our duty when we express the opinion that we are expressing in regard to this corrupt practice, declaring that the respondent is guilty of a corrupt practice, namely, a promise to the witness Wood to endeavour to procure a situation for him if he would vote for him the respondent, and that that promise was subsequently curried into effect as far as the respondent was able to perform it.\nThe learned judges have therefore refrained from expressing any opinion upon the evidence, as to the alleged bribery by payment of ten dollars, or upon the charge relating to a promise subsequent to the election.\nThe notice of appeal to this court purports to be limited pursuant to the statute to so much of the judgment as grants that portion of the prayer of the petition which relates to the personal charges against the appellant and finds and declares the appellant guilty of a personal corrupt practice at the election, and the appellant announces that he will upon the hearing of the appeal contend that the judgment, so far as it declares the appellant guilty of any corrupt practice personally, should be reversed and set aside.\nThe evidence relating to this charge of a promise to procure or endeavour to procure employment for Wood is, as I have said, confined to the testimony of the two parties to the transaction, Wood and Mr. German himself. The charge was opened by the examination of Mr. German who was called by the respondent's counsel. It will, however, be most convenient first to consider the evidence of Wood and ascertain as precisely as possible the material facts deposed to by him.\nWood speaks of at least four interviews with the appellant in the course of the canvass which preceded the election, the first being at Welland when nothing material is said to have occurred; the next meeting was at Port Robinson, where Wood lived; then a third interview took place at the City Hotel (Hammond's Hotel) at Thorold, where the promise to endeavour to procure a situation for Wood is said to have been made, and later on the parties again met at Port Robinson. Wood's account of what took place at the first Port Robinson interview is as follows. He says he met Mr. German \"on\" the street and Mr. German asked him if he was going to vote for him, to which the witness says he answered he hadn't thought anything of it. Then the witness says (taking the exact words from his deposition):\u2014\nHe (German) pressed me to vote for him, and I finally told him that I had heard there was money in the county and I was poor and hard up, and nothing to do, and if there was any I might vote for him. He asked me how much I wanted and I told him ten dollars; he said he would see I got it. I told him that I would rather have it from him, it was something that I had never done before and I did not want it generally known that I had done that kind of business. He said all right, he would see I got it from himself; he said he would give it to me.\nThe witness says this ended the conversation on that occasion.\nThen the next meeting of the parties was at Hammond's Hotel (the City Hotel) at Thorold, on an evening when a meeting of the appellant's supporters was being held at Thorold. To the question put to him by counsel as to what took place between Mr. German and himself on this last occasion, the witness answers:\nI told him that I had considered the thing over again and if he would give me something to do I would much rather have it than the ten dollars. Why, he says, \"I will do both.\"\nWood says this was all that took place on that occasion. Then on cross-examination the witness speaks further of this Thorold interview. I extract from his deposition the following passage:\nQ. And when you saw Mr. German you told him you were hard up? A. I did.\nQ. And told him that you were anxious to get employment? A. I did.\nQ. And that you would like very much if he could help you to get employment? A. Yes.\nQ. You bad known him before? A. Yes. Q. And when you saw him, you being hard up and wanting employment, asked him if he could not help you to get employment, that is what you say? A. I asked him that at Thorold. I told him. I would rather have employment than money.\nQ. When did you first speak to him about employment? A. At Thorold.\nQ. What date was it? A. I don't know that.\nThe third interview which, according to Wood, was had between the witness and the appellant, took place at Port Robinson subsequent to the meeting at Thorold. Wood says that Mr. German met him early in the evening in the street, that they separated, he (Wood) going directly home. That in a short time after he had got home, within three or four minutes, the appellant came to his house, that the witness himself opened the door for him. That there was no one in the house but the witness and his wife. Then I extract verbatim from the record what follows:\u2014\nQ. What happened? A. Well he came in, I asked him to sit down, he said he would not sit down, he was in a hurry to get back to the meeting. He gave mo the ten dollars he promised me, and told me he says, \"I'll give you the ten dollars now; you vote forme and after the election I will get you the situation.\"\nQ. Is there any doubt that that took place? A. Not the slightest.\nThe personal history of Wood and his conduct in relation to this election as given by himself are not irrelevant in considering the weight to be given to his evidence, and so far as I am able to give an opinion as to the credibility of a witness I did not see examined and whose demeanour in the witness box I had no opportunity of observing, I should say the account he gives of himself, his admitted offer to sell his vote, and the way he has acted since the election with reference to his evidence, all tend to discredit him, and that for these reasons his testimony does not commend itself to favourable consideration except in so far as it is supported by other circumstances or by the admissions of the appellant. Wood says that after having been in business as a butcher at Welland in partnership with his brother and having failed there he went to live at the International Bridge, which place he admits he left in order to avoid his creditors, and then went to Wisconsin, and after remaining there for some time he went to Buffalo, then returned to Welland and again moved to Port Robinson where he was living at the time of the election being engaged in selling fruit trees and being in poor circumstances. Then after the election, and after he had communicated the facts he swears to in his examination to Mr. Raymond, the solicitor of the present respondent, thus betraying Mr. German, the candidate he had, as he admits, taken a bribe to support, he obtained through Mr. Raymond a situation in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's service at Montreal, which employment came to an end a short time before the trial of the petition. He further states that Mr. Raymond took from him a statutory declaration embodying the statements which he reiterated in his evidence. Having been the sort of person he describes himself to have been, and having given his evidence in vinculis as it were, his conscience bound by the statutory declaration most improperly taken from him by the petitioner's solicitor[3], and having been induced to remain in the country and rewarded for making, the statutory declaration mentioned, by the situation obtained for him by or through the solicitor, coupled with his admitted readiness to be corrupted, implied in the statement that the proposal for the bribe which he swears he took, as well as for the offer about procuring employment came not from the appellant but from himself, I should not under all these circumstances, had there been no confirmatory evidence, have been inclined to attach weight to his testimony if I were driven to express an opinion as to it.\nIt is usual for judges presiding at criminal trials to recommend jurors not to convict upon the evidence of an accomplice, unless confirmed in respect of some material fact; this is done not by way of a direction in law or as a ruling on evidence, but is a simple recommendation to the jury which the judge is not bound to give, it being intended merely as an indication of what the judge would consider it safe and proper to do, if he himself were dealing with the facts. No law or practice requires a court to adopt such a rule in weighing evidence on the trial of an election petition, but had I to deal with the evidence we have before us on this appeal without being able to find in the appellant's own deposition any admissions confirmatory of the statements of Wood, I should adopt and act on the usage I have referred to, not as a rule binding on me, but as a safe and convenient principle to guide me to a conclusion.\nIf the learned trial judges had stated in their judgment which of the conflicting statements of the opposing witnesses they gave credit to that would have been, as has frequently been held here, conclusive and we should then have had nothing to do with the credibility of witnesses. They have, however, expressly disclaimed doing this as appears from the following passage from the judgment. They say:\nWe are glad to be relieved from further consideration of the evidence, and we have not so considered it as to come to a final and definite conclusion as to the credibility of the witnesses.\nThe learned judges reached the conclusion they arrived at upon another principle and upon evidence yet to be mentioned.\nIf, therefore, there had been a clear, direct and explicit denial by the appellant of the facts deposed to by Wood and had there been no circumstances in the case confirmatory of his statement, no admissions by the appellant and nothing warranting presumptions against him, I should then in the absence of any finding by the trial judges as to the credibility of witnesses have found it impossible to decide adversely to the appellant.\nThen I proceed to consider the appellant's own evidence. As regards what Wood swears to as having occurred at the two Port Robinson meetings, Mr. German does give a positive and explicit denial to Wood's statements which are in no way confirmed by admitted facts, or by presumptions therefrom, and the question so far as it depends on what passed on those occasions is, therefore, reduced entirely to one of the credit to be attached to one witness rather than the other. It was probably for this reason that the learned judges who, as I have pointed out, abstained from expressing any opinion as to the veracity of the witnesses did not pass upon the charge as to the bribe by paying the $10.\nThe case is reduced then to the consideration of the promise or offer to procure or to endeavour to procure employment, alleged by Wood to have been made at Thorold, and to which the decision of the trial court has been entirely restricted. It now becomes necessary to examine the evidence given by Mr. German himself as to this charge of having promised to endeavour to procure employment for Wood. What the appellant says on this head is contained in the following extracts from his evidence:\nQ. Then, when you saw him down at Thorold, did you have any conversation with him? A. Yes, shortly.\nQ. Who were present on that occasion? A. There were several in the bar, but I do not think there was any person near enough to hear any conversation we had. Q. What was the conversation? A. Well, I think that he spoke to me; I think it was on that occasion that he called me to one side and he said, don't you know some one in Buffalo that you can introduce me to, who will help to get me a situation over there; he says, I want to get out of this country; I am in debt, and they are bothering me, and I want to get away. I told him I thought I did, and that was all.\nQ. That was the whole of that conversation? A. Yes, practically all; I was in a hurry, and Mr. Cowper was waiting for me and some friends in the other room.\nMr. Blackstock\u2014Q. On the occasion that you refer to? A. I believe that was the time that he spoke to me about this situation.\nQ. That is all the conversation so far as you recollect? A. That is all; there might have been some further words said, but I don't think there was.\nQ. On that occasion did he tell you he would rather have a situation than ten dollars you had promised him, or indeed one hundred dollars? A. No.\nQ. Did he say that he would rather have a situation than one hundred dollars? A. No.\nQ. Did you in reply to that say to him that you would do both for him, give him the ten dollars and get the situation? A. No.\nQ. You did say that you would endeavour to get him the situation? A. No, he asked me if I knew any people in Buffalo that could get him a situation. I told him I thought I did, and that was all that was said. He may have asked me when I would be going to Buffalo, and I told him I did not know, but not until after the elections any way, that might have been said.\nQ. Did he speak to you about getting a situation, and did you intimate that you would assist him in that respect? A. There was just that of it; he asked me if I knew any people in Buffalo that could assist him.\nQ. Do you intend to represent that you did not intimate to him that you would assist him? A. There was the intimation of course.\nSubsequently, Mr. German being examined by his own counsel having been recalled as a witness on his own behalf, gives this further evidence as to the Thorold conversation:\u2014\nQ. The fourth charge is, \"on or about the 28th day of February, 1891, at the said township of Thorold, the said respondent agreed to procure and offered and promised to procure, or to endeavour to procure a place or employment for the said Joseph B. Wood, in order to induce the said Wood to vote for the said respondent at the said election.\" Is that true? A. No, it is not. I told him I would introduce him to some people.\nNow, upon the evidence obtained from the appellant himself, I regret to be obliged to say that I must hold the fourth charge proved.\nThe statutory provision applying to this charge is that contained in section 84, subsec. (b) of the Dominion Elections Act, which reads as follows:\nThe following persons are guilty of bribery and are punishable accordingly: Every person who, directly or indirectly by himself or any other person on his behalf, gives or procures or agrees to give or procure or offers or promises any office, place, or employment, or promises to procure or to endeavour to procure any office, place, or employment to or for any voter, or to or for any other person in order to induce such voter to vote or refrain from voting, or corruptly does any such act as aforesaid on account of any voter having voted or refrained from voting at any election.\nThe cardinal questions to be decided here, are then, (taking out the words of the clause which apply to the case before us): 1st. Whether Mr. German did offer or promise to procure employment for the voter Wood? 2nd. Whether such promise was made to induce Wood to vote?\nNow, to turn again to Mr. German's evidence, we find him saying (to take his own words already quoted from the record) that Wood asked him if he knew any people at Buffalo that could assist him in getting a situation, and that he did in reply \"intimate\" to him that he would assist him, he says: \"There was the intimation of course.\"\nThen what does this mean but that Wood having asked Mr. German to assist him in getting a situation at Buffalo, Mr. German said to him that he would assist him in doing so. And saying that he would in the future assist him is nothing else than promising to assist. Of course the word \"promise\" need not be actually used. If a candidate says to a voter \"I will do my best in trying to get you a situation,\" that surely is a promise of an endeavour to procure employment, and what difference is there between a promise to try and get a situation and a promise to help or assist the voter in getting one? Both forms of expression mean that the party promising will endeavour to get the employment wanted and amount to nothing less than a promise not to get, but in the words of the statute, to endeavour to get employment.\nIt is not enough, however, that such a promise was made\u2014it must have been made corruptly; that is to induce the person to whom it is made to vote. Now the corrupt intent, that is the intent to induce the voter to vote, will not be implied though such an offer or promise be made to an elector in the very heat of a canvass if it can be ascribed to any lawful motive. In the case, for instance, where relations of kinship, of business, or long or close friendship exist between the parties, which afford reasonable ground for supposing that the candidate would be willing to aid the voter in the way promised, irrespective altogether of the election, the offer or promise will not be readily ascribed to a corrupt motive. But in the present case it may be asked what possible suggestion can there be, upon the evidence before us, of any motive which could have induced the appellant to promise Wood that he would endeavour to get him employment at Buffalo save the election? It is impossible that any such motive can be suggested. The only connection which, so far as we can see from the proofs in the record, had ever existed between Mr. German and Wood was, that some time before the election, some years, I should think, Mr. German had acted professionally as solicitor for the firm of butchers at Welland to which Wood then belonged, about some chattel mortgages. Under these circumstances and in the absence of proof to the contrary, it is impossible to say that the object of Mr. German (who admits he had previously, at Port Robinson, canvassed Wood for his vote) in making the promise or intimation to Wood, was any other than one in connection with the election; and if so, it could only have been with the intent of inducing him to vote. Then as to the evidence of Mr. German when recalled by his own counsel and asked whether the 4th charge (which was read to him) was true\u2014all that need be said is that it actually confirms his former evidence. Mr. German says: \"I told him that I would introduce him to some people.\" What is that but saying over again that he promised to endeavour to get him employment. Of course the answer implies that he was to introduce Wood to people with a view to getting him a situation, as in fact the appellant afterwards did.\nI have not overlooked the Cheltenham Case[4] in which Baron Martin is said to have held that a mere offer of employment not accepted or carried out would not amount to bribery. But I am of opinion that in view of the express words of the statute which I have already read such a decision cannot be followed. Moreover, in the Waterford Case[5] Hughes B. acted on the very opposite view of the law.\nFurther, in the present case, it does not rest on a mere offer or promise, for the appellant did carry out his promise by going to Buffalo with Wood and endeavouring through Beuhl to get him employment. And this it may also be said must be presumed to have been done in pursuance of the \"intimation\" which Mr. German says he gave to Wood that he would comply with his request to assist him, and shows not by words but by acts and conduct, that what was meant by that assent was nothing less than a promise to endeavour to procure employment.\nIn Cunningham's Treatise on Corrupt Practices at Elections[6] the law will be found laid down as I have stated it, and the, Chetlenham Case is distinctly denied to be law.\nThen there are additional reasons why presumptions are to be made against the appellant. He admits having written a letter to Wood and then having written another letter telling him to destroy both that and the first letter. This direction Wood says he acted upon and burnt both letters. Wood says these letters had reference to the election and to the promises Mr. German had made him. It is true he afterwards says he does not remember the contents of the letters, but by this he was evidently not understood by the learned judges as retracting his former evidence that the letters had reference to the election, but as merely intending to say he did not remember the exact terms of them. Mr. German when first examined by the petitioner's counsel says he does not recollect writing these or any letters to Wood, but if he did write, telling him to destroy letters\u2014it was because he had been warned by friends not to put dependence on Wood. Later on when Mr. German is examined by his own counsel he says he did write Wood a letter and then a subsequent letter telling him to destroy both. But he does not say when this occurred, nor does he deny that it was during the canvass or after the election, and he says that these letters were \"without any reference to the election at all,\" that he has been trying to remember what it was about; that it was something regarding some private business which he had quite forgotten.\nI agree with the learned judges of the trial court that this is an unsatisfactory way of accounting for these letters. Mr. German had, when he had not heard Wood's evidence that the letters had been destroyed, and when for all he knew the letters might be produced to contradict him, admitted that if he had written to Wood it was about the election I think the court below was right in not accepting this as a sufficient explanation regarding the contents of these letters to do away with that presumption which is always made against one who destroys relevant documents, viz., that their production would have been unfavourable to him.\nI do not, however, as the learned judges have done, rest my judgment exclusively on the presumption arising from the destruction of these letters, though I agree in their view also. For the reasons stated I can come to no other conclusion than that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree that this appeal; should be dismissed. It is a frivolous appeal. There was nothing, to justify it. Audaces fortuna juvat should not be relied upon in courts of justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concur that the appeal must be dismissed. I cannot find any ground which would justify the reversal of the learned judges who tried the election petition.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014We had the advantage of an earnest and able presentation by Mr. Cassels of the grounds on which it is contended that the judgment of the two learned judges who tried the petition should be reversed, and I have carefully examined the report of the evidence.\nIt would, as has frequently been remarked, require a very plain demonstration of error on the part of the judges who saw and heard the witnesses to justify an appellate court in differing from them upon their findings of fact. I must say, however, that looking at the reported evidence without the leaning which is natural enough in an advocate, particularly when there seems to be some hardship in his client's case, my apprehension of it does not lead me to doubt the correctness of the findings.\nThe learned judges did not discredit Wood, the principal witness. It was strongly urged that they ought to have done so, and that we ought to treat his evidence as unworthy of credence because he had, some time before the trial, made a declaration at the instance of the solicitor for the petitioner, who had said that if he would do so he would get him employment to keep him in the country until the trial, employment being accordingly obtained in Montreal from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, from which the witness was discharged a week or so before the trial. The practice of committing a witness to a certain statement of facts has occasionally been rebuked with severity and with justice, and there may be reasons found for regarding such evidence with caution and sometimes with suspicion. That is one of the things that are best dealt with by the tribunal of first instance. It is one of the complaints now made that the judges did not treat what was done with severity and, notwithstanding all that was done, believed the witness. They were the best judges in the matter. They knew, better than we can be expected to do, whether the witness ought to be regarded as a purchased witness, as we have been asked to regard him, merely because on his consenting to stay in the country till the trial employment was found for him by which he could support himself; or whether the circumstances of his having made the declaration of facts, which does not appear to have been put in the shape of an affidavit, or to have been anything beyond a statement in writing, affected the value of his sworn testimony.\nThe issue was whether the appellant had in order to influence Wood's vote offered or promised to endeavour to procure him employment, and whether after the election he had, corruptly and on account of Wood having voted, made the endeavour. The promise is charged in the particulars as having been made in the township of Thorold on or about the 28th of February.\nThere is ample and direct evidence of such a promise made in the town of Thorold, which is in the township of that name, and I am unable to say that the evidence of the appellant himself, as reported, is so directly opposed to that of Wood as to amount to anything like a satisfactory contradiction of it. The subsequent attempt to procure the employment is not in dispute. Both parties agree as to it, though its character depends of course on the previous promise.\nThe date of the promise seems, however, to have been the 17th and not the 28th of February. On the 28th something else, which was the subject of evidence, took place in Port Robinson which is also in the township of Thorold.\nThat other matter is charged in article 3 of the particulars, and the same date is assigned in article 4 to the promise which seems to have been referable to the 17th. I see no reason to suppose that the appellant was prejudiced or misled by the inaccuracy of the date, or that he could have given a fuller explanation of what took place on the 17th, if that date had been stated on the record. It is from the appellant that we learn that the date was the 17th. The witness Wood does not seem to have been able to fix any day in February, though in other particulars, such as the hotel in Thorold where he saw the appellant, the two substantially agree.\nI need not refer to the evidence in more detail. I make this general reference to it for the purpose of showing that it is capable of leading, and as I think leads directly enough, to the conclusion arrived at by the trial judges\nI do not think we can avoid dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Moss, Hoyles & Aylesworth.\nSolicitors for respondent: Meredith, Clarke, Bowes & Hilton.\n[1] 2 Can.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Specific performance\u2014Deed of land\u2014Undisclosed trust\u2014Enforcement\u2014Statute of Frauds.\nThe property of M. having been advertised for sale under power in a mortgage his wife arranged with the mortgagee to redeem it by making a cash payment and giving another mortgage for the balance. To enable her to pay the amount B. agreed to lend it for a year taking an absolute deed of the property as security and holding it in trust for that time. A contract was drawn up by the mortgagee\u2019s solicitor for a purchase by B. of the property at the agreed price which B. signed, and he told the solicitor that he would advise him by telephone whether the deed would be taken in his own name or his daughter\u2019s. The next day a telephone message came from B.\u2019s house to the solicitor instructing him to make the deed in the name of B.\u2019s daughter, which was done, and the deed was executed by M. and his wife and the arrangement with the mortgagee carried out. Subsequently B.\u2019s daughter claimed that she had purchased the property absolutely, and for her own benefit, and an action was brought by M.\u2019s wife against her and B. to have the daughter declared a trustee of the property subject to repayment of the loan from B. and for specific performance of the agreement. The plaintiff in the action charged collusion and conspiracy on the part of the defendants to deprive her of the property, and in addition to denying said charge defendants pleaded the Statute of Frauds.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Strong J. dissenting, that the evidence proved that his daughter was aware of the agreement made with B., and the deed having been executed in pursuance of such agreement she must be held to have taken the property in trust as B. would have been if the deed had been taken in his name, and the Statute of Frauds did not prevent parol evidence being given of the agreement with the plaintiff.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe circumstances which gave rise to this action were found by the trial judge as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff\u2019s husband, John McMillan, owned certain property which was mortgaged, and default having been made in payment the same was advertised for sale under a power of sale in the mortgage. Some months before the auction at which the lands were offered the husband, the mortgagor, had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. The plaintiff conceived the idea of buying the property for herself and attended the sale, but did not make a bid; the property was not sold. On the following day she went with her husband to the office of the vendor\u2019s solicitor, and after some conversation made an offer in writing to pay $3,325 for it, $325 to be paid in cash and the balance to be secured by a mortgage on the property. On the following day she authorized her husband to increase that offer by $25, making the offer $3,350. This offer was verbally accepted, the plaintiff agreeing also to pay all taxes due on the property. The intention of the plaintiff and her husband was to take a sum of money which was due on a contract entered into between her and one Wilson, and which contract was being performed by the husband as a builder, he not being able to make a contract in his own name by reason of his insolvency; but this money was not forthcoming, and caused some embarrassment as the wherewithal to pay the first instalment was not just then obtainable. The husband, however, in the course of a few days after that met George Barton, to whom he told the strait the plaintiff was in; in fact he said his wife was not able to carry out the sale because of the disappointment in getting the Wilson money. The defendant, George Barton, at once volunteered and made the offer: \u201cI will not see your wife stuck in that way. I will advance money for her myself, and give her a year to pay me back, at 7 per cent. if she will give me security.\u201d The husband said, \u201cShe will give you security on the Gordon Street lots (which she held as her own separate property) or you can hold the property purchased in trust for a year, and she will pay you 7 per cent and all expenses of the conveyance to her at the end of that time.\u201d This latter was agreed to, and the defendant George Barton then agreed to enter into an agreement to that effect with the plaintiff; and it was also agreed that defendant George Barton should accompany the plaintiff\u2019s husband on the day after to the vendor\u2019s solicitor and complete the purchase, after which the agreement with the plaintiff was to be executed. The husband reported this offer of George Barton to the plaintiff, and she acquiesced, and her husband then went alone, at her request, to the office of the vendor\u2019s solicitors and informed them that the defendant George Barton had agreed to buy the place for his wife on the terms agreed upon between the plaintiff and the said solicitors. They acquiesced, and the husband having left the office met the defendant George Barton and then took him to the office and introduced him to the solicitor as being the party who had agreed to purchase for the plaintiff. The conditions of sale were then read over and the question of the taxes due on the property was spoken of, and the vendor told him they must be paid by the purchaser, and the plaintiff\u2019s husband then agreed on behalf of the plaintiff that she should pay them, and the only money to be advanced by George Barton would be the $350. This being settled a contract was drawn up by the solicitors and signed by the defendant George Barton in presence of the husband. The defendant George Barton said he did not know whether he would take the deed in his own or his daughter\u2019s name, but he would advise him by telephone. On the following day a message came to draw the deed in the name of the other defendant, Fanny Barton, who is the defendant George Barton\u2019s daughter, and the deed was so drawn, and she gave back a mortgage to secure $3,200 and paid the $350 by cheque. The defendant Fanny Barton now claims that she purchased for herself and the plaintiff charges that the defendants George Barton and Fanny Barton entered into a fraudulent conspiracy to deprive the plaintiff of the bargain she had made for the purchase of the property and in violation of the verbal agreement entered into between her, the plaintiff, and the defendant George Barton.\nThe plaintiff accordingly brought an action to have the defendant Fanny Barton declared a trustee for her of the said property subject to payment of the amount due on the loan by said George Barton, and for specific performance of the alleged agreement between her and George Barton The defendants, in addition to denying the said agreement, pleaded that it was void under the Statute of Frauds for not being in writing, and that it was also void as being made in fraud of the creditors of the said John McMillan. The trial judge made the decree prayed for by the plaintiff and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The defendants appealed to this court.\nMoss Q.C. for the appellants cited James v. Smith[1]; Nobel\u2019s Explosives Co. v. Jones, Scott & Co.[2] Bain Q.C. for the respondents referred to Chattock v. Muller[3]; Kitchen v. Dolan[4]; Rose v. Hickey[5].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014My opinion is entirely in accord with the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal and Mr. Justice Maclennan, and I therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In my opinion the evidence did not warrant the conclusions of Mr. Justice Robertson and consequently the order of the Court of Appeal affirming his judgment ought to be reversed.\nThere never was any contract with the respondent or with Barton binding on Mr. Horsford, the mortgagee, to sell the property to either. The Statute of Frauds is pleaded and the defendant is entitled to avail herself of the defence afforded by it.\nMrs. McMillan\u2019s offer as signed by her was to purchase for $3,225, a price which was not accepted.\nThe offer signed by George Barton written at the foot of a copy of the printed conditions of sale was never signed by Mr. Horsford nor by any one duly authorized on his behalf; it never, therefore, ripened into a contract capable of being enforced against Horsford, although, no doubt, a mere parol acceptance by him would have made it a valid and binding contract within the Statute of Frauds as against Barton, and susceptible of being enforced against him. The law is clearly settled that where an offer to purchase, specifying all the terms required to make a contract of sale, is signed by the proposed purchaser a parol acceptance of that offer by the proposed vendor is sufficient to convert it into a contract binding on the party signing. Warner v. Willington[6]. But on the other hand such an offer thus\u2019 accepted by parol does not become binding on the vendor, who may notwithstanding his acceptance repudiate it and, set up the Statute of Frauds and the want of signing as a defence to an action brought to enforce the sale. It was long ago determined that the want of mutuality did not prevent a party to a contract of sale, who had not signed a memorandum such as the Statute of Frauds requires, from setting up the statute against the other party even though the latter had signed and would have been bound by the contract. Mr. Justice Maclennan suggests that inasmuch as the mortgagee\u2019s solicitor deposes that he referred by letter to his client, who lived at Port Hope, to inquire whether he would permit $3,200 instead of $3,000 to remain on mortgage, and inasmuch as Mr. Horsford authorized him to do this, the latter must be taken to have given a written assent to the contract. But there are several answers to this. In the first place the correspondence is not in evidence, and we cannot surmise that there was an assent to a proposal which, for all that appears, Mr. Horsford may never have had communicated to him. It is quite consistent with the evidence of Mr. Milligan, the solicitor, that the authority to take a mortgage for $3,200 may have been general and without reference to any particular offer or purchaser. Next, it could not apply to the contract signed by Mrs. McMillan for this was an offer to purchase for $3,325 only which was rejected by the solicitors, the price required by them being $3,550 which was never offered in writing by Mrs. McMillan. Then the assent of Mr. Horsford referred to by Mr. Justice Maclennan could not refer to the memorandum of offer signed by George Barton, for this was not signed until after Mr. Horsford\u2019s assent to take the mortgage for $3,200 had been communicated to his solicitors. It is therefore out of the question to say that on the 21st of November, 1888, the date of Miss Barton\u2019s purchase, Mr. Horsford the mortgagee was in any way bound to sell to Mrs. McMillan or to George Barton for her benefit; on the contrary, Mr. Horsford was, as Mr. Milligan quite correctly told Miss Barton, perfectly free to exercise his power of sale in favour of any one except himself or his solicitors. The reason for making these observations is this: If Horsford had become bound by reason of having, by a writing duly signed and so binding on him under the statute, accepted Mr. Barton\u2019s offer he would not have been free to sell to Miss Barton, and the latter, if she had taken the conveyance of the legal estate with notice of such a prior contract, would have been bound by it as much as Horsford himself. There is, however, no pretense for any such assumption. As far as Horsford was concerned he had a perfect right to sell to any one he chose,\u2019 provided he complied with the terms of his power of sale.\nThe only question then is, whether Miss Barton was free to purchase as she did for her own benefit; and differing very widely indeed in the view I take of both the law and the facts from the learned trial judge, as well as from the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Maclennan, I must answer this in the affirmative.\nI do not regard Bartlett v. Pickersgill[7] as having been overruled by Heard v. Pilley[8] or any of the late cases which have been referred to. It had always, until it met with some judicial criticism from Selwyn and Giffard L.JJ. in Heard v. Pilley8, been regarded as an authoritative decision, and what was said as to it in Heard v. Pilley8 may well be regarded as obiter dicta, inasmuch as it was clear in that case that parol evidence was admissible upon a distinct ground. As has been pointed out by Kekewich J. in the late case of James v. Smith[9], the case of Heard v. Pilley8 was a suit for specific performance instituted by a party, who had authorized another to purchase as his, agent, against the vendor and the agent (who had taken the contract in his own name) to compel the execution of the contract of sale. No conveyance had been executed and the contract still remaining executory what the plaintiff sought to prove was not a trust but agency, and there is nothing in the Statute of Frauds forbidding the admission of parol evidence to establish such a relationship. The actual decision in Heard v. Pilley8 is therefore really not at variance with Bartlett v. Pickersgill[10], and as the latter case has always been recognized as good law by such distinguished text writers as Lord St. Leonards[11] and Mr. Dart[12], and has moreover, so recently as 1890, received the judicial approval of Mr. Justice Kekewich[13] who, had the statute been properly pleaded, would have acted on this view in the case cited, I cannot regard it as an overruled case. See also Lewin on Trusts[14]. The cases of Lees v. Nuttall[15], Cave v. Mackenzie[16], and Chattock v. Muller[17], are all susceptible of the same explanation; they were all cases of agency. Then if Bartlett v. Pickersgill10 is to be taken as good law parol evidence would not have been admissible even against George Barton himself, if he had purchased, paid his own money, and given a mortgage in this own name. And if this is so it follows that the defence of the Statute of Frauds must be equally available to Miss Barton, by whom it has been duly pleaded and in whose behalf the objection to the admissibility of parol evidence was expressly taken in limine at the trial. Upon this ground alone I should be prepared to allow the appeal.\nAs regards the cases of Haigh v. Kaye[18], Booth v. Turle[19], Davies v. Otty (No. 2)[20], and Lincoln v. Wrigh[21], no one who has been familiar with these cases and their application in practice by courts of equity can fail to apprehend the distinction between them and such cases as James v. Smith[22] and that now under consideration[23]. In all the cases just cited an absolute conveyance had been made by the party asserting the trust upon a parol trust which was established not merely upon the parol testimony of witnesses, but by reason of the additional circumstance that the grantor had retained possession of the property conveyed, which possession being inconsistent with the deed was not susceptible of being referred to any other title than the trust. Under these circumstances it was held, upon a principle analogous to that on which courts of equity act in decreeing relief, on the ground of part performance in the cases of contracts by parol, that it would be to sanction a fraud upon the grantor and to make the statute the instrument for effecting that fraud to permit the trustee to set up an absolute title in himself with which the possession and enjoyment of the grantor would be inconsistent. In such cases the trust is not established merely on parol testimony but on the surrounding facts of the case, which are not excluded by the statute and which courts of equity hold are sufficient to let in the parol evidence. This class of cases can, however, manifestly have no application when the sale is, as here, under the paramount title of a mortgagee who has never been in possession, the possession being all along retained by the mortgagor. There is here, therefore, nothing inconsistent with the deed raising the presumption of a trust.\nIf, then, parol evidence is admitted in such a case to show a trust it would be, as Lord St. Leonards says, \u201cdirectly in the teeth of the Statute of Frauds\u201d[24].\nThere is, however, the further defence upon the facts. The evidence entirely fails to establish that the purchase by Miss Barton was made collusively with her father, with his money, or in any way for his benefit. On the contrary it appears very conclusively that Mr. Barton having mentioned to his daughter the fact that the property was for sale, and that he had agreed to purchase it for Mrs. McMillan and applied to her to advance the cash to enable him to do so, she refused to make the loan and at once resolved and declared her intention to purchase it for herself, and very promptly went to the office of the mortgagee\u2019s solicitors and there made the arrangement, going again the next day and paying the cash portion of the price. No fact could be more clearly established in evidence than that the money was the appellant\u2019s own. She points out the sources from which it was derived and the production of her bank account corroborates her statements in this respect. That Miss Barton did not avail herself of any contract entered into by the mortgagor with her father or Mrs. McMillan is sufficiently apparent from what has before been pointed out, viz., that there was no such contract binding on the mortgagee, and so far from assuming to claim the benefit of the offer, a proposal short of contract, before made with the solicitors she expressly asked Mr. Milligan if the mortgagee was free to sell to her, and announced to him that she was buying for her own account. Had Miss Barton represented to the solicitors of the mortgagee or led them to believe that she was carrying out the proposal made by her father the case might, have been different, though even then I should have thought there would have been legal difficulties in the plaintiff\u2019s way; so far from doing this, I repeat, she took pains to impress upon them that she was buying for herself. It is true that Mr. Milligan said in answer to a question put to him by the learned judge\u2014a question I may say, which if it had been put by counsel and objected to, it would have been the learned judge\u2019s duty to have overruled\u2014that he understood \u201cthey were carrying out the contract which George Barton had signed;\u201d but this is not evidence but the mere conclusion of the witness, entirely unwarranted by anything which Miss Barton is proved to have either said or done.\nThen what is there remaining to warrant the inferences of fraud and conspiracy which have been imputed to the appellants? Nothing but the relationship of father and daughter which exists between them. Had Mr. Barton told a person in no way related to him that he proposed to buy the property for the respondent surely that person would not have been incapacitated from making a purchase for his own benefit, nor, if he had done so, could it, in the absence of evidence, have been reasonably imputed to him that he was acting in collusion with Barton. Then upon what principle should any difference be made between the present case of a purchase by his daughter and that just supposed? The appellant, Miss Barton, is not a child nor an inexperienced girl, but a young woman of twenty-four years, who, as Mr. Justice Burton in his judgment has remarked, indicated by her evidence the possession of considerable ability, who, as she states, had had experience in dealings in real estate previous to this purchase, and who was moreover possessed of means, satisfactorily proved to have been her own, amply sufficient to justify her in engaging in the purchase. Had the appellant been dependent on her father and without resources of her own, or had she been a young person of immature years, we might have gone far in making the presumption that she was interposed for the purpose of cloaking a purchase for her father\u2019s benefit, by whom in that case the money would presumably have been supplied; but as the case is presented to us on the evidence no such inference is admissible, and I am unable to find any reason why the case of Miss Barton should be distinguished from that of a mere stranger to whom her father had made the same communication of the facts and the same application for an advance of money which he had made to her. It is out of the question to say, as Mr. Justice Robertson does, that Miss Barton\u2019s father ought to have controlled her. We are dealing with legal rights and obligations, and with nothing else, and the plain answer to the learned judge\u2019s observation on this head is that she was in no way subject to the legal control or tutelage of her father; that she was as regards both legal age and actual capacity quite competent to act for herself; and so far from there being any proof that what she did was done under her father\u2019s influence, or with a view to his advantage, such presumptions are most effectually rebutted. Unless, therefore, it is to be held as a matter of legal presumption that a young woman of twenty-four, possessed of evident business ability and experience, could not act in a matter of this kind independently of her father merely because she was resident in his house, the respondent\u2019s case must fail. So to, extend the disqualification of the father, to make the purchase for his own benefit, to the daughter, as a matter of legal disability, could have no sanction either in law or reason. Some stress was laid upon Miss Barton having said that she understood from her father that McMillan was to pay the taxes as indicating that she had adopted his proposal and was merely carrying it out on his behalf. She gives in her evidence an explanation of this which is reasonable and satisfactory. She says she expected McMillan to pay the taxes as he had been in possession. No doubt this was legally correct. McMillan must have been assessed for the taxes and was the person primarily liable to pay them, and the only person to whom any personal liability in respect of them attached, although, of course, the taxes were also a charge upon the property itself. I see nothing in this observation to indicate that the purchase was for the benefit of George Barton, or otherwise than as it was expressly declared to be, an independent purchase by Miss Barton with her own money and for her own exclusive benefit. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J\u2014Notwithstanding some contradiction between the evidence of John McMillan, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, and the defendant George Barton it sufficiently appears, I think, from Barton\u2019s own evidence, that he signed the agreement which he did sign for the purchase of the property in question at the instance of John McMillan, but for and on behalf of the plaintiff, for the purpose of giving effect to an offer which had been made by her to, and accepted by, the vendor through his solicitor, and upon an agreement that he should hold the property only as security for repayment by the plaintiff of the purchase money mentioned in the contract of purchase as being given in cash, together with interest thereon, to be repaid within a year, and that it was part of the arrangement made with him that although by the contract of purchase he was to buy subject to the back taxes these taxes should be paid by McMillan. When Barton signed the contract of purchase he gave to the vendor\u2019s solicitors his own name and that of his wife in case the papers should be made out in his own name and also the name of his daughter Fanny M.E. Barton saying that perhaps the papers should be made in his daughter\u2019s name, and that he would telephone from his house whether they should be made out in his own name or in that of his daughter; of the above facts there is, I think, no doubt. Now on the same afternoon a telephone message was delivered to the vendor\u2019s solicitors from a son of George Barton\u2019s from George Barton\u2019s house, saying that the property was to go in Miss Barton\u2019s name, and I am of opinion that although the defendant Fanny Barton seems to have entertained the design of acquiring the property absolutely to her own use in despite of her father\u2019s contract of purchase, of which she was quite aware, she in point of fact procured the deed to be executed upon the faith of her father\u2019s contract, and that it was executed to her with the intention upon the part of the vendor\u2019s solicitors of giving effect to the father\u2019s contract. She stated to the vendor\u2019s solicitor that she knew she was purchasing subject to the back taxes, but added that McMillan had agreed to pay them, thus showing that she was perfectly aware of the agreement between her father and McMillan in relation to these taxes and that she was taking the benefit of that agreement. It is apparent that the learned trial judge did not believe the evi- dence of the defendant Fanny M. Barton when she represented herself as being a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser of the property wholly independently of her father\u2019s contract, of the terms of which she was quite aware, and was as I have observed taking advantage of as to the back taxes, and I cannot say that the conclusion so arrived at by the learned trial judge was incorrect. I am satisfied upon the evidence that notwithstanding the skill exhibited by the young lady in endeavouring to support the purchase as one made bon\u00e2 fide in her own interest as an independent purchase, the deed under which she claims was in truth and in fact executed to her for the sole purpose of giving effect to her father\u2019s contract of purchase, and that she must abide the consequences and hold the property as her father must have held it if the deed had been taken in his name, subject to the terms of redemption upon the faith of which he entered into the contract of purchase for and in behalf of the plaintiff. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014In my opinion this judgment ought to be affirmed on the grounds fully stated and discussed by Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal.\nThe fact seems to me to be manifest, from the evidence taken as a whole, that the conveyance to Fanny Barton carried out, and was made by the vendor for the purpose of carrying out, the arrangement specified in the offer made in writing by George Barton on behalf of the plaintiff, but being really the arrangement made by the plaintiff herself with some intervention by her husband.\nThe objection so much relied on, that that agreement could not have been enforced against the vendor for want of a writing signed by him to satisfy the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds is beside the question, as has been clearly demonstrated by Mr. Justice Maclennan, and I think that the principles enunciated by James L.J. in the case of Haigh v. Kaye[25], with respect to the operation of the 7th section of the statute, fully sustain the propriety of treating the appellant Fanny Barton as a trustee for the respondent, notwithstanding the absence of any written declaration of the trust, and without impediment from the suggestion that the transaction was put in the name of Mrs. McMillan, and not in that of her husband, in order to avoid interference by the creditors of the latter.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Morphy & Millar.\nSolicitors for respondent: Greene & Greene.\n[1] [1891] 1 Ch. 384.\n[2] 17 Ch.

The Liquor License Act, 1883, section 6.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the claimants' claim for $1,578.76.\nThe action was brought by the appellants to recover the sum of $1,578.76 which they alleged was due to them from the Government of Canada; the claim therefor arose under the following circumstances:\u2014\nUnder the Liquor License Act, 1883, of Canada, the appellants were appointed the Board of Commissioners for the license district of the city of Quebec, and they continued in that office and capacity from the 19th day of February, 1884, until the 23rd day of December, 1885, at which time, the act having shortly before that date been declared ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the appellants ceased to act as commissioners.\nBy the 6th section of the act it is provided that \"A chief inspector of licenses, and one or more inspectors, shall be appointed by the Board of License Commissioners from time to time for each district, as the board may see fit, and each license inspector shall, before entering upon his duties, give such security as the board may require for the due performance of his duties, and for the payment over of all sums of money received by him under the provisions of this act; and the salary of the inspectors shall be fixed by the board, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council.\" Under this section the appellants appointed a chief inspector at a salary of $1,200 and two assistant inspectors at $1400 each, per annum, and those inspectors were paid at these rates up to the time when the commissioners ceased to hold office.\nThe said salaries which the appellants so fixed for the inspectors were not at the time they were determined upon approved of by the Governor in Council, nor did the appellants at any time submit the salaries to the Governor in Council for approval, but the appellants commenced and continued to pay the inspectors their salaries at the said rate until the month of September, 1885, when they were notified that an order in council had been passed on the 5th September fixing the rates at which inspectors were entitled to be paid, which was lower than the salaries which the appellants had been paying the said inspectors.\nAll the moneys which the appellants had received in the administration of the Liquor License Act during their tenure of office was paid into the license fund and amounted to the sum of $4,480, and it was out of this fund, under subsection 2 of section 56 of the act, that the salaries and expenses of the commissioners and inspectors and other expenses were to be paid, and it appears that the appellants had as a matter of fact paid to the inspectors for their salaries the sum of $3,431.42 which was the amount due them at the rates which the appellants had fixed for them.\nThe amount of license fund was not sufficient to cover all the claims on that fund for salaries and expenses under the requirements of the, order in council.\nWhen the operations under the act came to be wound up, the Government of Canada appropriated a sum of $726.23 to be added to the amount received by the appellants into the license fund, which made a total of $5,206.23, available for salaries and expenses; and the Department of Inland Revenue acting within the scope of the order in council of the 5th September, 1885, apportioned the said sum as follows: $2,521.33 for the appellants as commissioners, $1,852.66 for the inspectors and the sum of $832.24 for contingencies.\nThe sum which the appellants had already paid to the inspectors, namely, $3,431.42 was more than the Department of Inland Revenue was empowered under the said order in council to allow by the sum of $1,578.76, and the appellants found that out of the $5,206.23 there would only be $942.55 left to apply upon their own salaries, instead of the $2,521.33 which the department had appropriated for their payment.\nThe appellants then applied to the government for payment of this difference of $1,578.76, and upon payment being refused they applied for and obtained a reference of their claim to the Exchequer Court under 50 and 51 Vic. ch. 16, sec. 23, and on the 18th day of November, 1890, the case came on for trial at the city of Quebec before the judge of the Exchequer Court and judgment was afterwards rendered whereby the appellants' action was dismissed.\nL.

(Oral)\u2014The act under which the appellant was appointed having been declared by this court and the Privy Council ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, this petition of right is not maintainable and the appeal must be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Les appelants formant le bureau des commissaires pour l'octroi des licences pour la vente des liqueurs, en vertu de l'acte des licences du Canada, de 1883, r\u00e9clament la somme de $1,578.76 comme leur \u00e9tant due par Sa Majest\u00e9 pour les causes suivantes:\nNomm\u00e9s commissaires des licences pour le district de licence de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1884, les appelants en ont rempli toutes les fonctions et devoirs, jusqu'au 23 d\u00e9cembre 1885, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle l'acte en question fut par jugement du Conseil priv\u00e9, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inconstitutionnel.\nLes appelants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s commissaires des licences en vertu de la sec. 6 de l'acte des licences, d\u00e9clarant que:\nA chief inspector of licenses, and one or more inspectors, shall be appointed by the board of license commissioners from time to time for each district, as the board may see fit, and each license inspector shall, before entering upon his duties, give such security as the board may require for the due performance of his duties, and for the payment over of all sums of money received by him under the provisions of this Act; and the salary of the inspectors shall be fixed by the board, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council. En vertu de cette section les commissaires nomm\u00e8rent un inspecteur en chef avec un salaire de $1,200 et deux assistants inspecteurs avec un salaire de $400 chacun, par ann\u00e9e, et ces inspecteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 ces taux jusqu'au 10 septembre 1885, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle les salaires fix\u00e9s par les commissaires furent r\u00e9duits par ordre en conseil.\nPar lettre du 14 mars 1884, le ministre du revenu de l'int\u00e9rieur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de ces nominations et du montant des salaires fix\u00e9s qui seraient pay\u00e9s mensuellement pour l'inspecteur et toutes les semaines pour ses assistants, avec les fonds qui se trouveraient entre les mains des commissaires, \u00e0 moins d'instructions contraires.

En cons\u00e9quence, les commissaires continu\u00e8rent \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9penses de leur bureau et les salaires de leurs officiers, aux taux fix\u00e9s par eux, jusqu'au 10 septembre 1885, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle ils furent notifi\u00e9s par le d\u00e9partement qu'un ordre en conseil fixant et r\u00e9duisant les salaires des inspecteurs avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9. Les inspecteurs furent ensuite pay\u00e9s suivant le montant fix\u00e9 par cet ordre en conseil jusqu'au 23 d\u00e9cembre 1885, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle tous proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour mettre \u00e0 effet l'acte en question furent abandonn\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil priv\u00e9. En vertu de la sec. 61, les commissaires \u00e9taient tenus de faire rapport au ministre du revenu de l'int\u00e9rieur de toutes leurs op\u00e9rations pour la mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution de l'acte des licences; et pendant tout le temps que le dit acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 en force, les dits commissaires ont constamment tenu le d\u00e9partement au fait de toutes leurs op\u00e9rations.\nDepuis le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1884 au 25 d\u00e9cembre 1885, le montant de leurs d\u00e9penses s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 aux sommes suivantes:\u2014\nSalaires de l'inspecteur et de ses assistants\n$3,431 62\nDiverses d\u00e9penses\n832 24\nSalaires des commissaires\n2,513 34\n$6,777 20\nLes d\u00e9penses diverses furent accord\u00e9es par l'ordre en conseil, mais le salaire de l'inspecteur en chef et de ses assistants fut r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $1,852.66 au lieu de $3,431.42 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 par les commissaires, ce qui fait une diff\u00e9rence de $1,578.76 entre le montant r\u00e9ellement pay\u00e9 et d\u00e9bours\u00e9 par les commissaires et celui fix\u00e9 par l'ordre en conseil du gouvernement.\nCette diff\u00e9rence de $1,578.76 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 retranch\u00e9e du montant accord\u00e9 comme salaire aux commissaires, $2,521.33, il n'est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux-ci que $942.57 \u00e0 compte de leur salaire.\nLeur action a pour but d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9s de la somme de $1,578.76 d\u00e9bours\u00e9e et pay\u00e9e par eux pour la mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution de l'acte des licences; en outre de ce qu'ils ont re\u00e7u \u00e0-compte de leur salaire.\nL'honorable juge de la cour de l'Echiquier a renvoy\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de droit des appelants en se fondant sur la sec. 6 de l'acte des licences de 1883, cit\u00e9e plus haut, contenant la d\u00e9claration suivante: \"And the salary of the inspectors shall be fixed by the board subject to the approval of the Governor in council.\"\nD'apr\u00e8s l'expos\u00e9 des faits ci-dessus, il est clair que les commissaires ont inform\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le d\u00e9partement de toutes leurs actions au sujet de la mise en force de l'acte, qu'ils lui ont donn\u00e9 information du montant fix\u00e9 pour le salaire des inspecteurs et qu'ils ont aussi demand\u00e9 l'approbation requise par la sec. 6 de l'acte, enfin que toute leur conduite a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e au coin de la prudence, du jugement et de la plus grande bonne foi dans tous leurs proc\u00e9d\u00e9s.\nNe recevant pas de r\u00e9ponse au sujet du salaire de leurs officiers ils continu\u00e8rent de les payer aux taux fix\u00e9s par eux, dont ils avaient inform\u00e9 le gouvernement en lui rendant compte de leurs d\u00e9penses. Non seulement les commissaires avaient raison de prendre le long silence du gouvernement \u00e0 ce sujet comme une preuve d'approbation du taux fix\u00e9 par eux, mais l'ayant inform\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la cour Supr\u00eame qu'ils entendaient maintenir en office leurs officiers, ils re\u00e7urent une lettre en date du 14 ao\u00fbt 1885, les informant que leur d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait approuv\u00e9e. N'\u00e9tait-ce pas l\u00e0 une approbation formelle et une ratification de la fixation du salaire? Si le gouvernement avait eu l'intention alors de ne pas confirmer les salaires n'\u00e9tait-il pas absolument de son devoir d'en informer les commissaires et de leur dire en m\u00eame temps qu'il consentait au maintien des officiers, mais \u00e0 un taux moins \u00e9lev\u00e9. Les commissaires pas plus que les officiers ne pouvaient s'imaginer que le gouvernement avait l'intention de les conserver, mais \u00e0 un taux r\u00e9duit dont il ne fut nullement alors question. Ces officiers ont d\u00fb pr\u00e9sumer que puisque le gouvernement retenait leurs services, c'\u00e9tait aux m\u00eames conditions que par le pass\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire au salaire fix\u00e9 par les commissaires qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 jusqu'alors sans aucune difficult\u00e9. Malheureusement l'approbation du Gouverneur en conseil requise par la section 6 de l'acte des licences de 1883, pour la d\u00e9termination des salaires n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, je me vois bien \u00e0 regret forc\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer que cette formalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u00e9gitimer la r\u00e9clamation du salaire. Cependant les commissaires ayant fait toutes les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires pour l'obtenir ce n'est pas \u00e0 eux d'en supporter la responsabilit\u00e9, mais au ministre du revenu de l'int\u00e9rieur qui a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la demande des commissaires. Il faut esp\u00e9rer que le d\u00e9partement indemnisera les commissaires d'une perte qu'ils ne devraient pas subir.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this petition of right was rightly dismissed. I have come to that determination not without regret, as it is clearly in evidence that the petitioners were certainly led into error by the officers of the Crown, and paid these inspectors solely with the intention of effectually putting an act of Parliament into force, in performance of their duties. I think in law, however, that they have no right of action, though their claim should, in my opinion, receive a favourable consideration from the Crown. I agree with the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nThe salaries of the inspectors could only become a charge upon the license fund after the sanction and approval of the Governor in Council of such salaries had been obtained therefor, and there is no evidence that the salaries as fixed by the appellants were ever approved of as required by the statute, so that any sums of money paid by the appellants without such approval were paid illegally, and the appellants must take the consequences of their illegal action.\nThe appellants were expressly warned shortly after their appointment by letter of the commissioner of Inland Revenue that in fixing the salaries of the inspectors, the salaries so fixed were subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, and that when the salaries should be submitted to the department, the Governor in Council would consider the matter; and more especially were the appellants notified by the letter of the commissioner of Inland Revenue of the 6th August, 1884, to the appellants, wherein amongst other things the commissioner says, \"In districts where the revenue accrued upon applications for licenses and license fees is sufficient to meet all anticipated expenditure, the chairman of such boards will probably feel little hesitation in accepting the responsibility of authorizing disbursements on account of the expenses of the board and of the salaries and expenses of the inspectors, always bearing in mind that the inspector's salary is subject ultimately to the approval of the Governor in Council, and therefore that any advance on account of it must leave a reasonable margin for any possible divergence of view between the board and His Excellency in Council as to the value of the services rendered.\" The appellants cannot now be allowed to say that they never had any notification from the Department of Inland Revenue as to the fixing of the salaries even if such notification were necessary. And the fact that the appellants went on for nearly the whole time of their official tenure paying the salaries to the inspectors as fixed by themselves, with the knowledge of the Department of Inland Revenue, cannot, it seems to me clear, be construed into an approval of their conduct under the statute so as to bind the Crown.\nThe approval as required by the 6th section of the statute cannot be inferred from the mere inaction or silence of the Minister of Inland Revenue. That section requires actual approval by the Governor in Council. The minister, therefore, in fact had no authority under the statute to approve, and as the learned judge in the court below puts it, what he could not do directly he could not be held to have done indirectly. Queen v. McGreevy[2] and Queen v. Smith[3].\nNeither can the delay which took place between the time when the appellants first notified the department that they had fixed the salaries and the time when the salaries were fixed and sanctioned by the Governor in Council, be taken to be an admission on the part of the Crown that the salaries fixed by the commissioners had the approval of the Crown.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Belcourt, MacCraken & Henderson.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor, Hogg & Balderson.\n[1] 2 Ex.

C.\nP.A.A.D., respondent, as representing the institutes and substitutes under the will of the late J. D. brought an action against J.B.T.D. (appellant) who was one of the institutes and had acted as curator and administrator of the estate for a certain time for reddition of an account of three particular sums, which the plaintiff alleged the defendant had received while he was curator.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that an action did not lie against the appellant for these particular sums apart from and distinct from an action for an account of his administration of the rest of the estate.\nThe plaintiff in his action alleged that he represented S.D., one of the substitutes in virtue of a deed of release and subrogation by which it appeared he had paid to S. D.'s attorney for and on behalf of the defendant a sum of .\u00a3447. 7s. 6\u00bdd., the defendant having in an action of reddition of account settled by notarial deed of settlement with the said S.D. for the sum of $4,000 which he agreed to pay and for which amount the plaintiff became surety.\nHeld that as the notarial deed of settlement gave the defendant a full and complete discharge of all renditions of account as curator or administrator of the estate, the plaintiff could not claim a further reddition of account of these particular sums.\nThe plaintiff also claimed that he represented F.D. and E.D. two other institutes under the will in virtue of two assignments made to him by them on the 21st January, 1869, and 15th November 1869 respectively. In 1865, after the defendant had been sued in an action of reddition of account, by a deed of settlement the said F.D. and E. D. agreed to accept as their share in the estate the sum of $4,000 each, and gave the defendant a complete and full discharge of all further redditions of account.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the defendant could not be sued for a new account but could only be sued for the specific performance of the obligations he had contracted under the deed of settlement\nIn 1871 C.Z.D., another of the institutes, died without issue, and by his will made the defendant his universal legatee. Plaintiff claimed his share in the estate under a deed of assignment made by defendant to Plaintiff in 1862 of all right title and interest in the estate.\nHeld, that the plaintiff did not acquire by the deed of 1862 the defendant's title or interest in any portion of C.Z. De's share under the will of 1871.\nHeld further, that under the will of the late J.D., C.Z.D.'s share reverted either to the surviving institutes or to the substitutes and that all defendant took under the will of C.Z.D. was the accrued interest on the capital of the share at the time of his death.\nBy the judgment appealed from the defendant was condemned to render an account of his own share in the estate which he transferred to plaintiff by notarial deed in 1862, and also an account of C.D.'s share, another institute who in 1882 transferred his rights to the plaintiff. The transfer made by the defendant was in his capacity of co-legatee of such rights and interests as he had at the time of the transfer, and he had at that time received the sixth of the sum for which he was sued to account\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the plaintiff took nothing as regards these sums under the transfer and even . if he was entitled to anything, the defendant would not be liable in action to account as the mandatory or negotiorum gestor of the plaintiff.\n2. That F. D. and E. D. having acquired an interest in C. Z. D.'s share after they had transferred their share to plaintiff in 1869 the plaintiff could not maintain lois action without making them par-ties to the suit. Art. 920 C.P.C\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014Quare: Were not the transfers made by the institutes E.D., F.D. and CD. to the plaintiff while he was curator to the substitution null and void under Art. 1484 C.C.?\nAPPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) (1), which modified the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada (1).\nThe respondent as representing the institutes, S\u00e9v\u00e8re Dorion Firmin Dorion Charles Dorion, Eustache Dorion Charles Z\u00e9phire Dorion and the appellant himself under the will of the late Jacques Dorion who died in 1822 and also in his capacity of curator to the substitution, created by the said will, sued the appellant for the reddition of an account of the amount of three particular sums of money amounting to the sum of $15,646, which it is alleged the appellant received in his capacity of curator to the estate of the late Jacques Dorion.\nIn March, 1821, Jacques Dorion, by his last will, bequeathed his estate to his brother Charles with substitution in favour of the said Charles's children and the children of his children so long as there would be any of the name.\nJacques Dorion died in 1822, Charles then came into possession of the estate. On the 28th February, 1841 Charles died, and J. B. T. Dorion, the present appellant, was appointed curator to the substitution created by the will of Jacques Dorion, and he appears to have been in possession of the said estate in that quality from 20th August, 1841, to the 14th August, 1858.\nIn his declaration the plaintiff alleged that the defendant during his administration of said estate, received from Fred. T. Hall et al., 1st, on the 16th May, 1845 $8,000.00; 2nd, on 18th May, 1854, $6,980.00, and 3rd from one EIoi Marier, on the 18th July, 1855, $666.67 that these three capital sums belonged to the substitutes of the estate of Jacques Dorion; that the defendant had failed to invest said sums of money, making use of the same for his own benefit, receiving? the interest thereon without accounting for the same.\nThe deeds of assignment from the institutes to the respondent and the pleadings are referred to at length in the judgments of the courts below (1) and in the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Taschereau, hereinafter given.\nThe respondent as representing the institutes had intervened in a previous action of reddition brought by one Moreau, who had become curator to the substitution and by a judgment of the Superior Court the appellant was condemned to pay the respondent the sum of $142282.72, but 0:1 appeal it was reduced to the sum of $525.37, and on an appeal and cross-appeal to the Supreme Court the action and intervention were dismissed (1).\nLacoste Q.C. and Bonin Q.C. for the appellant cited and relied on Dalloz, Rep. (1); Merlin, Rep. (2); Pardessus (1); Delamarre et Le Poitvin (1); Groujet et Merger (1); Encyclop\u00e9die de droit (1).\nSee also Cummings v. Taylor (1); Dorion v.

En 1858 14 ao\u00fbt Moreau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur, aux lieu et place du d\u00e9fendeur et, en 1866, 7 juillet, P. A. A.

Puis il all\u00e8gue' que le d\u00e9fendeur lorsqu'il \u00e9tait curateur, et depuis, a toujours g\u00e9r\u00e9 toute la succession, et n'en a pas rendu compte, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, qu'il a re\u00e7u en 1845, 1854 et 1855 trois des capitaux appartenant \u00e0 la dite succession, se montant en tout \u00e0 $15,646, dont il n'a jamais rendu compte. Et il conclut : lo \u00e0 une reddition de compte, Dar le d\u00e9fendeur, de cette somme d\u00e9 $15,646, sinon \u00e0 ce qu'il soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la lui payer moins une somme de $2,353 que, lui-m\u00eame, le demandeur doit an d\u00e9fendeur en vertu d'un jugement du 19 novembre 1883 20 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur soit condamn\u00e9, s'il ne rend pas compte, \u00e0 lui payer une somme de $21,380 pour la cart du capital de S\u00e9v\u00e8re, fils, auquel ii est subrog\u00e9, all\u00e8gue-t-il, par l'acte du 25 avril 1866, \u00e0 lui consenti par le dit S\u00e9v\u00e9re fils.\nJe dispose de suite de cette part de S\u00e9v\u00e9re fils. Je suss d'avis avec .a cour d'Appel, que cet acte du 25 avril 1866, par lequel il appert que le demandeur a pay\u00e9 au dit S\u00e9v\u00e9re, fils, une somme de \u00a3443.9.6 \u00e0 l'acquit du present d\u00e9fendeur, pour lequel il \u00e9tait caution, ne le subroge contre le d\u00e9fendeur que pour cette somme, et ne lui conf\u00e8re pas le droit de demander un compte au d\u00e9fendeur pour la part du dit Severe, fils, dans les trois sommes sur lesquelles ii base son action droit que d'ailleurs le dit S\u00e9v\u00e8re n'aurait pas lui-m\u00eame en vertu d'un acte entre lui et le d\u00e9fendeur du 12 janvier 1866 identique \u00e0 ceux entre le d\u00e9fendeur et Firmin et Eustache dont je parlerai dans un instant. Le demandeur lui-m\u00eame d'ailleurs, dans sa declaration, n'all\u00e8gue qu'une subrogation en sa faveur \u00e0 cette somme de \u00a3443.9.6.\nMaintenant taut qu'aux parts de Firmin et Eustahee, le demandeur doit aussi \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de sa demande pour les motifs sur lesquels la cour d'Appel s'est appuy\u00e9e en renvoyant cette partie de l'action. Par actes du 5 novembre 1864 et du 29 mai 1865 entre eux et le d\u00e9fendeur, ces deux co-l\u00e9gataires consentirent an dit d\u00e9fendeur une d\u00e9charge complete et finale de son administration jusqu'\u00e0 ces dates, avec stipulation que leurs sixi\u00e8mes se montaient \u00e0 $4,000 chacun faisant $24,000 pour le tout, dans laquelle somme ii est clair, les trois sommes sur lesquelles le demandeur base son action se trouvent comprises s'engageant, les dits Firmin et Eustache de ne jamais exiger du d\u00e9fendeur on de la dite succession des int\u00e9r\u00e9ts sur une plus forte somme que celle de $4,000, et admettant que leurs parts ne se sont jamais \u00e9lev\u00e9es \u00e0 une plus forte somme le d\u00e9fendeur de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 reconnaissant qu'elle s'\u00e9l\u00e9ve \u00e0 cette somme. L'acte par Eustache dit (et l'autre est dans le m\u00e9me sens.)\nLe dit Eustache Dorion acquitte et d\u00e9charge compl\u00e8tement et finalement de ce jour et \u00e0 toujours le dit Jean B. T. Dorion, son fr\u00e9re, de toute reddition de compte de curatelle et d'administration de Ia dite succession Jacques Dorion, et de toute sa part des biens meubles et immeubles et choses g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques de la dite succession comme aussi de toute balance de compte qu'il a ou pourrait avoir \u00e0 exercer et \u00e0 demander \u00e0 l'encontre du dit Jean-Baptiste T. Dorion.\nIl me parait incontestable que cet acte contient un r\u00e8glement final du moins tant qu'aux trois sommes sp\u00e9cifiquss maintenant r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par le demandeur que le d\u00e9fendeur avait alors et depuis longtemps re\u00e7ues tel que l'all\u00e8gue le demandeur lui-m\u00eame\nLe demandeur a \u00e9mis la proposition que comme le d\u00e9fendeur n'a jamais pay\u00e9 ce reliquat de compte de $4,000 \u00e9tabli eni;re lui, le d\u00e9fendeur et Firmin et Enstache, ii est demeur\u00e9 comptable, et l'appuie sur l'ordonnance de 1667, art. 29, par. 1, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que tous ceux qui out administr\u00e9 sont toujours comptables, encore que le compte soit closet arr\u00eat\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient pay\u00e9 le reliquat. En loi sa proposition est correcte, mais ilen fait une fausse application. D'abord, ce n'est pas une reddition de compte de son administration de ces $4,000 qu'il demande ici au d\u00e9fendeur Et puis cet article de l'ordonnance ne veut pas dire que quand un reliquat a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, mais non pav\u00e9 l'ayant compte aura droit tous les mois, tous les ans, ou chaque fois qu'il lui plaira \u00e0 une nouvelle action en reddition de compte. Stephens v. Gillespie (1); Blais v. Valli\u00e8res (1); M\u00e9thol v. Dufott (1). L'action en revision de compte est m\u00eame prohib\u00e9e par l'ordonnance. Il n'existe alors que l'action en redressement ou en reformation (1) s'il v a eu erreurs ou omissions. Et sur le reliquat m\u00eame, quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'amiable c'est l'action de dette qui est donn\u00e9e Michaud v. Vezina (2); Demolombe (3); Marcoux v. Morris en appel (1); Demolombe r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 cet article de l'ordonnance dit (1) : Bien que le rendant compte fat r\u00e9put\u00e9 comiptable jusqu'au paiement du reliquat, c'\u00e9tait seulement en ce sens que les. r\u00e8gles relatives aux comptables, et particuli\u00e8rement la voie d'ex\u00e9cution par Ia contrainte par corps, lui demeuraient applicables.\nFirmin, S\u00e9v\u00e8re fils, et Eustache n'auraient done pas d'action comme, la pr\u00e9sente contre le d\u00e9fendeur. Et le demandeur, leur cessionnaire n'a pas plus de droits qu'eux. Le contre-appel qu'il a pris du jugement de la cour du Bane de la Reine qui a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 cette partie de sa demande, dolt done \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens\nJe passe maintenant \u00e0 la part de Charles Z\u00e9phire, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1871, laissant un testament\nCe testament n'est pas produit, mais ii est admis qu'il a constitu\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur, J. B.Th\u00e9ophile, l\u00e9gataire universel. Parce legs, les arr\u00e9rages d'int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9chus du vivant du testateur sont passes au d\u00e9fendeur; mais pour sa part du capitaldu legs de Jacques Dorion, l'instituant, Charles Z\u00e9phire, n'a Pu la l\u00e9guer au d\u00e9fendeur, pas plus qu'il n'aurait pa le faire \u00e0 un \u00e9tranger. Tous ses droits se sont \u00e9teints avec lui, soit que sa part soit accrue en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec charge de rendre \u00e0 ses cinq fr\u00e8res survivants, soit qu'elle, soit de suite pass\u00e9e, d\u00e9grev\u00e9e, \u00e0 leurs enfants, Art. 868, 873, 933 0.C.; Ricard (1); Denisart Accroissement (1); Marcad\u00e9 (1); Troplong (1); Guyot (1); Salviat, usufruit .(1); Pothier, Substitutions (6); et Donat. test. (1); Sirey (2); Joseph v. Castonguay (3); Jones v. Cuthbert (4). Il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 decider dans l'instance entre ces deux theories soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience.\nSous l'une ou sous l'autre, le d\u00e9fendeurrn'apu acqu\u00e9rir des droits \u00e0 la part de Charles Z\u00e9phire comme son l\u00e9gataire universel. Jacques Dorion a institu\u00e9 les six enfants de Charles apr\u00e8s leur p\u00e9re, l\u00e9gataires conjoints, avec substitution graduelle, Bourjon (1); et le sixi\u00e8me de Charles Z\u00e9phrre revient ou \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res survivants ou \u00e0 leurs enfants non pas jure adcrescendi mais jure non decrecendi, arts. 868, 933 C.C., Laurent (1); Demolombe (1). C'est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame, pour un sixi\u00e9me, avec la jouissance, \u00e0 charge de conserver et rendre, que l'instituant a legue a Charles Z\u00e9phire, et cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Charles Z\u00e9phire n'a pu en disposer ni la morceler. La proposition que, par le fait qu'il n'a pas laiss\u00e9 d'enfants, la substitution, pour son sixi\u00e9me, est devenue caduque n'est pas fond\u00e9e. La substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire comprend Ia vulgaire, art. 926 C. C. L'intention \u00e9videnee de l'instituant \u00e9tait de conserver ses biens dans la famille. C'est d'ailleurs toujours l\u00e0 l'inteniion que l'on doit presumer dans les substitutions c'est l\u00e0 le motif que la loi elle-m\u00eame attribue aux instituants. Dans ce but, il a ordonn\u00e9, et c'est sa volont\u00e9 qui fait la loi que taut qu'il existerait des descendants de Charles en ligne directo ils viendraient successivement aux biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s dan l'ordre prescrtt par la loi, avcc charge \u00e0 chaque g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de conserver et rendre et avec les modiiications qud cette charge peut comporter en loi, sans qu'aucun d'eux pussse jamais y d\u00e9roger, ni interrompre l'ordre r\u00e9gulier de succession en ligne directe; et afin de neas laisser de doute sur ses intentions, il ajoute \u00e0 in substitution une prohibition d'ali\u00e9ner les capitaux. Or l\u00e9guer par testament, c'est aliSner. Pothier Subtituiions (1), Proudhon, Usufruit (2).\nSi la mort de Charles Z\u00e9phrre sans enfanss avait entrain\u00e9, la caducit\u00e9 de la substitution pour son sixi\u00e9me, ii s'en suivrait qu'il aurait pu le vendre de son vivant, et que cetee vents resoluble d'abord serait devenue inattaquable \u00e0 sa mort. Ne serait-ce pas l\u00e0 tin r\u00e9sultat absolument contraire aux intentions du testateurr S'il avait vendu ses droits purement et simplementt est-ce que son acheteur aurait eu des droits aprss la mort de son vendeur?\nTh\u00e9v\u00e9not-Dessaules Diet, du Digeste (1) dit :\nLes parts l\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 ceux des l\u00e9gatairss conjoints, dont la future existence quoique pr\u00e9sumee na pas eu lieu, accroissent ajix autres parts.\nEn mati\u00e8re de substitution co-hczreses inter se gaudent jure ctccrescendi et jus accrescendi ac substitutio reciproca. Idem re Testament (1).\nEt l'annotateur ajoute\nC'est aussi ce qui sans doute auratt lieu dans notre droit tant pour les legs particuliers que pour les legs universels, laiss\u00e9s conjointement a plusieurs.\nJe r\u00e9f\u00e8re aussi \u00e0 Aibry et Rau (1) et Demolombe, donations (1).\nJe dis done, que si Eustache, Firmin et le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame (et peut-\u00eatre S\u00e9v\u00e9re, fils, si representation a lieu) out chacun h\u00e9rit\u00e9 avec Charles en 1871, d'une part de celle de Charles Z\u00e9phire, cette part, ils l'ont encore. Les transports qu'ils out faits au demandeur de leurs droits dans la succession en 1862,1866 et 1869, en supposant m\u00eame qu'ils s'\u00e9tendraient aux trois sommes en question, ne couvrent que les droits qu'ils avaient alors dans ces sommes comme l\u00e9gataires de leur propee chef de Jacques Dorion, et ne peuvent s'\u00e9tendee \u00e0 ce quills n'avaient pas alors et \u00e0 ce qu'ils n'ont h\u00e9rit\u00e9 que subs\u00e9quemment de Charess Z\u00e9phire (1) et le demandeur n'en \u00e9tant pas le cessionnaire n'en peut demander compte au d\u00e9fendeur.\nLe demandeur lui-m\u00eame n'a-t-il pas reconnu en 1882 que toute la part de Charess ZCphire n'appartient pas au d\u00e9fendeur, lorsqu'il a acquis de Charless sa part dans la dite succession consistant, est-il dit dans l'acte, non dans un sixi\u00e8me mais dans Un cinqui\u00e9me? Si Charles avait un cinqui\u00e8me c'est que les cinq freres survivants, \u00e0 la mort de Charles Z\u00e9phire, ont chacun h\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'une part de son sixi\u00e8me.\nSi, au contraice, cetee part de Charles Z\u00e9phrre est pass\u00e9e en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et enti\u00e8re aux enfanss des cinq fr\u00e8res surviTants, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 alternativement \u00e0 l'audience, la consequenee est la m\u00e9me vis-a vis du dem mdeur. Il n'en est pas plus le ces-sionnaire Le substitu\u00e9 du substitu\u00e9 est substitu\u00e9 de liinstttu\u00e9. Et si m\u00e9me, tel que les parties semblent admettre par la d\u00e9claration et par les plaidoyers, bien qu'erron\u00e9ment suivant mci, cetee part \u00e9tait pass\u00e9e toute enti\u00e8re au d\u00e9feideur par le testamntt de Charess Z\u00e9phire le demandeur n'en est pas plus le cessionnaire pour la m\u00e9me ra.son que la cession que lui a faite le d\u00e9fendeur en 186;2, n'est pie de son propee sixi\u00e9me, et ne s'\u00e9tend pas an si xi\u00e9me de Charess Z\u00e9phrre qui u'est advenu \u00e0 lui, le lit d\u00e9fendeur, qu'en 1871.\nIl me serait en consequence inutile de rechercher si Charles Z\u00e9phire a Pu l\u00e9guer \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, quoiqu'il n'eut pu le faire \u00e0 un otrangrr. La questonn d'ailleurs n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e Par les parties.\nJ'ai d\u00fb me prononcer sur son testament, paree que le jugement dont est appel, prenant les admsssions des parties peut-\u00eatre plut\u00f4t que donnant l'opinion des savanss iuores lui a donn\u00e9 un effet que le ne puis v voir, et que la questinn a \u00e9t\u00e9 savamment d\u00e9battue \u00e0 l'audience. Mais, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, le d\u00e9fendeur, eit-il h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de toute la part de Charles Z\u00e9phire le demandeur doit succombrr tout de m\u0152me, car lui, le d\u00e9fendeur, ne la lui a jamais c\u00e9d\u00e9e depuss qu'il en a h\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nSon contre-pppel, tant qu'\u00e0 cetee part, dolt donc aussi \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9. Ceci dispose des quatre parts en question sur le contre-pppel du demandeur. J'en viens maintenant \u00e0 l'appel du d\u00e9fendeur, qui se dit l\u00e9s\u00e9 par le \"jugement de la cour du BanO de la Reune en ce qu'il le Qondamne \u00e0 rendee compee de son- propee sixi\u00e8me et du sixi\u00e8me de Charles dans les trois sommes susdites.\nD'abord tant qu'au sixi\u00e8me du d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00e9me. Le demandeur ici base sa demande sur une cession ou transport parle d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0lui en date du 20 d\u00e9cembre 1862 de ses droits dans la .dite succession. C'est, il est evident, comme un des co-l\u00e9gataires seulement que le d\u00e9fendeur a consenti cet acte; il n'a pu y \u00eatre question de lui comme curateur ou procureur. Or, le demandeur demande exciusivement compee de trois sommes sp\u00e9cifiquss toutes per\u00e7ues par le d\u00e9fendeur avant cetee cession. Cette cession eomprend-elle ces trois sommes? Le d\u00e9fendeur lui a c\u00e9d\u00e9 ses droits et actions. Avait-il des droits on une action contee lui-m\u0152me ^ Une cession de droits ii semble n'est et ne t)eut \u00eatre qu'une cession de drotts contee des tiers. Ii est stipul\u00e9 dans cet acte que\nLe dit cessionnaire touchera et recevra sur ses simples recus du curateur Moeeau ou de tous autres qu'il appartiendaa tous les capi taux aff\u00e9rant an dit c\u00e9dant dans la diee succession comme l\u00e9gataires pour l'effet de quoi le c\u00e9dant le met et subroee dans tons ses droits et actions, privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques.;\nOr depuss longtemps auparavant ce transport, comme j.e l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 remarqu\u00e9, le dCfendeur avait re\u00e7u son sixi\u00e9me dans les trois sommes sur lesquelles l'actinn est bas\u00e9e Car en recevant le total il avait bien re\u00e7u son prdpre sixi\u00e9me, dont il \u00e9tait devenu cr\u00e9ancier, avant tout partage ala mort de Charles. Art. 1122 C.C.\nCe transport donc n'est pas et n'a pu \u00eatre de ce sixi\u00e9me on d'aucune somme re\u00e7ue ant\u00e9rieurement par le d\u00e9fendeur, mais uniquement de ce qui lui \u00e9tait alors encoee d\u00fb. Quand le demandeur est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir du curateur Moreau, on de tous autres qu'il appartiendra, tous les capitaux aff\u00e9rant an d\u00e9fendeur, ceci ne peut s'\u00e9tendre aux capitaux que le d\u00e9fendeur avait d\u00e9ja re\u00e7us et quii par consequent, ne lui \u00e9taient pas afF\u00e9rants.\nL\u00e9 demandeur n'est done pas le cessionnaire de la part du d\u00e9fendeur dans les trois sommes en question. Mais meme, en sipposant qu'il le serait, et qu'il serait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendra que le d\u00e9fendeur lui a c\u00e9d\u00e9 par cet acte son sixi\u00e8me cie ces $15,646 que lui, le d\u00e9fendeur, avait alors entre ses mains ceci ne lui donnerait pas contre le d\u00e9fendear, une action en reddition de compte, car lui, le d\u00e9fendeur, n'est pas par l\u00e0 devenu son mandataire. Pour son propee sixi\u00e9me, ii n'a pas a\" comme procureur en recvvant cette somme mais, simplement ponr lui-m\u00eame comme co-legataire. De meme pour les int\u00e9rets de ces \u00e9iommes. Maintenant, en supposant toujouss, que cet acte du 20 d\u00e9cembre 1862 puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une cession du sixi\u00e8me de cette somme au demandeur, le d\u00e9fendeur est-il par l\u00e0 plus devenu le mandatarre du demandeur, paree qu'il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 garder ce sixi\u00e8me, entre ses mains? Un emprunteur quine rembourse pas au temps convenu jouit bien du capital de son.pr\u00e9teur, mais peut-on dire qu'il en est le mandataire? Un c\u00e9dant on vendeur ne d\u00e9livre pas cc qu'il a c\u00e9d\u00e9 ou vendu \u00e0 son cessionnaire, devient-il le mandatarre de son cessionnaire?\nEn loi donc, je croirais que le d\u00e9fendeur n'est pas par cet acte devenu, du moins pour son propee sixi\u00e8me dans ces trois sommes, le mandataire, ou negotiorum gestor du demandeur m\u00e9me si cet acte les couvratt. Je conclus que le demandeur doit faillir sur cc chef de sa demande, etque l'appel du d\u00e9fendeur doit \u00e9tre en consequence mainteru.\nCeci dispose de la cinqui\u00e8me part. Ii reste celle de Charles. Le transport au demandeur par Charles d'un cin-oui\u00e8me dans cetee succession en date du 23 juin 1882 le demandeur l'all\u00e8gue lui-m\u00e9me, n'est qu'une cession de droits contre le d\u00e9fendeur. Or in ne paralt pas avoir ete signifi\u00e9 au defendeur. L'objection, cependant, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Ii n'est pas non plus questonn dans la cause de retrait successoral, art. 710 C.O.; Lecierc v. Beaudrj (1), si le demandeur n'est pas successibee, ce qui n'appert pas au dossier. Cependant sur cette part de Charles, le demandeur doit, dans mon opinion, sucdomber comme sur touess les autres pour un motif qui entralne le rejet de l'aciion dans son entier ind\u00e9pendamment des raisons particuli\u00e8rement applicables aux cinq autres parts que j'ai donn\u00e9es.\nIi all\u00e8gue que le d\u00e9fendeur a administr\u00e9 toute la succession et en a retire les capitaux et revenus, mais il ne demande pas une reddition de compte de toute son administration, mais uniquement de trois sommes sp\u00e9cifiques re\u00e7ues par lui.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il ait ainsi droit de diviser une administration pour n'en demander compte que par parties. C'est une indivisibilit\u00e9, et il ne peut \u00eatre permis au demandeur de prendre dix, vingt, trente actions si dix, vingt, trente sommes diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues par le d\u00e9fendeur. Le g\u00e9rant d'une h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 pourrait-il prendre une action pour forcer les h\u00e9ritiers \u00e0 recevoir un compee de lui et lui donner un\u00ba decharge pour partie seulement de sa g\u00e9rance? Le d\u00e9fendeur ici aurait-il en une telle action seueement pour ces trois sommes re\u00e7ues par luii\nOn n\u00e9 peut diviser une dette \u00e9chue pour en demander le recouvrement par plusieurs actions dit l'art. 15 du C.P.C., Legar\u00e9 x. The Queen Insurance Co. (1). Sans doute, si un cr\u00e9ancier, sur une action de dette demande $100, et prouve que $200 lui sont dues, son action ne sera pas pour cela renvoy\u00e9e. Mais une action en reddition de compee Est par sa natuee m\u00e9me indivisible, comme la g\u00e9ranee elle-m\u00eame, et l'obiigaiion de rendee compee le sont. Le d\u00e9fendeur peut sur les autres parties de son administration qui a dure un demi-siecle, avoir contee le demandeur une r\u00e9clamation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que les trois sommes sp\u00e9cifiquss demand\u00e9es par l'action. D'ailleurs, il ne dolt pas \u00eatre expos\u00e9 \u00e0 une multiplicit\u00e9 de poursuites pour ce qui ne forme chez lui qu'un seul et m\u0152me acte l'administration dans son ensembee. La \u00e9auee de Joseph v. Phillips, (1) cit\u00e9e par le demandeur, n'est pas in point. L\u00e0 le d\u00e9fendeur n'avait retire qu'une seule somme pour le demandeur, dont il \u00e9tait procureur, non g\u00e9n\u00e9rall mais seulement pour retirer cetee somme sp\u00e9ciale, et la cour d\u00e9cida que, sous les circonstances, le demandeur pouvalt prendre contre lul une action de dette pour recouvrer cetee somme sans \u00eatre obli\u00b0*\u00e9 do recourrr \u00e0. une demande en reddition de compte. 11 est evident cjue si le d\u00e9fendeur eit eu l'administration g\u00e9nerale des affaires du demandeur, comme ici, d'apr\u00e8s les allegations de la declaration le d\u00e9fendeur a eu la cour dans cetee cause aurait dit au demandeur qu'il ne lul \u00e9tait pas permis de choisir une somme sp\u00e9cifique d'entre toutes celles re\u00e7ues par le d\u00e9fendeur, pour Ia r\u00e9clamer par action directe, et qu'il lui fallait recour.r \u00e0 l'action en reddition de compte mais en redditinn de compie non d'une somme sp\u00e9cifique mais de toute l'administration.\nUn l\u00e9gataire qui a l'administration enti\u00e8re d'une succession l\u00e9gu\u00e9e universellement \u00e0 plusieuss est vis-\u00e0-vss de ses co-l\u00e9gataires dans la position d'un associ\u00e9 ^\u00e9rant des affaires de Ia soci\u00e9t\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vss de ses co-associ\u00e9s. Et ii ne me paralt pas possible de pr\u00e9tendre qu'un de ceux-ci pourratt r\u00e9clamer de son associ\u00e9 g\u00e9rant un compte partiel, ou d'une partie divi- see de sa g\u00e9rance. Et l'action du demandeur ici est non seulement en reddition de compte contre le d\u00e9fendeur comme g\u00e9rant et administrateurr mais elle participe encoee du caract\u00e8re d'une action en partage contre 1 lui comme son co-legataire. Et ce partage ne pent \u00eatre demand\u00e9 que de toute la succession, non d'une partie seulement. L'action fa mili\u00e9 etciscundcB ou communi dividendo n'est donn\u00e9e que pour toute l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 5 et une succession indivise ne doit \u00e9tre l'objet que d'une seule liquidaiion et d'un partage unique. Demolombe (1).\nL'un des associ\u00e9s, dit la cour de Bordeaux, re DuTnecq ne peut contraindre see co-associ\u00e9s \u00e0 partager un objet partcculier avant quil nait \u00e9t\u00e9 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la liquidation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et au r\u00e8glement des comptes des associ\u00e9s entre eux. (1) J Bouthilli\u00eat v. Tuvcottc- (1); Dupues v. Du puis (1).\nDc plus sur une action en partage, tous les co-propri\u00e9-taires doivent \u00eatre en cause. Or ici, Firmin, S\u00e9v\u00e8re et Eusaaclie ne le sont pas. Le demandeur ne les repr\u00e9sente pas pour leur part dans la part de Charles Z\u00e9phire comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 remarqu\u00e9. Ii n'est pas leur cession-naire de cetee part.\nSans doute le demandeir n'a pas demand\u00e9 un partage par son action. Ii ne le pouvait, vu qu'il all\u00e8gue avoir droit \u00e0 toute la succession mais comme il n'a pas prouv\u00e9 avoir droit aux parts de S\u00e9v\u00e8re, Firmin et Eusaaclie, ni \u00e0 celle du d\u00e9fendeur, dans la succession de Charles Z\u00e9phire, ni \u00e0 celle du defendeur lui-m\u00eame dans les trois sommes dont in demande compte, son action prend, je l'ai dit, tout le caract\u00e8re d'une action en partage.\nLe demandeur a cmu pouvoir rencontrrr cette objection en disant que le d\u00e9fendeur pouvait bien, s'il avait voulu, rendee un compee du tout. C'est possible, mais ce n'est pas l\u00e0 la question. L'action telle que port\u00e9e, d'apr\u00e8s ses propres all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, est-elee fond\u00e9e en droit ou non? Si elle ne I'est pas le d\u00e9fendeur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu d'y suppl\u00e9er, ou de la refaire.

Before the time for appealing expired the attorney ad item for the defendant delivered the shares to the plaintiff's attorney and stated he would not appeal if the society were paid the amount directed to be paid. An appeal was subsequently taken before the plaintiff's attorney complied with the terms of the offer. On a motion to quash the appeal on the ground of acquiescence in the judgment:\nHeld, that the appeal would lie.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014T.iat an attorney ad item has no authority to bind his client not to appeal by an agreement with the opposing attorney that no appeal would be taken.\nA by-law of a building society (appellants) required that a shareholder should have satisfied all his obligations to the society before he should be at liberty to transfer his shares. One P. a director in contravention of the by-law, indeed the secretary to countersign a transfer of his shares to the Banque \"Ville Marie as collateral security for an amount he borrowed from the bank and it was not till P.'s abandonment or assignment for the benefit of his creditors that the other directors knew of the transfer to the bank although at the time of his assignment was indebted to the appellant society in a sum of $3,744, for which amount under the by-law his shares were charged as between P. and the society. The society immediately paid the bank the amount due by P. and took an assignment of the shares and of P.'s debt. The shares being worth more than the amount duie to the bank the curator to the insolvent estate of P. brought an action claiming the shares as forming part of the insolvents estate and with the action tendered the amount due by P. to the bank. The society claimed the shares were pledged to them for the whole amount of P\u2019s indebtedness to them under the by-laws.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, that the shares in question must be held as having always been charged under the by-laws with the amount of P.'s indebtedness to the society and that his creditors had only the same rights in respect of these shares as P himself had when he made the abandonment of his property, viz., to get the shares upon payment of P.'s indebtedness to the society. Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe respondents (plaintins), in their capacity of joint curators to the insolvent estate of Charles Trefil\u00e9 Picard, by their action prayed to have twenty shares of the appellants (defendant's) stock valued at $200 per share, declared their property and for an order to the appellant society to so enter these shares upon its books or in default of so doing, to be condemned to pay to the respondents (plaintiffs) $4,000, and at the same time deposited $1,664.43 as due by Picard to the Banque Ville Marie and for which sum Picard had transferred these shares as collateral security. The appellants (defendants) by their pleas declared their willingness to so register the stock, but only on payment to them of the said sum of $1,664.33 paid by them to the Banque Ville Marie, and of a further sum of US 744 with interest from the 25th of February 1885.\nThe facts which have rise to the litigation are the following The appellants are a building society organized under ch. 69 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, and Picard., the insolvent, was a shareholder in the society and held as such thirty shares of $200 each. As collateral security for loans made to him by the Ville Marie Bank and aggregating $1,550, Picard in 1882 transferred to the bank twenty of these shares. Picard al the time he made this transfer to the bank, was accountant and a director of the society, and he also owed the society in the neighborhood of $1,000, and by tie 24th of February, 1885, renewals and new loans had brought the amount to $3,744, represented by a demand note which specially covenanted that his stock was transferred to and held by the society as collateral security to be by it, in case of his default, taken in payment and sold without any misc en demeure being necessary. The transfers were made in fraud of appellants to the Ville Marie Bank and were entered in the transfer book sinned by the transferred and transferee and countersigned by the secretary-treasurer, but of the fact that these transfers existed the society only became aware in February, 1886, and it then immediately paid off the claim of the Bank Ville Marie and took a subrogation dated the 11th March, 1887, of all its rights. In November, 1885, Picard became insolvent, and the respondents who had been appointed joint curators to his insolvent estate on the 27th of May 1887 were authorized by the court to take an action in their name for the benefit of Picard's creditors against the appellant society for the recovery of these twenty shares, and it is the money paid by the society to the Ville Marie Bank which the respondents tendered with their demand for the delivery of the shares.\nThe following by-laws of the society were filed at the trial of the action Art. X.\u2014No shareholders shall be entitled to demand from the Society the reimbursement of the amounts paid on his shares, the only way for him to dispose of his shares shall be by selling or transferring the same.\nArt. XI.\u2014 To this effect, the Society shall keep a transfer book and all transfers to be valid shall be signed by the transferor and the transferee, and counter signed by the Secretary Treasurer.\nNo transfer shall be made by the transferor until he has met all his obligations to the Society, and the Society shall not be obliged to acknowledge such transfer unless it be made in the form and on the conditions prescribed in the present article.\nArt. XII.\u2014The shares and moneys generally of any members in arrears towards the Society for any reason whatsoever, are specially and by privilege, affected to the payment of the Society's claims against him.\nIn the Supreme Court \u00e0 motion to quash the appeal on the ground of acquiescence by appellant in the judgment appealed from was made by respondent and judgment was reserved and the case heard on the merits.\nLaflamme Q.C. and Charpentier' with him for appellants contended that the transfer to the bank was made in fraud of the society's rights, and that no privilege could be removed or canceled by fraud and Picard's creditors could not invoke the fraud of their debtor to deprive the society of their lien and privilege on these shares, and referred to art. 1972 0. 0. (P.Q.)\nB\u00e9ique Q.C. for respondent contended that the property and assets of the debtor being the common pledge of his creditors (art. 1981 C. C.) and the proceeds thereof having to be distributed by contribution or dividend appellants could not be permitted to appropriate to themselves the shares in question unless they justify of the right of pledge which they have alleged and they liad not done so and referred to art. 1970 CO., and contended also that the transfers to the bank were regular and binding on the society, and were known to the directors of the company and they could not after Picard's assignment dispute their regularity.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(After reading the above statement of the case proceeded as follows:) The fraud in the transfer of the shares in question in this case seems or be established beyond all qquestion, and I do not understand it to be disputed. I think the appellants cannot by fraud be deprived of their unquestionable right and privilege in these shares secured to them by law and as the curators stand in the place of Picard neither they nor the creditors of Picard whom they represent, can, in my opinion, invoke the fraud of Picard their debtor to derive the appellant of the lien and privilege on these shares which the law has so conferred on them. When the defendants by paying the claim of the bank were reinstated in the position of which Picard's fraud had deprived them, they were simply placed in the same position in which they would have been if no fraud had been perpetrated To allow Picard's creditors to avail themselves of Picard's fraud to obtain the possession and the benefit of the stock which but formich fraud would have stood on the books of the society subject to the advances made to Picard, they can only do this by claiming through Picard's fraud, and so making themselves participators in that fraud which seems to me contrary to every principle of law and justice. I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Davidson should be restored. STRONG J.\u2014The appellants are a non-permanent building society incorporated under the provisions of chap go Q C the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada. By section 1 subsection 3 of this act societies organized under it, are empowered to make rules and regulations for the governance and guidance of the same, but such rules are not to be repugnant to the express provisions of the act or to the laws in force in Lower Canada.\nBy the Provincial Statute 42 and 43 Vic. chap: 32, sec. 4, building societies are authorized to lend money on the security of their own shares.\nThe society made by-laws and regulations of which articles 11 and 12 have an application to the present case.\nArt XI enacts that no transfer of shares shall be made by the transfer until he has met all his obligations to the society, and the society shall not be obliged to acknowledge such transfer unless it be made in the form and on the conditions prescribed in the present article. Art. XII. provides that the shares and moneys generally of any members in arrears .towards the society for any reason whatsoever, are specially and by privilege affected to the payment of the society's claims against him.\nThere can be no doubt in my opinion, that these bylaws are not in any way repugnant to the general law of Lower Canada as it existed when the Consolidated Statutes were passed, nor to the law as it now exists as embodied in the Code.\nThe law of course was and is that property such as these building society shares were, is to be considered movable property by determination of law And it is also the law that such property cannot be so hypothecated as to constitute a security available against the hypothecating debtor's creditors. And also that, as expressed in art. 1970 of the Code, it is essential to the validity of a pledge that the pledged property shall remain in the possession of the creditor or of a third person agreed upon between the parties. Had the by-laws in question attempted to authorize the creation of a security m any way repugnant to these provisions of the law they would undoubtedly have been absolutely null. They have not, however, attempted to do so. The shares in the building society are shares in the capital stock of the society, and this capital stock necessarily remains in the possession of the society and the refit to deal with the shares in it is by a provision quite usual and certainly intra vires made subject to the control of the society acting, of course, through its boa rd of directors.\nTherefore, when the by-laws provided that the society should have a privilege on \u00e1 members shares for whatever he might we to the society, and that no transfer should be made until the transfer had met all his obligations to the society, they provided for a security which was legal and within the competence of the society to create. The shares as shares in the capital stock of the society, were in a sense in the possession of the society and no transfer of them could be made so long as any debt was due by the holder to the society without the assent of the latter. Then the transfers to the Bank Ville Marie, being in the very teeth of the by-laws, and made fraudulently and entered in the transfer book only by the fraudulent complicity of the secretary-treasurer, they were absolutely null and void as regards the society. The delivery of the share-books to the bank ms de no difference. These books were not the shares, they were merely evidence of the shares and the delivery of them by an original shareholder to a creditor without the registration of a proper transfer in the books was wholly inoperative and could not affect the privilege of the society, either for past or future debts. Until a proper legal transfer was registered, it was the right of the society to treat the original holder as absolute owner of the unencumbered property in the shares.\nThe consequence must be that apart from any special agreement to that effect, and by the mere force of the by-laws the moneys lent and advanced to Picard became privileged debts charged on the shares so soon as such moneys were advanced to him, just as much so as if the statute had itself embodied the terms of the by-law.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Davidson was correct and ought to be restored, the appeal being allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelante est Incorpor\u00e9e comme soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction en vertu du ch. 69 des statuts consolid\u00e9s du Bas-Canada.

Ils \u00e9taient sign\u00e9s par Picard comme c\u00e9dant et par ubalde Garand agissant et acceptant pour la banque, et r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement contresign\u00e9s par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de l'appelante.\nLorsque Picard a fait le transport de ses actions \u00e0 la banque Ville-Marie, il devait alors pr\u00e9s de $1,000 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appelante, et au 25 mai 1885, des renouvellements et de nouveaux pr\u00eats avaient porte sa dette \u00e0 la somme de $3,744. Cette somme \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par son billet \u00e0 demande avec d\u00e9claration, comme dans les r\u00e8glements ant\u00e9rieurs, que son stock \u00e9tait transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et d\u00e9tenu par elle comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale de ce qu\u2019il lui devait.\nIi est en preuve qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque le bureau de directeurs de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait encore dans 1 ignorance du fait que Picard avait transport\u00e9 ses actions \u00e0 la banque Ville-Marie depuis 1882\u2014Picard \u00e9tait un des directeurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et son teneur de livres. Ses rapports intimes avec le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier lui avait fait acqu\u00e9rir sur celui-ci une influence dont il a profit\u00e9 pour l\u2019induire \u00e0 tromper la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 manquer \u00e0 son devoir en entrant et contresignant dans les livres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le transport de ses actions \u00e0 la banque Ville-Marie, sans la connaiasance du bureau de direction et pendant que Picard \u00e9tait endett\u00e9 envers la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Picard promettait au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de rembourser promptement la banque et de d\u00e9gager ses .actions pour remettre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la m\u00e9me position. Ce sont ces transports dont les intim\u00e9s veulent prendre avantage au detriment de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a perdu ses droits sur les actions de Picard.\nSans doute Picard et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier ont commis en se concertant pour executer ces transports \u00e0 l\u2019insu lu bureau de direction, et pendant que Picard \u00e9tat endett\u00e9, une fraude \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Mais comme il n'y & absolument aucune F preuve que la banque Ville-Marie ait connu cette fraude ou y ait particip\u00e9 en aucune mani\u00e8re, la transaction est inattaquable, et l'appelante l'a reconnu dans une reclamation qu'elle a faite dans la masse en faillite de Picard, et en remboursant \u00e0 la banque Ville-Marie les deniers qu'elle avait avanc\u00e9s \u00e0 Picard sur le transport de cas actions.\nMalheureusement pour l'appelante, Picard \u00e9tant devenu insolvable ee fit le 14 novembre 1885 pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers, cession de ses biens qui sont devenus par l'effort de l'art. 1987 C.C le gasre commun de tous ses cr\u00e9anciers et le product en doit \u00eatre distribu\u00e9 par contribution.\nL'appelante ne peut s'approprier les parts en question, qui par la faillite de Picard sont devenues la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses cr\u00e9anciers \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne puisse \u00e9tablir qu'elle a l\u00e9galement un droit de gage sur ces m\u00eames parts.\nLe privil\u00e8ge que donne le droit de gage ne subsistant, qu'autant (art. 1900 C.C.) que le gage resee en la possession du cr\u00e9ancier, ne peut pas exister dans le cas actuel en faveur de l'appelante qui n'a jamais en. la possession des dites actions depues la date des transports faits par Picard \u00e0 la banque Ville-Marie en. 1882. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s avoir rembours\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re en 1886 que l'appelante en a obtenu lassassions, mais apr\u00e8s que l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 do Picard en eut fait passer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers. Ni la banque Ville-Marie, ni Picard, par son transport n'oirt Pu faire acqu\u00e9rir \u00e0 s l'appelante un privil\u00e8ge sur ces parts que la faillite rendait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du cr\u00e9ancier. L'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J. Cette cause nous est d'abord pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une motion des intim\u00e9s pour rejeter l'appel, parce que l'appelante aurait acquiesc\u00e9 au jugement en l'ex\u00e9cutant pour partie. Cette motion doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. L'ex\u00e9cution par la remise des livrets, f\u00fbtelee suffisante, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le procureur de l'appelante. Or, ii n'\u00e9tait pas dans les limites de son mandat, comme procureur ad lilent, lorsqu'il a agi dans cette circonstance. Et de plus, son mandat avait pris fin par le jugement final .dans la cause.\nMaintenant tant qu'au m\u00e9rite. En 1881, un nomm\u00e9 Picard, \u00e9tant propri\u00e9taire de vingt actions nominartives, acquitt\u00e9es depuis, dans le fonds social de la .Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction, pr\u00e9sente appelante, emprunta .de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame une somme de $744 sur la garantie de ces actions qu'il lui transporta par un .\u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9. Mais ii garda ses livrets, et aucun transfert r\u00e9gulier n'en fut fait dans les livres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tenus pour l'enregistrement de tels transferts. Il a m\u00eame peut-\u00eatre continu\u00e9 \u00e0 touclir les dividendes. Du moins je n'en vois aucune preuve au contrarre En 1882, Picard transporta les m\u00eames actions \u00e0 la banoue \"Ville-Miarie comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale d'avances que lui fit la banque. Ii remit ses livrets \u00e0 la banque et ce transfert fut d\u00e9ment enregistr\u00e9 au livre des transferts de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLes directeurs, n'ayant pas eu connaissance de ce transfert, quoiquil fut reguli\u00e8rement fait, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 continua \u00e0 faire des avances \u00e0 Picard, qui, par un r\u00e8glement final le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1885 reconnut lui (devoir $3,744.00, et, comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale, lui transporta de nouveau ses vingt actions, mais encore seulement par un \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9, et sans transfert r\u00e9gulier sur les lives de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ii \u00e9tait depuss longtemps un des directeuss de la compagnie, et continua \u00e0 l'etre. Le 14 novembre, 1885, Picard fut, d\u00e9ciaro en faillite. En 1887 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 remboursa \u00e0 la banque Ville-Marie le montant que lui devait Picard, sur quoi la haiaque remit \u00e0 la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 les vingt parts en question par acte authentique et par un transfert r\u00e9silier sur les livres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que ces vingt parts sont devenuss le gacre commun des creanceers de Picard. L'appelance soutient qu'elle a an privil\u00e8ge suriceless paree qu'elle en est en possession comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re gagiste.\nLa cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appelante, mais la cour d'Appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 favorable aux intim\u00e9s. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nous demande de declarerance la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qu'elle est cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Je suis d'avis qu'elle ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\nElle n'a jamais cu la possession de ces parts avant la faillite de Picard. Ces transports sous seing priv\u00e9, valables entre Picard et elle n'ont aucune valeur vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers. Et no l'a-t-elle pas elle-m\u00e9me reconnu en payant la banque Ville-Marie? Elle a non seulement laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 Picard ses livrets, mais n'a m\u00e9me pas exig\u00e9 do iui le transfert r\u00e9galier sur ses livres exit\u00e9 par la \u00e9o\u00e9 et ses propres r\u00e8glemants surtout dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des tiers. Quand Picard a failli, ces parts \u00e9taient en la possession de la banque, comne son gage; et la banque une fois payee elies sont dvenuss le gage commun des cr\u00e9anciers de Picard. La r\u00e9trocession quen a depuis laite en 1887 la banque \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut pr\u00e9judicier aux cr\u00e9anciers. Pas plus qu'une mise en possession par Picadd lui-m\u00e9me, en 1887, n'aurait Pu donner un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 Ia sodi\u00e9t\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Q'est comme si Picard avait en 1881 promis donner ses parts en gage, mais ne l'avatt fait et n'en avait mis la \u00a1soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en possession r\u00e9elle qu'en 1887, aprss sa faillite. Toute la question se resume \u00e0 celle-ci. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait-elle ces parts en gage vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, toujours, en 1885. Non, bien certainement. Elle no les a jamas eues ni en 1881, ni en 1885 vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, parce que le transfert r\u00e9gulier sur ses livres, n\u00e9cessaire, vis-\u00e0-vis eux, pour Ia mettre en possession n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avant la faillite. La cause serait la m\u00e9me, en \u00e9cartant la transaction avcc la banque, et supposant que Picard eit failli en 1882. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aurait-elle Pu alors r\u00e9clamer un privil\u00e8ge sur ces parts \u00e0 lencontre des cr\u00e9anciers de Picard. Non, parce qu'ellen'en avait pas la possession, la detention n\u00e9cessaire pour constituer le gage vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers. Onaque actionnarre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est propri\u00e9taire et en possession de ses actions. Elles peuvent Atre saisies et vendues en justice, et ii pout \u00e0 son gre los vendre, mettre en gage et ceder \u00e0 quelquo titre quo ce soit. Pardessus, Droit Commercial ([2]). Et, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pa admis elle-m\u00eame en payant la banque, quoique, quand Picard lui avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ses parts, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 e\u00fbt un \u00e9crit sons seing priv\u00e9 los lui transportant \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame. Est-ce quo si, an lieu de transporter ces parts seulement comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale, Picard los e\u00fbt vendues purement et simplement \u00e0 qui quo ce soit, et qu'un transfert r\u00e9gulier sur los livres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 eut \u00e9t\u00e9 fait a lacqu\u00e9reur de bonne foi, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pourratt contester le titre do cet acqu\u00e9reur, on r\u00e9clamer contee lui le privil\u00e8ge do gagiste? Non: la vente serait parfaitement valable, comme le transport \u00e0 la banque l'\u00e9tait. Et pourquoi? paree que Picard, malgr\u00e9 l'\u00e9crtt sous seing priv\u00e9 entre lui et la banque est, vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, rest\u00e9 en possession et ma\u00eetre absolu do ces parts. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nen a jamais eu la possession avant sa banqueroute, cons\u00e9quemment elle ne les a pas cues en gage. Et aprss la banqueroute, elle n'a Pu acqu\u00e9rir un privil\u00e8ge au pr\u00e9judice des L autres cr\u00e9anciers\nLe statut lui donne un privil\u00e8ge mais vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, il lui fallan; pour 1 exercice de ce privil\u00e8ge, se faire mettre l\u00e9galement en possession de son avage. Ce statut doit s'interpr\u00e9ter conjointement avcc le droit commun. D'ailleurs c'est comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re gagiste r que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 reclame ici.\nLa proposition tue les cr\u00e9anciers de Picard, \u00e9tant ses ayanss cause, ne peuvent avoir plus de droits que lui et que, cqns\u00e9quenment, comme Picard n'aurait pu conteser \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 son droit de cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re gagiste eux, non plus, ne peuvent le faire, est bas\u00e9e sur une erreur \u00e9vidente. Elle p\u00e9che par ses pr\u00e9misses. Les cr\u00e9anciess, sous ces; circonstances, n'agissent pas comme ayants-cause de le cir d\u00e9biteur, mais comme tiers. La jurisprudeece et Ia doctrine sont unanimes sur la question. Dans quatre cauess rapport\u00e9es danssirey, ([3]) la cour de Cassation a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nLes cr\u00e9anciers d'un i'alli ou leues syndics bien qu'ils soient les ayants-cause du failli comme substitu\u00e9s \u00e0 ses droits n'en sont pas moins des tiers comme repr\u00e9sentant Ia masse de la faillite, en taut qu'elle a des droits \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre contre les actes du failli, et notamment \u00e0 conservrr dans son aet; les valeurs qu'il en auratt fait sortir\nDans une autre cause, re Glauzel ([4]) la m\u00e9me cour d\u00e9cida que \" les cr\u00e9anciers sont recevables \u00e0 demander la nullit\u00e9 d'un nantissement consenli rar leur d\u00e9biteur sans l'observation des formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales \" Dans re V\u00e9dic ([5]), et re Langer ([6]), la m\u00e9me jurisprudence est suivie.\nCette derniere d\u00e9cision surtout est particuli\u00e8rement applicable a la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nLes cr\u00e9anciers, dit la cour, doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s non comme les ayants-cause du failli, n.ais comme des tiers vis\u2014\u00e0-vis de ceux d'entre eux qui r\u00e9clament un droit privil\u00e9gi\u00e9.

Le gage est un contrat reel et tant quele d\u00e9biteur L a conserve Ia chose en sa possession, il peut y avoir stipulation de gage, il n'y a pas de gage reel. C'est la mise en. possession qui donne naissance an droit du cr\u00e9ancier Le cr\u00e9ancier qui n'a pour lui Qu'une simple convention, sans possession, nest pas saisi, et sil nest pas saisi au moment de la faillite, il ne peut \u00eatre saisi ex post facto.

Picard being insolvent, made an abandonment of his property for the benefit of his creditors on the 14th of November 1885 under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, articles 763, &c.\nThe respondents, plaintiffs in the action, are the curators appointed under art. 768.\nPicard was a \u00a1shareholder and a director of the building society, defendants in the action and the present appellants.\nIn 1882 Picard transferred to the Banque Ville Marie twenty shares of the stock of the society to secure loans from the hank amounting to $1,550.\nHe owed money to the society at that time, amounting to about $1,000.\nA by-law of the society required that a shareholder should have satisfied all his obligations to the society before he should be at liberty to transfer his shares\nThe transfer to the bank was in violation of this by-law, but it was nade in due form, Picard inducing the secretary-treasurer to countersign it.\nPicard incurrel further debts to the society bringing up the amount he owed at the end of February, 1885, to $3,744. That amount was covered by his promissary note dated the 25th of February, 1885, payable on demand, and purporting to transfer to the society in security his shares in the capital stock, with power in case of default in payment of the note, to retain the shares or to transfer them to any person on terms and conditions agreed on with such person.\nThere had been similar notes given on the occasion of the several advances of money, which, together, made up the sum of $3744. This note was in fact a renewal of all the others. The terms of these notes may possibly have given, or have been intended to give to the society power to deal with the shares in case of default more extensive than the society would have had under its by-laws, but it is important to bear in mind that, the shares existing only under the by- laws, they had always, by virtue of the by-laws, been \u00e9 charged, as between Picard and the society, with \" Picard's obligations to the society.\nIt was not until some time after Picard's abandon-\" ment or assignment for the benefit of his creditors was made that the directors of the society other than Picard himself knew of the transfer of the stock to the bank The transfer being in due form and the bank having no knowledge of Picard's debt to, the society or of his fraud upon the society in transferring the shares without first satisfying his obligations to the society, it was of course entitled to hold the security. Therefore, on the 11th of March, 1887, the society paid to the bank the $1550 with interest and took a formal assignment of the shares and of Picard's debt\nThe claim of the society now is to hold the shares as security for that debt which claim is conceded by the respondents and also to hold them for Picard's other debt of $3,744. This latter claim is disputed by the respondents and is the subject of the present appeal.\nIt was sustained in the Superior Court by Mr. Justice Davidson, but his judgment was reversed on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 dissenting.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal is put on the ground that the twenty shares were:\u2014\nTransferred to the bank by transfers duly registeded in the transfer book of the said society, whereby the possession of the said shares passed from the said Picard to the said Bank Ville Marie with the sanction of the said society manifested by the act and signature of their secretary-treasurer, keeper of said transfer book whereby the possession of said shares passed to the said Bank Ville Marie, subject to be restored to said Picard on payment of said advances and could not, for want of possession, constitute a pledge in favour of said society by reason of any provision in their by-laws otherwise for any debt theretofore or thereafter created by said Picard towards the said society; Considering that the Tight to recover the said shares from the said bank on payment of its advances thereon, was vested in said Picard and passed to his creditors upon his insolvency;\nConsidering that lung before the eleventh of March eighteen hundred and eighty-seven the said Picard had become insolvent having on the. fourteenth day of November, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, as such insolvent, made an assignment of his estate and effects for the benefit of his creditors, and after such an insolvency, it was not competent for the said society to acquire any privilege or pledge over the said .shares to the (prejudice of the creditors of the said Picard, by paving the claim of the said Batik \"Ville Maree for the advances made by it to the said Picard, on the security of the said shares, and getting subrogated in the rights of the said bank, by transfer from the said bank to the said society made on the said eleventh March one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, other than to be reimbursed the amount thus paid, to wit, the sun of fifteen hundred and-fifty dollars and interest thereon\nNo accout seams to be taken of the circumstance that the transfer of the shares to the bank was as between Picard and the society, a fraud upon the society, but the effect of \"he transfer taken by the society from the bank whether or not it is in other respects correctly apprehended, is treated as if the society was previously a stranger to the shares and had no title to them but that acquired from the bank. The bank was innocent of the fraud, but if it had been otherwise if there had been a collusive scheme to defeat the lien which the society had upon the shares by virtue of the by-laws the fraudulent transaction could have been set aside and the bank postponed to the society. The possession on the shares would, if necessary, have been decided to the society. I say if necessary, because I do not understand that the possession was ever out of the society. The statement in the judgment is that the bank acquired possession by means of the transfer in the books of the society. No doubt that was sufficient possession, Dut it was possession of the character mentioned in the last words of article 1970 of the Civil Code, the thing pledged being in the hands of the per- son appointed by the parties to hold it, viz., the society,. and not in the hands of the creditor or the bank. As said by Laurent ([15]).\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tant d\u00e9positaire da registre formant le titre du d\u00e9biteur, elle \u00e9tait devenue, du consentement des deux parties, d\u00e9tentrice de cetitre pour les cr\u00e9anciers gagistes.\nThe bank being an innocent holder of the shares, the society could recover them only by assuming Picard's debt and paying, off the bank. in that way it in effect annulled the transfer to the bank. The effect as far as Picard was concerned, was the same as-if the transfer had been annulled by the decree of a, court or as if it had never been made, but the $1,550 had been advanced by the society itself. In the deed of transfer and subrogation from the bank it is, as a. matter of precaution, declared that the transferis made without novation of, or derogation from, the rights of the society in respect of the shares by virtue of Picard's note of the 25th of February, 1885.\nThose are the rights which the society is now asserting, not rights acquired after Picard's insolvency.\nI see no reason to doubt the power of the society to make the by-laws under which the shares of every member are charged with the payment of the claims of the society against him, and no share is transferable until the shareholder has satisfied all his obligations to the society. Those by-laws are part of the contract between the society and the shareholder.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE LOCAL JUDGE IN ADMIRALTY OF THE EXCHEQUER COURT FOR NOVA SCOTIA.\nPower of attorney\u2014Construction of\u2014Authority to settle and adjust claim\u2014Right to receive payment under.\nA crew of sailors claiming salvage from the owners of a vessel picked up at sea gave a power of attorney to P. authorizing him to bring suit or otherwise settle and adjust any claim which they might bave for salvage services, &c.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the local judge in admiralty, that P. was not authorized to receive payment of the sum awarded for salvage or to apportion the respective shares of the sailors therein.\nTaschereau J. took no part in judgment entertaining doubts as to the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal.\nAppeal from a decision of the local judge in admiralty for the district of Nova Scotia in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are thus stated by the Admiralty Judge in giving judgment:\u2014\nThis is an action for salvage by the plaintiffs, the crew of the schooner Iolanthe of Gloucester in the United States of America, against the British ship Quebec, her cargo and freight. The Quebec was abandoned at sea on the LaHave Banks off the coast of Nova Scotia on the 8th September last, and on the same day was boarded by the salvors or some of them. On boarding the vessel they found the vessel making water rapidly through two augur holes which had been bored in her side. These they plugged and stopped the leak. They then started to tow the ship to Halifax where they arrived with her on the 12th September. It is admitted that the ship was derelict and that ship and cargo were saved by the exertions of the plaintiffs. The schooner Iolanthe was owned by one Joseph O. Proctor, junior, of Gloucester, who by deed dated 14th September, 1891, authorized and empowered his father Joseph O. Proctor, senior, as his attorney \"to bring suit or otherwise settle and adjust any claim which I may have for salvage services rendered to the barque Quebec, recently brought into the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, by my said schooner Iolanthe,\" and on the 16th of the same month the master and crew of the schooner executed a power of attorney to the same Joseph O. Proctor \"for us and in our name and behalf as crew of the said schooner, to bring suit or otherwise settle and adjust any claim which we may have for salvage services rendered to the barque Quebec recently towed into the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, by said schooner Iolanthe, hereby granting unto our said attorney full power and authority in and concerning the premises as fully and effectually as we might do if personally present.\" Acting under this power of attorney Joseph O. Proctor agreed with the owner of the Quebec to accept the sum of $1,680 in lull of salvage for the ship, and that amount was paid to him by the agents of the owner on the 19th September. The salvage on the cargo was reserved for negotiation with the owners of cargo The only evidence as to the arrangement for salvage on cargo is that given in the testimony of George S Campbell of the firm of Corbett & Co., agents for the owners of the cargo. He says, \"I had several conversations with Joseph O. Proctor, senior. He brought me the powers of attorney to him at the first interview I had with him. On the authority of these papers I treated with him as to salvage of the cargo. We made a settlement on 22nd September in the forenoon; we were to pay the parties represented by Proctor $1,300 in full. This settlement was based on the supposition that the cargo was in perfect order. Proctor offered to take $1,300. We accepted subject to approval of our principals. Before that approval was obtained the power of attorney to Proctor was cancelled. The notice of cancellation to us was after the arrangement with Proctor.\" A release (Proctor, senior), was put in evidence dated the 19th September which acknowledges receipt of $650 in settlement of the claim of the owner of the schooner on the salvage of the cargo, and $46.43 for the claim of the master of the schooner on the same fund, which I assume was paid to him by Corbett & Co. The plaintiffs did not receive their money and became dissatisfied with the conduct of Proctor, and on the 22nd September they revoked and cancelled their power to Proctor, of which due notice was given to Proctor, the owner of the ship and his agents and to the agents for the owners of the cargo. Negotiations for a settlement of the plaintiffs' claims were continued but without success, and on the 8th October the ship was arrested under process from this court, an appearance was entered for the owners of the ship and cargo on the 9th October and on the 22nd October the owners of cargo paid $603.57 into court. The defendants contend that the payment to Proctor and his release and receipt for the money received by him is an answer to the plaintiffs' claim, while the plaintiffs contend: 1st. That their signatures to the power of attorney were fraudulently obtained, that they did not know the nature of the paper they were signing and that it was not read over or explained to them; and 2nd. That assuming the paper to be duly executed, it only authorized Proctor to settle and adjust the amount to be paid by the defendants, but did not authorize him to receive or them to pay to him the money payable to the plaintiffs, nor did it authorize him to adjust and settle the proportion of the salvage to be paid respectively to the owner of the schooner and the plaintiffs, and that the payment to him did not release their lien on the ship and cargo.\nThe decision of the judge was that the power of attorney did not authorize the owners of the Quebec to pay to Proctor, or Proctor to receive from them, the amount of salvage awarded and that Proctor's release of the plaintiff's claim did not prevent plaintiffs from maintaining this action. The defendants appealed.\nW. B. Ritchie for the appellants cited the following cases on the authority of Proctor under the power of attorney to receive payment: Hatch v. Hale[1]; Hawkins v. Avery[2]; New York Railway Co. v. Bates[3]; Rex v. Martin[4].\nMacCoy Q.C. and Morrison for the respondents referred to The Sylph[5]; The Sarah Jane[6].; Coondoo v. Watson[7].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the evidence very clearly shows that this man Proctor was dealing with those unfortunate seamen in a most improper and objectionable manner. They were in Halifax waiting for the salvage, without means and unable to get any reasonable information from either Proctor or the agents of the ship-owner, and Proctor having got the money, rightly or wrongly, went off with it; and I do not think the conduct of the agents of the ship is to be commended and it seems very much as if they were acting in concert with Proctor, rather than with a desire to aid the men in preventing the money reaching the hands of Proctor as they desired, though, it is true, it may be that they were influenced by the belief that Proctor was authorized to receive the money and therefore were unwilling to assist the men in any attempt to enforce the payment from the ship-owners notwithstanding the payment to Proctor.\nBe this as it may, I am not disposed to question the accuracy of the finding of the learned Chief Justice \"that the men signing the power of attorney understood what they were doing and clearly comprehended the fact that they were, by executing the instrument, delegating power to Proctor to act for them to the extent of the power as expressed by the words of the instrument,\" but I do not think they authorized or intended to authorize Proctor to settle and adjust their proportion of the salvage as between the owners of the schooner and themselves, or receive their shares and release their lien until they actually received their respective shares. Whether such was their intention or not must depend on the reasonable and fair construction of the written instrument itself. The words of this power of attorney are:\nWe, the undersigned, being all the crew of the schooner Iolanthe at the time said schooner rendered salvage services to the barque Quebec, do hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint Joseph O. Proctor our true and lawful attorney with power of substitution for us in our names and behalf as crew of the said schooner to bring suit or otherwise settle and adjust any claim which we may have for salvage services rendered to the barque Quebec recently towed into the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, by said schooner Iolanthe, hereby granting unto our said attorney full power and anthority to act in and concerning the premises as fully and effectually as we might do if personally present, and also power at his discretion to constitute and appoint from time to time as occasion may require one or more agents under him or to substitute an attorney for us in his place and the authority of all such agents or attorneys at pleasure to revoke.\nIt is for the judge to decide as a question of law on the construction of this power of attorney given by the crew to Proctor, inasmuch as the construction of written instruments is in all cases matter of law for the court. Berwick v. Horsfall[8]; Neilson v. Harford[9]. In my opinion this power of attorney must be strictly construed.\nIn Attwood v. Munnings[10] Bayley J. says:\u2014\nThe plaintiff in this case relies on the authority given by two powers of attorney which are instruments to be construed strictly.\nAnd again:\u2014\nThe words must be confined to that which is their obvious meaning. And the same case shows that the general words are not to be construed at large, but as giving general powers for the carrying into effect the special purposes for which the power of attorney was given.\nIf the power conferred must be pursued strictly and so construed in ordinary cases, how much more so in a case such as this where seamen, whose interests it is the policy of the courts of admiralty to protect, are concerned.\nNow what does the power of attorney authorize Proctor to do?\nFor us and in our name to bring suit or otherwise settle and adjust any claim which we may have for salvage services rendered to the barque Quebec, granting to our said attorney full power and authority to act in and concerning the premises as fully and effectually as we might do if personally present.\nBut not a word about the distribution of the money or receiving it or releasing or discharging the ship. It authorizes a suit to be brought which was not done, and in the event of a suit not being brought to settle and adjust any claim, &c.; that, as I read the instrument, authorized him to fix and determine the amount to be paid by the owners of ship and cargo on account of the salvage services, but having settled and adjusted the amount I can find no language in the power of attorney to authorize Proctor to receive the amount of such adjustment, and to release and discharge the lien which the law gave the seamen on the vessel and cargo until their salvage claims were paid to them. Under this power Proctor would take all necessary means of executing it with effect, that is to say, all necessary means to settle and adjust the amount as between the owners of ship and cargo and the sailors. But receiving the money and fixing the amount to be received respectively by ship-owner, captain and seamen, as between themselves, were matters entirely independent of settling and adjusting the amount between owners of cargo and sailors. If such was the intention of this instrument, prepared at the instance of Proctor, surely they should not have been asked to sign until this was clearly pointed out to them, and as their interests were in conflict with that of the ship-owner I think they should have had legal assistance. But I think the notary who drew the power of attorney clearly shows that it was intended only to apply to a settlement of the amount of the salvage claim. He says on his examination at the trial:\u2014\nI am a notary public and shipping broker at Halifax. The first thing I had to do with the Quebec was at the request of Joseph O. Proctor to prepare a power of attorney. This was on 16th September last about 10 a.m. I prepared the power of attorney. The captain and some of the crew of the Iolanthe came to my office with Proctor. Proctor brought the paper with him. The seal on the face of the paper now was then on the paper. Proctor and the captain of the schooner then brought the crew to sign this paper. Proctor explained to the crew what the nature of the instrument was. He told them it gave him the exclusive power to make all arrangements with regard to the salvage of the ship and cargo, and he would do all in his power to make the best settlement possible. I read the power of attorney over to the crew myself, and explained it to them several times. They did not all sign at the same time, but in batches. I read the paper and explained it to each batch. Every man who signed the paper in my presence had the paper read and explained to him. The men were sober as far as I could see. They were intelligent and asked questions about the paper. I read it to Seibe. He asked for an explanation. He wanted to know what the document was and what powers it gave. I explained to him that it gave full powers. He seemed to me to be sober. I told him and all of them that Proctor had full powers. There was no force or undue persuasion used in my presence.\nDon't know where the power of attorney was prepared. The paper was signed by all the men during the morning. The master of the schooner and Proctor brought them to my office. John J. Collins was the master. There wits no hesitation to sign on the part of the men. I told them they were giving Proctor absolute power to settle the salvage on ship and cargo. Joseph O. Proctor was not the owner of the Iolanthe. He told the men that he had a power of attorney from the owner of the schooner. He told the men he was the agent for the owner of the schooner. He did not say he was the owner.\nWhat are the full powers the notary referred to but to settle the amount of salvage on ship and cargo and to make the best settlement possible? No doubt payment to the attorney of plaintiff is payment to himself: this may well be, for in such a case he is employed to collect the debt and the right to receive it is necessarily incident to the duty to collect, and then again he is an officer of the court and under its control. But an agent under a power of attorney stands in a very different position; he can only do what he is expressly authorized to do. His authority is confined to the very terms of the power. Thus payment of a debt to an agent employed to sue the defendant is not payment to the plaintiff. In Yates v. Freckleton[11] \"the court were clear that an agent employed to sue is not therefore authorized to receive payment. They said it had been formerly doubted whether payment to the attorney was payment to the party, though it was now settled to be so.\"\nSTRONG J.\u2014This appeal cannot be sustained. The words of the power of attorney \"to bring suit or otherwise settle and adjust any claim which I may have for salvage services rendered to the barque Quebec\" were wholly insufficient to authorize payment to the attorney. Neither the word \"settle\" nor the word \"adjust\" implies any such authority, but they refer merely to the ascertainment of the amount due to the constituent. This is so plain that no reasoning or authority is required to demonstrate its correctness. \"Adjust\" plainly means to ascertain and in addition to the word \"settle\" being by itself insufficient to warrant payment, the principle of noscitur a sociis applies to restrict its meaning.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am not satisfied that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, and I take no part in the judgment. I refer to the Imperial Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890, 53-54 V. c. 27.\nGWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ.\u2014concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: W.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTransfer of stock\u2014Shares held in trust\u2014Duty of transferee to make inquiry.\nD. transferred to brokers as security for a loan certain shares in a joint stock company, the transfer expressing on its face that it was in trust. The brokers pledged these shares with other stock to a bank as security for advances, and from time to time transferred them to other financial companies, each transfer on its face purporting to be \u201cin trust.\u201d Eventually, the Federal Bank being the holders assigned D.\u2019s shares, and others pledged by the brokers, by a transfer signed \u201cB. manager in trust,\u201d to T. the manager of the respondent company, who accepted the transfer \u201cin trust.\u201d D. brought an action to redeem them on payment of the amount of the loan to him from the brokers.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that the form of the transfer to the loan company was sufficient to put them on inquiry as to the nature of the trust indicated, and they were only entitled to hold the shares of D. subject to payment of the amount he had borrowed on them. Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal (12 Can. S.C.R. 661; 12 App. Cas. 617) followed.\nHeld, per Taschereau and Patterson JJ., that \u201cmanager in trust\u201d on the transfer to the loan company only meant that the manager held the stock in trust for his bank, and that the transferree had a right so to regard it and was not put on the inquiry, even if such inquiry would have been possible in view of the shares not being numbered or identified in any way by which they could be traced.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Street at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff Duggan, in October, 1881, assigned to Scarth & Cochran, a firm of brokers in Toronto, 80 shares of the Toronto House Building Association as security for a loan of $1,500, and in February, 1882, he transferred to said brokers 80 other shares of the same stock as \u201cmargins\u201d in stock speculation they were carrying on for him. Both transfers were expressed on their face to be \u201cin trust.\u201d\nA few days after the second transfer Scarth & Cochran obtained advances from the Standard Bank and transferred 80 shares, which were not numbered or otherwise identified, to \u201cJohn L. Brodie, in trust, cashier,\u201d and in July, 1882, they transferred the remaining 80 shares in the same way. They afterwards shifted the loan from time to time from one bank or company to another, each transfer being made in the same way \u201cin trust,\u201d until in 1887 the shares were transferred by the Federal Bank, the then holders, to the defendants the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company, with which the brokers had negotiated a loan of some $14,000. The transfer by the bank in this case was also signed \u201cJ.O. Buchanan, manager, in trust,\u201d and was made to \u201cJames Turnbull, in trust,\u201d Turnbull being the manager of the defendant company. Prior to this transfer the name of the Toronto House Building Association had been changed to that of the Land Security Company and a new allotment of shares had been made which had been taken up by the Federal Bank at the request of the brokers, and the transfer to the defendant company consisted of 160 shares of old and 638 shares of new stock.\nAfter this transfer Duggan demanded from the defendant company a re-transfer of his stock and tendered an amount sufficient to cover what he owed the brokers Scarth & Cochran. The company refused to recognize him in the matter and claimed to hold the stock for their advances to the brokers and they finally sold the stock. Duggan thereupon brought an action against the company and Turnbull their manager for a declaration that they could only hold the stock for the amount due by him to the brokers and asking for an account of the full value of the shares and of the defendants\u2019 dealings with them.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Street who gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff, holding that the form of the transfer was such as to put defendants on inquiry and that they could not hold the stock for more than plaintiff owed the brokers. This decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal and the plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Kerr Q.C. for the appellant. Shares may be pledged as any other personal property. Donald v. Suckling[3].\nThe owner\u2019s title cannot be affected by the mode in which the shares are transferred any more than some informality in registration can affect the validity of a deed. See Cole v. The North-western Bank[4]; Williams v. The Colonial Bank[5].\nAs to what a pledgee may do see Donald v. Suckling3; Story on Bailments[6]; Campbell on Sales[7].\nIf the respondents claim to be transferees without notice they must establish the fact. The evidence brings them within the decision in Earl of Sheffield v. London Joint Stock Bank[8]; Simmons v. London Joint Stock Bank[9]. See also Williams v. The Colonia Bank5. As to the intention of the parties in the transaction between Duggan and Scarth & Cochran see Bradford Banking Co. v. Briggs[10].\nThe learned counsel also referred to Shaw v. Spencer[11]; Muir v. Carter[12]; Raphael v. McFarlane[13]; Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny[14].\nE. Blake Q.C. and Howland for the respondents. In Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny14 the bank dealt with a person who on the face of the instrument was a trustee for some person undisclosed. In this case the only fact brought to the knowledge of the respondents was that the transfer to them was signed \u201cmanager in trust.\u201d That reasonably meant in trust for the bank of which he was manager.\nIf a buyer of stock is obliged to make an inquiry in a case of this kind, in which inquiry he is liable to be met with false statements and evasions, there would be an end of buying and selling stocks as no one would be safe in investing money in them.\nThe respondents acquired an absolute title to the shares subject to redemption on payment of the advance made on them. Briggs v. Massey[15].\nR.S.O. (1887) ch. 128 is an act similar to the Factors Act in England, and sections 1,10 and 11 apply to this transaction and are a complete bar to the relief sought by the appellant. See Williams v. The Colonial Bank[16] and City Bank v. Barrow[17].\nThe respondents took shares without notice and the appellant must show some equitable ground upon which they should be re-transferred. Burkinshaw v. Nicolls[18]. Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I entirely agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Street in this case and think this appeal should be allowed and his judgment restored. I think that where stock is transferred in trust, and that fact appears on the face of the transfer, it is it is the bounden duty of all or any parties to whom the said stock is about to be transferred to make all reasonable inquiries and proper investigation as to the nature of the trust on which the transfer has been made, and had that been done in this case I cannot escape the conclusion that the nature of the trust to Scarth & Cochran would have been discovered, and that Scarth & Cochran never had more than a qualified interest in the shares in question; and this duty of making inquiries was not only on those who took these shares from Scarth & Cochran but on all subsequent transferees, all these transfers having been made for the benefit of Scarth & Cochran in trust. I think the defendants had such information as made it not only reasonable and proper, but their duty, to make inquiry into the origin of the title and all intermediate transfers, more particularly as the transaction was in fact between the defendants and Cochran, and had such inquiries been honestly made with a view of discovering the true position of the stock it is to be presumed correct information would have been given. It would have resulted in a discovery of the true facts, and as no such inquiry was made it is no answer to say that had the inquiry been made they might have been met by false or misleading information.\nI entirely repudiate the doctrine, as I did in The Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny[19], approved of by the Privy Council[20], that banks or any others can, after their attention is called by the transfer itself to the fact that the stock is held in trust, blindly and without inquiry accept transfers of such stock and so deprive the cestui que trust of his property.\nThe money throughout was all advanced, by each and every one through whom the stock passed, for and to Scarth or Scarth & Cochran. In fact all dealings in reference thereto, including the defendants\u2019, were with Cochran. A simple inquiry from Cochran would have elicited a development of all the facts connected with the shares. Cochran having actually made the transfers to Turnbull for the defendants, as Mr. Turnbull says, \u201cwe made no inquiry, we did not think it necessary. It might belong to him or somebody else we did not know;\u201d and I think he might have added, \u201cWe did not care.\u201d\nWhen the transferees find on the books of the company that the shares are held in trust then, in my opinion, arises the duty to inquire.\nI think this case does not come within the Factors Act\nThe case to which our attention has been called of Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[21] has no application whatever to this case. There the instrument was negotiable and there was nothing in connection with it to put any parties on inquiry. It was the case of a bond payable to vendor and a negotiable security of which plaintiffs were bon\u00e2 fide holders who received it for value in good faith and without knowledge of want of title in its predecessor, and without anything in connection therewith to put the holder on inquiry, and it entirely differs in its state of facts from those which this case presents.\nSTRONG J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal and hold that the appellant cannot recover against the respondents. The case of Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal[22] is not applicable. I adopt the reasoning of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action was brought to redeem certain shares in the stock of an incorporated company called the Landed Security Company which the plaintiff, as was alleged, had about ten years ago transferred to the defendants William B. Scarth and Robert Cochran, then carrying on business in partnership in the city of Toronto as stock brokers and money brokers, upon certain trusts and by way of security for certain advances made by them to him, and which shares by divers mesne assignments from them had been transferred to the defendants the Canadian Loan and Agency Company, of which company, at the time of their becoming possessed of the shares, the defendant Turnbull was manager. The learned judge before whom the case was tried rendered judgment for the plaintiff against all the defendants. His decree was that:\nThe defendants do pay to the plaintiff the value of the one hundred and sixty shares of stock of the Landed Security Company less the balance remaining due by the plaintiff of the debt due by him to the firm of Scarth & Cochran at the time of its dissolution, and that the within named defendants other than defendant Scarth do also pay to the plaintiff the value of the six hundred and thirty-eight shares of the said stock less the balance due by the defendant Cochran in respect of their dealings subsequent to the dissolution of the said firm; the value of the shares in each case to be taken at their market value between the 15th December, 1887, the date of the plaintiff\u2019s tender to the defendants the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company, and the 8th March, 1890.\nAnd it was by the said decree referred to a referee to ascertain such value and to take the necessary accounts. From this judgment the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company and the defendant Turn-bull appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario; that court allowed their appeal and from the judgment of that court this appeal is brought by the plaintiff. Although the judgment of Mr. Justice Street remains unimpeached against the defendants Scarth and Cochran respectively, it will be necessary to enter into a consideration of the transaction from its initiation between Duggan and Scarth & Cochran in order to the determination of the question raised by the appeal as to the liability of the defendants, the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company, to the plaintiff.\nIn 1881 the appellant was possessed as absolute owner of 160 fully paid up shares in the capital stock of a company incorporated by an act of the legislature of the province of Ontario under the name of \u201cThe Toronto House Building Association,\u201d which name was subsequently by another act of the legislature changed to \u201cThe Landed Security Company.\u201d By the act of incorporation of the above company it was enacted that the stock of the company should be deemed to be personalty and should be assignable, but that on transfer of any share should be valid until entered in the books of the company according to such forms as the directors might from time to time appoint. The directors accordingly opened a book in which all transfers should be made in a form adopted by the directors and printed in the book which was called the transfer book.\nThe act of incorporation did not require the company to issue, and there is no evidence that they ever did issue, any certificates of ownership of shares in the company. An owner of shares in the company had no means, so far as appeared at least, of evidencing his title to shares in the company except by reference to the books of the company which contained the only evidence of any person being a proprietor of shares in the company, whether he was such by original allotment by the directors or by transfer from an original allottee. Being so possessed of the above 160 shares the appellant applied to the defendants Scarth & Cochran, then carrying on the business of stock brokers and money lenders in partnership, for a loan of $1,500. The negotiation for such loan was made and completed with the defendant Cochran, and it was agreed that the appellant should transfer to the defendants Scarth & Cochran 80 of the said shares as security for such loan. To perfect this transaction the appellant on the 26th day of October, 1881, went to the office of the company and had the printed form of transfer in the books of the company filled up and signed the same, which when so filled up and signed was as follows:\u2014\nFor value received I, Edmund H. Duggan, of Toronto, do hereby assign and transfer unto W.B. Scarth and Robert Cochran in trust of Toronto, eighty (80) shares in the stock of the funds of the Toronto House Building Association of Toronto, numbered in the books of the association as shares No.\u2014on which has been paid the sum of two thousand dollars subject to the provisions of the act of Parliament authorising the incorporation of the association and the by-laws, rules and regulations thereof already passed or hereafter to be passed in accordance therewith.\nWitness my hand at the office of the association this 26th day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one.\n(Sgd.)E.H. DUGGAN.\nOn the following day, on the 27th October, 1881, the defendants Scarth & Cochran signed an acceptance of the above transfer at the foot of the transfer in the books of the company as follows:\nI hereby accept the foregoing transfer of eighty (80) shares of the stock of the Toronto House Building Association on the conditions and subject to the provisions above mentioned.\n(Sgd.)\nW.B. SCARTH,\nIn trust.\n\u201d\nROBERT COCHRAN, It does not appear what was the time, if any was named, for repayment of the loan and in the absence of a time fixed by agreement of the parties we must take it to have been repayable upon notice being given to the appellant demanding repayment, and there is no suggestion that any such demand ever was made. It was not disputed that the transfer of the shares was to be solely as security for repayment of the loan, or that the agreement upon which the loan was effected was that the transferees of the shares should have power, in the event of default in repayment of the loan, to sell the shares or so many thereof as might be necessary to realize repayment of the loan with interest, and that they should pay or transfer to the appellant any surplus of money or of shares which might remain after such repayment. Upon the transfer of the eighty shares to the defendants Scarth & Cochran in trust as expressed in the instrument of transfer the loan was made, and there does not appear on the evidence to have been any default committed by the appellant so as to have given any occasion for the exercise of the transferees\u2019 power of sale of the shares. In the month of February, 1882, the appellant entered into a further agreement with the defendants Scarth & Cochran, namely, that they should in their capacity of stock brokers purchase shares for him on margin, as it is called, in the Hudson Bay Company and Canada N.W. Land Company upon the security of divers other shares then held by the appellant in different companies, such shares when transferred by the defendants Scarth & Cochran to be held by them as collateral security merely for any balance that upon an account taken between them and the appellant should become due to them by the appellant upon the purchase of said shares in the said Hudson Bay Company, and in the said Canada N.W. Land Company; accordingly in pursuance of such agreement among other shares transferred to the defendants Scarth & Cochran by the appellant he, upon the 20th day of February, 1882, transferred to them eighty other fully paid up shares in the said Toronto House Building Association by an instrument duly filled up and signed by him in the transfer book of the said association, which instrument so signed is as follows:\u2014\nFor value, received I, Edmund Henry Duggan, of Toronto, Esquire, do hereby assign and transfer unto Messrs. Scarth & Cochran Brokers, of Toronto, in trust, eighty shares in the stock of the funds of the Toronto House-building Association of Toronto, numbered in the books of the association as shares No. , on which has been paid the sum of two thousand dollars, subject to the provisions of the Act of Parliament authorizing the incorporation of the company, and the by-laws, rules and regulations thereof already passed or hereafter to be passed in accordance therewith. Witness my hand at the office of the association this 20th day of February, 1882.\n(Sgd.)E.H. DUGGAN.\nAnd on the 22nd day of the said month of February, the defendants Scarth & Cochran accepted the above by a note at the foot of the said transfer in the transfer book of the said association as follows:\nI hereby accept the foregoing transfer of eighty shares of the Toronto House Building Association, on the conditions and subject to the provisions above mentioned. Dated this 22nd day of February, 1882.\n(Sgd.)SCARTH, COCHRAN & Co.\nNow that the defendants Scarth & Cochran held these last-mentioned shares solely upon trust cannot, I apprehend, admit of a doubt, and that such trust was that the shares so transferred by the appellant in trust should be held by the transferees only as collateral security to await the result of the transaction entered into by the appellant through them as brokers in the purchase on margin for the appellant of shares in the Hudson Bay Company, and in the Canada N.W. Land Company; and that this was well understood by the defendants Scarth & Cochran fully appears by the accounts rendered by them from time to time to the appellant, wherein also it appears that they themselves transferred to the like account and acknowledged themselves to hold the eighty shares trans- ferred to them in security for the $1,500 loan upon the like trust as the shares transferred in February, 1882, namely, as collateral security only to await the result of the said purchases as margin. In the month of October, 1882, in an account then rendered by them to the appellant of shares purchased for him in the Hudson Bay Company and in the Canada N.W. Land Company they acknowledge themselves to then hold as stocks of the appellant held as margin the following shares:\n50 Building and Loan\n$ 1,250\n80 Land Security\n2,100\n80 do do\n6,600\n$ 9,950\n80 British Am. As. Co.\nOn. the 2nd February, 1883, they charge the appellant in account with him in respect of the purchases on margin with $1,610.33 which appears by the evidence to be the amount of the loan of $1,500 obtained in October, 1881; and in an account rendered by them on the 31st January, 1886, they bring in the appellant their debtor in the sum of $3,751.14, for which they still acknowledge themselves to hold as \u201ccollateral\u201d the 160 shares landed security and 50 shares Building and Loan. On the 6th March, 1886, they charge the appellant with $1,487.50 paid by them for him for new shares, to which the appellant became entitled in the Landed Security Company as holder of the old 160 shares in Toronto Building Association, and on the 30th September, 1886, the defendant Robert Cochran renders to the appellant an account of everything from the beginning in his Robert Cochran\u2019s own name, and not in the names of Scarth & Cochran in which account, including the amount changed on March the 6th as paid for new shares accrued to the appellant in the Landed Security Company the appellant is brought in debtor in the sum of $5,142.94, and between that date and the 1st of July, 1887, the appellant is debited with other large sums of money as paid on account of other new shares in the Landed Security Company as accruing to him in right of the old 160 shares in the Toronto Building Association, such new shares in the whole amounting to 638, and during all this time Scarth & Cochran and Robert Cochran in the accounts rendered on the 30th September, 1886, and subsequently thereto, give the appellant credit for the dividends at the 160 old shares and the 638 new shares regularly as they became due and payable. Now under these circumstances there can be no doubt that the defendants Scarth & Cochran held the appellant\u2019s shares in the Landed Security Company, both the old and the new shares which accrued in right of the old, upon trust only as security for the balance of their account on their transactions with the appellant; neither can there, I think, be any doubt that the words \u201cin trust\u201d as inserted by the appellant in the instrument which he signed transferring the legal interest in the shares so transferred must be read as having been inserted by the appellant for the purpose of securing himself in the event of any breach, by the defendants Scarth & Cochran of the trust condition subject to which they held the shares, and in the reasonable expectation that any person accepting a transfer of the shares from them would be put upon inquiry as to the nature of the trust. That the defendants Scarth & Cochran committed a palpable breach of the trust condition subject to which they held the shares cannot admit of doubt, and the only question before us is whether under the circumstances appearing in evidence the Canadian Loan and Agency Company are to be affected by that trust or can they hold the shares which they acknowledge they acquired in virtue only of their contract with Cochran free from all obligation to the appellant in respect of shares which Scarth & Cochran held from him subject to a trust condition in his favour, or in the words of Lord Bramwell in The Earl of Sheffield v. The London Joint Slock Bank[23], whether under the circumstances appearing the defendants, The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company, must not be held to have had notice of such facts and matters as made it reasonable that inquiry should have been made by them into Cochran\u2019s title to deal with the shares as his own. The evidence bearing upon this point is that upon the 7th September, 1887, Cochran applied to the company through their manager and agent, the defendant Turnbull, for a loan of $14,300 upon the security of 160 old shares and 638 new shares of the Landed Security Company of which he represented himself to be the owner. Mr. Turnbull knew Cochran to be a stock broker and had had previous dealing with him as such; he did not, he says, consider whether the shares were Cochran\u2019s own or shares belonging to his clients; Cochran represented them to be his own and Turnbull dealt with him as the owner upon such representation; thereupon Turn-bull, on the behalf of his company, came to an agreement with Cochran to lend him the $14,300 upon the terms set forth in a deed of hypothecation which upon the transfer of the shares being effected as hereinafter mentioned Cochran executed under his hand and seal, and which as so executed is as follows:\nIn consideration of fourteen thousand three hundred dollars this day advanced by the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Com- pany (limited), I have deposited with the said company as security the following shares, viz., one hundred and sixty shares of fully paid up Landed Security Company, say, $4,000, and six hundred and thirty-eight shares of 20 per cent paid Landed Security Company, say $3,190, and covenant and agree to repay the said advance to the said company in three months with interest thereon until repaid at the rate of six and one-half per cent per annum, at their head office in Toronto, and in default thereof, but without prejudice to the company to recover on the said covenant, hereby authorize the company to sell the said shares without notice in such manner, and either by public or private sale, as they may see fit, the net proceeds to be applied to the payment of the said advance and interest, and the surplus, if any, to be accounted for to the undersigned. In case of deficiency I promise to pay to the company the amount thereof forthwith thereafter with interest thereon as aforesaid. If at any time the said shares should be quoted in the ordinary newspaper reports at a price under 220 per cent respectively on the nominal par value of such shares I undertake to make good to the company on demand forthwith the difference between the value of the said shares at the price above mentioned and at such reduced quotations, in default whereof the company are to be entitled to claim payment at once of the full amount of the said loan with interest thereon as aforesaid, and in case of non-payment to be at liberty to sell the said shares as above mentioned, and the company are not in any case to be liable for any loss arising from any sale of said shares. In the event of the undersigned having any other loan or loans from the said company the margin of which is insufficient, or in which any deficiency may exist under their respective terms, the company shall not be bound to release the securities hereby deposited until such insufficiency of margin or deficiency shall be made good; and in the event of any sale of the above securities under the powers granted to the company hereunder the company may apply any surplus that may remain in satisfaction, of any claim which they may have against the undersigned in respect of any other loan or loans under the respective provisions thereof. Any demand or notice which the company may think necessary to make or give is to be held sufficient if mailed to the persons so to be notified at their usual post office address or left at their usual place of business, but it is not to be obligatory on the company to make or give any such demand or notice.\nDated at Toronto this 7th day of September, 1887.\n(Sgd.)ROBT. COCHRAN.SEAL.\nThe terms of loan having been agreed upon Cochran and Turnbull went to the office of the Landed Security Company and there Cochran produced a power of attorney bearing date the same 7th day of September, executed in his favour by one James Oliver Buchanan as manager of the Federal Bank, of which bank he then was manager, which power of attorney was in the words following:\nKnow all men by these presents that I, James Oliver Buchanan, Manager in trust, of Toronto, hereby nominate and appoint Robert Cochran, broker, of Toronto, my true and lawful attorney for me and in my name to transfer one hundred and sixty fully paid up shares and six hundred and thirty-eight 20p.c. paid up shares in the stock of the Land Security Company, and as my act and deed to execute all covenants and agreements required to be executed by members subscribing for unadvanced shares and I hereby agree to ratify and confirm whatever my said attorney shall lawfully do in the premises by virtue hereof.\nWitness my hand and seal this 7th day of Sept., 1887.\n(Sgd.)J.O. BUCHANAN,SEAL.\nManager in trust.\nThereupon Cochran under and in virtue of the said power of attorney executed, in the transfer book of the Landed Security Company, two several instruments of transfer of shares which the said London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company through their manager and agent accepted (for that appears to me the effect of the transaction) and which instruments of transfer and acceptances thereof are as follows:\n1st. For value received I, J.O. Buchanan, manager in trust, do hereby assign and transfer unto James Turnbull in trust, one hundred and sixty old shares in the stock of the funds of the Land Security Company of Toronto numbered in the books of the company as shares No. ____, on which has been paid the sum of four thousand dollars ($4000) subject to the provisions of the Act of Parliament authorising the incorporation of the company, and the by-laws, rules and regulations thereof already passed or hereafter to be passed in accordance therewith. Witness my hand at the office of the company this 7th day of September, 1887.\nJ.O. BUCHANAN,\nManager, in trust.\nPer ROBERT COCHRAN,\nHis Attorney. I hereby accept the foregoing transfer of one hundred and sixty (160) old shares of the stock of the Land Security Company at the conditions and subject to the provisions above mentioned.\nDated this 7th day of September, A.D. 1887.\nJAMES TURNBULL,\nIn trust.\n2nd. For value received I, J.O. Buchanan, manager in trust, of Toronto, do hereby assign and transfer unto James Turnbull, in trust, six hundred and thirty-eight (638) new shares in the stock of the funds of the Land Security Company, of Toronto, numbered in the books of the company as shares No. ____, on which has been paid the sum of $3,190, thirty-one hundred and ninety dollars, subject to the provisions of the act of parliament authorizing the incorporation of the company, and the by-laws, rules and regulations thereof already passed or hereafter to be passed in accordance therewith.\nWitness my hand at the office of the company this 7th day of September, 1887.\nJ.O. BUCHANAN,\nManager, in trust.\nPer ROBERT COCHRAN,\nHis Attorney.\nI hereby accept the foregoing transfer of six hundred and thirty-eight (638) shares of the stock of the Land Security Company on the conditions and subject to the provisions above mentioned. Dated this 7th day of September, A.D. 1887.\nJ. TURNBULL,\nIn trust.\nNow the manager of the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company having thus accepted these transfers to give effect to the terms of the hypothecation deed above set out in full, and by way of security for the loan then made by the company to Cochran, the company through their manager had notice that the shares which Cochran had offered to the company as security for the loan he was negotiating with them for, and of which shares he had represented himself to be the owner, did not belong to him, but were in truth the property of the Federal Bank, held for them in the books of the Land Security Company in the name of their manager, J.O. Buchanan. Mr. Turnbull not- withstanding never asked Cochran for any explanation of this discrepancy between his statement as to the ownership of the shares, and his transferring them as the property of the bank who appear to have held them in the name of their manager subject to some trust and under a power of attorney given to him, Cochran, by the bank\u2019s manager. He says:\nWe, that is the company, made no inquiries as to the title to the stock. We believed the stock might belong to him (Cochran) or it might belong to some body else. We did not know and of course, in the absence of any thing to the contrary, we assumed it to belong to him.\nAgain:\nWe did not think it necessary to inquire whether he was the owner or not the owner. We did not think it was any part of our business.\nBut he had notice by the transfers that Cochran was not the owner and that the Federal Bank were, yet he made no inquiries. The transfers having been executed by the manager of the bank with the words \u201cmanager in trust\u201d added to his name, the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company and their manager were, I think, put upon inquiry whether there was any, and if any what, trust attached to the shares and what was the nature of the bank\u2019s title. We see that if the manager of the London and Canadian Loan and Agency had made inquiry of Cochran or the bank, he must have learned that the title which the Federal Bank had was derived from the Standard Bank and the Home Savings and Loan Company, which institutions also held the shares transferred by them respectively subject to some trust, and that they severally derived title from the Merchants Bank who also held the shares subject to some trust and acquired title from the defendants Scarth & Cochran, who claimed title only under transfers executed by the appellant to them, which transfers expressly stated that the shares were only transferred by the appellant to them on some trust. They would then have learned that Cochran alone had never any title to the shares, and that the defendants Scarth & Cochran held them only as trustees and subject to a trust imposed by the appellant the nature of which he could explain. If the Loan Company and their agent Turnbull abstained from inquiry as to the nature of the trust from a conception formed in the mind of their manager that the words \u201cin trust\u201d and \u201cmanager in trust,\u201d as used in the instruments of transfer from the Federal Bank had a meaning more limited than upon inquiry might prove to be correct, they must abide the consequences of their misconception. Cochran produced no certificate of ownership or any other document evidencing his ownership of the shares. It does not appear that any document ever had been in existence evidencing any title to the shares in him other than the instrument of transfer to Scarth & Cochran in trust, executed by the appellant; the case was not that of one offering a pledge of his evidence of title to the shares as the owner but it was the case of one dealing with shares as owner, but offering no evidence whatever of ownership, and the persons making him a loan upon the security of the shares having notice by the transfer which they accepted that he was not the owner but that the Federal Bank who held them upon some trust were. Under these circumstances the Loan and Agency Company were, in my opinion, put upon inquiry into the nature of Cochran\u2019s title to the shares and his right to deal with them and such inquiry must have led them to the knowledge that he never had any right to deal with them to any greater extent than the amount of the appellant\u2019s liability to the defendants Scarth & Cochran from whom the loan company\u2019s title to the shares is traced. Having made no inquiry into the nature of the title of the persons with whom they dealt for the shares it is but reasonable that they should take subject to the trust to which he was subjected by the instrument of transfer which constituted his sole title. This is the principle involved in Shaw v. Spencer[24] which, in my opinion, enunciates sound law. It cannot be said that the appellant enabled Scarth & Cochran or either of them to commit the fraudulent breach of trust which they have committed to the appellant\u2019s prejudice when be declared on the face of the instrument transferring the title to them that it was to them as trustees that the shares were transferred. If the contention of the respondent should prevail under the circumstances appearing in the present case it must equally prevail although the instrument of transfer executed by the appellant should have set out in the most precise terms the trust purposes upon and subject to which the transfer of the shares was made. If we should hold that the London and Canadian Loan Company were not under the circumstances appearing in the present case put upon inquiry into the nature of the title they were acquiring through their agreement with Cochran, I can see no possible mode by which an owner of shares in the company could transfer them to trustees upon trust in favour of the transferrer if the statement in the deed of transfer that the transfer is made to the transferees in trust is not sufficient to put all persons dealing with such transferee who at least as in the present case produces no document whatever evidencing his title upon inquiry as to the nature of his title. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Street be restored.PATTERSON J.\u2014The learned judges who delivered their opinions in the court below have ably and ex- haustively explained the grounds on which the judgment is based. I think we should affirm the judgment upon the same grounds. Great reliance was placed in support of the appeal upon the case of The Earl of Sheffield v. London Joint Stock Bank[25] before the House of Lords, and Simmons v. London Joint Stock Bank[26] before the Court of Appeal, but the view taken of those cases in the court below is borne out by the recent decision of the House of Lords in the latter case[27] reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal and explaining the effect of the judgment in the Earl of Sheffield\u2019s Case[28].\nThe defendant company, through the defendant Turnbull who was assistant manager of the company, took a transfer of the shares in question from J.O. Buchanan, the manager of the Federal Bank, as security for money lent by the company to Cochran. Mr. Buchanan had held the shares on behalf of his bank as security for money lent to Cochran. Some of the shares had been transferred to him on the books of the company by previous holders, and some were new stock allotted to him as the holder of the older shares. In each case the transfer or allotment was to \u201cJ.O. Buchanan, manager, in trust.\u201d He transferred the shares to Turnbull by a document which described him as \u201cJ.O. Buchanan, manager, in trust,\u201d and was signed \u201cJ.O. Buchanan, manager in trust, per Robt. Cochran his attorney,\u201d transferring the shares to \u201cJames Turnbull, in trust.\u201d\nThe argument has turned to a great extent on the force to be attributed to these words \u201cin trust.\u201d In two or three cases which came to this court from the province of Quebec, the leading case being Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal[29] which went to the Privy Council[30], the term was Held to convey an intimation that the property was held on behalf of a cestui que trust and to call for inquiry by one dealing with the nominal holder as to who was the cestui que trust, and the title was read just as if, instead of stopping at the word \u201ctrust,\u201d it had gone on to say \u201cin trust for so and so.\u201d Now suppose the extended form of expression had been used in the transfers to Buchanan and to Turnbull. It would be \u201cBuchanan in trust for the Federal Bank\u201d and \u201cTurnbull in trust for the Land Security Company.\u201d That was what was meant and what the parties all understood. The transfers might as well, except for the form which was adopted for convenience sake, have been direct to the bank and to the company. Whether Turnbull or his company found the Federal Bank recognized on the books of the Land Security Company as the absolute holder of the shares, or found that they were held by Buchanan on behalf of the bank, I find no authority for holding that there was a duty to carry any inquiry into the title farther back. The existence of such a duty can be contended for only, as it appears to me, by attributing to those words \u201cin trust\u201d a meaning that was not intended by the persons who wrote them and which they would not naturally convey to a person reading together the associated words \u201cJ.O. Buchanan manager in trust.\u201d Buchanan would naturally be understood, as Turnbull understood from the document without further inquiry, to hold as manager in trust for his bank. That is the extent of the notice conveyed by the words, and there is nothing to suggest that the legal estate which passed by the transfer may be subject to any equities as against the bank.\nThere might, as I apprehend, be serious practical difficulties in the way of tracing back the title to shares which have nothing in the way of numbers or certificates by which they may be identified, but which are transferred only in the books of the company. The possibility of this may be a reason for caution before acceding to the general proposition on which the action is founded. But however this may be I am not satisfied that the inquiry, if carried back in the present case, would compel the result for which the appellant contends. We should find, it is true, one or two instances in which the words \u201cin trust\u201d may be less distinct in their application than in the case of Buchanan. Thus we find 45 shares once transferred as security for a loan to the Home Savings and Loan Company in trust, not to an officer of the company, and we find that while the plaintiff\u2019s first transfer of 80 shares to Scarth & Cochran in trust was to secure a loan from a company of which they were managers, his second transfer of 80 shares to \u201cScarth & Cochran, brokers in trust,\u201d was as collateral security on another transaction and not in respect of a loan effected at the time. The use of the words \u201cin trust,\u201d may in these two instances be capable of some explanation that does not now call for close examination, possibly, in the case of the Home Company, that the transfer which was from \u201cWm. Cooke, cashier in trust,\u201d was upon a printed form similar to that on which Mr. Cooke on the same day transferred 235 shares to \u201cH.S. Strathy, cashier in trust,\u201d\u2014forms seemingly prepared for transfers to individual officers and not to corporations\u2014and in the case of the second 80 shares there may be the same or some other way of accounting for the use of the words. The question would be whether the words implied a declaration of trust in favour of the plaintiff, or would properly be so understood. It is undeniable that, as between the plaintiff and Scarth & Cochran, the plaintiff\u2019s right to redeem his stock in no way depended on those words. It may be easily assumed that if those parties had intended to say that the transfer was by way of pledge or mortgage they would have said so. In place of that they use an expression which appears to be not unusual in these transactions where one lending money for another, whether as broker or manager of a bank or a loan company, takes security in his own name, and which in that situation is an apt expression. We may further note that whatever difference, if any, there may have been in the two transfers of 80 shares each, yet the whole 160 original shares together with the 638 new shares would seem to have been afterwards regarded by the plaintiff as on exactly the same footing The decision of the appeal does not, in my view, turn upon this topic. I allude to it chiefly for the purpose of expressing my doubts of the ability of the plaintiff to sustain his claim even if it were to be held that the respondents ought to have inquired further into the history of the shares.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs[31].\nSolicitors for appellant: Kerr, McDonald, Davidson, & Patterson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Howland, Arnoldi & Bristol.\n[1] 18 Ont.

In an action against the city for damages it was shown that there was a space of seven or eight feet between the hydrant and the inner line of the sidewalk, and that L. was aware of the position of the hydrant and accustomed to walk on said street. The statutes respecting the government of the city do not oblige the council to keep the streets lighted but authorize them to enter into contracts for that purpose. At the time of this accident the city was lighted by electricity by a company who had contracted with the corporation therefor. Evidence was given to show that it was not possible to prevent a single lamp or a batch of lamps going out at times.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Strong and Taschereau JJ. dissenting, that the city was not liable; that the corporation being under no statutory duty to light the streets the relation between it and the contractors was not that of master and servant, or principal and agent, but that of employer and independent contractors, and the corporation was not liable for negligence in the performance of the service; that the position of the hydrant was not in itself evidence of negligence in the corporation and that L. could have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts presented to the court on this appeal sufficiently appear from the above head-note and from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne. MacCoy Q.C. for the appellant. As to the general liability of a corporation for negligence see McCafferty v. Spuyten Duyvil, &c., Railway Co.[1]; Chicago v. Starr[2].\nThe statement of claim does not show any cause of action against the city. Rounds v. Stratford[3]; Soule v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[4].\nDrysdale for the respondent, referred to Carty v. City of London[5].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I agree in all respects with the judgment of Mr. Justice Graham before whom this action was tried. The hydrant was an obstruction placed in the public highway, the sidewalk being, of course, part of the highway. I do not say that the city had not power to maintain the hydrant within the limits of the sidewalk, or that it was guilty of a nuisance in so maintaining it.\nMy opinion proceeds upon this, that in exercising statutory powers the city was bound to exercise due diligence and to proceed without negligence. This is a general principle of law well and authoritatively laid down in Lord Blackburn's judgment in the case of Geddis v. Proprietors of Bann Reservoir[6] cited in the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher. It therefore becomes a question of fact whether the appellants were guilty of negligence in maintaining this hydrant within the limit of the way for foot passengers in a street lighted only by an uncertain mode of illumination, such as the electric light described in the evidence, and I am of opinion that on this question of fact the learned judge who tried the action rightly found for the plaintiff. The question of the cost of removing the hydrant outside the sidewalk is no element in the case; the paramount duty was that of caring for the safety of the public using the street, and this, as a judge of fact and speaking from the evidence, I hold was not properly provided for.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I dissent. I have come to the conclusion that the city is liable for negligently and improperly placing an iron hydrant on the sidewalk on Barrington street in such a position as to be dangerous to persons lawfully using that street, and wrongfully and negligently keeping and continuing such hydrant in that position. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff's right of action in her statement of claim is rested upon the following grounds, namely, that Barrington street is a street in the city of Halifax, owned by and in possession of and under the control and management of the defendants; that the night of the 28th August, 1889, was dark, and that the lights provided for lighting the said street were so negligently and improperly managed, and the machinery provided therefor was so inadequate and inefficient, that the said lights so provided were not lit on said night and did not afford any light; that the defendants had notice and knowledge for a long time previous to said night that said lights provided for lighting said street were negligently and improperly managed, and that the machinery provided therefor was inadequate and inefficient, and that the lights in the said street were very frequently not lighted, and that the said street was very frequently entirely without light and left in total darkness; that the defendants had long prior to said 28th day of August negligently and improperly placed an iron hydrant on the sidewalk on Barrington street aforesaid in such a position as to be dangerous to persons lawfully using said street, and the defendants wrongfully and negligently kept and continued said hydrant in said position; and that the plaintiff on the night of the said 28th of August, and while Barrington street aforesaid was in total darkness, was lawfully walking along the said sidewalk, and in consequence of the said street not being properly lighted and the said hydrant being so improperly placed and continued on said sidewalk the plaintiff fell over the said hydrant and was bruised and seriously injured, &c. The question now is whether there was any evidence to support the judgment for the plaintiff which was rendered by the learned judge who tried the case, and I am of opinion that there was not. With the unanimous judgment of the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the maintaining the hydrant complained of in the place where it was lawfully erected upwards of twenty years ago constituted no evidence of negligence upon the part of the defendants as to the hydrant, I entirely concur.\nThen as to the charge of negligence in the alleged defect in the lighting of Barrington street on the night in question. The city of Halifax was first incorporated by the provincial statute, chapter 55 of the statutes of 1841. That statute not only did not impose any obligation or duty upon the city to light the streets, but it did not make any provision empowering the city to raise funds necessary for that purpose. Provision had been made by the legislature for lighting the town of Halifax before its incorporation as a city by an act of the legislature, ch. 16 of the statutes of 1840, which incorporated a company under the name of the Gas Light and Water Company, which act was amended by an act of the Nova Scotia Legislature in ch. 72 of the statutes of 1844, whereby the powers of the said company to supply the city of Halifax with water were expressly repealed and the name of the said company was declared thenceforth to be the Halifax Gas Light Company. Now, the provision made for lighting the city by the act of incorporation of this company was wholly independent of the city corporation. It rested wholly with the proprietors or a majority of the proprietors of any street whether such street should be lighted or not. If a majority only of the proprietors and not all desired their street to be lighted they had to apply to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, before the incorporation of the city, or to the city council since such incorporation, who, on being satisfied that a majority of said proprietors had actually agreed that the street in question should be lighted, were required to cause a fair and proportionate rate to be made on the whole of the property in such street, and when such rate should be made and approved by the court, the court (i.e., city council) should order such street to be lighted. If all the proprietors on any street should by written agreement fix a rate they might contract with the company without the intervention of the city council, and provision was mads for enforcing payment of the rate agreed upon as well as of that imposed under the authority of and approved by the city council. Under this act the streets of the city of Halifax which were lighted were lighted until the month of November, 1887, the Gas Company increasing the number of lamps in any street and locating them according to the wishes of the council. In the meantime in the year 1851 the city council was first empowered to control and regulate the lighting of the city. By the 149th section of an act of the legislature of 1851, 14th Vic. ch. 19, it was enacted as follows:\nThe city council shall make by-laws, orders and regulations for lighting the city, and also for supplying water therein, and they may make any necessary contracts on behalf of the city for these purposes.\nAnd by the 152nd section it was enacted that a sum of not less than \u00a3400 should be annually included in the general assessment for the purpose of supplying the city with public fountains, hydrants and fire plugs, and that the Halifax Water Company should for that sum of \u00a3400, to be paid to them annually by the city, supply a specified number of fountains, hydrants and fire plugs in such places as had been or might be appointed by the city council. At the time of the passing of the above act the city of Halifax was supplied with water by the Halifax Water Company, and with light by the Halifax Gas Light Company, under the provisions of the statute ch. 16 of the statutes of 1840 above referred to; the section 149 of the statute of 1851 in so far as lighting the city was concerned, was acted upon by the city council thenceforward in determining the number of lamps which should be erected in each street and locating them and paying therefor, and for the gas light supplied. Now by the provincial act, 27 Vic. ch 81, provision was made enabling the city of Halifax to purchase the property, rights and privileges of the Halifax Water Company, and enacting several precise clauses enabling the city council to undertake itself the duty of supplying the city with water. No such provision is at all made with respect to lighting the city. The only provision upon that subject is made by section 409 which is a limitation of the provision of section 149 of the act of 1851, as follows: The city council shall make by-laws, orders and regulations for lighting the city, and they make any necessary contracts on behalf of the city for that purpose.\nAnd on the same day as this act 27 Vic. ch. 81 was passed an act 27 Vic. ch. 64, enabling the city council to inspect, test and prove the accuracy of the gas meters furnished, for use by the Halifax Gas Light Company, or by any other gas light company which might thereafter be established within the city; and by that act it was enacted that towards payment of the inspector by the city the gas light company should pay $200 annually into the hands of the city treasurer. It is obvious, therefore, I think, that section 409 of 27 Vic. ch 81, which is the provision on the subject still in force, is fully complied with by the city council making the necessary contract for the lighting the city with persons or companies competent to enter into the same with the city, and that not only is no obligation imposed upon the city to erect, maintain and work the necessary works for providing gas or other light, but that they are not empowered to erect or purchase, or to raise the funds necessary for the erection and purchase, of such works. Now, as already said, the sections 149 of 14 Vic. ch. 1 and 409 of 27 Vic. ch. 81, have been complied with by the city council making contracts for the lighting of the city with the Halifax Gas Light Company until the month of November, 1887, when a contract went into operation which the city council entered into in the month of September previous with a company doing business under the name, style and firm of J. W. Chandler and Company, for the lighting of the city with electric lamps for three years from the 24th November, 1887. That company, in accordance with the provisions of that contract, erected the lamps, and it is for the failure of one of those lamps to give light on the night of the 28th August, 1889, that, as is alleged, the injury sustained by the plaintiff was occasioned, which failure of such lamp to give light at the time in question is charged as negligence of the defendants giving cause of action to the plaintiff. In the statement of claim this negligence is charged thus:\nThat the lights provided for lighting said street (Barrington street), were negligently and improperly managed and the machinery provided therefor was inadequate and inefficient.\nAs already shown, the lights and the machinery provided for supplying the electric lights were not under the management of, or provided by, the city council but under the management of, and provided by, the company with which the city council had, under the authority of sec. 409 of 27 Vic. ch. 87, entered into a contract for lighting the city. But it was contended that the city could not avail themselves of their contract with the electric light company to relieve themselves from responsibility to the plaintiff upon the principle of law that a person upon whom a liability is imposed, whether by common law or by statute, cannot absolve himself from his liability by delegating his duty to another, and in support of this contention were cited Gray v. Pullen[7]; Pickard v. Smith[8]; and Carty v. The City of London[9]. The principle is not questioned but its application to the present case is. It is not disputed that where a particular duty is imposed upon any person as incidental to the doing of any work which he by statute is authorized to do such person cannot, by employing a contractor to do the work authorized, evade responsibility to a person injured by the non-fulfilment of the incidental duty imposed. That was the case of Grey v. Pullen (1), Pickard v. Smith, (2) and Carty v. City of London (3). But in entering into the contract with the Chandler Electric Light Company, the terms of which the city council had full power to arrange, the council while thus exercising the power vested in them by the statute discharged the duty imposed upon them by the statute; they were not employing the company to do work which the statute had required them to do themselves, nor had the statute imposed upon the council the duty of lighting the city by works of their own, or enabled them to raise the funds necessary for the purchase or erection and maintenance of the necessary works; they had in effect no power but that of entering into contracts with persons able to supply the light which in the exercise of their discretion the council should think necessary, and this they did by the contract they entered into with the Chandler Electric Light Company. The relation thus, which by statutory authority was created between the council and the company, was not that of master and servant or of principal and agent but that of employer and independent contractors, and the law applicable to such a case applies, namely, that if any one suffers injury from any negligence in the execution by the contractors of the work they have undertaken the contractors alone are responsible. In the present case the negligence alleged to have existed is improper management of the lights on Barrington street and defect in the machinery provided for producing the light. No evidence whatever, either of defect in the machinery or in the management of the light, was offered by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's case as to negligence causing the light in question to go out consisted solely of the bare fact that as the plaintiff reached the place where the hydrant over which she fell was the light in the street flickered and went out\u2014a thing not unusual in the use of electric light, the cause of which does not seem to be well known, or at least it was not shown in evidence to be attributable to any negligence. Evidence was given to the effect that \"it is not possible to prevent a single lamp, neither is it possible to prevent a batch of lamps, going out; it is not possible to guard against particular lights going out suddenly.\" So that the evidence failed to show that the flickering and going out of the particular lamp in question was attributable to any negligence whatever. Much irrelevant matter was admitted in evidence from which it appeared that the council were not quite satisfied with the manner in which the company fulfilled their contract with the city in other parts of the city quite apart from the place where the plaintiff met with her accident, and the case seems to have been determined by the learned judge who tried the case upon this irrelevant matter. The gist of the case lay in establishing, 1st, negligence to have been the cause of the light on Barrington street flickering and going out, for if the light had been good the plaintiff beyond doubt could and should have avoided the hydrant; and 2ndly, that the city corporation is responsible for such negligence; in both of these points the evidence, in my opinion, wholly fails, and therefore the appeal must be allowed with costs and the action in the court below dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the plaintiff's action dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: W.

Exchequer Court, that under 43 Vic. ch. 8 confirming the agreement of sale by the Grand Trunk Railway Company to the Crown of the purchase of the Riviere du Loup branch of their railway, the Crown cannot be held liable for damages caused from the accumulation of surface water to land crossed by the railway since 1879, unless it is caused by acts or omissions of the Crown's servants, and as the damages in the present case appear by the evidence relied on, to have been caused through the non-maintenance of the boundary ditches of claimant's farm, which the Crown is under no obligation to repair or keep open, the appellant's claim for damages must be dismissed.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the appellant's claim for damages with costs.\nThis was a claim for damages for the flooding of the appellant's farm. The claimant complained that the ditches on each side of the Intercolonial Railway where it crosses his farm, had not been kept cleaned out and in proper state of repair, and that in consequence water had been allowed to accumulate on each side of the railway track in such quantity, that it overflowed his land on each side and claimed $1,000 for such damages. The claimant alleged also that by this deed of conveyance to the Grand Trunk Railway in 1859, the Crown was bound to maintain in good order and repair sufficient ditches to carry away all the surface, water. The Crown denied its liability and by consent of parties the case was determined upon the evidence taken in that case of Simoneau v. The Queen[2]. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court found upon that evidence\u2014which is reviewed in the report of the case in 2 Can. Ex. C. R. p. 391\u2014that the damages to the plaintiff were the result of his own neglect to clean his boundary ditches so that the water that collected near the railway had no means of escape, and held that the deed of conveyance did not impose upon the Crown the obligation to keep open and in good repair these boundary ditches.\nBelcourt for appellant in addition to the points of arguments and cases cited in the Exchequer Court[3], relied on Bell v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[4]; Pouliot v. The Queen[5]; Smith v. The Atlantic & North-west Railway Co.[6]; Leonard v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[7]; Workman v. Great Northern Railway[8]; and 50-51 Vic. ch. 18.\nHogg Q. C. for the respondent, contended on the evidence that the Crown had maintained the railway ditches in good repair, and was not liable under the deed of 43 Vic. ch. 8, to repair boundary ditches between farms crossed by the Intercolonial Railway.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Concurred with Taschereau J.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. I am unable to understand the evidence (which was that taken before the registrar in another cause, between different parties, and relating to different lands) as applied to the land alleged to be damaged in the present case. The use of this evidence on this petition seems, however, to have been sanctioned by the Exchequer Court. Under these circumstances I think the appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Cette cause est un appel de la cour d'Echiquier. Les faits peuvent se r\u00e9sumer comme suit:\nL'appelant est propri\u00e9taire du lot 347 sur le plan du cadastre de la paroisse du Cap St. Ignace, dans le comt\u00e9 de Montmagny, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le chemin de fer de l'Intercolonial traverse une partie de ce lot, et le demandeur se plaint que les foss\u00e9s de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la voie ferr\u00e9e o\u00f9 elle traverse sa terre, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vid\u00e9s et tenus en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9paration, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'eau s'est amass\u00e9e de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la voie ferr\u00e9e en telle quantit\u00e9 qu'elle a d\u00e9bord\u00e9 sur ses terres de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, ce qui lui a caus\u00e9 des dommages, et par son action il r\u00e9clame $1,000 pour tels dommages.\nLa cour d'Echiquier a renvoy\u00e9 l'action; de ce jugement le demandeur appelle \u00e0 cette cour.\nAvant de proc\u00e9der avec cette action, il fut convenu entre les conseils repr\u00e9sentant le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur, que la preuve prise dans la cause de Simoneau v. la Reine[9] qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue et jug\u00e9e dans la cour d'Echiquier en f\u00e9vrier 1890, formerait et serait la preuve dans cette pr\u00e9sente cause, et que l'action serait jug\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s cette preuve et les exhibits produits dans la dite cause.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9e dans la cause de Simoneau v. la Reine (1) est un lot de terre voisin de celui du pr\u00e9sent appelant, et le demandeur all\u00e9guait dans cette cause que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9e par l'eau et par les m\u00eames causes que celles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par le demandeur dans la pr\u00e9sente action. En cons\u00e9quence aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue dans la pr\u00e9sente cause dans la cour d'Echiquier, mais la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e sur la preuve prise dans la cause de Simoneau, maintenant reproduite dans la pr\u00e9sente cause; et l'appelant soutient que d'apr\u00e8s la preuve dans la cause de Simoneau, la Couronne est responsable des dommages dont il se plaint.\nJe suis d'opinion qu'il ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\n1. Le titre de la Couronne \u00e0 la partie du lot 347 requis pour le chemin de fer au lieu en question fut acquis de la compagnie de chemin de fer du Grand Tronc du Canada sous le statut 43 Vic. cap. 8, qui confirmait l'achat par le gouvernement du Canada de cette partie du chemin de fer du Grand Tronc s'\u00e9tendant de Hadlow \u00e0 la Rivi\u00e8re du Loup, d'apr\u00e8s lequel acte la Couronne se rendait responsable de toutes r\u00e9clamations pour dommages survenant apr\u00e8s la date du transfert du dit chemin. La compagnie de chemin de fer du Grand Tronc eut besoin en 1854 de la dite partie du lot n\u00b0 347 pour la construction, le maintien, et l'usage du dit chemin de fer et acquit le titre \u00e0 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par acte de Joseph M\u00e9thot le 3e jour de janvier 1854, et le m\u00eame acte renferme non seulement un transfert absolu de la dite partie de la dite terre \u00e0 la dite compagnie pour le montant sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 dans l'acte, mais de plus il y est stipul\u00e9 que le montant pay\u00e9 comprend la compensation qui doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9e au dit M\u00e9thot pour tous dommages provenant de l'expropriation du dit morceau de terre.\nD'apr\u00e8s cet acte, l'appelant ou ses auteurs ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u une enti\u00e8re compensation pour les dommages caus\u00e9s par la prise de possession de la terre et par la construction du dit chemin de fer, et \u00e0 moins que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre que, \u00e0 raison de quelque changement dans la condition du chemin de fer depuis la date du dit acte, la position de l'appelant est devenue plus on\u00e9reuse, l'appelant est d\u00e9chu du droit de recouvrer les dommages qu'il r\u00e9clame maintenant.\n2. L'appelant pr\u00e9tend que d'apr\u00e8s le dit acte la compagnie de chemin de fer du Grand Tronc \u00e9tait et que la Couronne est maintenant tenue d'entretenir les foss\u00e9s et les cours d'eau ouverts et avec passage libre pour l'eau de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la voie du chemin de fer, ainsi que les ponceaux traversant la voie d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre. Mais la preuve d\u00e9montre aussi clairement que possible que la compagnie du chemin de fer a toujours entretenu ses foss\u00e9s dans un bon \u00e9tat, et que la Couronne n'est aucunement en faute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nL'inondation de la terre de l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par sa propre n\u00e9gligence, en omettant de faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires.\nLa preuve d\u00e9montre que les foss\u00e9s de ligne sur sa terre qui devaient donner cours \u00e0 l'eau qui pouvait s'amasser pr\u00e8s de la voie ferr\u00e9e et qui ont servi \u00e0 cela pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nettoy\u00e9s par l'appelant, et il est prouv\u00e9 clairement que c'est par cette n\u00e9gligence qu'il a souffert des dommages.\nIl ne pr\u00e9tend pas et ne peut pr\u00e9tendre que la Couronne soit oblig\u00e9e d'entretenir les foss\u00e9s de ligne sur sa terre.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nOn Appeal from the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Improvement or alteration of street\u2014Lowering grade\u2014Injury to adjacent land\u2014Remedy\u2014Action\u2014Compensation under statutory provisions\u2014By-law\u201451 V. c. 42 s. 190 (B.C.).\nThe act incorporating the city of New Westminster, 51 V. c. 42 (B.C.) by s. 290, empowers the council of the city to order by by-law the opening or extending of streets, etc., and for such purposes to acquire and use any land within the city limits, either by private contract or by complying with the formalities prescribed in subsections 3 and 4 of said section, which provide for the appointment of commissioners to fix the price to be paid for such land ; subsection 13 provides for the confirmation of the appointment and 15 for the deposit in court of said price by the council which deposit should vest in them the title to said land.\nSubsection 17 of section 190 enacts that subsections 3 and 4 shall apply to cases of damage to real or personal estate by reason of any alteration made by order of council in the line or level of any street, and for payment of the compensation therefor without further formality.\nThe council was authorized by by-law to raise money for improving certain streets but no by-law was passed expressly ordering such improvements. In one of the streets named in said by-law the grade was lowered, in doing which the approach to and from an adjacent lot became very difficult and no retaining wall having been built the soil of said lot caved and sunk thereby weakening the supports of the buildings thereon.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, Ritchie C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting, that the owner of said lot could maintain an action for the damage sustained by lowering the grade of the street and was not obliged to seek redress under the statute ; that subsection 17 of section 190 which dispenses with the formalities required by prior subsections only applies to cases where land is injuriously affected by access thereto being interfered with, and where land is taken or used for the purposes of work on the streets the corporation must comply with the formalities prescribed by subsections 3 and 4 ; that the street having been excavated to a depth which caused a subsidence of adjoining land the latter must be regarded as having been taken and used for the purposes of the excavation, and the council should have acquired it under the statute ; not having so acquired it, and having neglected to take steps to prevent the subsidence of the adjacent land, they are liable for the damage thereby caused.\nHeld further, that the neglect to take such precautions was in itself, however legal the making of the excavation may have been if skilfully executed, such negligence in the manner of executing it as to entitle the owner of the adjacent land to recover damages for the injury sustained.\nHeld, per Patterson J., that in the absence of the statutory preliminaries a municipality I as no greater right than any other owner of adjacent land to disturb the soil of a private person.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was brought to recover damages for injury alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the street on which her property is situate being excavated, in order to lower the grade, to such a depth that the soil of her lot caved in and fell into the excavation and the supports of the buildings were weakened defendants having neglected to put up a retaining wall or other support. The questions raised on the appeal were whether or not plaintiff was entitled to compensation for such injury, and if she was if she could bring an action to recover it.\nThe pleadings in the case and the statutes governing it are all set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellants argued that under the charter of New Westminster, 51 Vic. ch. 42, plain- tiff could not bring an action but must follow the statutory provisions for her remedy if she had any, citing Adams v. City of Toronto[1] ; Coverdale v. Charlton[2] ; Pratt v. Corporation of Stratford[3] ; Vandecar v. Corporation of Oxford [4] ; Ayers v. Corporation of Windsor[5].\nOsler Q.C. for the respondent referred to West v. Parkdale[6] and North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion[7].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The by-law authorizes the raising of money for improving the street in question. This necessarily involves, in my opinion, authority to expend the money for the purpose for which it was raised. It would be extraordinary if the corporation had authority to raise money for a particular object and had no power to expend it when so raised. And this being so the corporation in improving the street had the unquestionable right to lower and grade it, and if in doing so the land of any proprietors adjoining the street was injuriously affected if they are entitled to claim compensation therefor it can only be under the provisions of the act.\nGale on Easements[8]:\nSubject to the restriction already mentioned, that an encroachment must not be removed with unnecessary violence, there seems nothing to take this class of cases out of the rule before adverted to : \" That a party confining himself within the limits of his own property may deal with it as he will.\" [This view is supported by Gayford App. Nicholls, Resp. (1854)[9] in which, the plaint being in part for negligently taking away the support of a modern house, the judge was held to have misdirected the jury in leaving to them the question of negligence. In several modern text books, not including Wms. Saund.[10] it is laid down, without further authority than the cases above distinguished, by the learned editors that an action is maintainable against a landowner for negligence in removing the support afforded by his land to the modern house of his neighbour. This may to some extent be attributable to vagueness in the use of the relative term negligence[11] \u2014of which a definition is given by Alderson B. in Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Company (1856)[12] ; and Willes J.,Vaughan v. Taff Vale Rail. Co. (1860)[13]. It should seem that in this class of cases if the mere removal occasions the fall the defendant is not liable, however negligent may have been the manner of the removal\u2014for his act was confined to his own land.] If he dig a pit he is not bound to put a fence round it to keep trespassers from falling into it, [(1 Roll abr. 88 pl. 4), fully supported in Jordin v. Crump (1841)[14] ; but qualified by Barnes v. Ward (1850),[15], to the extent that if the pit abuts on a highway and renders the highway dangerous to persons passing along it with ordinary care then the occupier is bound to fence it. Cf. Stone v. Jackson (1855)[16] ; Hurst v. Taylor (1885)[17]. This is on the ground that such a pit is a public nuisance, interfering with the use of the way. But if the pit or other excavation be not substantially adjacent to the way there is no obligation to fence it, and no action is maintainable against the owner of the land if a person accidentally or otherwise straying off the way falls into the pit ; Hardcastle v. South Yorkshire Railway &c. Company (1859)[18] ; Hounsell v. Smyth (1860)[19].]\nDillon's Municipal Corporations[20] :\n990 (783). No common law liability for consequential damages for change of grade. Accordingly, the courts, by numerous decisions in most of the States, have settled the doctrine that municipal corporations, acting under authority conferred by the legislature to make and repair, or to grade, level and improve streets, if they keep within the limits of the street, and do not trespass upon or invade private pro-property, and exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of the work resolved upon, are not answerable to the adjoining owner, whose lands are not actually taken, trespassed upon or invaded, for consequential damages to his premises, unless there is a provision in the constitution of the State in the charter of the corporation, or in some statute, creating the liability. There is no such implied or common law liability even though in grading and levelling the street, a portion of the adjoining lot, in consequence of the removal of its natural support falls into the highway. And the same principle applies, and the like freedom from implied liability exists, if the street be embanked or raised in reducing it to the grade line, so as to cut off or render difficult the access to the adjacent property. And this is so although the grade of the street has been before established, and the adjoining property owner had erected buildings or made improvements with reference to such grade.\n991. Same subject. No right to lateral support of soil[21]. Where the power is not exceeded there is no implied or common law liability to the adjacent owner for grading the whole width of the street, and so close to his line as to cause his earth or fences or improvements to fall, and the corporation is not bound to furnish supports or build a wall to protect it. The abutting owner has as against a city no right to the lateral support of the soil of the street and can acquire none from prescription or lapse of time.\nIn addition to which I cannot think that a corporation has not a right, by order, to level and grade a street as incident to their right to put and keep the street which has been duly laid out in a proper state of repair to enable the same to be used as streets and highways usually are. What are they but ordinary and necessary repairs to enable the public to use the streets and highways in the ordinary course of the traffic of the city ?\nTherefore a by-law was unnecessary, but if necessary then there was, as I have said, a good by-law.\nI do not think in levelling this street there was any negligence or carelessness on the part of the Commissioners ; they simply acted in the discharge of a public duty in the exercise of a public trust for the public benefit, and inasmuch as they confined the excavation within the lines of the street no action can be sustained against them by any individual who may have sustained a special injury or consequential damage from the act done, the act itself being lawful and there being nothing in the mode in which it was carried into execution to make it unlawful. The case of Boulton v. Crowther[22] establishes this beyond all question.\nThe commissioners did no wrong. They could not repair or improve by levelling and grading the street without making the excavation complained of ; there is no question but that they acted bon\u00e2 fide ; they were required to grade and level the streets ; in doing so their acts were justifiable. I cannot see that any wrongful act can be alleged against them. The only way the damage complained of could have been avoided, was by leaving a large part of the road unexcavated ; this would have frustrated the very object sought to be accomplished, viz., reducing the street to a proper grade. If plaintiff has sustained damages by her property being injuriously affected the law has provided how she may obtain compensation ; or if it has not she is without remedy.\nIt was relied on in the court below that the statute giving compensation was not pleaded. I cannot think there could be any necessity for pleading that plaintiff should not have brought her action inasmuch as she could have obtained compensation under the statute. The plaintiff had a right to bring an action or not. She certainly had no right to bring an action if the law gave a remedy she was bound to pursue and had failed to adopt it, and which precluded the right to bring an action. Surely when on the trial of the case the facts, as proved, developed that she had mistaken her remedy or had no remedy, it would be impossible for the court to give her judgment in an action in which she had misconceived her remedy. STRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. First, it is an undeniable fact that no by-law was passed authorizing the interference with her property for which the respondent brought this action. The case is not therefore within the statute authorizing expropriation or encroachment on private property. This is so plain as a legal conclusion that no authority need be cited to sustain it. It is a general proposition of law, that in the case of all statutes authorizing the taking or interfering with private property for public purposes the procedure directed by the statute must be followed with exactitude.\nBut even if there had been a by-law, and the statute had been followed so far as concerned procedure, I should still have thought the respondent entitled to retain the judgment she has recovered on another and distinct ground.\nIt is, I take it, an established rule that in all cases where public works are executed under statutory authority to the extent of an infringement on private rights of property the statutory powers must be executed without negligence and in such a way as to do the least possible injury to the private owner. This principle received the approbation of the House of Lords in Geddis v. Bann Reservoir[23], and is particularly enunciated in the judgment of Lord Blackburn in that case.\nIn the present case negligence in the execution of the work is distinctly alleged in the statement of claim and is, in my opinion, amply proved. The neglect to build a revetement wall, or to put up some support to the respondent's property after making the escarpment complained of, is conclusive proof of negligence. Upon both grounds I am of opinion that the judgment ought to be sustained and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I also dissent with His Lordship and for the reasons by him given, from the judgment about to be entered. I would allow this appeal. A by-law was not necessary as, in my opinion, was amply demonstrated by Mr. Justice McCreight in the court below. Then, if one was necessary, that of the 17th June, 1889, covers the case, and the plaintiff's only remedy was by arbitration under the compensation clauses of the act of 1888. If necessary the defendants should be allowed to amend their defence under sections 63 and 64 of the Supreme Court Act.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in her statement of claim complains that the defendants have wrongfully excavated and lowered Agnes street in the city of New Westminster to the depth of 15 feet or thereabouts in front of a lot of land of the plaintiff whereon she had a house erected, and that thereby they have withdrawn the support of her said lot and that the soil of her said lot has in consequence sunk, given way and caved into the said street, and her house thereon is weakened and cracked and has settled and is liable to further settlement ; and she complains that the defendants excavated and lowered the said street as alleged negligently, carelessly and unskilfully in not leaving sufficient support to the said lot from the soil of the said street and in not erecting a retaining wall or other fixture to prevent the soil of the said lot from caving or falling into the said street ; and that they lowered the said street as alleged without any by-law being passed by the council of the said city authorizing the same and without any legal authority, and she claimed damages for such alleged injuries. The defendants in their statement of defence allege that they are a municipal corporation incorporated by and subject to the provisions of an act of the Legislative Assembly of the province of British Columbia passed in the 51st year of Her Majesty's reign and known as \" The New Westminster Act 1888,\" and they say that acting in pursuance of the powers and in performance of the duties conferred and cast upon them by the said act, for the purpose of repairing, levelling and grading the said street, they cut down the same in some places and raised the same in other places, one of the places where the same was so cut down being opposite the land of the plaintiff which are the alleged wrongful acts of the defendants in the plaintiff's statement of claim mentioned, and they deny that the plaintiff's land was entitled to the support of the land of the street or that the execution of the said works have deprived the plaintiff of any support to which she was entitled as owner of the said lands. And they further deny that the said work was executed in a negligent, careless or unskilful way as alleged in the plaintiff's statement of claim, and they deny that the work was executed without the passing of a by-law or without legal authority. The above contains the whole substance of the complaint and defence to which it is necessary to advert.\nAt the trial it appeared that Agnes street had been excavated along the front of the plaintiff's lot to a depth varying from 8 4\/5 feet to ten and one-third, 10 1\/3, feet, and that the natural consequence of such excavation, though made within the limits of the street, was to withdraw support from the plaintiff's lot to such an extent that a large portion thereof was carried away and sunk, and caved into the excavation made in the street whereby the foundation of the plaintiff's house settled and became injured. No by-law authorizing to be done the work which was done was ever passed by the municipal council of the city. A by-law was passed intituted \" A by-law to raise by loan the sum of $85,000 for street and park improvements,\" by which it was enacted that it should be lawful for the mayor of the city to raise by way of loan, from any person or persons, bodies or body corporate, who might be willing to advance the same upon the credit of the debentures thereinafter mentioned, a sum of money not exceeding $85,000, and that the proceeds of the debentures issued and sold under the authority of the by-law should be applied to improvments on Queen's Park and the streets thereinafter mentioned, and as nearly in the proportion in the by-law also mentioned as might to the council seem expedient, that is to say, \" Queen's Park $15,000, Columbia street $1,000, Agnes street $2,500,\" and divers other streets, divers other sums appropriated to each :\u2014\nProvided that out of the said sum of $15,000 set apart for the improvement of Queen's Park there should be paid into the city treasury to the credit of the general account the sum of $3,000, being the sum already expended out of the general revenue for park improvements ; provided, also, that if the requirements of any of the streets above mentioned should be found to be less or greater than the sum apportioned to the said street, the said sum may be increased or diminished, as in the circumstances may seem to the council expedient, and the surplus, if any, remaining out of the appropriations above set out after said streets have been completed may be applied to other works of permanent improvement not specified herein at the discretion of the council.\nThe contention on behalf of the defendants was, 1st. That for the work which was done on Agnes street no by-law was necessary ; 2nd. That if a by-law was necessary the above by-law for raising $85,000 was sufficient ; 3rd. That the work as done was authorized by the powers vested in the council by the act incorporating the city, being the provincial statute 51 Vic. ch. 42, the 116th subsection of section 142 of which act was specially relied upon, and that there was no negligence committed in the performance of the work and that therefore, 4th. No action lay ; 5th. That the plaintiff was either entitled to no redress at all or could seek redress only under some provision in the statute for that purpose, but it was not set up by way of defence upon the record that the plaintiff had any remedy given to her by the statute which she was restricted to instead of proceeding by action.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried without a jury rendered a verdict in favour of the plaintiff for $681; that verdict was sustained by the Supreme Court of British Columbia from the judgment of which court this appeal is taken, and the grounds urged before us in support of the appeal were those above stated.\nBy the 204th and 205th sections of the above act of the legislature of British Columbia, 51 Vic. ch. 42, incorporating the city of New Westminster, it is enacted that every public street, road, square, lane, bridge or other highway in the city shall be vested in the city, and that every such public street, road, square, lane, bridge and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation.\nBy the 142nd section it is enacted that the council may from time to time alter and repeal by-laws for, among other things[24] :\nOpening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, stopping up and putting down drains, sewers, water-courses, roads, streets, squares, alleys, lanes and other public communications within the jurisdiction of the council, &c., and for entering upon, breaking up, taking or using any land in any way necessary or convenient for said purpose.\nBy section 190 it is enacted that : The council of the city shall have full power and authority to order by by-law the opening or extending of streets, lanes, public places, squares and highways, or the construction of a public wharf or wharves, &c., and to order at the same time that such improvements should be made out of the city funds, or that the cost thereof shall be assessed in the whole or in part upon the pieces or parcels of land belonging to the parties interested in or benefitted by said improvements, and to purchase, acquire, take and enter into any land whatsoever within the limits of the said city, either by private contract between the council of the said city and the corporation or other persons interested, or by complying with all the formalities hereinafter prescribed for opening streets, &c., or for continuing or improving the same, &c., &c.\nThe formalities which are then prescribed for acquiring any land required by the corporation for the purpose of said improvements, and by compliance with which alone the corporation can acquire or take any land the property of any person, are set forth in the 3rd and 4th subsections of section 190 as conditions precedent necessary to be fulfilled before the corporation can take or interfere with any such land, and are as follows :\u2014\nThe council shall cause to be served upon the owner of the property required for the purpose of any such improvement a notice, either personally or by a notice addressed through the post office to the person last assessed as proprietor at his actual or last known domicile, and shall also give public notice by three insertions in at least one newspaper published in said city and in the British Columbia Gazette, that they would on a day and hour mentioned in such notices (not less than one week distant) present to the Supreme Court of British Columbia or to a judge thereof in chambers, or to a county court judge, a petition calling upon the said court or judge to nominate three competent and disinterested persons to act as commissioners to fix and determine the price to be allowed for each and every piece of ground or property which may be required by the corporation for said improvements, and which shall be designated in the said notices by a general description and by reference to a map or plan in the office of the solicitor of the corporation, and one week at least shall elapse from the date of the last insertion of the said notice in the said papers to the day appointed for presentation of the said petition and a copy of the said notice shall be posted near or in the neighbourhood of the property to be expropriated. Then by subsec. 4 it is enacted that the court or judge to whom such petition should be presented shall appoint three commissioners as aforesaid, and shall fix the day on which the said commissioners shall begin their operations and also the day on which they shall make their report, &c. Provision is then made for the course to be pursued by the commissioners in making their appraisement and their report thereon, and then by subsection 14 it is enacted that\u2014\nOn the day fixed in and by the order appointing the commissioners the council of the city shall submit to the court or to any of the said judges the report containing the appraisement of the said commissioners for the purpose of being confirmed to all intents and purposes, and the said court or any of the said judges may thereupon, after hearing any or all of the parties interested therein who may appear, pronounce the confirmation of the said report, which shall be final as regards all parties interested and not open to any appeal.\nThen by subsection 15, it is enacted that :\nThe council of the said city shall, within one month after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, make in the hands of the registrar or clerk of the court a deposit of the price or compensation and damages settled and determined in and by said report, and the act of such deposit shall constitute a legal title in the city to the property in the said piece of land, &c., &c., and the said council shall be vested with said piece of land, &c., &c., and may of right, without any further formality, enter into possession of and use the same for any of the purposes authorised by the act.\nThen by subsection 17 it is enacted that all the provisions of the said 3rd and 4th subsections shall apply and be extended: To all cases in which it shall become necessary to ascertain the amount of compensation to be paid by the said council to any proprietor of real or personal estate, or his representative, for any damage he or they may have sustained by reason of any alteration made by order of the council in the line or level of any street, &c., &c., and the amount of such compensation it is directed shall be paid at once by the council to the party having a right to the same without further formality.\nThen follows a provision, that :\nAny person who shall erect any building whatever upon or contiguous to any established or contemplated street, &c., &c., without having previously obtained from the City Engineer or Surveyor the level and line of such street, &c., shall forfeit his or her claim for damages or compensation by reason of any injury caused to the property or building when such level or line shall be settled and determined by the council.\nWith respect to this provision it is only necessary to observe that it has no application to the present case for the plaintiff's house was erected prior to the passing of the act.\nNow, while by subsection 116 of section 142 the corporation is empowered to make by-laws for opening, making, improving, repairing, widening and altering streets, &c., &c., and for taking and using any land in any way necessary or convenient for any such purpose ; and although it may be that any improvement or alteration made wholly within the limits of the street can be lawfully performed without a by-law ; yet it cannot, I think, be doubted that if any such improvement or alteration should require the taking, using or encroaching upon any adjacent land belonging to any person other than the corporation as necessary or convenient for the making the proposed improvement or alteration, the right to take, use or encroach upon such land for such purpose could only be acquired under a by-law and by compliance with the provisions of section 190 and the subsections thereof ; while if the improvement or alteration can be and is made within the limits of the street improved or altered without the taking, using or appropriating any adjacent land for the purpose, and without encroaching upon or affecting such land otherwise than by injuring the access thereto by alteration in the level of the street the corporation may make the alteration subject to having compensation awarded under the provisions of subsection 17 of the section 190.\nSubsections 1 to 15 of section 190 plainly, as it seems to me, apply to any land adjacent to the line of a street, the level of which is altered, that is necessary to be appropriated, taken or used in the making or maintaining the altered level, while subsection 17 applies to the cases of land not so taken or used but which, although not so taken or used, is injuriously affected by the alteration of the level. The contention on the part of the appellants was that what they caused to be done in the alteration of the level of Agnes street they were authorized to do without a by-law, and that if the plaintiff was entitled to any remedy or compensation she was entitled to it only under subsection 17 of section 190. If the injury sustained by the plaintiff was only that her lot was injuriously affected by the access thereto having been injured by a work completely executed by the corporation within the limits of the street, as would have been the case if the corporation by the erection of a sufficient retaining wall had prevented the subsidence of a portion of her land into the excavation, she might have been barred of her right of action, and remitted to her remedy under section 190 subsection 17, but under the circumstances of the present case I do not think that the plaintiff is driven to that subsection for the redress to which she is entitled. We must take it as established beyond controversy that the subsidence of that portion of the plaintiff's land which has sunk and caved into the excavation made in the street was the natural and inevitable consequence of the excavation having been made to the depth it was made, unless such subsidence should have been prevented by the erection of a sufficient retaining wall. The consequence being natural and inevitable, unless so prevented, must have been and should have been foreseen by the corporation and its officers, and it was therefore incumbent on the corporation either to have acquired before making the excavation the right to take and use so much of the plaintiff's land as must, by reason of the depth of the excavation, fall into the excavation when made, or to have prevented the subsidence by the erection of a sufficient retaining wall, in which latter event the plaintiff could have claimed compensation, limited, however, to the damage sustained by her land being injuriously affected in the access thereto ; when then the corporation made an excavation in the street, although made within the limits thereof but to such a depth as of necessity to have caused the total subsidence of a large portion of the plaintiff's land into the excavation, they must, in my opinion, be regarded as having taken and used the land of the plaintiff so sunk into the excavation as having been necessary to the making of the excavation as made, just as much as if the level of the street, instead of having been lowered, had been raised to such as height that the base of the embankment necessarily covered a portion of the plaintiff's land. In either case the land of the plaintiff so appropriated, taken or used for the purpose of the alteration must be regarded as so much land taken from the plaintiff for the necessary purposes of the alteration in the level made by the corporation. The right to take or use any part of the plaintiff's land as in any way necessary or convenient for the purpose of making or maintaining the alteration contemplated to be made in the street could only be acquired under a by-law, and by compliance on the part of the corporation with the provisions of subsections 3, 4, 14 and 15 of section 190 as conditions precedent. No such right ever was acquired, but the corporation, in making the excavation which they have made in their own land to such a depth and in such a manner as of necessity to cause a large portion of the plaintiff's land to sink into the excavation so made, have, as a necessary attendant upon the making the alteration made in the street, taken and used, and deprived the plaintiff of, so much of her land as has so necessarily sunk into the street, and in so doing they have wrongfully taken and deprived the plaintiff of so much of her land. As to the case of Pratt v. Corporation of Stratford[25] and other cases of a like nature in the Ontario courts upon which the learned counsel for the appellants relied as justifying what they have done in the present case, it is only necessary to say that in the view which I have taken they do not apply. In those cases the complaint was not, as here, of the plaintiff having been deprived of a portion of her land in the doing the work done by the corporation, but that the work done merely injuriously affected the access to the plaintiff's land, none of which was in any way taken or used in the performance of the work, and of none of which was the plaintiff in any of those cases deprived by the manner in which the work was executed.\nBut the plaintiff is, in my opinion, entitled to maintain this action also upon the principle that the non\u2014prevention of the subsidence of the plaintiff's land into the excavation made by the corporation in the street, however legal the making of the excavation may have been if skilfully executed, constituted such negligence in the manner in which the work was executed as to entitle the plaintiff to recover in this action. It is clear upon the evidence that the injury to the plaintiff's land which is complained of could have been prevented by the erection of a retaining wall. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the corporation to have erected such a wall as a necessary precaution to prevent the sinking of the plaintiff's land into the excavation made by the corporation for their own purposes in the street, and thereby to have reduced the plaintiff's claim to compensation under subsection 17 of section 190 by reason of the alteration in the level of the street injuriously affecting the access to the plaintiff's land. The appeal, in my opinion, must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Gwynne. I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment which he has now delivered. I shall not attempt to go over the matters which he has so fully discussed, but I shall merely refer to some additional authority on one point. The excavation and lowering of the street in front of and up to the line of the plaintiff's land was, as has been shown, an act within the powers of the council. It would have been competent for the council, if it were desired or were necessary to break in upon the plaintiff's land to do so, taking the preliminary steps and adjusting the compensation under the statute. What was in tended was not to touch the corpus of the plaintiff's property but to confine the works to the limits of the street. In doing that, however, the support which the plaintiff's land received from the adjacent soil of the street was removed, causing a fall of the soil and injuriously affecting the supports of the plaintiff's house. It is not shown or alleged that the house, which was a recent structure, contributed by its weight to the falling in of the soil. or that the soil would not have fallen to the same extent if the house had not been there.\nNow, in the absence of the statutory preliminaries, I do not understand that the municipality, as owner of the street, has any greater right to disturb the plaintiff's soil than any other owner of adjacent land would have. An ajdacent owner may, as I understand the law, excavate and remove his land up to his neighbour's line, but if in so doing he removes the natural support to which his neighbour is entitled he must replace it by artificial support. In this case the required support would have been a retaining wall.\nIn Goddard on Easements[26], I find that the law thus stated :\nEvery person has a right ex jure natural\u00e6 that his land shall not be disturbed by the removal of the support naturally rendered by the subjacent and adjacent soil.\nThe author then shows that the right to subjacent support has been decided to be similar to the right to adjacent support, and adds :\nThe natural right to support, then, being established by-law it is necessary to understand what is the exact nature of this right\u2014that is, to what land owners are really by law entitled. The right to support is not a right to a particular means of support\u2014as, for instance, if support has always been received from subjacent coal, that the coal, or a certain portion sufficient to sustain the superincumbent weight of the soil, shall never be removed ; but it is a right that the ordinary enjoyment of land shall not be interrupted, so that, until the enjoy- ment of the surface land is disturbed, the owner has no right to complain of the removal of the minerals. It is, therefore, perfectly justifiable for a mine owner to excavate the whole of the minerals and substitute artificial props to support the surface land in lieu of the natural means of support which he has removed. * * * * It is commonly said that the natural right to support continues only while land remains in its natural condition unburdened with houses ; this is not correct, for the natural right remains though houses are built ; but the owner of land cannot suddenly increase his right, or impose a new or additional burden on the servient tenement, by erecting buildings, and the servient owner is therefore not responsible if the land sinks when he excavates if the sinking is produced by the increased weight the dominant owner has imposed on the surface. That the natural right remains is clear from the decisions in the cases of Brown v. Robins[27] and Stroyan v. Knowles[28], in which it was held that an action would lie for the removal of the support necessary for the adjoining land in its natural condition, notwithstanding houses had been recently erected on the surface, provided the weight of the houses did not produce the sinking of the land\u2014that is, providing the land would have sunk in the same manner had no houses been erected.\nThe case of The Corporation of Birmingham v. Allen[29] was decided after the publication of the first edition of Mr. Goddard's treatise from which I have quoted those passages, which are not materially altered in the later editions. The judgments in that case contain an instructive discussion of the question of support in the peculiar aspect in which it there arose. I shall read a short passage from the judgment of Jessell M. R.\nAs I understand, the law was settled by the House of Lords, confirming the decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in the case of Backhouse v. Bonomi[30], that every landowner in the kingdom has a right to the support of his land in its natural state. It is not an easement, it is a right of property. That being so, if the plaintiff's land had been in its natural state no doubt the defendants must not do anything to let that land slip, or go down or subside. If they were doing an act which it could be proved to me by satisfactory expert evidence would necessarily have that effect I have no doubt this court would interfere by injunction on the ground upon which it always interferes, namely, to prevent irreparable damage when the damage is only threatened. In Siddons v. Short[31] we have an instance of the granting of an injunction to restrain mining operations which would cause neighbouring land to sink although buildings had been recently erected there on the ground that the operations would have caused the land to sink even if the buildings had not been placed upon it.\nI have no doubt of the power of the corporation to improve the street by altering its level, or in any other way, without first passing a by-law on the subject. On this topic I refer to my remarks in the recent case of Bernardin v. North Dufferin[32]. I may add that when the necessity for a by-law is insisted on, as it has been in argument in this case, on the notion that while pending before the council persons interested would know from its terms what was proposed to be done and might oppose its passing, an assumption is made which nothing in the statute warrants. The provision that by-laws may be passed on certain subjects requires no particular form, no details, and in this case would, as I think, be satisfied, if a by-law were required, by the one that was passed appropriating money for the improvement of Agnes street. My judgment proceeds not upon any question of the authority of the corporation to make the improvements in the street, but upon the unauthorized injury to the plaintiff's property which I think was a wrong for which an action lies, and not an injurious affecting of the property by a lawful act the remedy for which would be by proceedings for compensation.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Carbould, McColl, Wilson & Campbell.\nSolicitors for respondent: Armstrong, Eckstein & Gaynor.\n[1] 12 O.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nContract\u2014Surety\u2014Consideration\u2014Stifling prosecution.\nIn an action on a bond executed by J. to secure an indebtedness of L. to plaintiff bank the evidence showed that L., who had married an adopted daughter of J., was agent of the bank, and having embezzled the bank funds the bond was given in consideration of an agreement not to prosecute.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the consideration for said bond was illegal and J. was not liable thereon.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, reversing the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe action in this case was brought to recover the amount due the plaintiff bank on a bond executed by the defendant to secure an indebtedness to the bank of H. & A. Locke, a firm doing business at Lockeport, N. S. Austin Locke, one of the members of said firm, was agent of the bank at Lockeport, and had embezzled money of his principals. He had married an adopted daughter of the defendant. The action was defended on the ground that the defendant executed the bond to prevent Austin Locke from being prosecuted for such embezzlement and evidence was given on the trial of threats by the cashier of the bank to prosecute unless security was given for the debt of the firm. The facts are more fully stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nRoss Q.C. for the appellant. The cashier could not bind the bank by any threats that he made. Downer v. Carpenter[1]; Stainer v. Tysen[2]; Black River Savings Bank v. Edwards[3].\nThe leading case as to duress and illegality of consideration is Wallace v. Hardacre[4]. See also Ward v. Lloyd[5]; McLatchie v. Haslam[6].\nDrysdale for the respondent cited Jones v. Merionethshire Permanent Building Society [7]\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in banco. The action is upon promissory notes and upon a guarantee, whereby the defendant guaranteed to the plaintiff payment of the indebtedness of H. A. Locke. The trial was before Mr. Justice Graham who decided in favour of the defendant as to the promissory notes sued on, and in favour of the plaintiff upon the guarantee. No appeal has been asserted in respect of the judgment for defendant upon the promissory notes. The defendant appealed from the judgment against him upon the guarantee, and his appeal was unanimously sustained,\u2014the Supreme Court in banco reversing Mr. Justice Graham's judgment and directing judgment to be entered for defendant. From this judgment the plaintiff has taken the present appeal.\nThe evidence with reasonable certainty, in my opinion, establishes that the defendant signed the guarantee in order to relieve Austin Locke from criminal proceedings which were then being threatened against him by Braine the plaintiff's agent, and under representations from Braine that such proceedings would be instituted unless the security were given.\nAustin Locke was the manager of the plaintiff's branch bank at Lockeport. He had embezzled the plaintiff's money. It was for this embezzlement that the criminal proceedings were threatened, and it was to secure' the indebtedness of Austin Locke and his partner Sydney Locke, who composed the firm of H. & A. Locke, that the guarantee was exacted.\nAt the argument of the appeal plaintiff's counsel contended that the fact of an agreement to compromise the crime of Austin Locke had not been pleaded. This defence, however, is fully raised by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th paragraphs of the defence and was so regarded at the trial, a great part of the evidence on both sides being devoted to this single issue. It is stated in terms in the 4th paragraph of the defence that the guarantee was executed in order to stifle the threatened prosecution for embezzlement.\nI quite agree that the defence now relied on was sufficiently pleaded.\nI think it a mistake to treat this, as the learned trial judge appears to have done, as a question of duress. It is the question of an agreement entered into to secure the payment of certain moneys in consideration of no proceedings being taken against a party for embezzlement, in other words compounding a felony. In this case there was no other consideration either alleged or proved, and such a consideration, being contrary to the policy of the law, cannot be relied on. I think the evidence very clearly shows that the understanding on which the security was given was that no prosecution would be instituted on the part of the bank, and had that not been the understanding I do not think the defendant would have entered into the arrangement.\nThe learned trial judge says: \"I have not thought it necessary to decide as to whether or not Mr. Braine did make the threat alleged because I have come to the conclusion that if it was made it did not so operate upon the mind and will of the defendant that it destroyed his free agency and rendered him unable to give his assent to the contract.\"\nEven in the learned judge's view of the case it seems to me it would have been better for the learned judge to have decided one way or the other, whether the threat was or was not made, for if made it appears to me difficult, if not almost impossible, to say what effect it had on the mind and will of the defendant, or how it operated on him; but whether this operated on the mind or will of the defendant is, in my opinion, entirely beside the question, because outside of any question of duress or its effect on the free agency of the defendant any consideration of forbearance to prosecute a felony is void as being against public policy. Keir v. Leeman[8]. It is clear that a consideration must not only be valuable but it must be a lawful consideration, and not repugnant to law or sound policy or good morals. Ex turpi contractu actio non oritur.\nThe allowance of such an objection as this is not for the sake of the party who raises it but is grounded on general principles of policy. Where the fact comes to the knowledge of a party, as this most assuredly did, that a felony has been committed, if it is not his duty to prosecute it certainly is contrary to his duty to compromise or compound the felony, because by so doing he is thereby enabled to secure to himself a pecuniary advantage by obtaining security for the amount embezzled or stolen. Considering that embezzlement is rampant at the present day, if we may judge from the cases from day to day detailed in the public print, one would think the banks especially would endeavour to put a stop to such practices instead of practically encouraging them by hushing the offence up on being secured the pecuniary loss they would otherwise sustain.\nIf they will not prosecute is it not right and proper that courts should not allow them to benefit by agreements made to compensate their loss by letting the offender go free in consideration of their not prosecuting? Surely it is the duty of banks and monetary institutions, and one would think their interest, to prosecute and to bring offenders of this sort to justice rather than, by concealing and stifling prosecutions, if not to encourage practically not to discourage such offences, all parties being well aware by confessions of the embezzler that a large amount of the plaintiff's money had been embezzled.\nInasmuch as I can discover no other consideration for the defendant entering into this contract with the plaintiff but the clear intimation that if he did not do so criminal proceedings would be instituted against the embezzler, and the irresistible inference from the evidence being that if he did nothing would be done in the matter, and the contract now sought to be enforced having been entered into under these circumstances, I am of opinion that such consideration was unlawful and no court can be asked to enforce a contract based on such an unlawful consideration.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The judgment appealed against seems to me to be in all respects correct. The defence that the bond sued upon was given for the purpose of inducing the appellants to refrain from instituting criminal proceedings against Austin Locke, which proceedings were threatened by their agent, Braine, is sufficiently pleaded and was substantially proved. It is impossible to suppose that the respondent, who appears from the evidence to be an experienced man of business, would have become a surety for a person in the position of Locke unless there had been some inducement of the most urgent kind. Then no other motive for the respondent's intervention has been suggested than that he executed the bond to save his relation or connection Locke from prosecution. The irresistible inference, therefore, is that it was given for this purpose alone.\nThe case is in all respects like that of Jones v. Merionethshire Building Society[9] and does not resemble that of McClatchie v. Haslam[10] where a married woman gave a security for her husband's debt and afterwards impeached it as having been given to stifle a prosecution. In the last cited case the court were able to say that the inducement to give the security might have been the conjugal influence of the husband, and that there was consequently a motive to which it might be ascribed other than that of an intention and desire to shelter a relative from a prosecution by compounding a criminal offence.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014It seems to me evident that the bank cannot recover in this case. The transaction upon which they base their claim arose out of an agreement to stifle a criminal prosecution illegally made by their agent, of whose illegal acts they cannot take advantage. The evidence, it seems to me, leaves no room for another conclusion as to this fact, and it is settled law that \"any contract or engagement having a tendency, however slight, to affect the administration of justice, is illegal and void.\" Per Lord Lyndhurst in Egerton v. Earl Brownlow[11]. The case of Jones v. The Merionethshire Permanent Building Society[12], has, since the judgment in the present case, been affirmed by the Court of Appeal[13]. I refer to it.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely agree with the review of the evidence as made by Justices Weatherbe and Townshend, and concur with them that the fair conclusion to be drawn from it is that the defendant was induced to give the guarantee which is the subject of this suit upon the faith of an agreement that by his so doing Austin Locke, who had rendered himself liable to a criminal prosecution for fraud upon the plaintiffs, and who was married to a young lady who had been adopted and brought up by the defendant as his daughter, should not be prosecuted. The guarantee was given upon an illegal contract or to stifle a criminal prosecution. The appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: A. A.

The plaintiff appealed.\nHaegel Q.C. and Kennedy Q.C., for the appellant referred, to Peugh v. Davis ([1]); Russell v. Southard ([2]); Holmes v. Matthews ([3]); Locking v. Parker ([4]).

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Assuming the law as to the admission of parol evidence to establish that the conveyances, under which the respondents claim, were intended to operate merely by way of security and not as absolute deeds to be as the appellants contend, I am nevertheless of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. The conveyance is impeached on the ground of fraud and misrepresentation, and in the alternative it is alleged that it w as given as a mere mortgage or security. Neither of these alternative cases is supported by the evidence.\nTreating the questions on which the decision depends exclusively as questions of fact it is, in my opinion, manifest that the appellant fails to establish either of the propositions she contends for.\nAs I am, on this head, entirely of the same opinion as the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba it would serve no useful purpose to enter upon an analysis of the evidence. I therefore content myself with saying that I agree with the Chief Justice of Manitoba and adopt his judgment as to the facts of the case. The objections to the deed founded on the Banking Act are fully answered in the able judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Dubuc on the original hearing.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The appellant\u2019s bill of complaint was rightly dismissed in the court below.. The case turns mainly upon the questions of fact, and we cannot, in my opinion, interfere with the finding of the learned judge at the trial, concurred in as it was by the court in banco. The fact that there was virtually only one judge who re-heard the case cannot affect the result.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By indenture of lease bearing date the 14th day of June,1875, Alexander McMicken, then carrying on the business of a private banker in the city of Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba, and being possessed, under a contract of purchase made with the Hudson Bay Company, of town lots numbers 33 and 34 in block 3 according to a map or plan of the Hudson Bay Company\u2019s Reserve at Fort Garry, dated the 1st day of July, 1872, and registered in the registry office of the county of Selkirk, of which town lots the said Hudson Bay Company were seized in fee, did demise and lease the said two lots to the Ontario Bank for the term of three years, to be computed from the date of the said indenture at the yearly rent of $1,600, to be paid to the said Alexander McMicken, his heirs and assigns; and by the said indenture the said Alexander McMicken covenanted that at the expiration of the said term he would extend the lease of the said premises for a further period of two years at the same rent if requested so to do by the said Ontario Bank. In the summer of the year 1877 the said bank, at the request of the said Alexander McMicken; advanced and paid to the Hudson Bay Company the amount due by the said Alexander McMicken to the said company as and for the purchase money of the said two lots, and of another town lot numbered 48 in the said block 3, described in the same plan of the said company\u2019s survey at Fort Garry, amounting in the whole to the sum of $2,700, and thereupon the said company, by three several deeds bearing date respectively the 3rd of July, 1877, granted, bargained, sold and conveyed the said three lots severally and respectively unto the said Alexander McMicken, his heirs and assigns forever. On the 23rd April, 1877, the said Alexander McMicken, by a deed of bargain and sale of that date, for the consideration therein expressed of $1,500, acknowledged to have been paid to him by one Gilbert McMicken, the father of the said Alexander McMicken, granted, bargained, sold and conveyed unto his said father in fee simple, the said three lots numbered 33, 34 and 48, and also a considerable number of other lots in the province of Manitoba, by the following description, that is to say:\nThe south half of section thirty-five in Township eleven, Range (4) four east of the principal meridian according to the Dominion Government survey of the province of Manitoba, also all those lots in the city of Winnipeg in said province described as follows, viz.: Lots numbers twenty-eight (28), thirty-three (33), thirty-four (34), thirty-seven (37), forty-eight (48), and the south half of lot thirty-six (36) all in block three (3) according to a map or plan of the Hudson Bay Company\u2019s Reserve at Fort Garry signed by Donald Alexander Smith, dated the first day of July, A.D. 1872, and duly filed in the registry office for the county of Selkirk. Also that lot of land in Winnipeg aforesaid on the north side of Notre Dame street bounded on the west by a lot belonging to one Charles Turner, on the north by a lot belonging to one Robert Patterson, on the east by a lot now or formerly belonging to one John Schultz, on the south by Notre Dame street, and having a frontage and depth of one chain; also acre lots numbers forty-four (44), forty-five (45), forty-six (46), forty-seven (47), and forty-eight (48) as the same are shown on a subdivision of the James Ross estate known as lot number nine (9) of the Dominion Government survey of the parish of St. John made by Duncan Sinclair, D.L.S. and registered in the registry office of the county of Selkirk as number forty-five (45).\nAnd the said Alexander McMicken covenanted with the said Gilbert McMicken that he the said Alexander McMicken had right to convey the said lands in manner aforesaid free from all incumbrances. In the year 1875 a firm of hardware merchants, trading in the city of Winnipeg under the name and style of McMicken and Taylor, one of the partners in which firm, namely, Hamilton Grant McMicken, was a son of the said Gilbert McMicken, became indebted to the said bank upon the paper of the said firm discounted for the firm upon which paper the said Gilbert McMicken was liable as endorser. In the month of February, 1876, the liability of the firm and of Gilbert McMicken as their endorser to the bank, amounted to the sum of $8,000; to secure Gilbert McMicken for such his liability as endorser, and for his undertaking to renew the paper of the firm from time to time, the firm gave to him security by a chattel mortgage upon certain goods and chattels of the firm. This chattel mortgage was duly renewed in February, 1877, the liability of Gilbert McMicken to the bank as endorser of the paper of the firm in the bank still continuing to exist as in the previous year. In the month of September, 1877, the said Alexander McMicken was indebted to the bank in the sum of $4,000, theretofore advanced and lent to him and for which the bank then held his promissory note. He was also indebted to the bank in the further sum of $6,000 theretofore advanced to him, and for which the bank held his note endorsed by the said Gilbert McMicken. On the 17th September, 1877, by indenture of mortgage of that date, Gilbert McMicken, at the special instance and request, as he himself says, of his son, the said Alexander McMicken, conveyed the said town lots Nos. 33, 34 and 48, by way of security to the Ontario Bank for the principal sum of $12,700 together with interest as in the said indenture mentioned, such principal sum being composed of the said sums of $2,700 $4,000 and $6,000, in which the said Alexander McMicken was so indebted to the bank. This indenture of mortgage was subject to a proviso for avoiding the same upon payment of the said principal sum with interest thereon at the rate in the said indenture mentioned on or before the 15th day of August, 1878, and that in default of such payment the said bank upon giving one month\u2019s notice might enter upon, lease, or sell the said lands. This indenture was duly registered in the registry office in and for the city of Winnipeg on the 20th day of September, 1877. Upon the 24th day of November, 1877, the said bank recovered a judgment in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in the province of Manitoba against the said Gilbert McMicken, as endorser of certain promissory notes of the firm of McMicken & Taylor for the sum of $7,707.75 then due by him as such endorser to the bank; a certificate of that judgment was duly registered in the registry office of the county of Selkirk upon the said 24th day of November. This registration according to the law of Manitoba had the effect of making the said judgment operate as a charge upon all lands within the said county of Selkirk whereof the said Gilbert McMicken was seized, or w hereunto he was entitled. On the same 24th day of November, 1877, the said bank recovered two several judgments in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the province of Manitoba against the said Gilbert McMicken and Alexander McMicken for the further sums respectively of $417.90 and $403.79. Upon these three judgments writs of fieri facias against the goods and also against the lands of the defendants in the said respective judgments were issued out of the said court and placed in the hands of the sheriff of the said county of Selkirk; the several writs against goods were renewed for one year upon and from the 19th day of November, 1878, but were not again renewed, and the said writs against lands were never renewed. Prior to the month of November, 1877, the said firm of McMicken & Taylor had become insolvent and the said Gilbert McMicken turned over to their assignee in insolvency the chattel mortgage executed by the said firm as security to him for his endorsing their paper to the Ontario Bank. The evidence of this point is that of Mr. Gilbert McMicken himself, who, in his evidence says that: \u2014\nHe did nothing with the chattel mortgage himself\u2014that was left, among McMicken & Taylor\u2019s effects when they went into insolvency, the property being turned over.\nThe moneys secured by the above mortgage not having been paid according to the tenor thereof, the bank on the 24th November, 1878, filed a bill of foreclosure of the mortgage against the said Gilbert McMicken, in the proper court in that behalf in the province of Manitoba, and a decree nisi for foreclosure appears to have been obtained therein, proceedings upon which the bank at the special instance and request of the said. Gilbert McMicken agreed to stay, and did accordingly stay by a letter of the date of the 8th of November, 1878, addressed by the general manager of the bank at Toronto, to the agent of the bank at Winnipeg, which letter is as follows:\nGEORGE BROWN, Esq., Manager, Winnipeg.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I telegraphed you to-day to stay the proceedings in the matter of foreclosure of the mortgage against Mr. McMicken. We have a letter from him asking that proceedings may be withdrawn until the expiry of our present lease about 18 months hence, which my board are not willing to agree to, but for the present consent to a stay of proceedings, with the hope that Mr. McMicken will use his best efforts to pay off our claims and get the property entirely into his own hands.\nTruly yours,\nD. FISHER,\nGen. Manager.\nWhile the proceedings were thus stayed, both Gilbert McMicken and his son Alexander entered into negotiations with one McCrosson, to procure him to purchase the lots numbered 33 and 34, and these negotiations appear to have proceeded so far that a price was agreed upon to be paid by McCrosson, which was somewhat in excess of the amount due under the mortgage, subject to the concurrence of the bank.\nIn relation to this negotiation Mr. Gilbert McMicken, on the 10th July, 1879, addressed and sent the letter following to the cashier of the bank at Toronto:\nWINNIPEG, 10th July, 1879.\nTo THE CASHIER ONTARIO BANK, TORONTO.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I have to request the favour of your bringing the subjoined proposition before your board, and to ask for it a favourable consideration inasmuch as by accepting it the bank will be secured in an early cash settlement of the indebtedness for which the mortgage now existing is pressed to foreclosure. The effect to me would be merely the saving of the back lot which was included in the mortgage to give the bank greater security. I would wish very much to get as early a reply as convenient, and as the season for building is wearing on, the party to whom reference is made in the proposition is also very desirous of early information on the subject, so that if it meets the concurrence of the board he might at once contract for material.\nI am, dear Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nG. MCMICKEN.\nThe proposition inclosed in this letter is as follows:\nWINNIPEG, 18th July, 1879.\nProposition for submission to the board of directors of the Ontario Bank re the mortgage of G. McMicken on property in Winnipeg, viz., that the bank, on the mortgagor at once yielding up his equity of redemption, sell or make over to Thomas McCrosson the two lots on Main street for the amount of the debt, $12,700, McCrosson to pay $700 cash, to bind himself to build forthwith on the vacant space a building to cost not less than $6,000, to make over the rents to the bank of the new building with a further cash payment of not less than $2,000 yearly until the whole is paid off. The bank, as soon as McCrosson has erected the said buildings to release to me the back lot. This would make certain the bank being recouped their whole advance within three years. Respectfully submitted by\nG. MCMICKEN. Upon the 8th of August, 1879, Mr. Gilbert McMicken addressed and sent to the cashier of the bank at Toronto, by the hands of Mr. McCrosson, the following letter:\nWINNIPEG, 8th August, 1879.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Mr. McCrosson having occasion to be in Toronto, will call upon you respecting the proposition I submitted to you of date 10th July for the purchase of the two lots on Main street now under mortgage by me to the bank securing indebtedness of A. McMicken. To the proposition then submitted I have hot heard from you, and hoped when Lt.-Governor Macdonald arrived he would have been able to deal in some measure with it. I think the offer of Mr. McC. a good one for the bank, and it will aid me in so far as I wrote to you. Mr. McC. will now offer a substitutional proposal should the bank prefer it, viz.: Waiving building obligation to pay the bank weekly payments of $100 until the whole sum of $12,700 and interest is paid off.\nI would respectfully urge the acceptance of one or other of these offers of Mr. McC. He is a reliable man in every respect.\nYours truly,\nG. MCMICKEN.\nLieutenant-Governor Macdonald referred to in the above latter was a director in the bank and a friend of Mr. McMicken, and whom Mr. McMicken had been in negotiation with to procure his influence with the board of the bank in support of his applications to the bank in relation to the matter.\nNeither of the above offers was accepted by the bank. It will be observed that in neither of them was; any provision whatever proposed to be made for payment of the amount remaining due to the bank on the judgment recovered against Gilbert McMicken for the sum of $7.707.75 upon which a balance exceeding $4,400 still remained due, the difference having been paid out of the estate of McMicken & Taylor; nor was any provision proposed for payment, of the amounts due upon the two judgments recovered against Gilbert and Alexander McMicken for the several sums of $417.90 and $403.79. The agent of the bank at Winnipeg appears to have been opposed to the acceptance of any arrangement which did not provide for the payment of the whole of the amount remaining due under the said respective judgments as well as of the amount due upon the security of the mortgage, under the apprehension that otherwise the bank would be prejudiced in the recovery of the amount due under the judgments. The negotiations between the McMickens and McCrosson for the purchase by the latter of the two lots Nos. 33 and 34 proceeded so far that one W. H. Ross, a solicitor then practising in Winnipeg, since deceased, was employed to investigate the title to the lots for McCrosson. He appears to have found upon registry in the registry office of the county of Selkirk deeds to the purport and effect following: \u2014\n1st. An indenture bearing date the 1st day of September, A.D. 1877, and registered upon the 1st day of October in that year and purporting to be made between Gilbert McMicken, of the city of Winnipeg,. Esquire, of the first part and Margaret Jane McMicken of the same place, wife of Alexander McMicken of the second part, whereby the said Gilbert McMicken for the expressed consideration of one thousand five hundred dollars therein acknowledged to have been, paid to him by the said Margaret Sarah McMicken, did grant unto her, her heirs and assigns forever, the several pieces of land in the said indenture mentioned,, comprising all of the several parcels of land mentioned in the above recited indenture of the 3rd day of April, 1877, and by that indenture conveyed to Gilbert McMicken by Alexander McMicken, except the lot No. 28 in the block number (3) three in the city of Winnipeg in that indenture mentioned, and comprising also another lot of land not in that indenture of the 3rd of April mentioned, described as being situate on the south side of Notre Dame street in the city of Winnipeg, and as being lot number ten according to a map or plan of the property of one John Shultz, known as lot number two of the Dominion Government surveys of the parish of St. Johns on file in the registry office of the county of Selkirk; 2ndly. An indenture bearing date the 28th day of October, A.D. 1874, registered in the registry office of the county of Selkirk on the 11th day of November, 1874, and purporting to be made between Alexander McMicken, of the first part, and Gilbert McMicken and Sedley Blanchard, of the second part, whereby the said Alexander McMicken for and in consideration of one dollar therein expressed to have been paid to him did grant, bargain, sell and confirm unto them the said Gilbert McMicken and Sedley Blanchard and the survivor of them and the heirs and assigns of such survivor for ever, all that land and premises in the said city of Winnipeg described as follows (the said lots 33 and 34 in block 3), together with all and singular the buildings and improvements to the same belonging or in any wise appertaining; in trust nevertheless and for the uses following and none other, that is to say, for the sole ,and separate use of Margaret Sarah McMicken, the wife of the said Alexander McMicken, party of the first part for and during her natural life, and so as she alone or such person as she shall appoint shall take and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof, and ,so as her said husband shall not in any wise intermeddle therewith, and in case the said Alexander McMicken shall survive his said wife then in trust to reconvey the said lands and premises to him the said Alexander McMicken, his heirs and assigns upon the death of the said Margaret Sarah McMicken; and in case the said Margaret Sarah McMicken shall survive the said Alexander, then upon the death of the said Margaret Sarah McMicken in trust to reconvey the said lands and premises to the lawful heirs of the said Alexander McMicken. Provided, however, that the said trustees or the survivor of them, the heirs, executors or administrators of such survivor, shall hold the said lands and premises upon the further trust to sell and convey the whole or any part of the aforesaid premises and appurtenances to any person or persons and for such sum or sums of money as the said Alexander McMicken and Margaret Sarah McMicken, by writing under their hands and seals, and duly executed at any time during their natural lives, may appoint and direct; and 3rdly. An instrument under the hands and seals of the said Alexander and Margaret Sarah McMicken, bearing date the 21st day of December, A.D. 1874, and registered in the registry office for the county of Selkirk on the 20th day of January, A.D. 1875, in the words following: \u2014\nWe, Alexander McMicken, of the city of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, banker, and Margaret Sarah McMicken, wife of the said Alexander McMicken, under and by virtue of the provision in that behalf, made in a certain deed of trust made by the said Alexander McMicken to you Gilbert McMicken and Sedley Blanchard, both of the city of Winnipeg, Esquires, dated the 28th day of October, A.D. 1874, and duly registered in the registry office in and for the county of Selkirk, in said province of Manitoba, in book 5, folio 261, do hereby authorize, enjoin, empower and direct you, the said Gilbert McMicken and Sedley Blanchard as trustees, under and by virtue of the said indenture of trust to convey, transfer, sell and make over to Alexander McMicken above named, in consideration of the sum of one dollar the lands and premises in said trust deed mentioned and described and conveyed or intended so to be, and to hold the same unto the said Alexander McMicken, his heirs and assigns to his and their own free and absolute use, benefit and behoof for ever.\nWith reference to these two latter instruments Alexander McMicken stated in his evidence that he deeded the lots 33 and 34 to his father and Mr. Blanchard (who was his solicitor and since deceased) as trustees for his wife, and that afterwards he got into difficulty and that Mr. Blanchard and one Mr. McArthur thought it would look better for him to have the property put back into his own name again and that it was done; ultimately he says it was conveyed to his father who, with his consent, gave the mortgage to the bank to secure $12,700. The conveyance to his father was that of the 3rd April, 1877, whereby, for the consideration expressed therein of $1,500, Alexander conveyed to his father not only the said lots Nos. 33 and 34, but all the other property therein mentioned and above detailed. How the registration of these instruments escaped the notice of the solicitor of the bank who had instituted for them the suit against Gilbert McMicken alone for the foreclosure of the mortgage was not explained, the solicitor having died in the year 1881, long prior to the commencement of this suit. It was suggested that the non-discovery of the existence of the deed of the date of the 1st September, 1877, was attributable to the default and neglect of the registrar. But however this may be, the bank first acquired knowledge of the existence of any such deed by the discovery made by Mr. W. H. Ross upon behalf of Mr. McCrosson having been communicated to Mr. Brown, the agent of the bank at Winnipeg upon or immediately before the 20th of September, 1879, upon which day he left Winnipeg on leave for his summer holiday, and did not return until the 16th of October. During his absence a Mr. Smith, an inspector of the bank, discharged his duties and he applied to Mr. Ross who had discovered the deed upon registry and procured from him for the bank his opinion respecting the interests of the bank under the circumstances, which opinion he forwarded to the head office of the Bank at Toronto; meantime the solicitor of the bank in the foreclosure suit against Mr. Gilbert McMicken, finding his proceedings in that suit rendered nugatory by the discovery of the deed of the 1st of September, 1877, fited a new bill of foreclosure against Margaret s. McMicken, the grantee of that deed. The agent of the bank upon his return to Winnipeg, upon the 16th of October, immediately renewed negotiations with Mr. Gilbert McMicken to procure a settlement of the bank\u2019s claim, and he retained Mr. W. H. Ross who had discovered the deed on registry, and since deceased, to act as solicitor of the bank in the matter, who as such solicitor procured the execution of the deed of the 22nd October, 1879, whereby Margaret Sarah McMicken, wife of Alexander McMicken of the city of Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba, and the said Alexander McMicken, of the same place, gentleman, therein described as the parties of the first part, in consideration of the sum of fifteen thousand dollars of lawful money of Canada therein acknowledged to have been paid to them, the said, parties of the first part, did grant unto the Ontario Bank the parties to the said deed of the second part their successors and assigns for ever, lots numbers thirty-three, thirty-four and forty-eight in block three of l he Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s survey, in said city of Winnipeg, to have and to hold to the said parties of the second part to the said deed, their successors and assigns, to and for their sole and only use for ever. And the said parties of the first part did thereby covenant with the said parties of the second part that they had power to convey the said lands to the said parties of the second part, and that the said parties of the second part should have quiet possession of the said lands free from all incumbrances, and that the said parties of the first part would execute such further assurances of the said lands as might be requisite. And the said parties of the first part released to the said parties of the second part all their claims upon the said lands. In order to the perfection of the title purported to be conveyed by the said deed Mr. Ross prepared, and procured to be signed by the said Gilbert and Alexander McMicken, the declaration following: \u2014\nWe, Gilbert McMicken and Alexander McMicken, of the city of Winnipeg in the county of Selkirk, do hereby declare that the conveyance from Alexander McMicken to Gilbert McMicken of lots thirty-three, thirty-four and forty-eight, block 3, H. B. Co. survey, was made for valuable consideration, as Alexander McMicken at that time owed a much larger amount to Gilbert McMicken than the value of the property over and above mortgage to Ontario Bank, and that Gilbert McMicken was not intended to be a trustee for Alex. McMicken, but bon\u00e2 fide absolute owner in fee simple.\n(Signed,) G. MCMICKEN.\n\u201c A. MCMICKEN.\nDated Oct. 22, 1879.\nMr. Ross at the same time procured to be signed by the said Gilbert McMicken, Alexander McMicken and Margaret Sarah McMicken a receipt in the words following: \u2014\nReceived from the Ontario Bank payment in full of all charges, claims or accounts against the Ontario Bank by us, and we hereby release the Ontario Bank from all such charges, claims or accounts now due or accruing due.\nDated at Winnipeg the 22nd day of October, A.D. 1879.\n(Signed,) G. MCMICKEN.\n\u201c A. MCMICKEN.\n\u201c MARGARET S. MCMICKEN.\nAnd at the same time he procured to be signed by the manager of the bank at Winnipeg a receipt in the words following: \u2014\nReceived from Gilbert McMicken and Alexander McMicken payment in full of all charges, claims and accounts whether by judgment or otherwise due by them, or either of them, to the Ontario Bank, save and except a note for nine hundred dollars due by Gilbert McMicken, and we hereby release all such claims.\nDated at Winnipeg the 22nd day of October, A D. 1879.\n(Sgd.) GEORGE BROWN,\nManager. Upon the 12th of November, 1879, Mr. Ross forwarded to the manager of the bank a letter signed in the name of the firm of Ross, Ross and Killam of which he was a member, explaining the reasons why he, as the solicitor employed by the bank in the matter, had taken the precautions which, by the above papers, he appears to have taken in closing the transaction wherein he says: \u2014\nRe MCMICKEN.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Referring to the lands with respect to which we advised Mr. Smith by letter on the 9th ult., we have now at your request to explain the steps since taken to secure the equity of redemption to the bank. Subsequently to our writing that letter, Mr. Alex. McMicken in endeavouring to induce us to accept the title for the party then proposing to purchase from Mrs. McMicken, informed us that it was not correct that Mr. Gilbert McMicken got the property without consideration, but that it was transferred in consideration of a debt due from Alexander to Gilbert McMicken, and on further pressing it appeared from Gilbert McMicken that he really had an interest in the property and only conveyed it to Mrs. McMicken when he, Gilbert, became involved, and in order to prevent its being taken under execution against him, and we have little doubt that Gilbert McMicken\u2019s previous contention that he only held as trustee and had no interest in the property was solely \u0456 or the purpose of preventing its being held for his own liabilities. At any rate we have procured written statements from Mr. and Mrs. Alexander McMicken and Mr. Gilbert McMicken to the effect mentioned which should be sufficient to induce a purchaser to take the title, as Gilbert McMicken\u2019s only liabilities of consequence are to your bank, and any purchaser buying from you for value relying On these statements would be protected. Mr. and Mrs. Alex. McMicken have now by deed duly executed, conveyed these lands to your bank for the expressed consideration of $15,000, but the real consideration is a receipt in full for all debts due the bank from both Alexander and Gilbert McMicken or either of them separately, except a note of Gilbert McMicken\u2019s for $900. This consideration is a good one, and even if it should at any time turn out that the conveyance by Alexander McMicken to Gilbert McMicken was wholly without consideration and simply a blind, this conveyance would merely give a preference over other creditors, and would not on that account be void except under proceedings in insolvency which are hardly likely to be now taken against Alexander McMicken as he has been left alone so long. In every view this is the best arrangement in the bank\u2019s interest that could be made.\nIt is to avoid this deed and wholly to\u05f3 alter its character that the present suit was instituted. The first proceeding taken for this purpose was a bill of complaint filed by the plaintiff on the 7th day of July, 1885, wherein she alleged that on the 17th day of September, 1877, Gilbert McMicken was the owner in fee simple of lots 33, 34 and 48 in block 3 in the Hudson Bay Company\u2019s reserve in the city of Winnipeg, and that by an indenture of that date registered in the registry office of the city of Winnipeg on the 20th day of the said month of September, he conveyed the said lands to the Ontario Bank as collateral security for the payment of three promissory notes made in favour of the bank, amounting in all to $12,700, and interest thereon, and that by an indenture purporting to bear date the 1st day of September, 1877, and registered in the registry office for the city of Winnipeg, the said Gilbert McMicken conveyed all his right, title and interest in and to the above described lands to her the said plaintiff. She then alleged that in the early part of the month of October, 1879, the defendants, namely, the Ontario Bank, made the following proposal to her, to wit:\nThat the plaintiff should convey to the defendants all her right, title and interest whatsoever in and to the said lands and premises in trust for the defendants to sell or otherwise dispose of the same and apply the proceeds of such sale or disposal in and towards, first, the payment of the said three promissory notes amounting in all to $12,700, then the payment of a certain promissory note upon which the said Gilbert McMicken washable to the defendants, and lastly, that whatever surplus there might be after the said four promissory notes were paid out of the proceeds of the sale or disposal as aforesaid of the said lands and premises, should be forthwith paid over to the plaintiff by the defendants.\nShe then alleged that she agreed to that proposal and thereupon executed the deed of the 22nd October, 1879, in which her husband joined her in conveying the said lands and premises to the bank, and she averred that she never would have executed that conveyance if the defendants had not undertaken to pay over to the plaintiff whatever surplus there might be after the said four promissory notes had been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the said lands. And she averred that the lands had been sold and that after payment of the said promissory notes there remained a surplus which the defendants refuse to pay to her, and she prayed for an account and payment to her of such surplus. Upon an examination on oath of the plaintiff on this bill she stated that she conveyed the property to the bank to pay off her husband\u2019s liability to the bank; that there had been a mortgage on the property but that she did not know whether or not it was existing at the time she conveyed to the bank; that she did not know enough of business to tell who made the mortgage; that she supposed it was given by herself; that so far as she remembered she thought it was; that \u04bbe\u0433 husband was indebted to the bank, but that she really did not know whether the mortgage was given to secure that debt or not; that she knew really nothing about the conveyance herself. Being asked what was the arrangements made with the bank, her answer was: that the deed was given to pay off the liability of her husband to the bank; and she added:\nOf course the property was much more valuable than the amount of my husband\u2019s debt, and the arrangement I wished made, and that was talked of, was that: : was to pay my husband\u2019s debt, and then the property was to come back to me, or what was left of it. My father-in-law\u2019s liability was also included in what the property was to be security for.\nBeing asked who talked of this arrangement, she replied that it was her father-in-law; her husband and her solicitor. Being asked whether that arrangement had ever been assented to by the bank, her answer was, \u201cWell, I think it was, that was the understanding so far as I know.\u201d Being asked whether they, by which I understand any officers of the bank, were present at any of these interviews between her father-in-law, her husband and her solicitor, she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Being asked if she could explain why the bank having already a mortgage upon the property required a deed from her, she answered, \u201c I don\u2019t know enough about business to tell you.\u201d Being asked if she knew whether the deed given by her was given to cover any greater indebtedness than was covered by the mortgage, her answer was: \u2014\nI know the deed covered my father-in-law\u2019s debt as well as my husband\u2019s, but I really don\u2019t know enough of business to tell you. I know I owned the property and I know I gave the deed, but I left the business to my husband and my solicitor.\nBeing asked if the bank made a proposal to her to convey to them on the terms set out in the bill, she answered, \u201cNot to me personally, but they did to my husband and solicitor.\u201d\nBeing asked who were present at the time she signed the deed, she answered\u2014\u201cThe late William Ross, George Brown, my husband and myself, and I think my father-in-law, though I am not sure as to him.\u201d\nThe Mr. Ross here mentioned was the solicitor acting for the bank in the matter; George Brown was the bank agent.\nBeing then asked whether anything was said at that time, she answered:\nYes, there was a little conversation. I asked Mr. Brown if he was not going to give me something, a silk dress or something, referring to the old custom, and he said, \u201cNever mind, you\u2019ll get something better than that out of it by-and\u05bebye.\u201d Previous to that there was no conversation.\nBeing asked if anything was said at that meeting as to the property being conveyed in trust, she answered, \u201c Not that I remember.\u201d She said further that \u201c she thought that was the only meeting at which an officer of the bank was present.\nBeing asked if any other documents were signed that day besides the deed, she replied, \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d She did not remember having signed a receipt. She did not remember how often she had signed her name. She remembered giving the deed to relieve her husband and her father-in-law; that she was willing to give the deed because of a conversation of Governor McDonald with her father-in-law in which McDonald assured her father-in-law that the bank only wanted the amount of the debt and that anything over and above that would come back to her, and for that reason she consented to sign the deed. Being asked if she was present at that conversation between Mr. McDonald and her father-in-law, she answered, \u201cno.\u201d Her attention having been drawn to the statement in her bill of complaint that Gilbert McMicken, her father-in-law, was the owner of these lands, she said:\nI don\u2019t think he was the owner. I got the property from my husband; he settled it upon me when he went into business, when it was free from debt and from my liabilities.\nBeing asked where that settlement was she answered that she supposed it was in the registry office. Being asked if she knew of her husband conveying the property in question to her father-in-law in 1877, she answered: \u201c I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about dates.\u201d She did not know that her father-in-law was the absolute owner of the property at any time. She did not think he was. Being asked why Gilbert McMicken conveyed the property to her as stated in the bill in September, 1877 she answered: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d Being asked then how he came to execute that conveyance to her, she answered that she did not know. Being asked if any conversation had passed between him and her for that deed, she replied: \u201cHow do you mean ?\u201d Being asked if she paid him anything, she replied: \u201cOh no, nothing.\u201d She did not know whether he was in difficulty then, in Sep., 1877, or not; she knew of none except that of 1879, when she relieved him and her husband, and being asked again to state the circumstances under which she executed the deed to the bank she replied that it was to relieve her husband and her father-in-law, owing to a debt they then owed the bank, but that it was, so far as she knew, on the understanding that it was only to secure a debt, and what was over was to come back to her, and that she did it on account of what Governor McDonald told her father-in-law. Being asked why she did not have a declaration of trust or something like that when the deed was given, she answered that she left all those things to her husband, that he and her solicitor attended to all her business. The result of that examination of the plaintiff appears to amount simply to this, that she executed the deed impeached to relieve her husband and father-in-law from certain debts they then owed the bank, and that she had herself no personal knowledge of any agreement having been entered into by the bank or any of its officers qualifying the terms of the deed as executed by her. She denies having had any information as to such an agreement having been contemplated or made other than what was received from her father-in-law or her husband; and no reason whatever has been suggested why, if any such agreement had been, made or contemplated, it was not reduced into writing. It is not suggested that the bank or any of its officers objected to the deed being drawn up and expressed in the true terms of the actual agreement between the parties to it. Afterwards and by an order of the 3rd day of October, 1888, that bill was dismissed for non-compliance by the plaintiff therein with another order of the court that she should appoint a next friend to carry on the suit on her behalf; and upon the 28th day of December, 1888, the bill of complaint now under consideration was filed. In that bill the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the equitable relief which she prays for is placed upon a wholly different foundation from that stated in the bill filed by her on the 7th July, 1885. In the bill now under consideration she avers the lease of the 14th June, 1875, by Alexander McMicken of the lots 33 and 34 in block 3, to the Ontario Bank, and that by indenture dated the 23rd April, 1877, Alexander McMicken conveyed the same lots and lot No. 48 in the said block 3, to Gilbert McMicken in fee, then the mortgage of the 17th September, 1877, by Gilbert McMicken to the bank in security for the principal sum of $12,700. She then avers that by indentures dated on or about the first day of October, 1877, Gilbert McMicken granted and conveyed the same lands to her in fee. Then in the 8th paragraph of her bill she alleges the recovery by the bank on the 24th of November, 1877, of a judgment for $7,707.75 against Gilbert McMicken as endorser upon paper of McMicken and Taylor, and that Gilbert McMicken transferred certain chattel property of McMicken and Taylor which Gilbert held under a chattel mortgage as security for his endorsing the paper of the said firm, the proceeds of which chattel property she avers the bank did receive or should have received. She then avers the insolvency of McMicken and Taylor and the receipt by the bank of a dividend of 40 cents in the dollar out of their estate applicable to payment of the said judgment. She then in the 12th and 13th paragraphs of her bill alleges the particular grounds upon which her claim for the relief prayed is founded, as follows: \u2014 12. In or about the month of October, 1879,the defendants, the Ontario Bank, through the defendant Brown acting as their agent and manager by falsely representing to your complainant that if said judgment against the defendant Gilbert McMicken was not paid off or secured every means of recovering the full amount thereof would be taken, and that the said defendant, Gilbert McMicken, would be harassed and pressed for payment in every possible way, and that proceedings of a serious nature \u00a1against the defendant Gilbert McMicken would be taken, also falsely alleging that the full amount of the said judgment was still due to the defendants the Ontario Bank, and concealing the fact that the defendants, the Ontario Bank, held any security for payment of the judgment set forth in the 8th paragraph of this bill of complaint or that they had been paid any moneys on account thereof, on the 22nd day of October, 1879, induced your \u0441omplainant to execute to the defendants the Ontario Bank the deed of the said lots 33, 34 and 48 on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth in order to save said defendant Gilbert McMicken from being harassed and annoyed as aforesaid.\n13. The deed mentioned in the last preceding paragraph pretended to be executed for the consideration therein expressed of $15,000 then paid by the defendants the Ontario Bank to your complainant, the receipt whereof your complainant thereby pretended to acknowledge and purported to convey with the Ordinary covenants of title an absolute estate in fee simple, free from incumbrances to the defendants the Ontario Bank, whereas in fact no money was then or at any other time paid to your complainant by the defendants the Ontario Bank, and the said deed, though absolute in form, was intended to be and is a mortgage to secure to the defendants the Ontario Bank the judgment set forth in the 8th paragraph of this bill of complaint and was executed for no other purpose whatever.\nShe then in the 17th paragraph of her bill alleged that the bank took possession of the lands leased to them by Alexander McMicken by the lease of the 14th June, 1875, in the 3rd paragraph of the bill mentioned and since the execution of the mortgage by Gilbert McMicken to the bank, in the 5th paragraph of the bill mentioned, have paid no rent under said lease to any one entitled thereto, but since the execution of said mortgage have been in possession of the lands leased as mortgagees in possession; and in the 18th paragraph of the bill she alleges that the bank, with the assent of the complainant and after consultation with her, have sold portions of the said lands and have received as purchase money and rents more than enough to pay any moneys they may be entitled to on said mortgage by Gilbert McMicken, and any moneys that may be due to them, if any, on the judgment set forth in the 8th paragraph of said bill. And the bill prays that it may be declared that the deed set forth in the 12th paragraph of the bill, that is the deed of the 22nd of October, 1879, was intended to be and is a mortgage to secure the moneys due on said judgment, and that the complainant may be let in to redeem the said lands remaining unsold, and that the defendants, the Ontario Bank, may be ordered to reconvey to the complainant the said lands on payment of any moneys that may be found due and owing to the defendants, the Ontario Bank, under and by virtue of said judgment and said mortgage; and that in the event of the said deed of the 22nd October, 1879, not being held to be a mortgage that it may be declared that the said deed was obtained from complainant by fraudulent and false representations, and on that ground should be declared void and set aside and that it may be declared invalid and void as being\u2019 in contravention of the charter of the bank and the several acts of the Dominion of Canada relating to banks and banking; or that, in default of such relief being granted, that the bank may be ordered to pay to complainant the sum of $15,000; and that the defendant George Brown and the defendants the Ontario Bank may be ordered to pay to the complainant any profits received by them or either of them by reason of the sale of any portion of the mortgaged premises.\nThe plaintiff was examined as a witness on her own behalf in support of the relief claimed in this her bill of complaint, and upon her examination in chief she stated that she did not remember any transaction in the year 1879 in relation to the property in question only that she gave the deed to the bank; that previously to giving that deed she had not personally any conversation with any person relating to the giving of the deed, but that her husband on two or three occasions which she mentioned in the summer of 1879 had conversations in her presence with the defendant Brown, and being asked to state the substance of such conversations she answered:\nMy father-in-law owed the bank, and Mr. Brown wanted a deed given of this property to pay off the debt of my husband and my father-in-law, and that it would make all things smooth and it would relieve my father-in-law of his liability and make alb things smooth and right, and that he was constantly pressed by the authorities in Toronto, the heads of the bank.\nAnd being asked if Mr. Brown had said anything else she answered: \u201c No, I don\u2019t remember anything\u2014that was the conversation\u2014and she added, \u201c and of course anything that was over and above \u201d when she was interrupted by her counsel asking: \u201cWas the property to be sold?\u201d To which she replied, \u201cYes, Mr. McDonald having been up here, assured my father-in-law \u201d\u2014and her stating anything which Mr. McDonald may have assured her father-in-law being objected to she was asked by her counsel. \u201c What was the conversation ?\u201d\nShe answered:\nHe wanted me to give the deed to the bank for these two debts, and that all over and above would come back to me after the property was sold. Being asked: How came you to sign this deed at all ? She answered: My husband asked me to sign it. Being then asked: Did you sign more than this deed ? She answered, I signed other papers; I don\u2019t know what they were, but I signed everything else that, I was asked to sign on that occasion.\nShe said further that with the exception of the occasion of her signing the deed she had personally no transaction with the bank or any of its officers in relation to the matter, To a question put to her in the following form: \u201c You say this deed was not read over to you at the time it was signed ?\u201d she answered, \u201c I don\u2019t think it was. I am sure it was not.\u201d She added that the transaction was not explained to her in any way\u2014that she simply did what her husband told her.\nOn her cross-examination she said that she did not remember having ever heard that her husband conveyed the property in question 10 her father-in-law in 1877. She did not know that her father-in-law had mortgaged the property to the bank. She had heard of mortgages and deeds and all that but could not tell anything about them. When she executed the deed to\u05f3 the bank she knew that there was a mortgage on the property for a debt of her husband\u2019s of $12,000, but she knew nothing about her father-in-law having conveyed the property to her. She did not remember having ever been consulted about that. She first heard in 1879 of the mortgage that was given to the bank for her husband\u2019s debt. I She had not been consulted about that, that her husband attended to her business and did not consult her about anything much; that he attended to all her business and that she did not know anything about the deeds\u2014that he never consulted her. Being then shown the declaration signed by her husband and father-in-law on the 22nd of October, 1879, upon the occasion of the execution of the deed she professed to know nothing at all about it. She admitted that her husband knew more about the ownership of property than she knew herself; she could give no explanation as to how her husband signed that declaration; and being thereupon asked whether as between him and her he would not be more correct than she was, she answered., \u201cin business matters I know very little about.\u201d She left all her business with her husband. The deed was given as she supposed to pay off both the debt of her husband and of her father-in-law, that is, the two debts already spoken of the mortgage and the judgment; she understood the deed was to pay those two debts. Then her examination upon former occasions is produced. She is shown one wherein she had said that she never heard Mr. Brown speak of the terms upon which the deed was to be given; she admitted her signature to the examination and she said that she supposed that that meant she had not personally. Then she said that she did not remember that a deed was mentioned but that he wished to have the payment of the debt attended to; but she did not remember that the giving of the deed or the terms upon which it should be given was specifically referred to. The instructions for the former suit she said were given by her husband but with her consent. She did not remember whether she accompanied him or not when he gave instructions to the solicitor, but she did not think that she did. Then with reference to a stable on lot 48 which she said she occupied for some time after the execution of the deed of the 22nd October, 1879, she said there was no agreement whatever with the bank that she should so use it. She \u201cjust stayed there\u201d she said, that is to say, her husband who, lived some distance off kept a horse there for some time.\nShe said that she never had any conversation or interview with Mr. Brown or any other officer of the bank about giving the deed; that Mr. Brown had spoken to her husband in her presence about the matter in the summer of 1879. Being asked how she had heard him speak about the giving a deed, she replied, \u201c Not often of the deed, I was speaking more of the liability than of the deed. I heard Mr. Brown talking of the debt;\u201d and again that \u201c he wished to have the paying of the debt attended to; \u201d and again that \u201c he was pressing to have papa\u2019s liability attended to.\u201d She did not remember that the terms upon which a deed should be given was ever specially referred to. She said in fact that:\nWhat she understood was that the deed when given would pay her husband\u2019s and her father-in-law\u2019s liability, and her father-in-law told her that Governor McDonald had assured him that all the bank wanted was their money and that when the property was sold everything over that debt would be returned to her, and upon that understanding she signed the deed.\nThe plaintiff has, in my opinion, wholly failed to establish her contention. I do not think it necessary to review the cases in which parol evidence has been received to qualify and cut down a deed of conveyance of land which is absolute in its terms into a mortgage. In cases of this kind, as is laid down by the Privy Council in Holmes v. Matthews ([5]), the onus rests altogether upon the appellant not only to rebut the presumption that the title as appearing in the written instrument is in perfect accordance with the intention of the parties, but he must also establish to the satisfaction of the appellate court that the judgment of the court below adverse to his contention is erroneous. In Rose v. Hickey ([6]), decided in this court in 1880, we held that the evidence necessary for this purpose must be of the clearest and most conclusive and unquestionable character. It will be sufficient to refer to the facts of the case of Lincoln v. Wright (3) and the judgment therein as the case ordinarily relied upon in illustration of the principles upon which the court proceeds in cases of this nature and of the evidence required to justify the court in declaring a deed absolute on its face to be different from what its terms represent it to be. In Lincoln v. Wright certain real property of the plaintiff, together with a policy of insurance effected by him upon his own life, were under mortgage as security for a loan to the plaintiff. The mortgage deed contained a power of sale by the mortgagee. The mortgaged property consisted of seven cottages, in one of which the plaintiff himself resided, a chapel or meeting-house and six acres of land. The\u055d plaintiff\u2019, while the mortgage was current, executed a deed whereby he conveyed and assigned all his estate and effects to one Gamble upon trust for the benefit of his creditors. Afterwards the mortgagee caused the property to be put up for sale under the power in his mortgage, but no sale was effected. Shortly afterwards Gamble was informed by his solicitors, who were also solicitors for the mortgagee, that the mortgagee had been offered \u00a3220 for the property, and that unless a higher price could be obtained it would be sold at that price. The bill stated that thereupon Gamble communicated with the plaintiff who at once went to \u0430 Mr. Wright since deceased, the father of the defendant, his daughter, and asked him to purchase the property for the plaintiff upon the terms that Mr. Wright should be repaid the purchase money and interest out of the rents of the cottages and chapel, and that he should also allow the plaintiff to continue in the occupation of the house and land which he then occupied. On the evening of the following day the plaintiff and Gamble called on Mr. Wright, who told Gamble that the plaintiff had been asking him to buy the property for the family of the plaintiff, and he was anxious to know if the money would be safe. Gamble in reply assured him that it would, and pointed out the mode in which: he could repay himself with interest, and Mr. Wright then agreed to purchase the plaintiff\u2019s interest, which; was a life interest in the mortgaged property, and the said policy of life insurance in behalf of and for the benefit of the plaintiff on the terms that Wright should pay \u00a3230 as purchase money and retain the rents of the cottages and chapel, and apply the same towards liquidating or reimbursing to himself the said sum of \u00a3230, and that in the meantime the plaintiff should pay interest and retain possession of the messuage then occupied by him and pay the premiums to accrue due on the policy, Gamble then added that it would be necessary to raise, the rents of the other cottages, and that this with the income from the chapel would enable the plaintiff to pay \u00a350 yearly in liquidation of the sum advanced. This arrangement was communicated to the mortgagee who acquiesced in it and the bill alleged that Mr. Wright, upon the 24th October, 1855, became the purchaser upon the terms and conditions above mentioned. From the time of the contract the plaintiff continued to reside in the house in which he had before resided and never paid any rent but he paid all taxes. He also regularly paid the premiums on the policy, except one in June, 1858, which he also would have paid but that he learned that it had been paid by some person acting on behalf of the defendant without any request on his part; when the premium for 1856 was due the plaintiff received a note from Mr. Wright informing him that the same must be paid without delay. Towards the end of the year 1855 Mr. Gamble had a conversation with Mr. Wright which led the former to suspect that Wright meant to depart from the arrangement and to claim the property as his own, and he thereupon wrote to Wright a letter reminding him of the original terms and stating his suspicions, in answer to which letter Wright wrote to Gamble as follows: \u2014\nJanuary 8th, 1886.\nSIR,\u2014I do not understand the purport of your note. You and Lincoln cannot have forgotten the conditions on which I purchased the life interest, namely, that I would allow him and his family the use of the house and land, paying therefor the policy and other outgoings, and that I would take the cottages and the meeting-house, commonly called a chapel, into my own hands, and that he should pay for the furniture by instalments. These are the conditions I named to Mr. Brown and several other neighbours even before I made the purchase. The deed which the society holds from Lincoln, Mr. Partridge has informed me, is null and void. The rent I have fixed upon is \u00a310 a year to be paid in advance commencing on the day of purchase.\nYours obediently,\nJOSEPH WRIGHT.\nOn the 15th June, 1856, Mr. Wright wrote to a member of the religious society which had previously rented the chapel the following letter: \u2014\nSIR,\u2014You no doubt may be aware that I have purchased the life interest of Mr. John Lincoln, allowing him the house in which he lives and the land rent free for the benefit of his wife and young children, keeping in my possession the cottages and the meeting-house, commonly called a chapel, upon the latter of which I have fixed a rent of \u00a310 per year to be paid in advance, commencing on the 24th October, 1855, the day on which the purchase was made.\nMr. Wright died at the end of the year 1856, and by his will he devised all his real estate to his daughter the defendant, then under age, and he appointed one Thomas Beck her guardian and sole executor of his will. Mr. Wright had received the rents during his life, and since his death they had been received by Mr. Beck, his daughter\u2019s guardian. After Mr. Wright\u2019s death Mr. Beck offered to allow the plaintiff \u00a310 a year for his life if he would give up the house and land. The bill alleged that this offer was a repetition of one which had been made by Mr. Wright in his lifetime. Upon the plaintiff refusing Beck\u2019s offer he, as a next friend of Miss Wright, instituted an action of ejectment against Lincoln, who thereupon filed his bill praying for an injunction and a decree that Wright had purchased the premises as trustee for the plaintiff, and that upon payment to Wright\u2019s representatives of what was due to them they might be decreed to convey and assign the property and the policy to the plaintiff. Now with reference to the case as alleged in that bill, the agreement upon which it was alleged Wright had purchased the premises for and on behalf of the plaintiff was most unequivocally proved by Mr. Gamble, a perfectly disinterested witness, whose narrative of which had taken place left no doubt and could leave no doubt as to the truth of the allegations in the bill. This fact was dwelt upon by V. C. Kindersley, who heard the case, and who was of opinion that the letters of Wright were consistent with that agreement and supported the plaintiff\u2019s case. Referring to the facts of the case he said: \u2014\nThe agreement was clearly proved by the plaintiff and Gamble who was a disinterested witness, and the letters of Wright were consistent with it.\nThe fact that the plaintiff also paid the premiums on the policy was a strong circumstance in support of the plaintiff\u2019s case, as in perfect accordance with the agreement established by the disinterested witness Gamble. A decree was accordingly made as prayed. Upon appeal Lord Justice Turner said: \u2014\nThe question was whether there has been such an agreement as the bill alleged. His mind was satisfied that there had been, the questions deposed to as having been put by Mr. Wright whether the investment would be safe, whether the interest would be regularly paid and the arrangement for repaying the principal out of the surplus interest and other similar particulars, satisfied his mind even more than if the evidence had been more positively direct. If no such agreement existed to what could Mr. Beckes offer of \u00a310 a year be ascribed. The case was not one of mere trust but of equitable fraud.\nIt is to be observed that the complainant in no part of her evidence has asserted that after the return of Mr. Brown to Winnipeg on the 16th October, 1879, she was present at any interview between him and her husband or her father-in-law, or any other person in relation to the matter excepting the one occasion of her executing the deed which she did, as she says, because her husband asked her. Upon that occasion also she signed the receipt of that date together with her husband and father-in-law at the direction and request of her husband. Now as to the conversations which she speaks of as having taken place in the summer of 1879, there does not appear to be any reason to entertain any doubt that, while these conversations are alleged to have taken place, neither Mr. Brown nor the bank had any knowledge that the plaintiff had or claimed to have any estate in the lands in question which the bank were proceeding in court to foreclose as the property of Gilbert McMicken alone who had executed the mortgage; these conversations therefore must have, as indeed the plaintiff in her cross-examination admits, related wholly to Mr. Brown\u2019s pressing to get Gilbert McMicken\u2019s liability upon the judgment against him as endorser of McMicken and Taylor\u2019s property paid as well as his mortgage debt for the recovery of which the foreclosure proceedings were pending, and to the difference upon that subject existing between Mr. Brown and him as appearing in Mr. Gilbert McMicken\u2019s correspondence with the bank. The reference made to what Gilbert McMicken alleged had taken place between himself and Governor McDonald, who appears to have been supposed to have had some influence with the board of directors of the bank, to procure them to take Mr. McMicken\u2019s view of the propositions made by him instead of the view which appears to have been taken by the Winnipeg manager of the bank appears to have been the sole foundation for the plaintiff\u2019s expectation, if she ever did expect, to receive any surplus of the value of the mortgaged property if any should remain after payment of what was due to the bank in virtue of the mortgage and said judgment. In connection with these alleged conversations it is not to be lost sight of that the representations alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s, letter as having been made to her by Mr. Brown, and which are there made to be the sole foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim entirely, are in both of the letters filed by her, the instructions for which must have been given by the plaintiff and her husband (or perhaps by her husband alone), stated to have been made \u201c in the month of October, 1879,\u201d while it appears that Mr. Brown was not in Winnipeg from the 20th September until the 16th October, and the deed was executed on the 22nd \u2014six days after his return. Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that the allegation in the bill of the delivery to Mr. Brown and the sale by him, and the receipt by him of the proceeds of the value of, the chattel property assigned to Gilbert McMicken by McMicken and Taylor by way of security to him for endorsing their paper, is proved to be without foundation by Gilbert McMicken himself who gave evidence that that property was left by him to be dealt with in the insolvency of McMicken and Taylor as their property out of which the bank received their dividend of 40 cents equally as all other creditors of the firm.\nMr. Ross, the solicitor acting for the bank in the matter of the deed of October, 1879, and who is since deceased, appears, in view of the relationship between the parties appearing on the registry to have been from time to time owners of the property, and in view of the consideration appearing on the deeds by which the property thereby conveyed was conveyed from the one to the other, to have taken not unnecessary or unreasonable precautions in procuring the execution of the deed, and of the other documents required by him to be signed at the same time for the purpose of protecting the bank from any claim being thereafter made in respect of the property either by Gilbert McMicken, Alexander McMicken or his wife, the present plaintiff. She had no better title to the mortgaged lots than she had to all the other property purported to be conveyed to her by the deed executed to her by Gilbert McMicken. That she paid nothing whatever by way of consideration for that deed is admitted by herself. She could not say why that deed was executed. She did not seem to know that it ever had been executed. The solicitor, Mr. Ross; appears to have had abundant reason to doubt the validity of that deed, and if invalid it is plain that the plaintiff had no title to the property. Under these circumstances her readiness to sign without inquiry whatever her husband should direct her to sign is easily understood. However Mr. Ross acted apparently with great prudence in requiring Gilbert McMicken and Alexander to sign the statement as to title which they declared to be true, as appears in the exhibit 42, and to get them and the present plaintiff to sign the receipt contained in exhibit 43 executed at the same time as the deed, for by that receipt all claims as to the rent payable under the lease which had been credited by the bank on the account kept with the mortgage debt were effectually determined whether such rent belonged in truth either to Alexander McMicken alone in whole or in part, or to Gilbert, or to the present plaintiff to whom it is clear that it did, in point of fact, belong ever since the date of the deed from Gilbert McMicken to her if Gilbert McMicken\u2019s own title and his conveyance to her could be held to have been executed bon\u00e2 fide for value. Again it is to be observed that in no part of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is there any pretense that Mr. Brown ever made the allegations and representations alleged in the 12th paragraph of her bill, and which are made the corner stone of the foundation upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief is in her bill rested. True it is that Alexander McMicken alleges that in August, 1879, Mr. Brown did promise him that if the bank got a deed of the property, and if upon its being sold it should realize more than enough to pay the two debts, the balance should come to his wife. He also says that on the morning that the deed was executed he finally made an arrangement with Mr. Brown that his, Alexander\u2019s, wife should sign the deed upon the distinct understanding that she should receive any surplus in the event of there being any after payment of said two debts out of the proceeds of the sale of the lands.\nNow it sufficiently, I think, appears upon the evidence that Alexander McMicken is in reality the person interested in this action, and that it is he who is carrying it on, in the name it is true of his wife, but for his own benefit, although he is named on the record as a defendant. His evidence then must be regarded as that of a person most deeply interested; and when given for the purpose of varying the terms and effect of a deed deliberately signed by himself without any explanation being offered as to why what he alleges to have been the true terms upon which the deed was given were not reduced into writing must be received with the greatest caution and indeed suspicion. He was aware of the foreclosure proceedings taken against Gilbert McMicken on the mortgage. It was after the decree nisi was obtained in that suit that Gilbert McMicken was endeavouring to make the terms with the bank which appear in his letters, while Brown, the agent of the bank, was pressing to get a settlement of the amount due under the judgment, as well as that due under the mortgage. As I have already observed there is no reason to doubt the truth of the fact alleged by Mr. Brown, that neither the bank nor he had any knowledge that the plaintiff claimed to have any interest in the property until the discovery of the deed on registry from Gilbert to her by Mr. Ross as solicitor for McCrosson on the occasion of his investigating the title with a view to negotiations between Gilbert and Alexander McMicken and McCrosson for the sale by Gilbert to McCrosson if they could obtain the concurrence of the bank. This discovery appears to have been first communicated to Mr. Brown immediately before his leaving Winnipeg on the 20th September, 1879. During the whole of the summer of that year Mr. Gilbert McMicken was dealing with the property, and was dealt with by the bank, as being sole owner of the equity of redemption therein. It seems, therefore, difficult to conceive that during the period Brown was negotiating with Alexander McMicken as representing his wife as true owner of that equity of redemption, and was making propositions to him or agreements with him founded upon the fact that his wife was the owner of the equity of redemption in the property mortgaged by Gilbert McMicken to the bank. I must say that, in my opinion, no reliance can be placed upon any of the evidence given to that effect.\nThen with reference to what is alleged by Alexander to have taken place on the morning of the 22nd October, what he alleges took place then is, that what was said was said as in repetition merely of something alleged to have been previously agreed upon in the summer. He offers no reason whatever why, if that was the arrangement, it was not reduced into writing. There is no suggestion that the bank or their agent, Mr. Brown, wished that the true terms of the transaction should not appear in writing; however, Mr. Brown says that the arrangement as to the giving of the deed was not made with Alexander McMicken at all, but that it was made between him and Mr. Gilbert McMicken, and that the agreement was that the bank should have a deed of the property in liquidation of the whole indebtedness, irrespective of a note of $900.00 which was Gilbert\u2019s own personal indebtedness. I may here repeat that there is no evidence that Mr. Brown ever claimed or asserted that the whole of the amount recovered by the judgment against Gilbert McMicken as endorser of the McMicken and Taylor paper still remained due, nor is there any reason to infer that either Gilbert or Alexander was ignorant that the bank had received the dividend of 40 cents in the dollar, declared out of the estate of McMicken and Taylor in insolvency and for which the bank had given credit on the judgment. Now this agreement alleged by Brown to have been made with him by Gilbert McMicken is the very one which was in terms subsequently carried out by Mr. Ross. Mr. Brown also says that when he and Gilbert McMicken made the above agreement Gilbert went out of his Brown\u2019s office to see Alexander, and to arrange to have the deed drawn, and we have the evidence of a young man then a student in the office of Mr. Ross who was acting in the matter as solicitor of the bank, that Alexander McMicken came to Mr. Ross\u2019s office and had an interview with Mr. Ross, and that he then gave instructions for preparation of the deed, saying that\nhe was giving the bank the property, and that they were to release their claims against his father and himself, and that he wanted the deed drawn and sent across the river.\nThereupon it appears that Mr. Ross, in view it would seem of the doubtful state of the title, required the transaction to be closed by the execution of the several documents which accompanied the deed, and which were prepared by himself in his own handwriting. It is true that Alexander McMicken denies that he did give instructions for the preparation of the deed as alleged by the witness who testified to that effect, but as the onus lies upon the parties who seek to vary the terms and effect of a deed deliberately executed by themselves it is sufficient to say that after the death of the solicitor who prepared and required the documents accompanying the deed to be signed, and after the death of the sole witness to the execution of the deed, there would be no security whatever in transactions affecting the transfer of the absolute interest in real estate if a court should interfere, upon such evidence as is given by the interested parties here, to vary the title as appearing in the documents so prepared and signed by the parties who now allege that those documents do not represent the intention of the parties.\nIn my opinion the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Kennedy & O\u2019Reilly.\nSolicitors for respondents, the Ontario Bank and Brown: Richards & Bradshaw.\nSolicitor for respondents McMickens: J.

S.C.R 446) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2] in favour of the defendants.\nThe plaintiff was assignee of one Morrison under an assignment for the general benefit of creditors and the action was brought to set aside a mortgage of a farm given by Morrison to the defendant McDonald a month before the assignment. The plaintiff claimed that this mortgage was void as a preference under R.S.O. (1887) ch. 124 sec. 2. The defendant McDonald had, before the action was brought, assigned the mortgage to the defendant Heffernan and plaintiff claimed as an alternative payment from McDonald of the proceeds of the assignment.\nThe facts proved on the trial were that Morrison was indebted to the defendant McDonald on certain pro- missory notes and wishing to leave the province of Ontario and go to Manitoba he proposed to give McDonald a mortgage on his farm for the amount and a further advance, McDonald having previously demanded payment of his debt. This arrangement was carried out. At the time Morrison knew that he was unable to pay his debts in full but as his credit had always remained good McDonald believed him to be solvent.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Street who gave judgment for the defendants on the ground that McDonald had no knowledge of the insolvent condition of his debtor when he took the mortgage. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision following Molsons Bank v. Halter[3] which had, then, just been decided. The plaintiff appealed.\nGarrow Q.C. for the appellant. This case differs from Molsons Bank v. Halter3 and Stephens v. McArthur[4] in two respects; there was no pressure and the whole estate of the debtor was assigned to McDonald.\nAs to what constitutes pressure see Long v. Hancock[5]; Brayley v. Ellis[6]; Ex parte Griffith[7]. And as to the effect of assigning the whole estate see Ex parte Fisher[8]; In re Baum[9]; Davies v. Gillard[10].\nLash Q.C. for the respondent McDonald and McDonald Q.C. for respondent Heffernan cited Stuart v. Tremain[11]; McMaster v. Clare[12].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I did not take part in the judgment of this court in the case of Molsons Bank v. Halter3. I have most carefully read the judgments delivered in that case. Had I been unable to arrive at a conclusion in consonance with that come to by the majority of the court I should have felt myself bound to follow that decision, but I am happy to say, after a careful consideration of the case, that I entirely agree with the reasoning of my brother Strong and the conclusion at which he arrived.\nThat case disposes of the present in which there was no concurrence of intent, on the one side to give and on the other to accept, a preference over other creditors, inasmuch as there is nothing to show that the defendant was aware of the insolvency of the debtor, and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest any bad faith or collusion between the defendant and his debtor.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs, my reasons for this conclusion being that pressure having been proved there was not a preference such as the statute avoids. Having already in the cases of Molsons Bank v. Halter[13] and Stephens v. McArthur[14] stated my opinion as to the proper meaning and construction of the statute I do hot feel called upon to repeat them again. Moreover I consider the question settled and concluded so far as authority goes by the decisions of this court in the two cases referred to.\nTASCHEREAU and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The decisions of this court in Molsons Bank v. Halter13 and in Stephens v. McArthur14 settle the questions of law in this case against the appellant, and it has been found that there was not in fact any intent to prefer. Therefore the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Dickson & Hays.\nSolicitor for respondent McDonald: F.

C. c. 35.\nAn action will not lie against the Crown for breach of a contract for carrying mails for nine months at the rate of $10,000 a year, made by parol with the Postmaster-General, and accepted by the contractor by letter, notwithstanding it was partly performed, as, if a permanent contract, being for a larger sum than $1,000 it could not be made without the authority of an order in council and if temporary it was revocable at the will of the Postmaster-General.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Exchequer[1] in favour of the respondent.\nThe suppliant, as agent of a steamship company, had tendered for the contract to carry the mails between St. John, N.B. and Digby, N.S. His tender was not accepted but the Postmaster-General verbally agreed to allow him to carry the mails until a contract should be made for the service which offer the suppliant accepted by the following letter:\u2014\nOTTAWA, Ont., 30th October, 1888.\nTo the Honourable John Haggart, Postmaster-General:\nSir,\u2014I beg to state that I hereby accept your proposition to carry Her Majesty's mails between St. John and Digby and Annapolis upon usual conditions, and at and upon the same price as has been subsisting between your department and the Nova Scotia Steamship Company, temporarily, that is, for a period of nine months, subject, as usual, to cancellation at an earlier period if deemed necessary by your department.\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) ROBERT B. HUMPHREY,\nOn behalf of N.B. and N.S.SS.Co.\nThe price formerly paid for the service was $10,000 per annum and the usual cancellation referred to was on giving six months notice, of the intention of the department to terminate the contract.\nThe suppliant carried the mails under this agreement for some two months when the department notified him that the agreement was at an end, and the mails were thenceforth carried by a government steamer.\nThe suppliant, by petition of right, claimed damages from the Crown for breach of contract claiming that he had expended considerable money in preparing steamers to carry the mails. The case was tried at St. John, N.B., when judgment was given for the suppliant and a reference ordered to assess the damages.\nOn application of the Crown the case was reopened and further evidence by the Postmaster-General and his deputy submitted, when the previous decision was reversed and judgment given for the Crown. The suppliant appealed.\nPugsley Q.C., Solicitor General of New Brunswick, for the appellant.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Assuming a contract was entered into between the Postmaster-General as alleged by the suppliant, had the Postmaster-General power to bind the Crown by such a contract? This depends on the statutory authority conferred on the Postmaster-General by R. S. C. cap. 35, by which the power of the Postmaster-General to make contracts for the carriage of mails is governed and to the provisions of which every contract or arrangement for the carriage of mails to bind the Crown must conform.\nSections 54, 60 and 62 of the act provide as follows:\nMAIL CONTRACTS AND CONTRACTORS.\n54. The Postmaster-General, before entering into any contract for carrying the mail involving an annual cost of more than two hundred dollars, shall give at least six weeks previous notice by advertisement in such newspapers as he selects in each case, and by public notices put up in the principal post offices concerned in such contract,\u2014that such contract is intended to be made, and of the day on which tenders for the same will be, by him, received.\n2. The contracts, in all cases in which there is more than one tender, shall be awarded to the lowest tenderer who offers sufficient security for the faithful performance of the contract, unless the Postmaster-General is satisfied that it is for the interest of the public not to accept the lowest tender.\n60. The Postmaster-General may, with or without previous advertisement, contract with any railway or steamboat company for conveying the mail; but no contract involving the payment of a larger sum than one thousand dollars shall be entered into without the approval of the Governor in Council.\n62. The Postmaster-General may make temporary contracts for such services until a regular letting in the form prescribed can take place.\nThis contract in this case was, as appears by the suppliant's letter of acceptance, only temporary and, as such, terminable when a regular contract was entered into as provided by sec. 62. If not, being for a larger sum than $1,000 the Postmaster General had no authority to enter into it without the approval of the Governor in Council.\nSTRONG J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument. I was of opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court was clearly right, and subsequent consideration has not led me to alter this opinion.\nUnder R.S.C. cap. 35 sec. 60 the Postmaster-General had no power to enter into such a contract as this, without an order in council, save under the authority conferred by sec. 62, which is expressly confined to a temporary contract until a permanent contract should be effected. The Postmaster-General treated this as a temporary contract under sec. 62 and accordingly put an end to it so soon as he had effected a regular permanent contract. In this he was clearly within the terms of the statute. The contract stated in the suppliant's letter of 30th October, 1888, expressly recognizes it as being a temporary contract and one which might be put an end to at an earlier period than nine months at the election of the Postmaster-General. I can see no ground whatever for doubting that this contract is referrible only to the powers conferred by sec. 62 and that it was consequently terminable at the will of the Crown. The words \"subject as usual to cancellation at an earlier period if deemed necessary\" indicate as strongly as words can that such was its meaning. Further, I am unable to see any reason for implying from the words just quoted any condition that the cancellation should be in any particular terms or otherwise than absolute at the pleasure of the Postmaster-General.\nThe appeal wholly fails and must be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Whether it was or was not prudent in the appellant to enter into a contract in the terms of his letter of the 30th October, 1888, if the receipt of that letter and the manner in which it was dealt with by the Post Office Department constituted a contract in the terms of the letter, is not the question. In my opinion it was not in the power of the Postmaster-General to enter into such a contract, that is to say for a definite period of nine months and exceeding $1,000, and further that if the letter is to be construed as containing the terms of the contract which the appellant did enter into with the Postmaster-General, it was terminable at the pleasure of the department and therefore that this appeal should be dismissed. I am of opinion further that the learned Judge of the Exchequer Court came to a correct conclusion when he held that the Postmaster-General had not entered into a contract with the appellant for the period of nine months or for any definite period. The intention of the department was, there can I think be no doubt, to enter into an arrangement purely temporary in accordance with the usual practice of the department as to which practice the evidence offered was admissible and should have been received.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I do not see how to get over the limitation contained in section 60 of the Postal Service Act[2] which requires the approval of the Governor in Council whenever the contract involves the payment of a larger sum than $1,000. That limitation of the authority of the Postmaster-General seems to apply to temporary contracts effected under section 62 as well as to what that section calls a regular letting in the form prescribed. We have not, therefore, the duty of construing the contract on which the appellant relies, but I may say for myself that I see no great difficulty in holding that it was a contract for nine months, subject to be cancelled at an earlier period if necessary, and I do not think any necessity for its cancellation is shown.\nThe absence of the order in council makes it necessary to dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W. Pugsley.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor, Hogg & Balderson.\n[1] 2 Can. Ex. C. R. 386.\n[2] R.S.C. ch. 35.\n"}

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Maintenance of county buildings\u2014Establishment of county courthouse and jail\u2014Right to remove from shire town.\nBy R.S.N.S. 5th Ser. c. 20 s. 1, as amended by 49 V. c. 11, \"county or district jails, court houses and sessions houses may be established, erected and repaired by order of the municipal councils in the respective municipalities.\" In 1891 an act was passed empowering the municipality of Lunenburg to borrow a sum not exceeding $20,000 \"for the purpose of erecting and furnishing a court house and jail for the county of Lunenburg, or repairing and improving the present courthouse in said county\" provision being made for the municipality of Chester and the town of Lunenburg (separate corporations in said county) respectively contributing towards payment of said loan.\nThe town of L. is the shire town of said county where the sittings of the Supreme Court are held as required by statute, and where the county court house and jail had always been situated. In pursuance of the above authority to borrow the council of the municipality, by resolution, proposed to build a court house and jail at B. another town in the county, intending after they were built to petition the legislature to transfer the sittings of the Supreme Court to B. The corporation of L. caused an injunction to be applied for and obtained restraining the municipal council from erecting a court house and jail, for the general purposes of the county, at B. or expending in such erection any funds in which the municipality of C. or the town of L. or either of them, are interested. On appeal from the judgment granting such injunction:\u2014 Held, that the municipality could not, under the statutory authority to establish and erect a court house and jail, remove these buildings from the town of L. and so repeal and annul the statutes of the legislature which had established them in L. Without direct legislative authority therefor the county buildings could only be erected in the shire town. The injunction was, therefore, properly granted.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ordering an injunction to issue against the defendants.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note and from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne who sets out the statutes affecting the proceedings and the resolutions of the municipality in respect to the erection of the buildings in question.\nThe Supreme Court granted an injunction in the following terms:\u2014\n\"It is ordered that the defendants herein and each and every of them, their and each and every of their workmen and servants, be and they are hereby restrained and enjoined from erecting or causing to be erected a court house and jail for the general county purposes of the county of Lunenburg at Bridgewater, in the county of Lunenburg, under or in pursuance of the resolution of the municipal council of the municipality of Lunenburg, passed on the 7th day of May, 1891, and said defendants and each and every of them are also hereby restrained and enjoined from expending or causing to be expanded in the erection of a court house and jail at Bridgewater, in the county of Lunenburg, any funds of the municipality of Lunenburg in which the municipality of Chester and the municipality of the town of Lunenburg, or either of them, are interested.\"\nFrom the judgment granting this injunction the defendants appealed. W. B. Ritchie for the appellants.\nRussell Q.C. for the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Are the defendants, appellants, in this case not endeavouring indirectly to do that they have no legal authority to do directly, viz., to change the shire or county town of the county of Lunenburg from the town of Lunenburg to the town of Bridgewater? I think the new county court house and jail should not be erected in Bridgewater until the legislature has authorized the change of the place for the transaction of the judicial business of the county from Lunenburg to Bridgewater; and until such legislative action, in my opinion, the county court house and jail cannot be erected elsewhere than in Lunenburg.\nTherefore I think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia right and the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I think there is nothing in the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Long prior to the year 1863 the town of Lunenburg was by divers acts of the legislature of the province of Nova Scotia established as the county town of the county of Lunenburg, and the place where the court house and jail for the county were erected and where it was enacted that the sessions of the Supreme Court of the province should be held. In 1863 the township of Chester which constituted a part of the county of Lunenburg was by ch. 52 of the acts of the legislature of that year erected into a separate district municipality for certain purposes having a General Sessions of the Peace with the same powers as if it were a separate county, but it was enacted that the district should contribute and pay annually one-fourth part of the sum necessary in each year for the county jail and court house and all expenses connected therewith and with the administration of justice, and it was further expressly enacted that nothing in the act should be construed to exempt the inhabitants of the district from serving as jurors \"at the Supreme Court at Lunenburg.\" At this time the town of Lunenburg where the said jail and court house were erected and where the sessions of the Supreme Court for the county were required to be held was an unincorporated town situate within the county of Lunenburg. In 1879, by an act of the legislature of that year now embodied in ch. 56 of the 5th series of the Revised Statutes enacted in 1884, the inhabitants of the district of Chester were declared to be a body corporate under the name of the municipality of the district of Chester and the inhabitants of the residue of the County of Lunenburg to be a body corporate under the name of the municipality of Lunenburg. In 1885, by chapter 72 of the provincial statutes of that year, the inhabitants of the said town of Lunenburg, within the limits in the act defined, were declared to be a body corporate under the name of the town of Lunenburg for municipal purposes, and it was thereby enacted that the said town thereby incorporated\nshall annually pay to the treasurer of the municipality within which the same is situate on the first day of June, an annual sum in lieu of all county rates and assessments hitherto levied or paid, which sum as nearly as may be shall be equivalent to the benefit derived by the town from the public services supported by the revenues of the county. Such sum shall be composed of the following items, that is to say, a pro rat\u00e2 proportion of the amount paid by the county on account of the administration of criminal justice an amount equal to the cost of maintaining in the county jail all prisoners committed to jail by sentence of the stipendiary magistrate of the town or committed to jail under process out of the municipal court\u2014an amount equal to the cost of maintaining all paupers chargeable to the town who shall be maintained in any poor house or like institution supported by the funds of the county, and its proportion of county school rates under the provisions of ch. 29, Revised Statutes.\nIn the following year the legislature by ch. 27 of the statutes of 1886, passed in amendment of ch. 58 of the Revised Statutes, 5th series, made provision for ascertaining and determining the amounts in each year payable by all incorporated cities, towns and districts within the limits of a county municipality for county purposes, and for levying such amounts in case of default in levying any of them being committed by any of such incorporated cities, towns or district municipalities. Section 1 of ch. 20 of the Revised Statutes, 5th series, enacted that:\nCounty or district jails, court houses and session houses may be erected and repaired by order of the municipal councils in the respective municipalities.\nBy way of amendment of this section it was enacted by ch. 11 of the statutes of 1886 that the word \"established\" should be inserted between the words \"be\" and \"erected,\" making the section read:\nCounty or district jails, court houses and session houses may be established, erected and repaired by order of the municipal councils in the respective municipalities.\nWe are called upon now not to give an exhaustive meaning to the word \"established\" as thus here introduced; that would perhaps be a very difficult task; but we are called upon to determine whether, by the introduction of that word, the municipal council of the municipality of Lunenburg are empowered to repeal in effect the statutes of the legislature which had established the jail and court house for the county in the town of Lunenburg in which court house the sessions of the Supreme Court for the county are by statute required to be held; and by erecting a jail and court house in a different part of the county to establish such place as the county town and the place where the jail and court house for the county should in future be maintained, and at the same time to hold the district of Chester and the town of Lunenburg liable to contribute to the erection and maintenance of such jail and court house in the same manner as they had been obliged to do by the provisions of the statutes which had subjected them to liability in relation to the jail and court house which the legislature had located in the town of Lunenburg. I cannot concur in the contention that the ch. 27 of the acts of 1886 is open to any such construction. We cannot upon such language as is used in that act attribute to the legislature an intention to vest in a municipal council power at their pleasure to repeal, alter, modify or annul acts of the legislature in such a manner. It may be that Bridgewater is a much better place than Lunenburg for the site of the jail and court house for the county, but that is a matter for the legislature expressly to determine and at the same time to say whether the district of Chester and the town of Lunenburg should be subjected to the same liability as to the jail and court house if Bridgewater should be made the county town as they were subjected to while they were maintained at the town of Lunenburg. That neither the municipal council of the county nor the legislature entertained the idea that the chap. 27 was open to the construction now contended for on behalf of the municipality of Lunenburg appears from the following circumstances in the evidence laid before us. On the 22nd January, 1891, the council of the municipality passed the following resolution:\u2014 Whereas this council has passed a resolution that they would with the co-operation of the town council of Lunenburg and of the municipal council of Chester take steps to build a court house and jail at as early a date as possible: Therefore resolved, that a committee of three be appointed to obtain information in regard to the kind of building or buildings suitable. Also respecting the cost of the same and the best site for the same, and submit to the council such information at the next semi-annual or special session. This committee to co-operate with a committee to be appointed by the town council for the same purposes.\nIt was then moved and passed that\u2014\nMr. Chesley draft a bill to borrow money and present for approval at evening session.\nAccordingly at the evening session of that day, as appears by the minutes of the council,\nMr. Chesley read a bill prepared to be presented at the ensuing session of the local legislature, to enable this municipality to borrow a sum of money not to exceed twenty thousand dollars for the building of a new court house and jail for the county of Lunenburg, and it was thereupon moved, that the bill so read should be placed in the hands of the municipal clerk to be certified and forwarded to the Provincial Secretary.\nThe session of the legislature commenced on the 2nd day of April, 1891, and the bill so prepared was introduced and upon the 19th day of May became law by an act passed that day intituled \"an act to enable the municipality of Lunenburg to borrow money for a court house,\" whereby the council of the said municipality was empowered to borrow a sum of money not exceeding $20,000 upon debentures to be issued under the act\u2014\nFor the purpose of erecting and furnishing a court house and jail for the county of Lunenburg, or repairing and improving the present court house in said county.\nAnd for the purpose of paying the principal and interest of the debentures to be issued under the act, it was enacted that:\nThe municipality of Chester and the town of Lunenburg shall respectively contribute towards the sums required to pay off the principal and interest of such loan from time to time, amounts in proportion to the ratios of the total assessment of the municipality of Chester and the town of Lunenburg respectively to the total assessment of the whole county of Lunenburg according to the assessment last made before the passing of this act, &c.\nNow, if the municipal council had the power now insisted upon under the ch. 27 of the act of 1886, of erecting the court house and jail at Bridgewater wholly irrespective of the above act, for the municipality now say that they are not at all proceeding under this act, there would have been no occasion for the procuring the passage of the above act. While the above bill was before the legislature, and shortly before it was passed into an act, the council of the municipality of Lunenburg, not in co-operation with the municipalities of Chester and the town of Lunenburg, but in despite of and against the remonstrances of those municipalities, upon the 7th May passed a resolution that the new court house and jail should be built at Bridgewater. It was argued that the municipality of Lunenburg had at any rate the right under that resolution to erect a local municipal court house and jail, but the order for the injunction granted by the Supreme Court does not interfere with their doing so. All that it prohibits is the erecting or causing to be erected a court house and jail for the general county business for the county of Lunenburg at Bridgewater, and it restrains and enjoins the defendants from expending or causing to be expended in the erection of a court house and jail at Bridgewater, any funds in which either of the municipalities of the district of Chester or of the town of Lunenburg is interested. The order and the injunction issued thereon must, in my opinion, be maintained and the appeal must be dismissed with costs. Further legislation must, in my opinion, be obtained before the council of the municipality of Lunenburg can attain the object which manifestly they have been endeavouring to attain by the course which they have pursued, namely, the removal of the county town and the court house and gaol for the county and the sessions of the Supreme Court from Lunenburg to Bridgewater.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: F.

Road Co. for injuries sustained from falling over a chain used to fasten the toll-gate on the company's road. On the trial the following facts were proved: The toll-house extended to the edge of the highway, and in front of it was a short board walk. The gate was attached to a post on the opposite side of the road, and was fastened at night by a chain which was usually carried across the board walk and held by a large stone against the house. The board walk was generally used by foot passengers, and C. walking on it at night tripped over the chain and fell sustaining the injuries for which the action was brought.\nThe toll collector was made a defendant to the action but did not enter a defence. It was shown that he had made an agreement with the company to pay a fixed sum for the privilege of collecting tolls for the year, and was not to account for the receipts. The company claimed that he was lessee of the tolls, and that they were not responsible for his acts. The jury found, however, that in using the chain to fasten the gate as he did he was only following the practice that had existed for some years previously, and doing as he had been directed by the company. The statute under which the company was incorporated contains no express authority for leasing the tolls, but uses the term \u201crenter\u201d in one section, and in another speaks of a \u201clease or contract\u201d for collecting the tolls.\nThe company claimed, also, that C. had no right to use the board walk in walking along the highway, and her being there was contributory negligence on her part which relieved them from liability for the accident. Held, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that C. had a right to use the board walk as part of the public highway, and was, moreover, invited by the company to use it, and there was, therefore, no contributory negligence; that whether the toll collector was servant of the company or lessee of the tolls the company, under the finding of the jury was liable for his acts.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nThe action was tried before a jury who answered the questions submitted to them adversely to the defendants. The questions with the answers of the jury were as follows:\u2014\n\u201c1. Was the passage between the toll house and the toll gate at the time of the accident in a reasonable state of repair, and reasonably safe for foot passengers? No.\n\u201c2. If not, were the defendants guilty of negligence in not having it so? Yes.\n\u201c3. Did such negligence cause the injury to the plaintiff? Yes.\n\u201c4. Was the plaintiff at the time of the accident using ordinary care and caution? Yes.\n\u201c5. Was the gate and were its attachments the gate and attachments furnished by the defendant company to Ryder for the purpose of collecting toll? Yes.\n\u201c6. Was the manner in which the gate and its attachments were fastened at the time of the accident the manner in which Ryder was authorized by the defendant company to fasten them? Yes.\n\u201c7. What damage did the plaintiff sustain by reason of the negligence of the defendants? $500.\u201d The trial judge reserved a question of law as to the relation between the defendants and the toll collector and subsequently decided that such relation was that of master and servant, not that of lessor and lessee or landlord and tenant. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff for the damages found by the jury.\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment, two of the judges dissenting and holding that the toll collector was a lessee of the tolls. The defendants appealed.\nBritton Q.C. for the appellants. There was no evidence of negligence sufficient to make the company liable. Rounds v. Town of Stratford[2]; Ray v. Village of Petrolia[3]; Maxwell v. Township of Clarke[4]; Bleakley v. Corporation of Prescott[5]; Great Western Railway Co. v. Davies[6].\nThe liability is no greater than if the accident had happened on a private way. Tolhausen v. Davies[7].\nThe plaintiff was not entitled to use this board walk as part of the highway. Crisp v. Thomas[8]. And she was guilty of contributory negligence. Burken v. Bilezikdji[9].\nRyder was lessee of the tolls and defendants are not responsible for his acts. Rich v. Basterfield[10]; Jones v. Corporation of Liverpool[11].\nLyon for the respondent. Appellants cannot rely on misdirection in the judge as to the question of relation between them and Ryder as they did not take the objection in the divisional court. Furlong v. Reid[12].\nAs to negligence see Tucker v. Axbridge Highway Board[13]. The chain was a nuisance for the maintenance of which appellants are liable. Sandford v. Clarke[14]; Todd v. Flight[15].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. I think there was ample evidence to show that the chain was not properly attached to the toll gate but was stretched across the sidewalk and that the plaintiff, without any contributory negligence, fell over this chain and sustained the injuries complained of. It was alleged that the toll-keeper was a lessee of the tolls under agreement with the defendants, and that the defendants were not liable for his negligence. But it appears that when he took possession, and for a long time previously thereto, the chain was there held in place by the stone just as it was when the accident in this case occurred. The trial judge held that he was there as a servant of the company; his decision was confirmed by both the courts below and was quite justified by the evidence.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I do not see that we would be justified in this case in interfering with the verdict of the jury which, in my opinion, is amply justified by the evidence and was approved of by the learned judge at the trial. I adopt Mr. Justice Osler\u2019s reasoning in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The respondent brought an action against the above company and one Joseph Ryder for injuries sustained by her upon a road which is the pro- perty of the above company, for which injuries it was contended that both the company and Ryder were liable. The plaintiff in the action alleged, as the fact is, that under the provisions of an act of the Parliament of the late province of Canada the above company are the owners of the road whereon the accident of which she complained happened, and that the defendant Ryder was their servant and as such collects the tolls at gate No. 1 on said road. She then alleged that on the night of the 15th of October, 1889, while lawfully travelling upon the said road she tripped and fell over a chain which the defendants carelessly and negligently had stretched across the said road, and that she sustained serious bodily injury. She then averred that the defendants unlawfully constructed and maintained a nuisance upon the said road whereby the plaintiff received serious bodily injury. She then averred that the defendant company, in disregard of the obligations imposed upon them by their act of incorporation, neglected to keep the said road in repair whereby she sustained injury as aforesaid, and she therefor claimed $5,000 damages.\nThe defendant company in their statement of defence pleaded that their road on the night in question was in a good and lawful state of repair; that the grievances in the claim mentioned were caused by the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence, improper conduct and want of ordinary care; that at the time of the happenings of the said alleged grievances in the statement of claim mentioned the defendant, Joseph Ryder, was the lessee of the tolls collectible at the said toll gate, and was entirely in the charge, management and control of the said toll gate as such lessee and not as the servant of the company, and that it was his duty as such lessee to manage and control the said gate and the chain by which it was fastened; and lastly the defendant company pleaded that at the time of the happening of the said alleged grievances in the statement of claim mentioned, the plaintiff was unlawfully in the place where it is alleged they happened, namely, upon a part of the company\u2019s property north of their toll gate there and lawfully reserved from the use of the public. The defendant Ryder suffered judgment by default to go against him, and the case came down for trial against the company before Armour C.J.\nThe plaintiff was called as a witness on her own behalf but she failed to give any clear account of how the accident happened; it may be admitted, however, upon the evidence of her daughter who was with her, that when they approached the toll gate, which was closed and apparently fastened, her mother went a few feet\u2014about four feet\u2014ahead of her, and instead of going to the door of the gate house, which could easily have been done, and calling some one to open the gate she went round the gate post nearest the toll house, getting up for that purpose on a narrow plank walk which served as a stoop or approach to the door of the toll house, and immediately after getting round the gate post she jumped on to the macadamized road and in jumping tripped and fell. Now, directly opposite the gate post which she went round there is a bay window which projects across the narrow plank walk or stoop, and reaches to within about ten inches of the gate post. On the Kingston side of the gate, which was the side from which the plaintiff approached the gate, this narrow plank walk which served as a stoop or approach to the door of the toll house extended from the extremity of the house on the Kingston side of the gate to the projecting window 19 inches in width; then it narrowed until at the gate post it was only about 10 inches in width and a little further on the outermost point of the projecting window reached almost to the ex- tremity of the plank walk, so that there was barely space for a person to pass round from one side of the gate to the other between the projecting window and the gate post where, from whatever cause proceeding, the plaintiff met with the accident which caused her the injuries complained of. The only cause assigned for the accident was a chain about one inch wide and half an inch thick by which the gate when closed was accustomed to be kept so. There were two ways in which this chain, which was not quite three feet long, was accustomed to be used by the lessee of the tolls and toll house. 1st. By a staple on the outside of the outer scantling on which the plank walk is constructed directly opposite the gate post with which the chain was connected; this was the mode and the only mode provided by the company for the purpose; 2nd. By laying the chain flush on the plank and extending it from the gate post across the plank towards the door of the toll house and placing a stone upon it. This was a plan adopted and occasionally made use of by the lessee for the time being, and there was no evidence that any officer of the company was aware of this manner of using and fastening the chain until after the accident. How the chain was fastened on the night of the accident did not directly appear for Ryder the lessee was from home and the gate was in charge of his wife, who said that as she had never heard or known of the accident until a fortnight after it was alleged to have occurred she could not say on which of the above two ways the chain was fastened on the particular night in question. As, however, the evidence was that if fastened to the staple in the way first above mentioned, the chain would not have lain on the plank walk at all, and that in such case the accident could not have been caused by the chain, and as the evidence also was that on the night in question the chain did lie on the plank walk, it may be admitted that upon that night the chain was fastened by the stone and not by the staple.\nThe evidence further showed that some time prior to the 1st of May, 1889, the company exposed for sale at auction the tolls of the gate in question for one year from the 1st May, 1889, and that Ryder, being the highest bidder of a lump sum, not named, payable in equal monthly instalments, for which he gave at the time endorsed notes, was put by the company into possession of the toll house as lessee thereof, and of the tolls to be collected at the gate for the term of one year from the said 1st day of May, 1889, and he continued to occupy as such lessee throughout the year but no written lease was executed to him. He had, however, the enjoyment of the possession of the house and of the right to collect the tolls leviable at the gate as lessee, and was recognized as such by the company for the full period of the year. It was further in evidence that he never asked for or received from the company any directions as to the manner in which he should fasten the gate. He exercised his own discretion as to that. At the close of the case the learned counsel for the company submitted that as against them there was no evidence sufficient to go to the jury. The learned Chief Justice declined to adopt this view and he submitted to the jury the following questions[16].\nAll of these questions the jury answered in a sense unfavourable to the defendants, and they assessed the damages sustained by the plaintiff at $500. Upon the answers of the jury to the above questions the learned chief justice, being of opinion that the relation existing between the company and Ryder was, as matter of law, not that of lessor and lessee and landlord and tenant but that of master and servant, and that the company were liable for whatever was done by Ryder in the course of his employment as such servant of the company, rendered judgment for the plaintiff. From this judgment the defendant company appealed to the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario upon the grounds: 1st, that the findings of the jury were against law and evidence, and the weight of evidence, and that the company were not shown to have been guilty of any negligence, and that therefore there should be a new trial; or 2nd, that a nonsuit should be entered as to the defendant company or judgment entered in their favour, and the action against them dismissed on the grounds among others that they were not guilty of any negligence, and that the judgment rendered against them was contrary to law and evidence, and that the company were not liable in law for the alleged grievances of which the plaintiff complained, or for the manner in which the toll gate and chain were managed by their lessee Ryder. The Divisional Court refused to interfere with the judgment, holding that the findings of the jury upon the questions submitted to them were warranted by the evidence, and that the jury had in effect found, and that the evidence warranted the finding, that the company handed Ryder the chain and told him he might stretch it across the highway in a particular manner in order to keep the gate closed. They further were of opinion that the negligence causing the accident was the negligence of the company in supplying Ryder with improper means of closing the gate, and they were further of opinion that the suffering the chain to lie on the plank as described in the evidence constituted sufficient evidence of their not being in repair for which they were expressly by their act of incorporation made liable. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the learned Chief Justice was of opinion that as nothing was said in the act under which the company became incorporated giving them in express terms power to lease they could not demise or lease their tolls, and therefore that he could not look upon Ryder as occupying any position higher than collector of tolls for the company; that the company were the parties in complete possession and charge of the tolls, toll houses and road, through Ryder as their servant, and therefore answerable for his neglect and omissions. The learned Chief Justice further added:\nIt is clear that this passage (by which the plaintiff went round the gate post) was left by defendants for foot passengers at night. I think they were legally bound to see that it was kept in a reasonably safe state for that purpose.\nMr. Justice Burton, in what appears to me a very able judgment, came to the conclusion that in point of law the company could demise the toll house and tolls to Ryder, and that to his mind it was perfectly clear that Ryder was a lessee of the company; that the relation between him and the company was that of landlord and tenant and not of master and servant; and that for Ryder\u2019s acts of the nature complained of the company were not responsible; and he was of opinion that judgment ought to be ordered to be entered for them in the court below. He pointed out very clearly that Hole v. Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway Co.[17] which had been relied upon by the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and cases of that class, had no application whatever to the present case. He was also of opinion that no case of want of repair was shown.\nIn this judgment Mr. Justice McLennan entirely concurred. Mr. Justice Osler, while apparently of opinion that the company had full power to create between themselves and Ryder the relation of land- lord and tenant, thought himself bound by the findings of the jury, as to which he thought there was some evidence, not much but in his opinion sufficient, to support the findings, and that this being so it mattered not whether Ryder was tenant or servant of the company. He thought the chain being laid where it was when under the stone did not constitute want of repair, but an obstruction of their road for which the company were responsible even if Ryder was their tenant and not their servant; and he thought that although it may have been erroneous in the learned Chief Justice who tried the case to hold that the relation between the company and Ryder was that of master and servant, a new trial was unnecessary for that upon the answers of the jury to the fifth and sixth questions he thought that the judgment should not be interfered with.\nUpon this division of opinion in the Court of Appeal for Ontario the case comes before us. In the judgment of Justices Burton and McLennan I entirely concur, and also in that of Mr. Justice Osler in so far as he concurs with them in the opinion that the company had full power to lease their toll house and tolls to Ryder. As to their perfect power to do so I cannot entertain a doubt. By the 6th section of the act, chapter 159 R.S.O., it is declared that the company when registered as directed in the act may acquire and hold any lands, tenements and hereditaments useful and necessary for the purposes of the company, and may afterwards sell and convey the same. By the 29th section that all lands taken by the company for the purposes of their road, and purchased and paid for by the company, shall become the property of the company. By the 66th section that the road of the company may be sold under legal process against the company, and when sold the sale shall be deemed to pass the road itself with all rights, privileges and appurtenances to the purchaser, subject to all duties and obligations imposed by law on the company. Then these are the sections referred to by Justices Burton and Osler section 98 by which it is declared that nothing in the act contained shall affect the sale of tolls which any party is entitled to collect under any lease or contract executed before the 14th day of June, 1853; section 129 by which it is enacted that if any renter of tolls at any gate on any road takes a greater toll than is authorized by law, he shall forfeit the sum of $20; sec. 156 which enacts that the three preceding sections thereto shall apply to and be held binding upon any lessee of such road or any owners whether a joint stock company or otherwise. Then the clauses containing the provisions as to the tolls authorized to be collected constitute the sole restriction imposed by the act upon the rights and powers possessed and enjoyed by the company over property declared by the act to be vested in them, and the common law right therefore of leasing their own property, subject only to the provision as to the tolls authorized to be collected, is, as it appears to me, beyond all doubt vested in the company. The common law rule, it is true, was that to constitute a good lease it should be by deed executed under the corporate seal, and this is what Bell v. Nixon[18] decides. The question there arose under an act of Parliament which enacted:\nThat all contracts and agreements to be made and entered into for the forming or letting of the tolls of any turnpike roads signed by the trustees or commissioners letting such tolls, or any two of them, or by their clerk or treasurer, &c.\nshall be good and valid, &c., and the question was whether where two persons filled the office of clerk to the trustees a lease which was signed by one only was binding on the trustees. Tindal C.J. giving judgment there says:\u2014\nI cannot think that where two persons are appointed to fill the office of clerk their principals can be bound in a contract by the signature of one only. By the common law there could be no lease in a case of this kind except under seal.\nThe case of Hinckley v. Gildersleeve[19], relied upon by the learned Chief Justice who tried this case, was wholly different from the present. There the corporation professed to demise to a lessee for the term of sixteen years their corporate rights and powers of constructing a canal and to authorize the lessee for the whole period of such term to collect certain tolls named in the lease, whereas the act did not authorize the corporation to establish or fix any rates of toll until they should complete the canal. They also by the lease professed to divest themselves of their corporate power of varying the rates of toll from time to time during the said term. Upon the execution of the lease the company ceased to elect directors, or to hold any meetings or to exercise in any manner any of their corporate powers. That was an attempt by the directors to divest the company during the term named in the demise of the whole of their corporate powers and franchises, and to vest such powers and franchises, including the right to construct the canal, in their lessee. The case therefore is wholly distinguishable from the present. The principle upon which the Court of Common Pleas for Ontario proceeded in The Corporation of Ancaster v. Durrand[20] is the identical principle upon which I found my opinion in the present case that the appellants had full power to demise their tolls to Ryder, namely, that the appellants by their act of incorporation have the property in and title to the road, toll houses, &c., &c., vested in them, as the municipal corporation had in Ancaster v. Durrand20. The company appellants having then had full power by common law to demise their toll house, and their gate No. 1 and the tolls collectable thereat, it cannot now be doubted that, upon the authority of the Mayor of Stafford v. Till[21]; Wood v. Tate[22]; Fishmongers Co. v. Robertson[23]; Doe Pennington v. Taniere[24]; Ecclesiastical Commissioners v. Merral[25]; Wilson v. West Hartlepool Ry.[26]; Mayor of Kidderminster v. Hardwick[27]; Co. of Frontenac v. Chestnut[28]; Corporation of Huron v. Kerr[29]; and many other cases, where one is by a corporation aggregate put into possession as Ryder was of the toll house and toll gate of the company, and of the receipt of the tolls collectible thereat, under a parol demise for a year, and has enjoyed such property and the benefit of the contract, the relation of landlord and tenant is created, and that this is recognized in law as an exception to the common law rule that a corporation aggregate can only demise by deed under the corporate seal is too well established to be now questioned. As therefore the manner in which the chain was used, which is alleged to have caused the injuries of which the plaintiff complains, was by undisputed evidence of Ryder himself shown to have been his act alone with which the appellants had nothing whatever to do, and as it was also established by undisputed evidence that the company were not aware of such mode of his using the chain until after the accident, I must concur in the judgment of the learned Judges Burton and McLennan that this action cannot be sustained against the appellants. But as Mr. Justice Osler seems to have felt himself bound to affirm the judgment in favour of the plaintiff upon the findings of the jury to the fifth and sixth questions, even if Ryder be regarded as the tenant of the appellants, I have perused the evidence with the utmost care and have estimated, as accurately as I could by the plan produced in evidence and made part of the appeal case, the very limited space between the gate post and the bay window of the toll house by which the plaintiff got round the gate to the place where the accident is alleged to have happened and I can find no evidence whatever which, even though Ryder should be regarded as the servant only of the appellants, is in my opinion sufficient to support and justify a judgment against them.\nThe first question submitted to the jury assumes as a fact established (in support of which I cannot find a particle of evidence) that the very limited space between the gate post, which the plaintiff got round, and the bay window, the outermost joint of which almost reached the extremity of the plank, was a passage way provided by the appellants by which foot\u2011passengers might pass the gate without going through it. The wholly insufficient character of the limited space in question would, in itself, seem to be sufficient to indicate that it never could have been intended for such a purpose. However there is no evidence whatever that it was; on the contrary the plank spoken of in front of the toll house, which at its greatest width was only nineteen inches and was narrowed to about ten inches opposite the gate post, is spoken of in the evidence only as stoop of the toll house\u2014an appurtenance in fact of that house. The witness Saunder speaks of it as \u201ca plank placed there as he understood as a kind of door step along the house, and the plaintiffs daughter who saw her mother fall just as she got round the gate post says that she thought \u201cit was placed to be a door step\u201d and this no doubt is just what it was and there is no evidence that it was, or was ever thought by any one to be, anything else; so that in truth the plea of the appellants that the plaintiff was unlawfully where the accident happened to her, namely, in a part of the appellants\u2019 property reserved by them from the use of the public, was proved. But it was said that if this limited space between the gate post and the bay window was not appropriated by the appellants for foot-passengers no other way was provided for that purpose; well it may be admitted that no other place than the space between the posts of the toll gate was provided. But the act under which the appellants enjoy their corporate rights does not impose on the appellants any obligation to provide any other space than that where the toll gate is across the travelled road for any persons whether on foot or otherwise using the road. The appellants or their tenant had a perfect right to keep the gate closed and no person whether on foot or otherwise has any right in law to pass by any other way than through the gate. When the gate is closed it is easy for a foot passenger as for any other person to call out for some person to come and open the gate. Nothing could have been easier on the night in question than for the plaintiff to have crossed the 19 inch plank and to have knocked at the door of the toll house which she passed before reaching the gate post. If there be any obligation on the appellants to provide for foot passengers a passage apart from the gateway, their not providing such a passage way cannot justify the appellants being held responsible for an injury received by the plaintiff in passing round the gate on the stoop of the toll house where no way was provided for that purpose, and by which there is no evidence whatever of her having been invited by any one to pass. As to the 2nd question it is to be observed that there was no suggestion in the evidence of any ground of complaint against the appellants or Ryder as for negligence in causing the accident, save only in suffering the chain not longer than three feet nor wider than one inch nor thicker than half an inch lying flush on the plank between the gate post and the toll house. Now 1st, that plank not having been part of the appellants\u2019 property which they had appropriated to the use of the public the leaving the chain there is not a matter of which the plaintiff or any one can complain as constituting negligence; there was no foundation therefore for submitting that question to the jury. 2ndly, even if the plank had been part of the appellants\u2019 property which had been appropriated by them to the use of the public the suffering a chain of the dimensions of the chain in question to lie upon it did not, in my opinion, afford sufficient evidence, either of nuisance, obstruction or negligence, to be submitted to the jury as proof of negligence.\nThe third question has no application except on the assumption of negligence being established; the finding of the jury therefore upon this question amounts simply to a finding that as a matter of fact the chain lying on the plank caused the injury of which the plaintiff complains.\nThe fourth question also has no application except upon the assumption of negligence causing the injury having been established.\nNow, as to the fifth question, there can be no doubt that the gate and its attachments were furnished by the appellants to Ryder for the purpose of his collecting toll but as lessee thereof and of the toll house, and whether he was in the relation of tenant or of servant to the appellants the finding of the jury that the gate and its attachments were furnished to him for the purpose of his collecting toll can afford no justification for a judgment against the appellants upon such findings.\nThen as to the 6th question the answer of the jury is in direct conflict with all the evidence upon the subject in question. Indeed there seems no foundation for submitting such a question to the jury unless accompanied with a direction that upon the evidence on the subject it could be answered properly only in the negative. Ryder himself, in the plainest language, said that he never asked the appellants for any directions, and that he never received from them or any one any directions whatever as to how he should fasten the gate; that he acted in that matter wholly upon his own judgment; and there is besides the independent evidence of the officers of the company that until after the accident to the plaintiff they had no knowledge of Ryder ever using the chain in the manner it was alleged to have been used on the night in question, namely, by laying it across the plank and putting a stone on it. Assuming then Ryder to have been, as I think he certainly was, the appellants\u2019 tenant of the tolls, toll house and toll gate, with their appurtenances, I cannot see how the answers of the jury to the 5th and 6th questions, either singly or together, can support a judgment against the appellants; on the contrary, even assuming the relation between the appellants and Ryder to have been that of master and servant, and not of landlord and tenant, I am of opinion for the reasons I have given that there was no evidence whatever given in the case which justified the submission to the jury of the questions which were submitted or which justifies a judgment against the appellants upon the answers given to those questions. The plaintiff seems upon the evidence to have wholly brought upon herself the injury she sustained by her wrongfully at- tempting to get round the gate post as she did, by a way never intended or adapted to be used in the manner it was used by her, and which was in fact a stoop or appurtenance to the tollhouse, and not at all set apart or appropriated by the appellants for use by the public. The appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendant company in the court below with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The toll gate when shut leaves no way for a foot passenger except the narrow bit of platform between the bow window of the toll house and the toll gate. The plaintiff was clearly invited to use that way, and had moreover a right to use it as a part of the public highway. In using it she tripped over a chain which fastened the gate, and was injured. The chain reached across the platform from the gate to the house where it was secured by a stone. It was a nuisance. The plaintiff clearly has a right of action. The question is whether the company is liable or only Ryder the toll collector.\nI am of opinion for the reasons given in the court below by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osier that the company is liable. It is not disputed that if the company, which must act by some individual, had hired a man at so much a month to collect the tolls it would have been responsible for his acts done in the course of that employment. The law on that point is too well settled to be disputed. But it appears that Ryder was not hired in that way He was paying the company an agreed sum for the year by monthly instalments, and not otherwise accounting for the tolls. He is called lessee of the tolls. I do not quarrel with the name which is convenient enough as a designation of a man holding Ryder\u2019s relation to the company. The statute[30] uses the term \u201crenter\u201d in section 129, \u201crenter and collector\u201d in that section apparently meaning the man who pays a fixed sum, or rent, out of the tolls, and the man who is hired to collect the tolls. In section 137 the terms used are \u201ctoll gatherer\u201d and \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d both terms applying indifferently to the renter and the collector. But the term \u201clessee,\u201d convenient though it may be, may easily be made too much of, as I think it is when the liability of the company for the conduct of the man who collects the tolls under the agreement that is called a lease is put on the same footing as that of a freeholder for the acts of his tenant for years. The statutory word \u201crenter\u201d is perhaps less liable to mislead. As far as it concerns the travelling public, as against whom certain rights and powers are conferred on the company with correlative duties, it is the same thing whether the toll gatherer or gate keeper is a renter or a collector. Is the company to be responsible for the acts of gate keeper Smith, who is paid his wages out of the tolls he collects and hands over to the directors, and not responsible for the acts of gate keeper Brown five miles down the road, who collects the tolls in precisely the same way and under the same statutable restrictions but pays a fixed sum to the company? The principle seems to me to be the same in both cases. The difference is in the mode of remunerating the gate keeper, but in each case he is, in my judgment, the company\u2019s gate keeper. The discussion respecting the power of a road company existing under the general act to make a lease of its powers and franchises is interesting but is, as it strikes me, scarcely called for by a transaction such as that which in this case is spoken of as a lease, but which seems to be merely an appointment to collect the tolls at one of the company\u2019s gates upon certain terms. But even if Ryder should be regarded in the light of a tenant of property using it for the purposes and in the mode contemplated by his lease, I think that, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Osler, there is evidence to support the sixth finding of the jury. Ryder\u2019s tenancy began at the 1st of May in the year of the accident. He shows that for years before that it had been usual to fasten the chain in the same way, although the gate keeper could, by taking a little more trouble, have fastened it at the front of the platform where it would have done no harm. I think the evidence of previous user was admissible on the sixth question.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: James Agnew.\nSolicitor for respondent: Horatio V.

It was filed on the 18th April 1891 and on the 10th October, 1891 within six months of the filing of the petition an order was made by Mr. Justice malhiot enlarging the time for the commencement of the trial until the 4th November, 1891, a:id the preliminary objections to the petition having been disposed of, another order was made on the 19th of October by Mr. Justice Malhiot fixing the date of the trial for the 4th November 1891 and fourteen clear days notice of trial was given to the appellant.\nThe particulars filed contained a large number of charges, and after hearing the evidence in support of them and the witnesses for the defence the court found as follows that the corrupt practices had been committed and voided the election '.\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant agilest en preuve que des manures frauduleuses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 et pendant la dite \u00e9lection par des agents du dit Thomas Murray hors la connaissance du dit> Thomas Murray \"\nOn an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the appellant limited the subject of the appeal to the following special and defined questions on which he claimed that the said alleged judgment, orders and decisions and each of them is illegal and void; '\n\u201c1. That the said Superior Court of the province of Quebec for the district of Ottawa had no jurisdiction to render the said. judgment as the said alleged trial was before the said judges and not before the said court and there were no findings of fact before the said court on which such judgment could issue, and the said judgment does not contain or refer to any special findings by the said court or by the said judges, and the same does not adjudge the appellant or any named agent of his guilty of any specific corrupt practice or of any practice referred to in the petition or bill of particulars, and the same is otherwise too general, illegal and void.\"\nu 2. That the said judgment is not signed by the said judges as trial judges or otherwise.'\n\u201c3. That the said election petition was filed and presented on the eighteenth of April 1891, and the said trial thereof was not commenced within six months thereafter by reason whereof and of the statutes in that behalf the said petition was out of court and at an end and the said judges or the said court, had no jurisdiction to commence or hold the trial of the said petition on the fourth day of November, 1891, as they in fact did or to render on the said day, or afterwards, any judgment upon said election petition, other than to declare that it was at an end and that they had no jurisdiction to try the same.\"\n4.That the order of Mr. Justice Maihiot, dated on or about the tenth day of October, 1891, pretending to extend the time for the trial of the said election petition until the fourth day of November, 1891, did not include the said fourth day of November, but was exclusive of that day and the said alleged order was otherwise illegal and void in this, that when the said order was made the preliminary objections filed to the said petition were not then disposed of and the said petition was not then at issue or ready for trial, and there was not then or when the said petition was at issue sufficient time to give, as required by the statute or by the rules of the said, court in that behalf the proper notice of trial before the expiry of the said six months; and that the order of the said Honourable Mr Justice Maihiot, of date the 19th day of October 1891 fixing a day for the commencement of such trial was and is illegal ultra, vires null and void for the reasons above stated and especially for the reason that on the 19th day of October 1891 the six months within which the said trial should have been fixed and commenced had then expired, and that the day so fixed was beyond the period of the said alleged extension.\"\n\u201c5. That the appellant did not receive nor was there given the fifteen lays notice of trial required by the rules of the said court but the notice as of trial in fact given was only notice for fourteen days.\"\n\u201c6. That the said petition and particulars delivered thereunder contained 20,481 charges of bribery and of other corrupt practices against the appellant, and several other persons alleged to be his agents, and each charge formed a separate and distinct offence and should be separately tried and adjudicated upon, yet the said judges assumed to try and in fact did try and adjudicate upon all said charges together, against the will of the appellant and contrary to the rules of law and natural justice.\"\n\u201c7. That the evidence of the witnesses at the said trial was not properly taken in this that the shorthand writer appointed by the said Honorable Mr. Justice Maihiot to take the evidence was not qualified in that behalf, or appointed by the Council of the Bar of the district of Ottawa, upon a report of a committee of examiners appointed by such council or in any other manner whatsoever to take evidence before the course and trials of said district of Ottawa or for any other purpose, or as an official stenographer or shorthand, writer of said district of Ottawa and when the evidence was taken it was not read over to the witnesses nor was it read over to them when extended, and the said evidence is not accurate or reliable.\nO'Gara Q. C. and Aylen for appellant cited The Glengarry Case ([1]) The Charlevoix Case ([2]); South Ontario Case ([3]).\n\"Rule \"XXI of the Election Court for the province of Quebec; Rule XL of the Superior Court ([4]); and Lavoie v. Gaboury ([5]); McQuillen. Spencer ([6]).\nMcDougall for the respondents was not called upon. The court proceeded to deliver judgment.\nSir W J. RITCHIE C.J. As the appellant has not printed the evidence this court is bound to hold that the learned \"judges have properly found as matter of fact that corrupt practices had been committed by the respondents' agents.\nSTRONG J.(Oral). I have no doubt whatever that none of the objections relied on by the appellant in this case have any weight.\nFirst as to the enlargement of the time for fixing the date of the trial made by the order of Mr. Justice Maihoit on the 10th of October. I think it was quite competent for the learned judge to make the order although the case was 'not at issue. It may be that the judge was not at that time prepared to fix a day for the trial but it was entirely within his power to enlarge the time without fixing the date of trial and the order made was perfectly good and valid. Then, as regards the point taken by Mr. Aylen and discussed by Mr. O'Grara that there is no specific report on the charges mentioned in the petition and the particulars\u2014there is nothing in that. We have in the printed case just such a finding by the judges who tried the case as ii has been the universal practice to make. In fact we have just what is required by the statute, for the judges have determined that the election of the appellant is void by reason of corrupt practices.\nThen as to the fifteen days notice. There is certainly something in this objection which might have been to the advantage of the appellant if it had been made at the proper time. If fifteen clear days notice of trial should be held necessary under the Quebec rules, though no doubt, if construed in accordance with art. 24 C.P.C., both days, the day of service and the terminal day should be excluded I am not at all satisfied that fourteen days would not be sufficient, one day being excluded and the other included. However there is no necessity for us to decide this point; it is quite clear it is not an objection which can be invoked on an appeal to this court. It is neither a judgment or decision on a question of law or of fact of the judges who tried the petition and therefore it is not an appealable point.\nThe last point relied on is as to the shorthand reporter\u2019s notes no: having been read over to the witnesses. It is out of the question that such an objection can be entertained. When the reporter was chosen he was duly sworn; the judges were satisfied with the way in which the evidence was taken and no objection was taken by the counsel. The judge has entire control of the procedure and in fact it would have been sufficient if mere notes of the evidence had been taken by the judge. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGRWYNNE J.I entirely concur that this appeal must ho dismissed.\nThe chief point of the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant was that the object of the statute was to obtain a speedy judicial decision on the merits of the election petition, and that therefore no trial was required to be commenced within six months from the filing\" of the petition. Granting speedy administration of justice to have been, as I agree it was, the object of the statute, I think it is a point worthy of consideration by the legislature whether appeals from the decision of the trial judges should not be altogether done away with, for if appeals like the present upon points of alleged irregularity not in any way affecting the merits and founded upon so frivolous grounds should be encouraged, the administration of justice would be almost indefinitely deferred instead of being speedily administered.\nPATTERSON J. I am also of opinion that this appeal fails on every point. A general finding on so many charges may be inconvenient for an appeal, but all that the statute makes necessary is a decision by the judges who have tried the petition, that the member whose election or return is complained of has been duly elected or that the election is void, and the statute in this case seems to have been followed literally by the judges' report.\nThe other points taken are questions of alleged irregularity of one kind or another which are not appealable to this court. As to the question of the regularity of the notice for trial although we are not bound to pronounce upon it on this appeal I may say for myself that it strikes me that the notice given was sufficient. Sec. 31 enacts that notice of the time and \"place at which an election petition will be tried shall be given in the prescribed, manner not less than fourteen days before that on which the trial is to take place. The court has thus the right to prescribe the manner of giving the notice, as for example by registered letter which was the mode adopted in this case but the statute fixes the time and I do not think the court has power to fix a different time. The notice here was a clear fourteen days' notice.\nAppeal dismissed with, costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : Henry Aylen.\nSolicitor for respondents : J. M. McDougall.\n[1] 14 Can SCR 453\n[2] 1 Can.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Control over streets\u2014Duty to repair\u2014Transferred powers\u2014Negligence\u2014Notice of action\u2014Defence not pleaded\u201434 V. c. 11 (N.B.)\u201425 V. c. 16 (N.B.)\nThe act incorporating the town of Portland (34 V.c. 11 [N.B.] gives the town council the exclusive management of and control over the streets, and power to pass by-laws for making, repairing, etc., the same. By s. 84 the provisions of 25 V. c. 16 and amending acts, relating to highways, apply to said town and the powers, authorities, rights, privileges and immunities vested in commissioners and surveyors of roads in said town are declared to be vested in the council. By another act no action could be brought against a commissioner of roads unless within three months after the act committed, and on one month's previous notice in writing. The town of Portland afterwards became the city of Portland, remaining subject to the said provisions, and eventually a part of the city of St. John. An action was brought against the city of Portland by C. for injuries sustained by stepping on a rotten plank on a side-walk in said city and breaking his leg. More than a month before the action was commenced plaintiff's solicitor wrote to the council notifying them of the injuries sustained by plaintiff, and concluding: \"As it is Mr. Christie's intention to claim damages from you for such injuries, I give you this notice that a prompt inquiry into the circumstances may be made and such damages paid as Mr. Christie is entitled to:\" except this no notice of action was given, but want of notice was not pleaded. The jury on the trial found that the broken plank was within the line of the street, and that the council, by conduct, had invited the public to use said side-walk. After Portland became a part of St. John the latter city became defendant in the case for subsequent proceedings.\nHeld, Strong J. dissenting, that the city was liable to C. for the injuries so sustained.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J. and Strong J., that the letter of the solicitor was not a sufficient notice of action under the statute.\nPer Ritchie C.J. If notice of action was necessary the want of it could not be relied on as a defence without being pleaded.\nPer Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. Notice was not necessary; the liability of the city did not depend on s. 84 of 34 V.c. 11, but on the sections making it the duty of the council to keep the streets in repair; and the only privilege or immunity possessed by the commissioners and surveyors of roads was that of exemption from the performance of statute labour.\nPer Strong J. One of the \"immunities\" declared to be vested in the council was that of not being subject to an action without prior notice and no notice having been given in this case C. could not recover.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a nonsuit or new trial.\nThe action was originally brought against the city of Portland for injuries sustained by the plaintiff in walking along a plank side-walk in said city and stepping on a rotten plank which gave way whereby he broke his leg. The city of Portland subsequently became a part of the city of St. John and the latter city appeared as defendants in the proceedings in the action after the union.\nThe action was twice tried, the verdict for the plaintiff on the first trial having been set aside and a new trial granted[1].\nThe main contention of the defendants is that they were entitled to notice of action which was not given, the notice relied on by plaintiff being, as they contend, insufficient. It was a letter from plaintiff's solicitor to the council as follows:\u2014\nJuly 9th, 1888.\nThe Council of the City of Portland:\nGentlemen,\u2014In behalf of Mr. J. J. Christie, of the city of Saint John, dealer in shoe findings, and as his attorney, I have to notify you that on Friday last, in consequence of a defective side-walk in your city, he fell and received severe injuries from which he is now, and for weeks will be, confined to his bed. As it is Mr. Christie's intention to claim damages from you for such injuries I give you this notice that a prompt inquiry into the circumstances may be made and such damages paid as Mr. Christie is entitled to.\nThey rest this defence on statutes governing the town of Portland before it was incorporated as a city, which are as follows:\u2014\nThe town was incorporated by 34 Vic. ch. 11 and the 84th section of that act provides that:\u2014\n\"All the provisions of an act made and passed in the 25th year of the reign of Her present Majesty, intituled, 'An act in amendment and consolidation of the Laws relating to. Highways and of the several Acts in amendment thereof,' except so far as the same are altered by or inconsistent with the terms of this act, shall extend and apply to, and are declared to be in force, so far as the same are applicable, within the said town of Portland; provided, that the several powers and authorities, rights, privileges and immunities by the said Acts of Assembly vested in the General Sessions of the Peace for the city and county of Saint John and Commissioner and Surveyors of Roads within the said town shall be and the same are hereby vested in the Town Council, to be exercised in such manner and through such officers, agents and persons as they shall prescribe.\"\nThen 31 Vic. ch. 19 sec. 1, provides that: \"The provisions of the first and second sections of the Revised Statutes, ch. 56, 'Of Actions against Officers and Recovery of Penalties,' * * * shall extend and apply to Commissioners of Highways for anything done in the execution of any office created or the duties of which are performed under any of the provisions of an act made and passed in the 25th year of the reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act in Amendment and Consolidation of the Laws relating to Highways or of any Act or Acts in amendment thereof or in relation thereto.\"\nR. S. N. B. ch. 56 secs. 1 and 2 above referred to are as follows:\u2014\n\"Sec. 1. No action shall be brought against any person for anything done by virtue of an office held under any of the provisions of this title, unless within three months after the act committed, and upon one month's previous notice thereof in writing, and the action shall be tried in the county where the cause of action arose.\"\n\"Sec. 2. The defendant in any such action may plead the general issue and give any part of this title and the special matter in evidence. If it appear that the defendant acted under the authority of this title, or of any regulations made by the powers conferred thereby, or that the cause of action arose in some other county, the jury shall give him a verdict.\"\nUnder these statutory provisions the defendants claimed that one of the rights, privileges and immunities enjoyed by a Commissioner of Highways was that no action could be brought against him for anything done in the execution of his duties without a month's previous notice thereof, and that such right, privilege or immunity was vested in the Council of the town of Portland and is enjoyed by the defendants.\nThe defendants claimed, also, that the broken plank causing the accident was beyond the line of the street and on private property as to which they were not liable.\nThe jury found the questions of fact in favour of the plaintiff, certain questions being submitted which, with their answers thereto, were as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the side-walk properly constructed in the first instance?\nYes.\n2. Were the two streaks of plank spoken of by Tomney placed by him on the vacant lot, and outside the line of the side-walk ordered by Supervisor Dunlap?\nNo.\n3. Were those planks within the city line?\nYes.\n4. Did the city use, or by their conduct invite the public to use, the whole side-walk, at this place, including the two streaks, next to or on the vacant lot?\nYes.\nVerdict for plaintiff\u2014Damages $1 500.00.\nThe defendants moved for a nonsuit or new trial which the court refused, the majority holding that notice of action was not necessary. They then appealed to this court.\nJack Q.C., Recorder of St. John, for the appellants: The corporation is not liable for non-feasance. Dwyer v. The Town of Portland[2]. As to the general liability of a corporation for negligence see Burns v. City of Toronto[3]; Oliver v. Worcester[4]; French v. City of Boston[5]; Ross v. Fedden[6].\nAs to limitation of action see Burton v. Mayor, etc., of Salford[7].\nPugsley, Sol.-Gen. of New Brunswick, for the respondent, referred to Clarke v. The Town of Portland[8]; The Town of Portland v. Griffiths[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014On the merits of this case I think the verdict of the jury is not open to objection and should not be disturbed, and therefore the simple point in the case turns on the question of notice of action. Were defendants entitled to notice of action? If so, was it given? If not, was want of notice pleaded or was it necessary to plead it? The statutes in England that require notice of action to be given make special provisions therefore as in 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 44 s. 9, which requires that the notice should be in writing, in which notice the cause of action and the court in which the case is intended to be brought shall be clearly and explicitly stated, and upon the back thereof shall be endorsed the name and place of abode of the party intending to sue, and also the name and place of abode or business of the attorney or agent, if such notice has been served by such attorney or agent. In the present case the statute simply states \"that no action shall be brought unless within three months after the act committed and upon one month's previous notice in writing,\" but nothing as to the contents of notice. In England it has been held that in construing notice of action under the various statutes requiring them the court will not subject them to too nice and narrow an examination, the object being that they should be plain and intelligible to plain men. See Jones v. Nicholls[10].\nThe notice in this case is as follows:\u2014\nJuly 9th, 1888.\nThe Council of The City of Portland:\nGentlemen,\u2014In behalf of Mr. J. J. Christie of the city of St. John, dealer in shoe findings, and as his attorney, I have to notify you that on Friday last, in consequence of a defective side-walk in your city, he fell and received severe injuries from which he is now, and for weeks will be, confined to his bed. As it is Mr. Christie's intention to claim damages from you for such injuries I give you this notice that a prompt inquiry into the circumstances may be made and such damages paid as Mr. Christie is entitled to. I remain,\nYours truly,\nMONT. McDONALD,\nAttorney-at-Law.\nI cannot think this a sufficient notice; there is nothing whatever to convey to the Council of the City of Portland an intention to bring an action.\nIf it was necessary to plead want of notice this was clearly not done, the only pleas being:\n1. That it was not the duty of the defendants to keep the said streets and highways, and the side-walks thereof, in a safe and proper condition for the passage to and fro over and along the same of the city of Portland and other good and worthy subjects of our lady the Queen, as alleged.\n2. That the defendants were not bound to keep the said Straight Shore Road and the side-walks thereof in repair as alleged.\n3. That the defendants did not undertake to repair and keep in repair the said Straight Shore Road and the side-walks thereof as alleged.\n4. That the defendants did not construct upon and along the said street, road and highway, upon one side thereof, a plank side-walk for the public to walk upon, as alleged.\n5. That the defendants did not negligently and improperly construct the said side-walk and afterwards negligently and improperly repair the same, and that in consequence of such neglect and improper construction, and also of such negligent and improper repairing thereof, the said side-walk became and was dangerous and unsafe for persons walking along and upon the same as alleged.\nBy statutes, 1 R.S.N.B. cap. 56, ss. 1 and 2; 31 Vic. cap. 19 ss. 1 and 2; 34 Vic. cap. 11 s. 84.\nAnd the said defendants, by E. R. Gregory, their attorney, say they are not guilty.\nThat it was necessary the following cases would seem clearly to establish, there being no statute authorizing the general issue to be pleaded and the special matter to be given in evidence under it. The general issue merely denies the fact of the commission of the injury complained of. In Davey v. Warne[11] where an act provided that plaintiff should not recover in an action for anything done in pursuance of the act unless 21 days' notice of action was given, it was held that the defendant must plead the want of such notice or he could not avail himself of it. This case seems to be directly in point. In this case Alderson B., delivering the judgment of the court says, \"as to the notice of action, we are of opinion that the want of it ought to have been pleaded as a defence to the action. It is an important point, but I do not entertain any doubt about it.\"\nSee also Richards v. Easto[12] and Law v. Dodd[13] which are equally in point.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I can come to no other conclusion than that this appeal must be allowed for the reason that the appellants were entitled to notice of action and that no such notice was given. This was the opinion of Mr. Justice Tuck on the first application for a new trial in this cause. The 1st and 2nd sections of 31 Vic cap. 19 made the 1st and 2nd secs. of cap. 56 of the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick applicable to Commissioners of Highways, and by the provisions of the last mentioned enactment one month's notice of action was required to be given to public officers to whom the statute applied.\nBy 34 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 84 the provisions of an act passed in 25 Vic., amending and consolidating acts relating to highways, were made applicable to the town of Portland, and it was provided that the powers, authorities, rights, privileges and immunities vested in the commissioners and surveyors of roads \"within the said town\" were vested in the town council of Portland. Subsequently these powers and immunities were successively transferred to the city of Portland and to the present appellants.\nThe first question raised is whether the right to notice of action is included within the word \"immunities,\" and differing with great respect from the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick I am of opinion that it is. The exceptional right not to be sued as an ordinary individual without a preliminary notice according to the course of the common law is surely a privilege and immunity. I can think of no general and comprehensive word by which such a right could be better expressed than this word \"immunity.\"\nIt is said however, (and it was the ground on which Mr; Justice King in his judgment on the first motion for a new trial held that notice was not requisite), that the right to notice under the provision mentioned does not apply to the surveyors of roads but is confined to the commissioners of roads, and that the negligence imputed to the city in the present case was a neglect imputable to it in its character of surveyor of roads rather than in that of commissioners of roads. With great respect I am unable to agree in this distinction. As commissioners of roads the city were bound to repair, and the accident for which the action is brought arose from a neglect to repair. I regard the surveyors as executive or subordinate officers to carry out the duties imposed on the commissioners, but I take it that the commissioners are bound to repair and to see that the surveyors properly perform their duties in executing repairs of the streets and side-walks. Further, it appears to me that the duties of the two offices of commissioners and surveyors transferred to the city have become so blended that any distinction between them in respect of such a matter as that of repairing cannot be any longer maintained, and that the city is entitled in all matters relating to streets to the immunities of the commissioners.\nThat the letter of Mr. Macdonald on the 9th of July, 1888, addressed to the Portland Council and received by the mayor, was not a sufficient notice of action to meet the requirements of the statute can scarcely be doubted. The case of Union Steamship Co. of New Zealand v. Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners[14], referred to by Tuck J. is conclusive on this head[15].\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J. \u2013 I would dismiss this appeal. I do not think a notice of action was necessary. Mr. Justice King fully demonstrates it in his judgment in the court below on the first motion. On the second ground taken for a new trial, that there was no evidence of such negligence as would make the appellants liable, I think they also fail. The defect was not a latent one; on the contrary, the evidence shows that this sidewalk, which was built of plank and raised about two feet above the level of the ground, had been allowed to go to decay so that it had become dangerous. The other grounds for their motion taken by the appellants have been disposed of by the judgment appealed from against their contentions. I see no ground of appeal in any of them.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The town of Portland was incorporated by a statute of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick, 34 Vic. ch. 11. By the 57th section of that act the town council was empowered to make by-laws, among other things:\nTo provide for making, paving, flagging, planking and repairing the streets, side-walks, crossings, roads, &c.\nAlso, by subsec. 17:\nTo cause lands lying along and below the level of any way, side-walk, street or thoroughfare to be properly inclosed and fenced at the cost and expense of the owners, and to recover such expenses with costs in a summary manner, provided that the said town shall not be in any way liable for any injuries or damages whatsoever occasioned by the neglect of such owners to erect and maintain any such fence, but the said owners shall be liable therefor.\nThen by the 83rd section it enacted that:\nThe town council shall have the sole and exclusive management and control of all roads, bye roads, highways, streets, side-walks, &c., &c., within the said town, and power to repair, amend and clean the same, &c., &c., and shall control the expenditure of all moneys assessed and collected or expended from the general revenues of the said town, for and on account of the making, repairing and improvement of any such roads, bye roads, highways, streets, side-walks, &c., &c.\nThen by section 117 it is enacted that the town council shall have power at their first meeting after the annual election of councillors in each year, or so soon thereafter as may be, to determine and direct what sum of money to the amount of fifteen thousand dollars shall be raised and levied in the town for, among other purposes named, \"making and repairing the roads, streets, &c., &c., within the said town.\" Then by section 128 it is enacted that: All assessments which now are or hereafter may be required to be levied in the said town for town or county purposes, shall be levied and assessed and collected under the provisions and according to the principles of this act, anything in any law or statute contained to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThen the statute defines the provisions and principles upon which assessments are to be made, in the sections from 129 to 141 inclusive. By the 129th section it is enacted that:\nAll rates, taxes or assessments levied or imposed upon the said town shall be raised as follows:\u2014\n1st. One-tenth of the whole amount of such rate, tax or assessment shall be assessed and levied by an equal tax on the poll of every male inhabitant of the said town above the age of 21 years.\n2nd. The remaining nine-tenths of the whole amount of such rate or assessment shall be assessed and levied in due proportion upon the whole value of all real estate situated in the said town of Portland, and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants thereof wherever the same may be, after deducting from such personal estate the just debts of such inhabitants respectively, and also upon the amount of annual income or emoluments of such inhabitants derived from any office, profession, trade, business, place, work, labour, occupation or employment whatsoever within the province, and not from invested real or personal estate of such inhabitants, and also upon the capital stock, income or other thing of joint stock companies or corporations, &c.\nNow it cannot be doubted, I think, that by the above sections alone, without any other, exclusive power to make and repair the streets and side-walks in the town was vested in the corporation, and that, to enable them effectually to exercise the power, they are empowered to pass by-laws for raising and levying all rates, taxes and impositions which can be levied, collected and enforced for that or any other purpose. Under these powers they did in 1878 construct the side-walk where the plaintiff sustained the injury of which he complains. That side-walk was suffered to fall into and was in a very defective condition when the plaintiff sustained his injury: it therefore, upon the authority of the Borough of Bathurst v. Macpherson, [16]became a duty imposed upon the corporation to maintain the structure supplied by them for public use in a fit state of repair, the neglect to discharge which duty would subject them to an action at the suit of a person injured thereby whatever might be their liability to put their streets and side-walks into, and to keep them in, a good state of repair. It is not, perhaps, necessary in the present case, for the reason above given, to determine what is the full extent of the obligation imposed upon the appellants generally in relation to the streets, &c., placed under their exclusive control and management. But the general impression I think is, and for my part I am prepared to express the opinion, that when such exclusive powers are vested in municipal corporations as they are constituted in this Dominion the correlative obligation to exercise the powers is imposed, and that neglect to discharge such obligation gives to a party injured a right of action. The provision made by subsection 17 of the 57th section of the act, which exempts the corporation from liability for injury sustained by any person from the neglect of the owners of lands lying along and below any side-walk to fence their property from the side-walk, would seem to imply that the legislature entertained the view that for injuries ensuing from a defective side-walk within the limits of streets which by the statutes are placed under the sole and exclusive management and control of the town council, the corporation are liable. Evidence was given by the defendants for the purpose of establishing that, and it was strongly insisted that the evidence so given did establish that, the place where the plaintiff sustained injury and the cause of such injury arose outside of the line of the street, with the view of claiming the benefit of exemption from liability under the provision of the said 17th subsection of section 57, as the land adjoining did lie along and below the level of the side-walk; but the jury, with all the evidence upon that subject before them, have found that the injury was sustained within the limits of the street, and for defect of a very grave description within the limits of the side-walk on the street, and I cannot say that this finding was not warranted by the evidence. Moreover it is to be observed that the particular plank, the defective condition of which was the immediate cause of the injury, had been laid by the defendants or under their authority, and extended, as by the defendant's own contention is claimed, beyond the limits of the street. However the jury have found that the injury occurred within the limits of the street, and by defect in the side-walk within such limits.\nFor the purpose of determining the question as to the liability of the defendants, apart from the question whether or not they were entitled to notice of action, there is no necessity whatever, in my opinion, to refer to the 84th section of the act at all. The liability of the defendants rests wholly upon the other sections of the act above quoted, and the fact that they had constructed the sidewalk where the injury was sustained. However the defendants contended that under that section they were entitled to notice of action. But this contention appears to me to involve the assumption that the liability of the corporation, if any there be, arises under the provisions of this 84th section, the object and utility of which, as affecting an action like the present, I confess I have been unable to see. The section enacts that:\nAll the provisions of an act made and passed in the 25th year of the reign of Her present Majesty intituled, \"an act in amendment and consolidation of the laws relating to highways and of the several acts in amendment thereof\" except so far as the same are altered by or inconsistent with the terms of this act, shall extend and apply to and are declared to be in force, so far as the same are applicable, within the said town of Portland: Provided that the several powers and authorities, rights, privileges and immunities by the said acts of Assembly vested in the General Sessions of the Peace for the City and County of St. John, and commissioners and surveyors of roads within the said town, shall be and the same are hereby vested in the town council to be exercised in such manner and through such officers, agents and persons as they shall prescribe.\nThe act above referred to as passed in the 25th year of Her Majesty's reign is ch. 16 of the statutes of that year. The powers and authorities vested in the commissioners and surveyors of highways by that act were designed solely to enable them \"to enforce and superintend the performance of the statute labour for such districts as they should be assigned to by the justices in general sessions,\" as appears by the 2nd section of the act. By the 11th section they were required and empowered \"carefully to mark out all the roads laid out, altered or extended under their direction by the provisions of this act,\" in the manner described in the section. By the 15th section it was enacted that:\nAll the public roads, streets and bridges in each county shall be cleared, maintained and repaired by the male inhabitants thereof being twenty-one years of age (with certain exceptions) who shall work, either in person or by sufficient substitutes, with such instruments as the surveyors shall direct, the number of days as follows, namely, all persons of twenty-one years of age and above\u2014three days; and for any real or personal estate he may possess not exceeding four hundred dollars\u2014one day; exceeding four hundred and not exceeding twelve hundred\u2014two days; exceeding twelve hundred and not exceeding two thousand dollars\u2014three days\u2014and so on in like manner for every eight hundred dollars one day additional for any real or personal estate he may possess not to exceed thirty days in any one year.\nThen by section 16 it was enacted that the estates of females and minors should be assessed in the same manner as the estates of residents, but that any assessment upon their property might be paid for in labour by substitutes. Then by section 18 the commissioners in each parish were required: By the 1st day of May in each year to make a list of the inhabitants of such parish and assess the number of days to be performed by them respectively according to the best of their judgment, &c., &c.\nThen by the 19th section they were empowered:\nPrevious to the commencement of the labour to receive from any person assessed to perform such labour 50 cts. for each days' labour required in lieu of the labour.\nAnd in such case they were required to let out the work by public auction to the lowest bidder and to apply such commutation in payment of the work performed by the persons to whom it should be so let By section 20 the surveyors were required when directed by the commissioners:\nTo summon at the most suitable time between the 1st day of May and the 1st day of August in each year the inhabitants, giving at least six days' notice either by personal service, or by leaving the notice at the place of residence, or by publishing the same in writing in three of the most public places in the district which shall contain the names, the number of days' work to be done by each person respectively, and the instruments to be used by each, the labour to be expended in making or improving the roads and bridges in the best manner, subject to the orders of the commissioner.\nIn short, the whole duty imposed by the act upon commissioners and surveyors of highways is that of providing for the distribution of statute labour under the above sections, and a few others relating to roads in the snow in winter, and the only \"privilege and immunity\" conferred by the act upon the commissioners and surveyors of highways is contained in the 36th section, which enacts that:\nAll commissioners and surveyors of roads shall be exempted from the performance of statute labour.\nBy the 42nd section for any neglect of duty imposed upon them by the act, they are subject:\nFor every offence to a penalty of not less than eight dollars nor more than twenty dollars to be recovered on the complaint of any freeholder, one-half to be paid to the person suing for and recovering the same and the other half to be applied for the improvement of the roads in the district where the offence was committed. Now the provision which is made for the repairing of the streets, side-walks, &c., of the town of Portland by the act 34 Vic. ch. 11, and for raising the funds necessary for that purpose by a poll tax upon every male inhabitant, and rates and taxes levied upon all real and personal property in the town, is so essentially different from the method by statute labour as provided by 25 Vic. ch. 16, that the provisions of this latter statute can more properly, in my opinion, be said to come within the exception contained in the words \"except so far as the same are altered by or inconsistent with the terms of this act\" in the 84th section of 34 Vic. ch. 11; for the repairing of roads by statute labour as provided by 25 Vic. ch. 16 is wholly inconsistent with the other clauses of 34 Vic. ch. 11, whereby the repairing of the streets, side-walks, &c., in the town of Portland is otherwise provided for. How section 84 came to be inserted in the act at all is, to my mind, inconceivable unless it was hastily and inconsiderately and unobservantly inserted while the bill was passing through the legislature.\nThe argument addressed to us on behalf of the appellants assumed that this action, if it lay at all, did so under and by force of this 84th section, and further, for which no authority was cited, that an action of this nature would have been, under the circumstances appearing here, against commissioners of highways before the incorporation of the town, and that therefore the appellants were entitled to notice of action which was a privilege conferred upon commissioners of highways by 31 Vic. ch. 19. Whether a commissioner of highways would or would not be at all liable in an action of the nature of, and under the circumstances of, the present one we need not determine, for the liability of the appellants depends not at all, in my opinion, upon this 84th section, but upon other sections of their act of incorporation which places all the streets, side-walks, &c., in the town under their absolute control, and gives them power to provide the funds to make them and keep them in repair. I am of opinion that no notice of action was necessary, and that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree to the appeal being dismissed on the grounds stated by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: I.

The appellant, Cahan, applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for admission as an attorney and barrister of that court, presenting certificates which showed that he had taken the prescribed course at the law school and received the degree of LL.B. The Supreme Court refused his application on the ground that the act of 1891 had not repealed the statutes previously in force respecting such application, and that it was necessary for the applicant to comply with the conditions contained in such prior statutes.

Under section 46 of the act the want of security is fatal to the appellant; I do not think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is a final judgment within the meaning of that term as used in the Supreme Court Act; and I agree with my brother Strong that the case is not one in which it would be proper for us to interfere. GWYNNE J.\u2014I am not satisfied that we have no jurisdiction. In my opinion, section 46 is only intended to apply to cases where there is somebody to whom security for costs can be given and not to such a case as this. The judgment was certainly final as it disposed of the application, and that being so I do not see how we are precluded from hearing the appeal.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I do not think that the judgment in this case was a \"final judgment\" from which an appeal would lie to this court.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitor for appellant: B.

[1887] ch. 184.) if private lands are injuriously affected by the exercise of municipal powers the council shall make due compensation to the owner, the claim for which, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be determined by arbitration.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that it is only when the act causing the injury can be justified as the exercise of a statutory power that the party injured must seek his remedy in the mode provided by the statute; if the right infringed is a common law right and not one created by the statute remedy by action is not taken away.\nBy sec. 569 of the same act the council, on petition of the owners for drainage of property, may procure an engineer or surveyor to survey the locality and make a plan of the work, and if of opinion that the proposed work is desirable may pass by-laws for having it done.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the council has a discretion to exercise in regard to the adoption, rejection or modification of the scheme proposed by the engineer or surveyor and if adopted the council is not relieved from liability for injuries caused by any defect therein or in the construction of the work or from the necessity to provide a proper outlet for the drain when made thereunder.\nThe act imposes upon the council, after the construction of work proposed by the engineer or surveyor, the duty to preserve, maintain and keep in repair the same. The township of R., in pursuance of a petition for draining flooded lands and a surveyor\u2019s report, constructed a number of drains and embankment. These drains were led into others formerly in use which had not the capacity to carry off the additional volume of water, but became overcharged and flooded the land of W. adjoining.\nHeld, that the municipality was guilty of neglect of the duty imposed by the act and W. had a right of action for the damage caused to his land thereby.\nHeld, per Strong and Gwynne JJ., Ritchie C.J. and Patterson J. contra, that the drain causing the injury being wholly within the limits of the municipality in which it was commenced, and not benefiting lands in an adjoining municipality, it did not come under the provisions of s. 583 of The Municipal Act and W. was not entitled to a mandamus under that section.\nPer Ritchie C.J. and Patterson J. Sec. 583 applied to the said drain but W. could not claim a mandamus for want of the notice required thereby.\nHeld, per Strong and Gwynne JJ., that though W. was not entitled to the statutory mandamus it could be granted under the Ontario Judicature Act (R.S.O.

This drain was constructed under the provisions of the Ontario Drainage Act 33 Vic. ch. 2. By that act it was enacted that after the completion of a work made under the provisions of the act the arbitrators acting under the Ontario Public Works Act, 32 Vic. ch. 28, should make an award, which should be deposited with the Commissioner of Public Works and a copy with the registrar of the county in which the lands to which the award relates are situate, and another copy with the clerk of the township or other municipality in which such lands are situate, to remain forever deposited with the records of such municipality, in which award should be specified the proportions of the total amount of the sums expended in and about the works as executed and which should be payable in respect of the several parcels or lots of land drained or improved, and also the proportion in which the said several parcels or lots and the proprietors thereof should in future be annually charged towards the costs and expenses which might from time to time be incurred in maintaining, cleaning and keeping in repair the drains and drainage works executed under the provisions of the act. By an amendment of this act passed on the 15th February, 1871\u201434 Vic. ch. 22\u2014it was enacted that the municipal council of any township, &c., whose roads might be benefited by the drainage or improvements referred to in the act or the works incidental thereto, and such roads, should be deemed to be within the provisions of the act. The effect of this clause was to make municipal councils and their roads liable to contribute to the original cost of a work and also to the annual charge for maintenance and repair equally as the lands of individuals benefited by the work and their proprietors were. By an act passed on the 29th of March, 1873\u201436 Vic. ch. 38\u2014the act 33 Vic. ch. 2 was repealed, except as to drainage works executed thereunder in respect of which an award has been made, and new provisions were made enabling the Commissioner of Public Works to undertake drainage works, on the application of the council of any municipality, or on the petition of the majority of all the owners, or of a majority of the owners as shown by the last revised assessment roll in any municipality to be resident on the property described in the petition the whole or a part of which is to be benefited by the drainage, and to continue drainage works begun in one municipality into another; and making provision for charging the cost of constructing and maintaining such works upon the lands in both which are benefited by a drain begun in one municipality and continued into another, or by a drain constructed wholly within the limits of one municipality but along the town line separating it from another municipality.\nThe drain no. 1, when it reached the 6th concession of the township, crossed a small watercourse known now as the Raleigh Plains drain, which coming from an easterly and south-easterly direction crossed the side line between lots nos. 12 and 13, and crossing the 6th, 5th and 4th concessions in a north-westerly direction discharged its waters into a stream called Jeannette\u2019s Creek. The drain no. 1 was constructed on this side line, but on its eastern side, and the earth from the drain was thrown up and spread on the western part of the side line to form an embankment to the drain, whereby the part of the road reserved for travel was raised in height; where this watercourse known as the Raleigh Plains drain crossed the side line that watercourse was stopped up by the embankment of the drain no. 1, and the waters coming down from the east were conducted down the drain no. 1 into the Thames. This stopping up of the Raleigh Plains drain at its junction with drain no. 1 does not appear to have answered the purpose intended or expected to have been attained by it, for in 1875 the council of the municipality re-opened the Raleigh Plains drain there and deepened it and enlarged and strengthened it on the west of the side line between lots 12 and 13, under a by\u2011law passed under the provi- sions of the Municipal Act 36 Vic. ch. 48, and thereby a provided better means of carrying off the waters coming down the Raleigh Plains drain from the east and down the drain no. 1 from the south than had been provided by drain no. 1 as constructed.\nBy this act, 36 Vic. ch. 48, the provisions of which were consolidated in ch. 174 of the R.S.O. 1877, and re-enacted in 46 Vic. ch. 18, and consolidated again in ch. 184 of the R.S.O. of 1887, it was enacted that upon a petition presented to the council as provided in the act, petitioning the council\nfor the deepening or straightening of any stream, creek or watercourse, or for the drainage of any property, or for the removal of any obstruction, &c., &c., the council may procure an engineer or provincial land surveyor to make an examination of the stream, creek or watercourse proposed to be deepened or straightened, or of the locality proposed to be drained, and may procure plans and estimates to be made of the work by such engineer or surveyor and an assessment by such engineer or surveyor of the real property to be benefited by such deepening or drainage stating as nearly as may be in the opinion of such engineer or surveyor the proportion of benefit to be derived by such deepening or drainage by every road and lot or portion of lot, and if the council be of opinion that the proposed work, or a portion thereof, would be desirable the council may pass a by-law for providing for the deepening of the stream, creek or watercourse or the draining of the locality.\nThe act then gave a form of by-law to be passed which contained a recital:\nThat the council are of opinion that the drainage of the locality described, or the deepening of such stream, creek or watercourse, as the case may be, is desirable.\nThen by sec. 586 of 46 Vic. ch. 18, as amended by 48 Vic. ch. 39, sec. 27, now sec. 585 of ch. 184 of R.S.O. of 1887, it was enacted as follows:\nIn any case wherein the better to maintain any drain constructed under the provisions of the Ontario Drainage Act, 33 Vic. ch. 2, and amendments thereto, or of the Ontario Drainage Act of 1873, or of the revised statute respecting the expenditure of public money for drainage works, or to prevent damage to adjacent lands, it shall be deemed expedient to change the course of such drain or make a new outlet or otherwise improve or alter the drain, the council of the municipality or of any of the municipalities whose duty it is to preserve and maintain the said drain, may, on the report of an engineer appointed by them to examine and report on such drain, undertake and complete the alterations and improvements specified in the report under the provisions of sections 570 to 583 (of the act of 46 Vic. ch. 18) inclusive, without the petition required by section 570.\nThat is to say without any petition for such alteration. Then by section 587 of 46 Vic. ch. 18 it was enacted that.\nIn any case wherein, after such work is fully made and completed, the same has not been continued into any other municipality than that in which the same was commenced, or wherein the lands or roads of any such other municipality are not benefited by such work, it shall be the duty of the municipality making such work to preserve, maintain and keep in repair the same at the expense of the lots, parts of lots and roads as the case may be as agreed upon and shown in the by-law when finally passed.\nAnd by section 589, it was enacted that:\nWhere the repairs required to be made under section 587 are so extensive that the municipal council does not deem it expedient to levy the cost thereof in one year the said council may pass a by-law to borrow upon debentures of the municipality the funds necessary for the work, and shall assess and levy upon the property benefited a special rate sufficient for the payment of the principal and interest of the debentures, and the by\u2011law shall not require the assent of the electors.\nThen by 48 Vic. ch. 39, section 26, the provisions of these sections 587 and 589 of 46 Vic. ch. 18 are declared to apply to drains constructed under the provisions of the Ontario Drainage Act, 33. Vic. ch. 2, and amendments thereto, or of the Ontario Drainage Act, 1873, or of the revised statute respecting the expenditure of public money for drainage works, as well as to the work to which the said sections now apply; and, further, it was by the section enacted that:\nThe deepening or widening of a drain in order to enable it to carry off the water it was originally designed to carry off, shall be deemed to be a work of preservation, maintenance or keeping in repair within the meaning of sections 584 and 587.\nThese sections 587 and 589 of 46 Vic. ch. 18, as. amended by 48 Vic., ch. 39, section 26, are now to be found in section 586 and 587 of ch. 184 of the R.S.O., 1887.\nLot no. 12, in the 4th concession of the township of Raleigh, was assessed for and contributed to the construction of the above government drain no. 1, and to the deepening, enlarging and straightening of the Raleigh Plains drain as made under the municipal by-law in that behalf in 1875. From the time of the completion of these two drains the lot no. 12 continued to be dry and capable of cultivation until year 1883; but in the interval between the completion of the Raleigh Plains drain improvement and the year 1883 the municipal corporation of the township of Raleigh, constructed, under divers by-laws passed by the municipal council under the provisions of the Municipal Institutions Act, divers other drains which were made to empty their waters into the said drain no. 1, the effect of which in progress of time was that by reason of the new drains bringing down more water, and at a greater speed, into the said drain no. 1 than that drain could retain the embankment of drain no. 1 was broken down and the lot 12 in the 4th concession of Raleigh, of which the plaintiff was tenant, became flooded and unfit for cultivation and continued so to be for some time. The defendants, upon a notice given to them on behalf of the plaintiff, proceeded to repair the breach so made but never restored the embankment to the height and efficient condition in which it was originally constructed. Like breaches from the same cause took place in divers places of the embankment in the years 1885-6 and 7, attended with like consequential flood- ing upon and damage to the plaintiff\u2019s land on said lot 12. In the year 1884 the municipal council of the township, under the provisions of the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1883, 46 Vic. ch. 18, passed a by-law for the construction of, and constructed thereunder in 1885,\na tap drain from a certain other drain called Government Drain no. 2 along the line of lots 10 and 11 in the 6th concession of Raleigh and along the line between the lands of Mr. Dunn and Mr. Huthnance in the 5th concession to the Raleigh Plains drain, and made a dam on lot 9 in the 7th concession to separate the waters of the Kersey drain from the water brought down the Buxton road.\nThis tap drain so constructed was little short of a mile in length, and is called the Bell drain. In the month of January, 1888, the plaintiff, then still being lessee of the lot 12 in the 4th concession of Raleigh, brought an action against the defendants for injury to her land occasioned by the waters coming down the said drain no. 1 breaking through the embankment of that drain on to the plaintiff\u2019s land in the years 1885-6 and 7 and by the waters brought down by the Bell drain into the Raleigh Plains drain in excess of what the Raleigh Plains drain in its then condition could carry off and which were thereby backed up the Raleigh Plains drain against the stream and caused to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land in 1886 and 1887. The plaintiffs action was founded upon the contention that the drains which the defendants were under a statutory obligation from year to year to cleanse, preserve, maintain and keep in repair had been, by the negligence of the defendants and the disregard of their statutory duty, suffered to become so obstructed, choked up, impeded and out of repair as to be incapable of carrying off the extra waters brought into them by the said drains constructed since 1875 by the municipal council of the township, and that therefore the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the injury thereby occasioned to her. She also made claim for a mandamus to compel the defendants to restore, clean out and repair the said drains so suffered to become obstructed, and to maintain the said drains and the embankments thereof in an efficient condition. This action was referred to the county judge of the county of Kent to take evidence and make his report thereon. The learned judge, after a careful inspection upon the ground and taking evidence upon the matters involved, made his report wherein he found among other things,, that the said government drain no. 1 was constructed in the years 1870 to 1873 inclusive along the easterly side of the road allowance between lots 12 and 13 in the said township of Raleigh, commencing in rear of the lake lots and ending the river Thames and lying immediately east of lot no. 12 in the 4th concession of said township, and that as part of the plan or scheme of said drain the earth taken thereout was to be thrown up and, as a matter of fact, was thrown up on the west side of the said drain as an embankment in order thereby to prevent the water from the said drain, and the water flowing into it from the easterly or south-easterly direction, from escaping westward on to the lands of said plaintiff and others; and that it was the duty of the said defendants to keep the said drain properly cleansed out and free from obstructions, and to keep the said embankment in a fit and proper condition; that for some years after the completion of the said drain no. 1 and of the said embankment the said land of the plaintiff was greatly benefited thereby and became more fit for cultivation, and that good crops were grown; that from time to time during the ten years next after the completion of the said drain the defendants constructed a number of other drains leading into said drain no. 1, and thereby brought down into the latter immense quantities of water far beyond its capacity to carry off, and that as a result it become surcharged, and from time to time overflowed the embankment on the west side thereof, and that particularly in the years 1885; 1886, 1887 and 1889, and frequently several times in each of said years, the water thus brought down flowed on to and over the plaintiff\u2019s said land and damaged and injured said land and the crops thereon growing; and that the said drain no. 1 has been allowed to become, and has become and is, through the 6th, 5th and that part of the 4th concession lying south of the Grand Trunk Railway, badly filled up with earth and silt and badly over\u2011grown with grass and willows, and that its capacity has thereby become much diminished and impaired, and is not and has not been for the last five years one-half of what it was when first completed, and that as a result of this condition the overflow of water on to and over the plaintiff\u2019s said lands, and the damage and injury thereto have been much increased; and that by the construction of the Bell drain a large body of water was brought down to the drain known as the Raleigh Plains drain that would not otherwise have come there, and that the Raleigh Plains drain was thereby over-charged with water, and that in time of high water every year except the year 1888, and in some years several times in the year, the water thus brought down has flowed into and over the plaintiff\u2019s land, or by raising the general level of the water has caused other waters to flow on to and over the plaintiff\u2019s land that would not otherwise have gone there, and the plaintiff\u2019s lands and crops have been thereby injured and damaged every year except the year 1888; and that for the water so brought down by the said drains into drain no. 1, and by the said Bell drain into Raleigh Plains drain, the defendants provided no sufficient or proper outlet; and that the defendants have not kept the embankment on the westerly side of the said drain no. 1 up to its original height, nor have they kept it up to the height that it was after the earth thrown up as aforesaid had become firm and settled; and when breaks have been made in the embankment by the water over-flowing as aforesaid the defendants have permitted these breaks to remain for a long time wholly unrepaired, and when repaired they were repaired in an inefficient and inadequate manner and still left lower than the road-bed on the north-west or south-east of said breaks, thereby enabling or permitting water to escape on to and flow over the plaintiff\u2019s said land, causing damage and injury to the crops thereon, that would otherwise have been carried down no. 1 drain to the river Thames; and he assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damage at the sum of $850.00, which sum he found that the plaintiff was entitled to receive and he found also that the plaintiff was entitled to a mandamus directing the defendants to properly repair the said drain no. 1, and to enlarge it sufficiently to provide for the additional water brought down as aforesaid or to provide a proper and sufficient outlet by some other method and to stop the additional flow of water brought down by the Bell drain as aforesaid or provide for its escape by some other sufficient method and to maintain the embankment on the west side of no. 1 drain at its original and proper height. Mr. Justice Ferguson affirmed this report and finding of the learned county judge and rendered judgment thereon in favour of the plaintiff for the said sum of eight hundred and fifty dollars and for the said mandamus, but directed that said mandamus should not issue until further order on a subsequent application or until the defendants should have an opportunity to make such improvements as they may deem sufficient. The Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed this judgment and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendants upon the grounds that the court were of opinion that the plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendants unless upon default committed after a notice in writing under sub-sec. 2 of sec. 583 of ch. 184 R.S.O. of 1887, and that no sufficient notice had been given; that the defendants are not liable for damages arising from their not providing a sufficient outlet for the waters carried through a drain constructed by them under the statutes relating to the drainage of lands; that when a surveyor has devised a scheme of drainage work it is for the corporation simply to construct it as designed without incurring any responsibility in so doing. In effect the judgment of the Court of Appeal was that the evidence disclosed no wrongful act, neglect or default of the corporation subjecting them to an action at suit of the plaintiff, whose only remedy, if any she had, was confined to an arbitration under the Municipal Institutions Act. Mr. Justice Ferguson had expressed the opinion that if a municipal corporation passed a by-law for the construction of drainage work upon a report of an engineer or surveyor employed by them under the statute to examine a proposed work, and constructed the work thereunder, and if the effect of such drainage work should be to deposit the waters carried off from one man\u2019s land upon another man\u2019s land and there leave them without providing any outlet, or means of carrying the waters from the land upon which they were so deposited, this would constitute such wrongful conduct as would render the corporation liable in an action for damages at the suit of the person injured by such conduct. From this proposition the Court of Appeal expressed their unqualified dissent. The question raised by this difference of opinion seems to be simply: Do the drainage clauses of the Municipal Institutions Act require or authorize municipal corporations to carry off the waters on lands proposed to be drained under the statute and to deposit such waters upon lands in a lower position belonging to other persons from which they cannot be removed at all, unless it may be by evaporation, or at least at great cost for which no provision is made? If the drainage sections of the statute do not require or in any express terms authorize that to be done the proposition as stated by Mr. Justice Ferguson seems to me to be well founded in law, and applying it to the present case the only question would be whether the evidence establishes that what was done in the present case was equivalent to the condition of things stated in the proposition of Mr. Justice Ferguson. Now it is to be observed that the drainage clauses under consideration do not require the corporation or its municipal council to do anything whatever for the purpose of draining drowned lands. They simply empower the council of the corporation to employ an engineer or surveyor to make an examination of the lands proposed to be drained, and to make a plan and to report as to whether, and in what manner, in his opinion, the lands proposed to be drained can be drained; and if the council shall be of opinion that the work as proposed by such engineer or surveyor is desirable they may pass a by-law for the purpose. There is no compulsion whatever imposed upon the council to adopt the plan as proposed by their engineer or surveyor. The person so employed is their servant. He may be an ignorant and unskilled person, and if he be, or whether he be or not, the council cannot shirk the responsibility cast upon them of exercising their own judgment in determining whether they shall or shall not adopt the plan as suggested by their servant. If they do adopt it it is their own work for all the consequences attending which they must be responsible, except in so far as they are protected by the statute authorizing them to use their discretion in the matter. I cannot concur, therefore, in the opinion expressed by the Court of Appeal to the effect that when the surveyor suggests the scheme of a drainage work it is for the corporation simply to carry it into execution. They must distinctly exercise their judgment as to adopting or refusing to adopt the scheme suggested, and if they do adopt it it becomes their work and scheme and not their servant\u2019s. We must, I think, in the language of Lord Watson in Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[18] hold that:\nWhere the terms of a statute are not imperative but permissive, when it is left to the discretion of the persons employed to determine whether the general powers committed to them shall be put into execution or not, the fair inference is that the legislature intended the discretion to be exercised in conformity with private rights, and did not intend to confer a license to commit nuisance in any place which might be selected for the purpose.\nAnd again:\nThe justification of the defendants depends upon their making good these two propositions: In the first place that such are the imperative orders of the legislature:\nThat they should do what they have done and is complained of:\nAnd in the second place that they could not possibly obey those orders without infringing private rights\nof the plaintiff as they have done.\nIf the order of the legislature can be implemented without nuisance they cannot plead the protection of the statute, and it is insufficient for their protection that what is contemplated by the statute cannot be done without nuisance unless they are also able to shew that the legislature has directed it to be done. As laid down also by Lord Blackburn in the same case[19] we must hold that:\nWhat was the intention of the legislature in any particular act is a question of the construction of the act.\nNow what is the plain inference to be drawn as to the intention of the legislature in enacting the drainage clauses of the Municipal Institutions Act? The clauses are permissive, not imperative. They do not require or direct any works to be executed at all; whether they shall be executed or not is left to the untrammelled judgment and discretion of the municipal councils. The object of the clauses is to enable lands to be drained for the purpose of cultivation and to provide means of paying the expense of doing so, and of preserving and maintaining them when constructed in an efficient state of repair to perform the purpose for which they designed. There is nothing whatever in any of those clauses to justify the inference that the legislature contemplated or countenanced the idea that water taken from the lands of one person should be so conducted as to be deposited upon the lands of another person. The rational and natural inference is that the intention of the legislature was that the water taken from the lands proposed to be drained should be conducted either directly into some lake, or into some natural or artificial water course having an outlet in some lake which the waters taken from the drained lands could reach without any injury being done to the lands of anyone. Such, as I think, being the manifest intention of the legislature to be gathered from there drainage clauses, if a municipal corporation while professing to act under the provisions of the statute should, by a drain or drains constructed by them, conduct such a body of water and at such a rate of speed into a natural or artificial water course that such last mentioned natural or artificial water course could not resist the rush of the extra water so brought into them and had not sufficient capacity to retain such extra waters so brought down, and to carry them off, and if the consequence should be that the sides of such artificial or natural water courses into which such extra waters should be so conducted should be broken down or overflowed by the rushing waters and adjacent lands should be thereby flooded with water which there were no means of carrying off, doing thereby injury to owners of the lands so flooded, I cannot doubt that such conduct would constitute a private nuisance not at all warranted by the statute, and would be an actionable wrong which could not be justified under the statute.\nIn the present case the plaintiff\u2019s right of action stands, as it appears to me, upon a still firmer foundation for the statute imposed an imperative duty upon the defendants to preserve, maintain and keep in an efficient state of repair the said drain no. 1 and the Raleigh Plains drain into which they conducted the waters brought down by the several drains constructed by them since 1875. For the purpose of keeping these drains, no. 1 and Raleigh Plains drain, in a thoroughly efficient state they were given most ample power annually to levy upon the lands and roads benefited by these respective works a sufficient sum to discharge the imperative duty so imposed upon them. We have seen that to prevent damage to adjacent lands they were empowered, if they should deem it expedient, to change the course of any drain whether constructed under 33 Vic. ch. 2, or under the Ontario Drainage Act of 1873, or under any other act, or to make a new outlet, or otherwise improve, extend or alter any such drain (on the report of the engineer appointed by them under sections 569 to 582 of the said ch. 184, R.S.O. of 1887), without the petition required by said section 569, and the deepening, extending or widening of a drain in order to enable it to carry off the water it was designed to carry off was, by sub-section 4 of section 586 of the said ch. 184, declared to be a work of preservation, maintenance and keeping in repair of the drains which the statute made it the imperative duty of a municipality, making a drainage work within their own limits without benefiting lands or roads in an adjoining municipality, to discharge. Now the finding of the learned County Court Judge, and the evidence upon which that finding proceeds, establish beyond all controversy that the drain no. 1, and the Raleigh Plains drain, which the defendants were by statute imperatively bound to preserve, maintain and keep in repair, had by the mere neglect of the defendants to discharge such their imperative duty been suffered to fall into and continue in such a state of disrepair and inefficiency to do the work required of them that they had respectively lost about two-thirds of their original capacity and were utterly incapable of carrying off the quantity of water brought down to them respectively by the drains constructed by the defendants. This was the cause of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff on her lands, and not the mere construction of the said last mentioned drains by the defendants since the year 1875, and this conducting by the defendants into the drain no. 1 and the Raleigh Plains drain so become inefficient, and deprived of their original capacity by the utter neglect of the defendants to discharge the statutory duty imposed upon them, of a greater body of water than the said drains in such their inefficient condition had capacity to retain was, in my opinion, an unlawful act not at ail warranted by the statute, and constituted an actionable wrong for the injuries resulting from which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in the present action. To injuries arising from such a cause the arbitration clauses of the statute have, in my opinion, no application; they apply only to injuries consequential upon the mere construction of drains authorized by the statute and not to injuries which, as in the present case, as already shown, arise from acts in themselves unlawful which constitute a private nuisance, and which the statute has not only not directed but has not authorised to be committed. The defendants have not attempted to excuse themselves nor can they excuse themselves on the ground of ignorance of the fact that drain no. 1 and Raleigh Plains drain had become quite incapable of receiving and carrying off the waters conducted into them by the drains or some of the drains constructed by them since 1875. As to drain no. 1 the contention of the defendants is that they did repair it annually, but the evidence is that they did not, and that whatever work they did upon it was done in such an imperfect and inefficient manner as to be quite useless; moreover, it was not pretended that the defendants had done anything to remove the obstruction and damage done to either of the above drains by reason of their being filled up, choked and incapacitated by silt and dirt brought down to them by the other drains constructed by the defendants, and by earth from embankments washed away. That the defendants were, in point of fact, made aware of the utter inefficiency of the drains from such causes there was abundant evidence to show; there was also abundant evidence to show that the drains could have been made efficient and at reasonable cost, (\u201cthat\u201d says G.H. Dolsen, who has been a member of the council almost every year since 1871, \u201cis a fact generally conceded\u201d;) and that the drains are wholly inadequate, in the condition into which they have fallen by reason of the neglect of the defendants to discharge their statutory duty, to carry off the extra waters brought down into them by the defendants, was clearly established. J.C. McNab, a surveyor employed by the defendants to examine Raleigh Plains drain and drain no. 1, says that both of them are altogether inadequate to the work now required of them; that the Raleigh Plains drain is in a very bad condition, and that it should be very much improved. In 1887 the defendants employed their surveyor McGeorge to make an inspection and report upon that drain, and he reported to them that the improvement and enlargement of the Raleigh Plains drain was a pressing necessity and demanded the best attention of the council. They, however, did not act upon his report.\nThe liability of the defendants in the present case cannot, in my opinion, be held to depend upon their having or not having had given to them the notice mentioned in sub-section 2 of section 583 of ch. 184 R.S.O. of 1887, which is identical with sub-section 2 of section 584 of 46 Vic. ch. 18 as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 32 section 18. The Raleigh Plains drain is a drain coming under the provisions of section 586 of said ch. 184, which is identical with section 587 of 46 Vic. ch. 18, that is to say, a work completed within the limits of the municipality in which it was commenced and which did not benefit any lots or roads in another municipality. To such a case sub-section 2 of section 583 of said ch. 184 is not by the statute made to apply. That sub-section is limited to works constructed within the provisions of the preceding sections from section 575, which are identical with sections from 576 to 583 in 46 Vic. ch. 18, that is to say, works commencing in one municipality and continued into another, or benefiting lots and roads in another municipality. Drain no. 1 was constructed under 33 Vic. ch. 2 which had no such clause as sub-section 2 of section 583 of ch. 184, but by section 587 of the latter act section 586 of that act is made to apply to drains constructed under 33 Vic. ch. 2 while no such provision is made as to section 583. So that by this section 587 the legislature seems to me in an unequivocal manner to recognise the fact that that section 586, as its language seems in plain terms to convey, applies to cases quite different from those to which sec. 583 applies. But if sub-section 2 of section 583 did apply to the present case it could not, in my opinion, be construed as divesting the plaintiff of the common law right of action which every one has for injuries occasioned by a plain neglect on the part of the defendants to perform an imperative duty imposed upon them by statute. The section must rather be read as conferring a benefit additional to such common law right, and as providing that any person sustaining injury after such notice shall have a right to the mandamus besides the right to recover pecuniary damages for the injury consequential upon neglect after notice. The happening of such injury after such notice may well be held to be conclusive evidence of negligence, but such a provision cannot be construed as divesting a plaintiff of a right of action theretofore accrued by continued neglect of an imperative duty imposed upon the municipality by statute to preserve, maintain and keep in repair the drain when constructed, of the necessity of repairing which the council may have had abundant evidence while the party injured may have been wholly ignorant. However, for the reasons already given, I am of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover apart from any question as to the notice referred to in said sub\u2011section 2 of section 583. It was argued that the damages should be separated, namely, those arising from the Raleigh Plains drain having been surcharged from those arising from drain no. 1, upon the suggestion that the defendants are entitled to levy any damages recovered against them upon the lands chargeable with the maintenance of the said respective drains. It may be very questionable whether damages recovered by a plaintiff by reason of neglect of the defendants to maintain in an efficient condition the drains constructed by them, or by the wrongful introduction into them of more water than in their neglected and inefficient state they are capable of retaining, can under section 592 of ch. 184, R.S.O., 1887, be levied upon the lots chargeable with assessment for the maintenance of the drains. That section would rather seem to be limited to damage occasioned by proceedings taken under the act and so authorized by the act by the parties engaged in the construction of the work authorized. It would seem to be an unnatural and a forced construction of the section to hold that a person made liable to contribute to the construction and maintenance of a drain authorized by the act, because of the benefit it confers upon him, should also be held to be liable to contribute to recompensing himself for damage and injury occasioned to his land by the illegal, wrongful conduct of the municipality and its officers by proceedings not authorized by the statute, or by negligence in the construction of a work which the statute did authorize, or by neglect to discharge the duty of maintenance in repair imposed by the statute. This, however, is a matter with which the plaintiff is not at present concerned. There is no law which makes it imperatively incumbent on a court or jury, where two causes may have contributed to occasioning the injuries complained of, to say how much they attribute to one cause and how much to the other, or which requires the verdict or judgment to be set aside for default of such severance of the damages. In my opinion the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson should be restored; the mandamus is, in my opinion, maintainable, not under section 583 of the Municipal Institutions Act, which, in my opinion, has no application in the present case, but under the provisions of the Ontario Judicature Act ch. 44 R.S.O. 1887.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The government drain no. 1 was constructed between the years 1870 and 1873, and for some years thereafter the plaintiff\u2019s land was greatly benefited by it; but the defendant corporation from time to time during the ten years following the completion of that drain constructed a number of other drains leading into it, and thereby brought down into drain no. 1 immense quantities of water far beyond its capacity to carry off, with the result that drain no. 1 became surcharged and from time to time overflowed the embankment on its west side, particularly in the years 1885, 1886, 1887 and 1889, and frequently several times in each of those years and the water thus brought down flowed on, to and over the plaintiffs land and damaged her land and crops. The defendants provided no sufficient outlet for the additional waters so brought down.\nThose are facts found by the learned referee, whose findings of fact were acquiesced in by the High Court and the Court of Appeal, although those courts differed as to the legal result.\nSimilar facts were found with respect to the Bell drain, viz., that by its construction by the defendants in 1884, and particularly by the construction, as part of the plan of the drain, of an embankment on the westerly side of the drain, a large body of water was brought down to the Raleigh Plains drain that would not otherwise have come there; that the Raleigh Plains drain was thereby overcharged with water; and that in time of high water in the years 1885, 1886, 1887 and 1889, and in some of those years several times in the year, the water thus brought down flowed on to and over the plaintiff\u2019s land, or by raising the general level of the water caused other waters to flow on to and over the plaintiff\u2019s land that would not otherwise have gone there, damaging the land and crops; and for the additional waters so brought down the defendants provided no sufficient outlet.\nWe are not expected to go behind these findings. The same facts were substantially embodied in the following extract from a formal statement agreed upon, for the purpose of avoiding a certain amount of printing, when the case was before the Court of Appeal:\nIt is now admitted by all parties that the drains so constructed at or after the dates of the respective by-laws put in, since no. 1, have not and never had a sufficient outlet to drain the plains and carry the waters running down in their courses past the plaintiff\u2019s lands and other lands in the plains, so as to protect them and the crops thereon from injury, and that the drains constructed since no. 1 was made have increased the flow of water brought down.\nThe drainage clauses as now found in the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1887, ch. 184, do not differ in any respect at present material from those in force when the drains were made. We shall have to glance, though as rapidly as may be, at some of them.\nSec. 569 enacts that in case the majority in number of the owners of the property to be benefited in any part of any township, &c., petition the council for, inter alia, draining the property (describing it) the council may procure an engineer or provincial land surveyor to make an examination of, inter alia, the locality proposed to be drained, and may procure plans and estimates to be made of the work by such engineer or surveyor, and an assessment to be made by such en- gineer or surveyor of the real property to be benefited by such work, and if the council is of opinion that the proposed work or a portion thereof would be desirable the council may pass by-laws:\n1. For providing for the proposed work, or a portion thereof, being done, as the case may be;\n2. For borrowing on the credit of the municipality the funds necessary for the work.\n3. For assessing and levying on the real property to be benefited a special rate to pay for the work;\n4 to 21. For purposes which we need not now stop to notice.\nSection 570 gives a form of by-law which is to recite the prayer of the petition, the examination by the engineer or surveyor of the locality to be drained, or as the case may be, his report thereupon, and the opinion of the council that the work is desirable, and to enact that the report, plans and estimates be adopted and the drain (or as the case may be) and the works connected therewith made and constructed in accordance therewith, and to provide for the borrowing of the money and the levying of the special local rate.\nThe by-laws for the construction of these drains followed the statutory form. The one that related to the Bell drain has been printed as a specimen of the whole. It recited a petition, not for the draining of a locality in the mode which the council may be advised by its engineer to adopt but for a specified work.\nWhereas, a majority in number of the owners as shown by the last revised assessment roll of the property hereinafter set forth to be benefited by the construction of the Bell drain, have petitioned the council of the said township of Raleigh praying that the government drain no. 2 be closed up at a point east from and near to the outlet of the Kersey drain, and that a tap drain be constructed from said government drain no. 2 at or near to the line between lots 10 and 11 in the 6th and 5th concessions to the Raleigh Plains drain. Also, that the Dyke drain he closed up west of said proposed drain. The report of the engineer, also recited, states that he has made an instrumental examination over the route of proposed drain, and reports that the work will comprise the making of a tap drain, &c., &c., adding \u201cThe tap drain will greatly benefit lands assessed,\u201d and giving estimates, with schedule of lands and roads benefited which are to be assessed for the work.\nIf the Raleigh Plains drain, into which the council thus, at the request of William Bell and others the petitioners whose property was to be benefited, ran the tap drain called the Bell drain, had been sufficient to carry off the water thus poured into it no harm would have been done. It was not sufficient, and the consequence was the flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s land which lay beyond the Raleigh Plains drain.\nI am not able to see on what principle the intervention of the engineer, whose advice as to the propriety of running the Bell drain into the other seems neither to have been asked or given, affects the liability of the council to the persons, strangers to the work, who were injured by it. The engineer\u2019s report merely shows how the waters may most effectually be turned into the Raleigh Plains drain, and takes no account of what is then to become of them. The capacity of the Raleigh Plains drain, and of Jeannette\u2019s Creek into which it ran, to receive the waters and carry them to the Thames, which was the outlet, appears to have been assumed without examination. I do not understand the defendants to contend that upon any construction of their statutory powers they had a right to drain any locality by merely conveying the waters to a lower level, without providing an outlet by which they would ultimately be carried to a river or lake. It is plain that the drainage authorised by the statutes is drainage by way of such an outlet. In the case of Malott v. Township of Mersea[20], the question was incidentally discussed before the Court of Appeal in 1886. The judgment of that court does not appear in the reports but it was before us in Mss. on the argument of this appeal. The council may have honestly taken it for granted that the Raleigh Plains drain afforded a sufficient outlet for the waters brought down by the Bell drain in addition to the waters with which it was already charged. They may be credited with having honestly thought so if they gave any thought to the matter, but all the same they were creating the nuisance from which the plaintiffs suffered. They brought the water there without providing an outlet for it, and it matters little to the plaintiffs whether that was due to miscalculation, or to the assumption without any calculation that the drain would carry the water, or even to simple recklessness. The general rule of law on the subject seems to me to be well expressed by Mr. Justice Denman in Humphries v. Cousins[21], when speaking of the right of every occupier of land to enjoy that land free from invasion of matters coming from the adjoining land.\nMoreover, he said, this right of every occupier of land is an incident of possession and does not depend on the acts or omissions of other people; it is independent of what they may know or not know of the state of their own property, and independent of the care or want of care which they may take of it.\nThe divisional court (Denman and Lindley JJ.,) considered these rights of an occupier established by the cases of Smith v. Kenrick[22]; Baird v. Williamson[23]; Fletcher v. Rylands[24] and the older authorities there referred to; and the then recent decision of Broder v. Saillard[25]. The first three of these cases were, s seven years earlier, commented on by the late Sir Adam Wilson in his judgment in Rowe v. Corporation of the Township of Rochester[26], the head note of which case is as follows:\u2014\nThe defendants, in order to drain a highway, conveyed the surface water along the side of it for some distance by digging drains there, and stopped the work opposite the plaintiff\u2019s land which was thus overflowed. Held that the defendants were liable even without any allegation of negligence.\nThe facts which are, thus far, in discussion resemble those in the case of Coghlan v. Ottawa[27] where the city corporation, adopting an existing sewer as part of the drainage system, connected with it two others of greater capacity which brought more water than the first could carry away, in consequence of which water escaped and injured the property of the plaintiff. The city was held liable.\nIn Furlong v. Carroll[28] I had occasion to examine the law with more particular reference to fire communicated from one man\u2019s land to that of another man, but the principle of liability is the same when damages are caused by water. I refer to my judgment in that case.\nI shall not refer to further authority on the subject of the plaintiffs right of action upon the facts as I have stated them, beyond a quotation, which I may adopt as expressing my own conclusion on this branch of the present case, from the language of the present Chief Justice of Ontario in McGarvey v. Strathroy[29].\nThe defendants have in the exercise of their municipal powers caused a larger quantity of water to flow on the plaintiff\u2019s land to her injury than would naturally have flowed thereon. From the early days of our municipal system I think it has been uniformly held that such proceedings give a cause of action. What I have said with respect to the Bell drain and its effects applies equally to the various other drains that discharge into and overcharge the government drain no. 1.\nThe common law right of the plaintiff against these defendants has not, in my opinion, been taken away by anything in the statute.\nThe argument to the contrary is that when drainage works are authorized by a by-law passed in accordance with the statute the corporation incurs no liability to an action for damage caused by the work unless there has been negligence in the execution of it, but that if damages are claimed the procedure to recover them must be by arbitration. The question is not the soundness of the principle thus relied on, which may be conceded, but its bearing upon the facts of the case. The provision of the statute which enables disputes to be settled by arbitration does not of itself cut off the remedy by action when, as in this case, the right infringed is a common law right and not one created by the statute; but if the act that injures you can be justified as the exercise of a statutory power you are driven to seek for compensation in the mode provided by the statute, or if (as has sometimes happened) no such provision is made you are without remedy. But the justification, if otherwise capable of being established, may be displaced, and the right of action maintained, by proof of negligence which caused the damage. The law is stated in terms at once comprehensive and concise in a passage which I shall read from Lord Blackburn\u2019s judgment in Geddis v. Proprietors of Bann Reservoir[30].\nFor I take it, he said, without citing cases, that it is now thoroughly well established that no action will lie for doing that which the legislature has authorized, if it be done without negligence, although it does occasion damage to any one; but an action does lie for doing that which the legislature has authorized if it be done negligently. And I think that if by a reasonable exercise of the powers, either given by statute to the promoters, or which they have at common law, the damage could be prevented, it is, within this rule, \u2018negligence\u2019 not to make such reasonable exercise of their powers.\nI do not doubt that the learned Chief Justice of Ontario correctly applied this principle to the statute before us, considered with reference to the general scope of the drainage provisions, when he said in this case.:\nI am of opinion that a corporation, adopting and carrying out a drainage scheme duly presented to them by a surveyor under the statute cannot be held responsible in damages because the scheme may prove erroneous and inefficient in some important particular, e.g., the not providing a sufficient outlet for the waters which it is designed to carry off. They are held responsible by action for negligence in the execution of the work; but having duly executed it according to its provisions it is not negligence in them that it turns out to be wholly inefficient or useless.\nIn other words, the statute does not make them responsible for the errors or unskilfulness of the drainage scheme duly adopted by them.\nBut I do not think the facts bring this case within the rule so enunciated. The council has obviously a discretion to exercise with regard to the adoption, rejection, or modification of any projected scheme of drainage. The initiative is taken by the owners of real property who may petition for the execution of the kind of work they desire, within the classes enumerated in section 569, some of which works do not, while others do, involve the diversion of waters from their natural channels. The petition may be for the deepening or straightening of any stream, creek or watercourse, or for the draining of property (describing it), or for the removal of any obstruction which prevents the free flow of the waters of any stream, creek or watercourse, or for the lowering of the waters of any lake or pond for the purpose of reclaiming flooded land or more easily draining any lands. The council on receiving the petition may procure an engineer or surveyor to make an examination of the stream, creek or watercourse, or of the lake or pond, or of the locality proposed to be drained, and may procure plans and estimates to be made of the work by the engineer or surveyor, and an assessment of the property to be benefited; and then, if of opinion that the proposed work, or a portion thereof, would be desirable, may pass the by-law.\nTo what extent or upon what information the discretion of the council as to the adoption of the report of the engineer is to be exercised we need not exhaustively consider. They must at least be satisfied that the scheme is one which the statute authorizes. When the drainage of described property is to be undertaken it is the clear intention of the statute that the waters shall be carried to some river or lake, or to a waterway by which they may reach that destination. Large powers are given to engineers and councils with the object of securing in every case a proper outlet. The corporation may not be responsible for the mistake of an engineer respecting the sufficiency of the outlet designed or selected by him, but the report and plans which may be procured for the information of the council, when the drainage of a described area is proposed, would be incomplete if they did not indicate an outlet which, in the judgment of the engineer, was sufficient.\nWe know from the Bell drain by-law, which is before us as a specimen of the by-laws relied on, that the petition, though it may have been practically sufficient, was not in terms for any of the works specified in section 569, inasmuch as it asked, not for the draining of certain lands, though that was really the object aimed at, but for doing specified work, viz.: making a tap drain from one existing drain to another; and we know further that the engineer\u2019s report merely set out the works that would be required in order to turn the waters from the one drain to the other. We cannot say, from anything that is before us, that the council acted upon any skilled advice of the engineer as to the sufficiency of the Raleigh Plains drain as an outlet for the water proposed to be diverted into it.\nSimilar remarks may be made concerning the overcharging of government drain no. 1.\nI am of opinion that these drainage works cannot properly be held, under the circumstances, to be such a reasonable exercise of the statutory powers of the council as to free the municipality from actions for damages for injuries caused by the waters, but that the action can be maintained on the grounds stated in the passage I have quoted from the judgment of Chief Justice Hagarty in McGarvey v. Corporation of Strathroy[31].\nI am further of opinion that it was undoubted negligence to discharge the waters collected from the areas newly drained into the inadequate waterways, called the Raleigh Plains drain and government drain no. 1, without examination of their condition and capacity.\nOn these grounds I think the judgment of the court of first instance, sustaining the award of damages for flooding the lands occupied by the plaintiff, was correct.\nI have now to consider the other branch of the case, which relates to the embankment on the west side of government drain no. 1, which embankment constitutes the travelled part of the road allowance along which the drain is constructed.\nIt is found as a fact that the earth taken from the drain when it was first dug was thrown upon the road so as to form this embankment as part of the plan of the drain, and not merely by way of making a better road. The embankment has been worn down and perhaps washed away in some places, permitting water to run over which ought to have been kept in the drain. In the High Court a writ of mandamus was awarded to compel the corporation to restore the embankment to its original height, by way of enforcing the duty cast upon the municipality to maintain the drain. The drain is wholly within the municipality in which it is commenced, and does not benefit the lands or roads in any other municipality. Sec. 586 declares that it shall be the duty of the municipality making \u201csuch a work\u201d to preserve, maintain and keep in repair the same at the expense of the lots, parts of lots and roads, as the case may be, as agreed upon and shown in the by-law when finally passed.\nThe question whether the duty of keeping in repair drains which do not extend into, or benefit, the lands or roads of another municipality is created by this section 586, or by section 583, is of importance, because section 583 gives the right to a mandamus to compel performance of the duty it imposes only after a reasonable notice to repair, and also, as I read it, makes the notice essential to the liability of the municipality to pecuniary damages for injuries caused by neglect or refusal to repair, while section 586 is silent on those subjects.\nSection 583 is wide enough in its terms to include both classes of drains, those extending into or benefiting more than one municipality and those to which section 586 relates. The language is:\u2014\nAfter such work is fully made and completed it shall be the duty of each municipality, &c.\nWhat is meant by \u201csuch work\u201d? I understand those words to mean any of the works authorized by section 569. We find the same expression in section 586 which commences thus:\u2014\nIn any case wherein after such work is fully made and completed, the same has not been continued into any other municipality, &c.\nIn both sections the term \u201csuch work\u201d means the same thing, and that is, as seems to me very evident, any work done under section 569.\nSection 583 casts upon each municipality the duty of preserving, maintaining, and keeping in repair the work within its own limits, either at the expense of the municipality or parties more immediately interested, or at the joint expense of such parties and the municipality, as to the council upon the report of the engineer or surveyor may seem just. Now, this discretion as to the apportionment of the cost of maintenance and repair was not considered necessary in the case of works that were entirely local in their effect as well as in their situation. Section 586 accordingly declares by whom the expense of maintaining works of that class is to be borne, giving the council no discretion in the matter.\nThe office of section 586 I take to be, not to impose the duty or declare what shall be the consequence of neglecting it,\u2014those things being already done by the earlier section,\u2014but to declare at whose cost the duty is to be performed. In the case of White v. Gosfield[32], in the Court of Appeal, I gave my reasons for so reading the statutes as they stood at the date of that decision, and I do not think the effect of the clauses as now found in the R.S.O., 1887, even with a slight amendment made in 1889, is different from what I then considered it to be, notwithstanding some ambiguities that have been allowed to creep in. The most serious of these ambiguities occurs in sub-section 9 of section 569, in the last part of the sub-section, which represents an amendment made, in 1886[33]. If I am right in my understanding of the effect of those sections 583 and 586, the provision of sub-section 9 to which I refer may perhaps fail in its intended effect, while, if I am wrong, an unexpected and not very creditable anomaly will appear. It would have to be held that a person complaining of the want of repair of a drain lying wholly within his municipality is free from the restrictions prescribed for his neighbor, whose drain is in all respects like the other but happens to benefit some land across the township line, while the first has not that effect.\nNo such an anomaly can have been intended, nor does it, in my opinion, arise upon the proper reading of the statute.\nThe duty to repair thus arising under section 583 the plaintiffs are not entitled to their mandamus unless they gave a reasonable notice to repair as required by that section. I cannot agree with the learned arbitrator that the notice given in 1883, and which was at that time complied with, whether sufficiently or not, can support the claim now pressed, and I agree with the Court of Appeal that the mandamus ought not to have been ordered. Other objections to the writ, or to the terms of the order granting it, I need not consider.\nSec. 583, as I understand it, further makes the notice a necessary preliminary to the liability of the municipality to pecuniary damage to any person who or whose property is injuriously affected by reason of neglect or refusal to repair according to the notice, but this does not, in my opinion, affect the right of the plaintiff to the damages now awarded to her.\nThe work of preservation, maintenance and keeping in repair, under secs. 583 and 586 includes (by the express terms of those sections) the deepening, extending or widening of a drain in order to enable it to carry off the water it was originally designed to carry off. A fortiori the duty to maintain according to the original plans and dimensions of the drain is to enable the drain to carry off the waters it was originally designed to carry off. But this Government drain no. 1, which is a work to the cost of which the plaintiff contributed, was not originally designed to carry off the waters that in later years were turned into it. Those are the waters which, if I correctly understand the findings, overflowed from the drain. The duty of the council towards the plaintiff was to prevent those waters from injuring her land. Whether or not that could have been done by clearing out or enlarging or otherwise repairing the drain, the purpose of the repairs not being to enable the drain to carry off the waters it was originally designed to carry off, sec. 583 does not stand in the way of the recovery of the damages in question.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the High Court restored as to the award of damages, and the appeal should be dismissed as far as it asks for a restoration of the writ of mandamus.\nI think the plaintiff should have her costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Douglas, Douglas & Walker.\nSolicitors for respondents: Wilson, Rankin, McKeough & Kerr.\n[1] 29 U.C.Q.B. 590; 22 U.C.C.P. 319.\n[2] 9 O.R. 611.\n[3] 10 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMortgagor and mortgagee\u2014Foreclosure of mortgage\u2014Practice\u2014Addition of parties\u2014Lessee of mortgagor\u2014Protection of interest of\u2014Staying proceedings\u2014Order for sale of mortgaged lands.\nIn an action for foreclosure of mortgage defendants were the administrator and heirs at law of the mortgagor and certain devisees in trust of deceased heirs. Subsequent incumbrancers, judgment creditors of some of the heirs, and the lessee of the Queen Hotel, part of the mortgaged property, under lease from some of the heirs, were not made parties. None of the defendants appeared and the equity of redemption of the mortgagor and those claiming under him was barred and foreclosed and the lands ordered to be sold on a day named. On that day, on application of the lessee of the Queen Hotel, an ex parte order was made by the Chief Justice directing that on payment into court of $37,019 by S. & K., further proceedings by plaintiff should be stayed until, further order and that plaintiff should convey the mortgaged lands and the suit and benefit of proceedings therein to S. & K. which direction was complied with.\nOn Dec. 26th, 1889, defendants moved to rescind this order. The motion was refused and the order amended by a direction that the lessee should be made a defendant to the action and S. & K. joined as plaintiffs, and that the stay of proceedings be removed. On Jan. 4th, 1890, a further order was made directing that the Queen Hotel property be sold subject to the rights of the lessee. From the two last mentioned orders defendants appealed to the full court which affirmed that of Dec. 26th and set aside that of Jan. 4th. Both parties appealed to this court.\nHeld, that the order of 26th Dec., 1889, was rightly affirmed. The stay of proceedings under the order affirmed by it was no more objectionable than if effected by injunction to stay a sale under a writ of fi-fa, and being made at the instance of a lessee, and as such a purchaser pro tanto, of the mortgaged lands who had a right to redeem it was in the discretion of the Chief Justice so to order. To the direction that plaintiff should convey the lands to S. & K. defendants had no locus standi to object, and they were not prejudiced by the addition of parties made by the order. Nor had defendants a right to object to the removal of the stay of proceedings and any right subsequent incumbrancers not before the court might have to complain would not be affected by the order made in their absence. Moreover, between the date of the order and the appeal to the full court the property having been sold under the decree the purchaser not being before the court was a sufficient ground for dismissing the appeal.\nHeld further, that the order of Jan. 4th, 1890, should also have been affirmed by the full court. In selling the mortgaged property the court had a right to endeavor to preserve the rights of the lessee by selling first the portions in which she had no interest.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming an order of the Chief Justice made on December 26th, 1889 in an action for foreclosure of mortgage and rescinding another order made on January 4th, 1890. The material facts are fully stated in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Strong.\nRoss Q.C. for the appellants in Collins v. Cunningham appeals from the judgment rescinding the order of January 4th, 1890.\nW. B. Ritchie for the respondents.\nW. B. Ritchie for the appellants in Cunningham v. Drysdale argues that the order of December 26th, 1889, should also have been rescinded.\nRoss Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nSTRONG J.\u2014These are appeals from two orders made by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the 10th of July, 1891, by one of which an appeal from an order made by the Chief Justice of that court on the 26th of December, 1889, was dismissed, and by the other, an appeal from another order of the same judge, made on the 4th January, 1890, was allowed and the order last mentioned was reversed, rescinded and set aside. The first mentioned order was made with the concurrence of the three learned judges, Weatherbe, Ritchie and Townshend JJ., who heard the appeals; from the judgment on the secondly mentioned appeal Mr. Justice Townshend dissented.\nThe action was originally instituted by Brenton Collins as the surviving executor of the Honourable Enos Collins for the foreclosure and realization of certain mortgages which had been made by one Bernard O'Neil to secure a large sum of money and interest to Enos Collins. The defendants in the action were Francis Cunningham, the administrator of the mortgagor, Bernard O'Neil, who had died intestate, and the heirs at law of O'Neil, and certain devisees in trust of some of the heirs who had died. None of the subsequent incumbrancers claiming charges against the estate as judgment creditors in respect of judgments recovered against the heirs of the mortgagor were originally made parties to the action, nor was Mrs. Sheraton, who claims to be a lessee of part of the property known as the Queen Hotel in Halifax, under a lease to her made upon the 15th of April, 1886, by Ellen O'Neil, Ellen Cunningham and Rose Cunningham, three of the heirs of O'Neil the mortgagor.\nThe writ, which was specially endorsed, was issued on the 18th of July, 1888, and the statement of claim was filed on the 30th July, 1888.\nNone of the defendants having appeared, on the 31st of July, 1888, an order in the nature of a decree was made whereby, after ascertaining and settling the amount due to the mortgagee for principal and interest, it was ordered that the equity of redemption of Bernard O'Neil, and of all persons claiming title under him or under the defendants, should be barred and foreclosed; that the mortgaged lands and premises should be advertized for sale in a newspaper published at Halifax for at least 30 days and by hand bills posted in the County of Halifax for at least 10 days before the day appointed for the sale, and that \"a copy of said hand bills be mailed to each of the subsequent incumbrancers of said lands and premises at least ten days before such sale.\" And by the same order it was also ordered that \"unless before the day appointed for such sale the amount due to the plaintiff with his costs be paid to him or his solicitor the said lands and premises be sold at public auction by the sheriff of the County of Halifax to the highest or best bidder. And that upon payment of the purchase money the sheriff do make a good and sufficient deed to the purchaser thereof.\" And it was further ordered \"that the said sheriff, out of the proceeds of such sale, do pay to the plaintiff or his solicitor the amount due him for principal and interest on the mortgages sought to be foreclosed with his costs to be taxed, and the balance, if any, to the accountant general to abide any further order that may be made herein.\"\nOn the 9th of August, 1888, Mr. Justice Townshend made an order that William McGribbon and David McGibbon, who were mortgage incumbrancers claiming as such under mortgages made by the heirs of Bernard O'Neil, or by some of them, should have leave to enter an appearance and becomes parties defendant in the action. On the 16th of August, 1888, the Chief Justice in chambers made an order that the mortgaged lands should be sold in two separate lots, that the Queen Hotel property should be sold first, and that the order of foreclosure and sale should be amended by engrafting thereon the order then made. On the 15th September, 1888, which was the day fixed by the sheriff and advertised for the sale, another order was made by the Chief Justice ex parte, on the application of Mary I. Sheraton, whereby it was ordered that upon payment into court in the cause by Joseph Seeton and Donald Keith of $37,019, all further proceedings on the part of the plaintiff should be stayed until further order, and it was also thereby ordered that within twenty days from the date of the order the plaintiff should assign, transfer and re-convey to the said Joseph Seeton and Donald Keith the mortgages sought to be foreclosed therein, and the lands and premises therein mentioned and described free and clear of all incumbrance by plaintiff or any person claiming through or under him, and also the above named suit and the benefit and advantage of all proceedings had and taken therein; and that upon compliance with this order by the plaintiff he should be entitled to be paid out of the said monies the full amount of his claim for debt, interest and costs.\nPursuant to this order Messrs. Seeton and Keith paid into court the amount mentioned in the order.\nSubsequently, and on the 22nd of October, 1888, the Chief Justice made another order whereby it was ordered that the prothonotary should pay, to the plaintiff's solicitor upon his written receipt the sum of $36,923.98 being the amount due the plaintiff herein, out of the monies paid into court under the order of September the 15th, 1888. And pursuant to this order the plaintiff was paid the amount specified, whereupon he assigned his mortgages and conveyed the mortgaged lands and premises to Messrs. Seeton and Keith.\nUpon the 26th of December, 1889, a motion was made by the defendants other than the defendants the McGibbons to rescind the order of the 15th September, 1888, whereupon the Chief Justice refused the motion and further ordered that the order of the 15th September, 1888, should be and the same was thereby amended by adding a clause thereto directing that Mary I. Sheraton be made a party defendant in the action, and it was declared that the said Mary I. Sheraton was thereby made a party defendant accordingly. And after reciting that the order of the 15th of September, 1888, had been complied with by the plaintiff and that the mortgages sought to be foreclosed together with the benefit of the proceedings in the action had been assigned to Messrs. Seeton and Keith upon their application, and with their consent, it was ordered that they should be and they were thereby joined as plaintiffs and made parties plaintiffs in the action, and further that the stay of proceedings directed by the order of the 15th September, 1888, be removed. Mrs. Sheraton, having thus been made a party defendant, on the 31st December, 1889, filed her statement of defence whereby she set up that she was entitled under a lease made by Ellen O'Neil, Rose Cunningham and Ellen Cunningham, dated the 15th of April, 1886, to a term of five years from the 6th of May, 1886, in the Queen Hotel property at the yearly rent of $2,400 payable in monthly payments of $200 each, with a right of renewal for a further term of five years; that she had entered into possession under the lease and made large repairs and improvements on the property, and that she had procured Messrs. Seeton and Keith to pay off the original plaintiff and take an assignment of the mortgages. Subsequently, and on the 4th of January, 1890, the Chief Justice made an order whereby it was ordered that the Queen Hotel property should be sold, subject to the rights of Mary I. Sheraton under the terms of the lease mentioned and set out in her answer, and subject to said lease, and that the order of sale granted on the 31st of July, 1888, as varied by the order of the 16th August, 1888, should be amended accordingly and by engrafting thereon the order now being stated, and that the said lands and premises in said mortgages described be sold as directed and provided in and by the order of sale of 31st July, 1888, and as the same is varied by the order of the 16th August, 1888, and by the order thus made, and that any amount received from the sale of the premises over and above the amount settled by the decree of 31st July, 1888, should be paid into the hands of the accountant general to abide the further order of the court.\nFrom these two orders of the 26th December, 1889, and the 4th January, 1890, the defendants other than the defendants McGibbons appealed to the full court, which court as before mentioned on the 10th July, 1891, gave the judgments already stated dismissing the appeal from the first mentioned order and allowing that from the order secondly mentioned.\nFrom these orders of the full court the present appeals have been brought.\nAs regards the whole of these proceedings I must take leave to remark that they appear to be somewhat out of the usual course of the proceedings in a simple foreclosure suit. It is, however, necessary to examine them separately and ascertain if there were any substantial grounds for displacing the orders made by the Chief Justice. First as to the order of the 26th December, 1889. That order in the first place refused to rescind, and thus indirectly confirmed, the order of the 15th September, 1888, which was made at the instance of Mrs. Sheraton, who, although having under the lease mentioned a very substantial interest in the equity of redemption of part of the lands in mortgage, being in fact a lessee, and as such a purchaser pro tanto, and having thus a clear and indisputable right to redeem, had not up to that time been made a party to the action. It was made ex parte on the very day of the sale. The first provision it contained was to stay the sale. I can see no greater objection to this than would have existed had the proposed sale been under a writ of fieri facias, and had the Chief Justice granted an ex parte injunction to restrain it, a proceeding which would clearly have been unobjectionable on the score of regularity. It was made at the instance of a person having a right to redeem and whose property was about to be sold behind her back as it were, and it being in the discretion of the Chief Justice to stop the sale we might well assume that it was in the interest of justice that it should be stayed, if it did not appear, as in fact it does, that such was the case. Moreover, the stay of proceedings was not to take effect until the redemption money should be paid into court, and the sale directed by the decree of the 31st July 1888, was expressly contingent upon there being no redemption. The defendants, parties interested in the equity of redemption, could therefore have no absolute right to insist that that order was irregular, whatever right the original plaintiff in the action might have had to do so. No such objection is, however, made by the plaintiff. Further the proceedings were only to be stayed upon payment into court, by parties who intervened at the instance of Mrs. Sheraton, of a sum sufficient to cover the full amount of the mortgage debt and interest. I can see no objection to this part of the order. As regards its latter provision, that upon payment of the sum received into court the original plaintiff should assign the mortgages and convey the premises to the parties paying in the money, the defendants have no locus standi to raise any objection to this branch of it, whatever right the plaintiff might have had to do so. The plaintiff did not, however, so object, but acquiesced in it and took the benefit of it by receiving payment of his debt and interest out of the monies obtained by means of its provisions. Therefore, so far as the order of the 26th December, 1889, confirmed this order of September, 1888, by refusing to rescind it it appears to have been unobjectionable. The other directions contained in the order of the 26th December, 1889, relate to the addition of parties. It is provided that Messrs. Seeton and Keith, who had furnished and paid into court the funds to pay off the original mortgagee, should be substituted or added as plaintiffs, and further that Mrs. Sheraton should be made a party defendant. No prejudice whatever could possibly accrue to the present appellants from these directions. It was surely right that Mrs. Sheraton, a party having such an important interest in the equity of redemption as she appears to have had under the lease before referred to, should be a defendant in order to enable her to assert her rights. And as regards the substitution or addition of plaintiffs that must have been a matter of indifference to the present appellants who could not in any way be prejudiced by any transfer or assignment of his rights which the original plaintiff might think fit to make and the substitution of his assignees as parties, plaintiffs, in his stead. It could make no difference to them to whom the proceeds of any sale which might result from the proceedings should be paid to the extent of the mortgage debt and interest.\nThis order of the 26th December, 1889, also discharged so much of the order of the 15th September, 1888, as stayed the proceedings. This left the plaintiffs at liberty to proceed with the sale under the decree of the 31st of July, 1888, which they appear to have done. I can see no objection to this part of the order so far as the present appellants are concerned. Whatever rights persons not parties to the action, viz., subsequent incumbrancers who are judgment creditors, not of the mortgagor O'Neil but of his heirs, may have to object was a question not before the court. The rights of such persons cannot be prejudiced by what was done in their absence, nor by what is now done, and they are still at liberty to raise any objection to the proceedings which may be open to them. Further, inasmuch as it appears from the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend that in the interval between the date of this order and the appeal to the full court the property was sold under the decree, the purchaser under that sale, which was warranted by the decree of the 31st of July, 1888, which itself was not impeached, ought to have been before the court, and on this ground alone the appeal should have been dismissed. It is true that the facts of this sale, and of the execution of a conveyance by the sheriff carrying it out, do not appear from the affidavits, yet inasmuch as Mr. Justice Townshend refers to it as a fact before the court it is right to presume that it was brought in some way to its judicial notice, and at all events it is a fact before this court inasmuch as it was alleged and admitted by counsel on the argument of the present appeal. The appeal from the order of the 26th December, 1889, was therefore, in my opinion, rightly held by the full court to be unfounded and was properly dismissed.\nThe principal objection to the order of the 4th of January, 1890, was that it directed the Queen Hotel property to be sold subject to Mrs. Sheraton's rights, whatever they were, under the lease made to her in April, 1886, of that property. Whatever her rights under that lease were is a point we are not called upon to consider, but whether she merely obtained a lease from three of the heirs at law of their undivided interests, or whether these lessors were entitled under some partition to that property in severalty, or whether the lease had been confirmed by the other heirs by receipt of rent, are matters all beside the present question. Whatever rights Mrs. Sheraton had acquired under the lease she had so acquired as a purchaser for valuable consideration of the equity of redemption pro tanto and as such it was entirely in the discretion of the court in selling, and quite right that they should endeavour to preserve these rights by selling, the other properties in which she had no interest in priority to the property demised to her. In my experience it was always the practice of the master's office in selling different parcels of land embraced in the same mortgage, in some of which the equity of redemption had been sold by the mortgagor to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser, to sell in such order of priority as if possible to conserve the rights of the purchaser. And this was done without any special direction in the decree. The soundness of such a mode of procedure is obvious if we consider that it is an established rule of equity that when some of several parcels of land subject to a common charge have been sold by the owner of the equity of redemption to purchasers for value, as between such purchasers and the mortgagor, and subject, of course, to the rights of the mortgagee which remain unaffected by such a sale, the different parcels are liable to the charge of the mortgage debt in the inverse order of their alienation. I am of opinion therefore, that the order of the 4th of January, 1890, was warranted\u2014the mortgagees not objecting\u2014by this consideration. I must therefore agree with Mr. Justice Townshend in holding that the appeal from the order last mentioned ought also to have been dismissed by the full court.\nIt is to be observed that the disposition we now make of this appeal cannot in any way affect the rights of subsequent incumbrancers not before the court. The decree of the 31st of July, 1888, by which an immediate sale was ordered was not impugned. It may still be open to those incumbrancers to object that such a decree ought not to have been made in their absence, and if they are able to do so in other respects the orders pronounced on these appeals cannot prejudice their right to impugn not only that decree but also the sale made under it. Further, I would repeat what has been already said, that it is not now assumed to define what Mrs. Sheraton's rights under the lease may be. This uncertainty may no doubt have prejudiced the sale and have had a depreciating effect upon it, if indeed anything could be considered depreciatory under a system in which mortgage sales are conducted by the sheriff like a sale under an execution without, as far as can be seen, any conditions of sale being settled by the court or its officers, or any investigation of the title had. No objection on this score has been raised by the appellants. As regards subsequent incumbrancers it must, I repeat, be distictly borne in mind that the orders now made are entirely without prejudice to their rights to impugn either the decree or the sale under it, or to ask satisfaction out of Mrs. Sheraton's interest if they can shew that their rights are paramount to hers, if they prefer doing this instead of having recourse to the fund remaining in court derived from the proceeds of the sale for the satisfaction of their judgments.\nThe appeal from the order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia dismissing the appeal from the order of 26th December, 1889, must be dismissed, and that from the order allowing the appeal against the order of the 4th January, 1890 must be allowed; both with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs as to order of December 26th, 1889, and allowed with costs as to order of January 4th, 1890.\nSolicitors for appellants, plaintiffs: Ross, Sedgewick McKay.\nSolicitors for respondents, defendants: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\n[1] 23 N.

B. S. conveyed this lot, through the C. B. Coal Co. to the S. & L. Coal Co. S. having died his widow brought an action for dower in said lot to which the company pleaded that the grant to S. was void, the property being vested in the Dominion government.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that the company having obtained title to the property from S. they were estopped from saying that the title of S. was defective.\nPer Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting. The conveyance by S. to the C. B. Coal Co. was an innocent conveyance by which S. himself would not have been estopped and as estoppel must be mutual his grantees would not. There were no recitals in the deed that would estop them and estoppel could not be created by the covenants.\nAfter the conveyance to the defendant company an act was passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia ratifying and confirming the title of the defendant company to all property of the C. B. Coal Co.\nHeld, that if the legislature could by statute affect the title to this property which was vested in the Dominion government it had not done so by this act in which the crown is not expressly named. Moreover the statute should have been pleaded by the defendants. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and the judgments of the court hereinafter given.\nW. B. Ritchie for appellant referred to Gaunt v. Wainman[2] and Small v. Procter[3] on the question of estoppel.\nDrysdale for the respondent cited Hitchcock v. Harrington[4] and Bigelow on Estoppel[5].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Inasmuch as the defendants claim title to the premises in question from the Cape Breton Co. limited, who obtained title to the same from Wm, Sword and entered into possession under such title, I think they, the defendants, are estopped from saying that no title passed to Sword or from questioning the title of Wm. Sword under his grant from the crown by the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia to Sword who entered into possession under the grant to him and the Glasgow and Cape Breton Railway Co. under Sword's deed to them, and the Sydney and Louisburg Coal Co. under the Glasgow and Cape Breton Co. with no better or other title than the Glasgow and Cape Breton Co. obtained from Sword.\nHow can it be urged that the defendants did not claim through Sword when the Glasgow and Cape Breton Co., whose only claim to the lot was through Sword, as defendants' factum admits, \"made a conveyance to the defendant company which, among other things, purported to convey the land in question.\"\nIt is not shown or pretended that the defendant company had or claimed to have any other title to the land in question. It must be borne in mind that this is not a controversy between the Government of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada in respect to the title to this lot. Nor are the defendants claiming under the Government of Canada; nor is the Government of Canada in any way assuming or claiming title to this land. Therefore, I think the title of the Government of Canada is not involved in the discussion of the rights of the parties in this case.\nThe grant from the Government of Nova Scotia to Wm. Sword is a grant in fee simple. I think Sword had such a seizin under the grant from the Government of Nova Scotia, as that dower would attach against all persons claiming under such seizin, until such seizin should be avoided by the entry or action of the person having right. No paramount title in defendants is set up, or asserted, still less proved by defendants against the widow, and therefore in my opinion she is entitled to her dower. What could be more unjust than that defendants should claim the land under Sword's title and repudiate the title of Sword's wife, claimed under the same title?\nNo question arises as to improvements made on the land by the company subsequent to the death of Wm. Sword, because the judgment only decrees that:\nIt is ordered that the plaintiff do recover against the defendant her dower in the lands described in the writ of dower herein, the same to be assigned and laid off to her according to the value of said lands at the date of the death of William Sword, mentioned in said writ of dower, and that the plaintiff do recover against the defendant her costs to be taxed.\nAnd plaintiff has not appealed against this.\nBut it is said the act of the local legislature, cap. 73 of the acts of 1881, bars her claim for dower in the property and restricts her claim to the recovery of compensation only for her right of dower. In the first place this statute has not been pleaded as I incline to think it should have been. But assuming it was not necessary to plead the statute, I cannot think it can in any way avail as an answer to this action.\nI refrain from expressing any opinion as to the power of the local legislature to legislate in reference to Dominion Crown lands, because, in my view of this case, it is unnecessary to do so inasmuch as I think the local legislature has not done anything of the kind. I agree with the plaintiff's counsel that the act in question must be strictly construed, and I think it must be confined in its operations to lands other than Dominion Crown lands over which the local legislature had clearly power to legislate.\nI think there is not any pretence for saying that the local legislature intended to interfere with Dominion land, and it may be admitted, under the authority of Holman v. Green[6], that the property in question at the passing of British North America Act belonged to the Dominion government. But assuming the local legislature had power to pass this act, what does it enact?\nThe purchase by and conveyance to the Sydney and Louisburg Coal and Railway Company made, &c., * * * are hereby absolutely ratified and confirmed, and the title to said leases and said real and personal estate and to the line of railway hitherto operated, &c., * * * and the lands whereon the same is situated, are vested in the Sydney and Louisburg Coal and Railway Company.\nHow can this apply to Dominion Crown lands? No mention whatever is made of the crown or the rights of the crown. If this statute was to operate at all, it would in the words of the statute absolutely ratify and confirm the purchase by and conveyance to the Sydney and Louisburg Coal Company and would vest the title to the lands, &c., in the Sydney and Louisburg Coal Company, but how could this act have this operation if the title to this land was in the crown. The crown is in no way named or referred to in the act, and without express words how is it possible the rights of the crown could be interfered with, and if the act could not have the operation which its clear unambiguous language indicates does this not show that the legislature did not intend to deal with property situate as this was, but only to property in which it had the right to vest an absolute title or estate.\nUnder all these circumstances I am very clearly of opinion that the widow of Wm. Sword is justly and legally entitled to her dower in the lands in question.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an action of dower unde nihil habet in which the respondent claimed to recover legal dower out of certain land being part of the foreshore in the harbour of Sydney in Cape Breton. The defence insisted upon was that the husband was never seized. The writ alleges that William Sword, the demandant's huband, was seized of these lands in his demesne as of fee during the coverture. There is no formal plea traversing the allegation of seizin in the established form of a plea of ne unques seisi\u00e8 que dower. The third plea denies possession, but that is not equivalent to a traverse of the averment of seizin. The fifth plea, however, may be treated as substantially such a plea, though informal. It alleges that the lands covered with water described in the writ are part of the navigable waters of Sydney harbour and were held by the demandant's husband under a grant from the province of Nova Scotia made since the 1st July, 1867, and contrary to the British North America Act. In the case of Holman v. Green[7] this court determined that the foreshore in harbours on the sea coast of the Dominion was vested in the crown in right of the Dominion and therefore could not pass under a provincial grant made since confederation. The law then declared has since been altered by statute, but in 1888 at the time this action was commenced and the plea referred to was pleaded it had not been so altered, and the statute in question has no retrospective effect. Therefore, although under the rules of special pleading this would be an argumentative traverse, yet as no objection was (even if it could have been) taken to the form of the plea, I am of opinion that it is an equivalent to a traverse of the seizin alleged by the demandant. The reply of the demandant took issue upon all the pleas and also replied an estoppel to the fifth plea.\nNow upon the evidence it appears quite clear that the respondent's husband never was rightfully seized of the lands in question. The paper title proved consists of a grant from the crown to William Sword the respondent's husband under the great seal of the province of Nova Scotia, made upon the 22nd October, 1867, a conveyance by way of bargain and sale from W. Sword to the Glasgow and Cape Breton Coal and Railway Co., and a subsequent conveyance by the latter company to the present appellants the Sydney & Louisburg Coal and Railway Co. (Limited).\nApart from estoppel and from the statute to be afterwards mentioned, it is clear that no seizin is thus proved. The provincial grant was void ab initio and consequently no seizin passed by it to the grantee William Sword, the demandant's husband. We could not hold otherwise without either overruling Holman v. Green[8], or giving to the Dominion statute mentioned a retroactive effect against the crown which its language does not in any way warrant. The demandant's husband was therefore never seized of right. As regards seizin in fact, or wrongful seizin, that is out of the question, since the title was in the crown which cannot be disseised.\nThen the replication to the fifth plea sets up an estoppel in this that the appellants claiming under and deriving title from the respondent's husband are estopped from denying his seizin. This defence is attemped to be supported by a reference to some Ontario cases by which we are not in any way bound and the soundness of which is, moreover, in my opinion open to question. The conveyance by William Sword to the Glasgow and Cape Breton Coal and Railway Company was what is technically termed an innocent conveyance, that is a conveyance not having any violent or tortious operation, such as a fine or feoffment formerly had; it follows that William Sword the grantor would not himself have been estopped by it. Bensley v. Burden[9]; also in note to Doe Irvine v. Webster[10].\nTherefore as all estoppels must be mutual, the grantor not being estopped the grantees would not be estopped either; consequently there was not, so far as appears upon the face of the paper title, any estoppel binding on the appellants. Had the deed contained recitals alleging that the grantor was seized in fee it would have been different, for a grantor conveying even by an innocent conveyance is estopped by recitals, but no such recitals appear to have been contained in the deed in question. The deed did, it is true, contain covenants, and I am not unmindful that the court of Queen's Bench for Ontario in the case of Doe Irving v. Webster[11] decided that an estoppel could be created by the covenants in a purchase deed, but, whatever effect this decision may have in the province of Ontario it is not (binding upon us in deciding a Nova Scotia appeal, and since Jessel M. R. in the case of the General Finance Mtge. & Disci. Co. v. Liberator Permanent Benefit Bg. Socy.[12] decided exactly the reverse, and that for reasons which must commend themselves to every property lawyer, I do not see that we can properly disregard his great authority on such a point in the present case. A grantor, who purports to convey land to which he has no title, if he afterwards acquires title will, no doubt, be restrained by a Court of Equity from setting up his paramount title against his own grantees and will be compelled to make good out of the title so subsequently acquired the title which he had previously purported to convey. But this equity is one which is only enforced on proper terms and is something wholly different from legal estoppel.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the respondent entirely failed in making out the title by estoppel.\nIt is, however, lastly urged that the statute of Nova Scotia 1881, ch. 73 sec. 15, cures all defects in the conveyance and is conclusive in favour of the demandant. There are several objections to this. In the first place the statute is not pleaded. Next, although its effect should be to vest a title in the appellants; it has no retroactive effect so as to confer a seizin on the husband of the demandant. Thirdly, even granting that it was within the powers of the Nova Scotia legislature, under the authority to legislate regarding property, to vest a title in lands the seizin of which was in the crown, in right of the Dominion, in private owners, (a point on which I withhold any expression of opinion) yet on well established principles of construction this statute could not have any such operation. It has been repeatedly laid down that no statute shall be construed as affecting the crown or its property unless the crown is expressly named in it. Then no reference to the crown is to be found in the provincial act under consideration.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff by writ of dower claims dower in a piece of land described in the writ as a piece of land covered with water, situate in Sydney Harbour in the county of Cape Breton, of which piece of land, particularly described by metes and bounds in the writ, the plaintiff alleges that her deceased husband was during the coverture seized in his demesne as of fee. To this writ the defendants among other defences plead in substance that the land in the writ mentioned constituted part of the navigable waters of the Harbour of Sydney in the county of Cape Breton, and had been held by the plaintiff's husband only under a grant from the province of Nova Scotia since July 1st, A D. 1867, contrary to the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867. The object of this plea and its substantial effect was to assert that the plaintiff's deceased husband never had any estate in the piece of land covered with water, nor any thing more than a bare possession devoid of title for that the grant under which he had possession was null and void under the British North America Act as was adjudged by this court in a similar case in Holman v. Greene[13], and that Her Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada was and is seised in right of her crown in the land in question as part of the harbour of Sydney. To this defence the plaintiff replied that she would object that the defendants ought not to be admitted to say that the said land covered with water mentioned and set forth in the plaintiff's writ is part of the navigable waters of the harbour of Sydney in the county of Cape Breton, and was held by plaintiff's deceased husband by through or under a grant from the province of Nova Scotia since July 1st, A.D. 1867, and contrary to the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, because the defendant company acquired their title by or through the plaintiff's deceased husband, and said defendant company should be estopped from pleading his want of title as a defence. Now it is to be observed that the plaintiff in her writ of dower averred that the land in question was situate in Sydney harbour and by the above replication she in effect insists that the defendants should not be admitted to aver:\n1st. That the land in respect of which the plaintiff claimed dower was situate in the harbour in which the plaintiff herself in her writ alleged it to be situate; and\n2nd. That her deceased husband had held the land under a grant from the province of Nova Scotia since the 1st July, 1867.\nNow supposing the question involved in this pleading to have been raised by a demurrer to the above replication, the question would simply be: Could the fact that those under whom the defendants claim received possession of the premises in question from the plaintiff's deceased husband operate as an estoppel in law to their insisting that the land out of which the plaintiff claims dower, as being a part of a public harbour of the Dominion of Canada, is by the constitutional act constituting this Dominion vested in Her Majesty in right of her crown for the public use and benefit of the subjects of the Dominion? So to hold would, in my opinion, carry the doctrine of estoppel beyond anything that is warranted by any decided case. But the question does not arise upon a demurrer to the above replication, for the case went down to trial upon several issues joined between the parties, and the plaintiff as part of her case produced in evidence a certified copy of an instrument purporting to be a grant of the land in question by the government of the province of Nova Scotia to the plaintiff's deceased husband, dated the 22nd October, 1867, for the sum of $50.00. The plaintiff thus asserted her claim upon the very instrument upon which by her replication she insisted that the defendants should be estopped from averring that her husband in his life time held the possession which he had of the land in question. She herself proved as part of her case what she insists the defendants should be estopped from averring. Upon her production of that instrument its construction and effect became matters submitted by the plaintiff herself to the judgment of the court which was bound by the judgment of this court in Holman v. Green[14]. The court could not be estopped from construing nor could the defendants be estopped from calling upon the court to construe, an instrument put in evidence by the plaintiff as part of her case and in virtue of which she claimed. The moment she put that instrument in evidence it became the duty of the court to construe it and to declare what effect it had as part of her case and her subsequent production of certified copies of an instrument purporting to be a deed of bargain and sale of the same land to the Glasgow & Cape Breton Coal and Railway Company, and of a deed executed by the Cape Breton Railway Company in liquidation to the defendant company could not withdraw from the court the duty of construing the first instrument which had been put in evidence by the plaintiff The defendants, while admitting that the deed of bargain and sale executed by plaintiff's deceased husband to the Glasgow & Cape Breton Railway Company passed to that company what possession he had, may well call upon the court to construe the effect of the instrument purporting to be letters patent from the province of Nova Scotia which the plaintiff has put in evidence, and may insist that having herself shown that the land in question is still vested in Her Majesty in right of her crown as the property of the Dominion of Canada, she has shown that the land is not land out of which she can have dower assigned to her. The doctrine of estoppel does not, as it appears to me, apply to such a case. If the doctrine did apply the plaintiff could, however, not claim dower but only damages under ch. 73 of the acts of the legislature of Nova Scotia in 1881 for such interest or such claim for dower which she had in the premises according to their value at the time of the execution of the deed of bargain and sale by her husband in 1871, for she could not while estopping the defendants from disputing her husband's title in the land under the provincial letters patent, being such as to give her a right to dower, insist herself that the provincial letters patent passed no title, and that the estate is still vested in Her Majesty in right of her crown for the purpose of insisting that the act of 1881 did not affect her.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I do not think that the Nova Scotia statute on which the appellants place so much reliance stands in the way of the recovery of her dower by the plaintiff.\nThe reasoning of Mr. Justice Meagher shows, conclusively to my mind, that the proper effect of the statute is to confirm what the deed of the tenth of January, 1881, professed to do, and that the right to compensation to which it restricts persons claiming any interest in or lien on the leases and real and personal estate at the time of the conveyance, is confined to compensation out of the fund set apart for that purpose in respect of properties in the second part of the schedule described, and does not touch the land now in question which the deed includes among the properties to which the title is recited as absolute.\nBut if this construction were not to prevail I still do not think the deed need interfere with the plaintiff's right to recover her dower. \"Compensation\" as it would then have to be read, would not be a very precise expression, and it would be given sufficient effect to by holding that the dower, in place of being set off by metes and bounds, should be commuted into a money payment, which is not an unusual mode of assigning dower.\nUpon the main question I am of opinion, for the reasons given in the court below where upon this point the judges were unanimous, and now given by his lordship the Chief Justice, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover. She proves that the defendants hold under the grantees to whom her husband conveyed by deed professing to grant the land in fee, and whom he put in actual possession of the land. That by itself is sufficient proof of title as against the defendants. But it is said that because the plaintiff put in evidence a grant of the land to her husband from the province of Nova Scotia, and because the land, being part of the foreshore of the harbour, belonged to the Dominion under the British North America Act, the plaintiff herself proved that her husband was not seized. I do not agree with that idea. In strictness all that is necessarily to be inferred is that immediately after confederation the land had been the property of the Dominion. But if the fact is taken to be that the land is still legally vested in the crown in right of the Dominion, the result is that a paramount title is shown which might be asserted against the defendants, and of course against the doweress, but which the defendants have no right to assert. There is abundant authority for this. Mr. Justice Townshend cites a passage from Park on Dower[15] in which the proposition is laid down, and refers to an English case and an Upper Canada case which are in point. In Gaunt v. Wainman[16] the evidence relied on to prove the demandant's right to dower was proof of a conveyance of the premises to the defendant by the assignees in bankruptcy of the husband. It was held that that deed did not estop the defendants from proving that the husband's estate was a leasehold, but the mode of proving the prim\u00e2 facie title was not questioned. The report of the case is very short. There was a fuller discussion in the Upper Canada case of Haskill v. Fraser[17] where the question was not complicated by anything corresponding to the fact in Gaunt v. Wainman (2) that the deed was not from the husband, though conveying his estate, and which case on the other hand turned chiefly on a question of pleading, it being held that the demandant ought to have pleaded the estoppel on which she relied\u2014a point not raised in the present case and which under the existing system would be less formidable than it was thirty years ago. The decision was that the defendant was not estopped from showing that the husband was a joint tenant of the land and that his co-tenant had survived him.\nDraper C.J. stated the general proposition that a person who accepts a grant is not estopped from saying that it does not pass so great an estate as it purports to convey, but only from saying that it passes no estate. In Roper on Husband and Wife[18] the law is thus laid down:\u2014\nAlthough it be generally necessary, as before appears, that the husband's seizin should be that of an estate of inheritance, yet it may happen that his widow may be entitled to dower when he was in fact seized of an estate for life or possessed for years only. But such title is defective since it springs out of the tortious act of the husband, as by his making a feoffment in fee. In such cases, however, the widow's right to dower will, it is presumed, be complete against the feoffee and the persons claiming under him; for the feoffee by accepting the conveyance admits that the husband was seized in fee and entitled to pass it; and the feoffee and such claimants are estopped from showing that the husband had a less estate, but as against the persons lawfully entitled to the lands upon the expiration of the husband's life estate or term for years the widow cannot claim dower, since they are not prevented from showing what interest the husband had in the premises.\nI quote another passage[19] following a discussion of the effect of the husband's estate being subject to a condition:\nIn truth, in all other cases, if the husband's seizin be defeated by a lawful title existing prior to the marriage, his wife's initiate title to dower will determine with it; for when the person so entitled recovers the estate it will have relation back beyond the marriage, and be attended with the like consequences as the entry of a donor for condition broken.\nIt is true that the conveyance by Sword was not a feoffment and did not create a fee by wrong. The estoppel created by it had not so large an effect as to do more than, as shown by Draper C.J. in Haskill v. Fraser[20], prevent the grantees and those claiming under them from denying that some estate passed. Prim\u00e2 facie the estate was in fee, but if it were in fact a less estate that might have been shown. No such thing, however, is attempted. The assertion is that no estate whatever passed, and that assertion is forbidden by the estoppel. I am not pressed by the objection that the plaintiff herself proves that her husband took under a title, ostensibly a grant in fee but liable to be defeated by a paramount title. The existence of a paramount title not, by itself, defeating the right to dower as against the husband's grantee, I do not see that it makes any difference whether the fact is shown by the plaintiff or the defendant. The plaintiff does no more than she would have (under the old system) done by her pleading, if as said in Haskill v. Fraser[21], the estoppel had to be pleaded. Her replication would admit the plea that her husband was not seized, and would aver that the defendant took under him, submitting that therefore the defendant should not be allowed to set up the truth.\nI refer also to chapter 31 of Mr. Malcolm G. Cameron's very useful treatise on the Law of Dower.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gillies & MacEchen.\nSolicitor for respondent: E.

S. C, ch. 8, sections 30 (b), 31, 33, 41, 54, 58 and 65\u2014The Electoral Franchise Act, R. S. C, ch. 5 section 32.\nHeld, affirming the decision of Gill J., that where the petitioner's status in an election petition is objected to by preliminary objection, such status should be established by the production of the voters list actually used at the election or a copy thereof certified by the clerk of the Crown in Chancery (R. S. C, ch. 8, sections 41, 58 and 65, R. S. C. ch. 5, section'32), and the production at the enqu\u00eate of a copy, certified by the revising officer, of the list of voters upon which his name appears, but which has not been compared with the voters' list actually used at said election, is insufficient proof. Gwvnne and Patterson JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, District of Richelieu, (Grill J.) maintaining the preliminary objections filed by the respondent to the election petition.\nThe respondent by a preliminary objection to the election petition filed against his return as a member of the House of Commons of Canada, for the Electoral Division of Richelieu, specially denied the qualification of the petitioner (appellant) as an elector who had a right to vote at the said election and alleged that he had no right to be a petitioner, not being, at the time of the election, an elector for the county of Richelieu, and that said petitioner had lost his right to vote at said election on account of corrupt practices during said election.\nThe case having been fixed for proof and hearing on the preliminary objections on the 23rd July, 1892, the returning officer, one J. N. Mondor, was heard as a witness and produced as petitioner's exhibit \" A \" the voters' list for 1891 on which the said election had been held, duly certified by the revising officer. The respondent objected to the production of this list and all proof therefrom, claiming that the copies of the lists which had been placed in the hands of the deputy returning officer and which had been returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery were the only lists which could be put in evidence.\nAfter hearing counsel on both sides the presiding judge dismissed this objection.\nThe returning officer then stated that the list Produced was the one on which the election had been held and that petitioner whom he identified and declared he well knew, was a voter and his name was on such list and further that he had got such list certified by the revising officer for the purpose of its being put in as evidence.\nAn adjournment was asked for by the respondent to prepare his evidence and on the 27th July the case was resumed, the petitioner with the permission of the judge once more examining the returning officer to correct an omission made by the clerk in writing down his deposition and added that the list he had produced had not been used at the said election.\nOn this evidence the case was submitted and adjourned to the 10th August, 1892. After the argument the petitioner, on the 10th August, while protesting he waived no right and was not bound so to do in order to remove all cause of doubt made a motion to be allowed to re-open his enqu\u00eate in order that he might produce the list returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.\nThe learned judge refused to grant this motion, and on the 13th August dismissed the petition on the sole ground that the list produced was no evidence, and that the lists returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery alone could have been put in as evidence.\nMorgan and Gemmill for appellant contended that under the statute and the law of Lower Canada the copy of the list produced by the appellant, certified by the revising officer, makes equal proof and is as good evidence as the original in the hands of the revising officer, and is binding as evidence, under the Electoral Franchise Act cap. 5 sec. 22 R.S.C. of the right of petitioner to vote at the election in question, and is sufficient for all purposes of election petitions, and cited and relied on R.S.C ch, 8 sec. 13; 52 Vic. ch, 9 sec. 8; arts. 1207 and 1211 C.C.; Magnan v. Dugas ([1]); The Megantic Election Case ([2]) The Prescott Elec-tiont Case ([3]).\nThis coupled with the rejection of petitioner's motion to be allowed to make such further proof would be quite valid ground for the allowance of the present appeal were it not fully justified by the evidence adduced and the law and jurisprudence on the subject.\nBelcourt and Plamondon for respondent contended that it was not proved that the copy of the list which had been produced was a copy of the list which had been used for the election in question in this case and that such evidence could have been easily given, and that by law and the decision of this court in the Stanstead Election Case ([4]), the petitioner was obliged to prove his quality of elector when such quality was denied by preliminary objection, and that by law he was obliged to make such proof by the best possible evidence; viz. in this case by the production of the list used for the election, or a copy thereof duly certified by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and cited and relied on sections 41 65 and 67 oh. 8 R.S.C.; Greenleaf on Evidence ([5]); Powell Law of Evidence ([6]).\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Grill of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, dismissing the petition of the appellant against the return of the present respondent as a member of the House of Commons for the electoral division of Richelieu.\nThe election was held on the 4th and 11th of January, 1892. The petition of the appellant .Francois Xavier Alcide Paradis was filed in due time after the return.\nIn the third paragraph of the petition the petitioner alleged that he was an elector qualified to vote and having a right to vote at the election, and that his name was inscribed on the list of voters which was used as well as on those which ought to have been used at the election.\nThe petition alleged various corrupt acts on the part of the sitting member (the present respondent) and his agents, and prayed that the election might be set aside and the respondent disqualified.\nThe respondent filed preliminary objections, one of which was that the petitioner had not the right of voting at the election, and that \" he was not and is not\" inscribed on the list of electors in force at the said election, and that he has not the quality required for maintaining the petition.\nOn the 23rd of July, 1892, an enqu\u00eate on .the preliminary objections was opened before the Honourable Mr. Justice Grill and the returning officer, Mr, Mondor, was called as a witness on the part of the petitioner, who proved that he was returning officer at the election, and he produced a copy of the list of electors for 1891 for the polling district No. 1, Of the electoral division of Richelieu, certified by the revising officer, the certificate being dated the 20th of July, 1892, and being in the form prescribed by the the statute 32 Vic. ch. 9 s. 8. The witness further said that he knew the petitioner, and that he was the person of the same name who was entered on the copy of the list produced.\nOn the 27th of July, 1892, the enqu\u00eate was continued and the same witness was re-called, and upon being examined again on behalf of the petitioner added that the copy of list produced was a copy of that which had been used at the election. He was further asked if he knew that the exhibit had been examined with the original but the question being objected to was withdrawn. On cross-examination the witness was interrogated as follows: \u2014\n\"Q. De sorte que cette liste exhibtt A n'a pas servi a l'election?\" To which, he answered: \"Non.\"\nOn the 10th of August, 1892, the petitioner moved before the same judge to open the enqu\u00eate in order that he might put in evidence the list of electors in the hands of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery which had actually been used at the election.\nThis motion the learned judge refused to grant.\nOn the 13th August, 1892, the hearing on the preliminary objections took place when the judge considering that the petitioner had not proved his quality of elector, which was expressly denied by the preliminary objections, rendered a judgment dismissing the petition.\nFrom that judgment the present appeal has been brought.\nBy section 5 of the \"Dominion Controverted Elections Act\" it is enacted that an election petition may be presented either by a candidate, or by a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates. Section 41 of the Dominion Elections Act 49 Vic. ch. 8 enacts that \"subject to the provisions \"hereinafter contained, all persons whose names are \" registered on the lists of voters for polling districts in \"the electoral division, on the day of the polling at any \"election for such electoral divison, shall be entitled to vote at any such election for such electoral district \"and no other person shall be entitled to vote thereat.\"\nBy section 13 of the same act the returning officer is required to obtain at least two copies of the list of voters as finally certified by the revising officer and then in force for each of the polling districts in such electoral division.\nBy section 30 (b) on a poll being granted the returning officer shall furnish each deputy-returning officer with a copy of the list of voters in the polling district for which he is appointed, such copy being first certified by himself or by the revising officer.\nBy section 54 of the same act, a person representing himself to be a particular elector named in the list of voters, applying for a ballot paper after another has voted as such elector is required to take the oath set forth in Form Y in the first schedule to the act\nForm Y is as follows: \" I solemnly swear that I am\n\" A. B. of whose name is entered on the\n\" list of voters now shown me.\" By section 58 the deputy-returning officer at the close of the poll is to enclose in the ballot box \"with ballots and other papers, the list of voters used by him and the ballot box having first been locked and sealed is to be forthwith delivered to the returning? officer or his election clerk.\nBy section 65 the returning officer is to transmit to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery with his return, the ballot \"papers the original statements of the deputy-returning officers \"together with the lists of voters used in the several polling districts,\" and all other lists and documents used or required at said election or which have been transmitted to him by the deputy-returning officers.\nBy section 32 of the Electoral Franchise Act as amended by sec. 8 of 52 Vic, ch. 9, Every copy of a list of voters supplied by the revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, or the Queen's Printer, and certified by any one of such officers as correct in the form E in the schedule to the act shall be deemed to be an authentic copy of such list.\"\nFrom these provisions of the statute I am of opinion in the first place that no person has an actual right to vote unless his name appears in fact to be entered upon the list of voters furnished, pursuant to the statute by the returning officer to the deputy-returning officer for the polling district in which the vote is tendered.\nIt is apparent from the whole scope of the act, and especially from the oath required to be tendered to a voter who claims that another person has wrongly voted in his name, that no person has a right to vote unless his name appears upon the list so furnished to the deputy-returning officer, either as a voter whose vote has been allowed and against whom there is no appeal or as a voter whose vote has been allowed but has been appealed against, or as a person who has claimed to vote but whose claim having been disallowed is the subject of a pending appeal.\nThe oath Y in the schedule of the act has this pertinence to the question, it shows that the deputy-returning officer is to be guided exclusively by the list delivered to him by the returning officer. This oath, which is to be tendered to a voter who claims that he has been personated by another who has already wrongfully voted in his name, requires that the list of voters shall be actually exhibited to the claimant, the list referred to being, manifestly the only official list in the hands of the deputy-returning officer, namely that which had been delivered to him by the returning officer. This demonstrates that the right to vote depends upon a voter's name being upon the list delivered to the deputy-returning officer. In short the officer in allowing or refusing claims to vote is to be guided by the list before him and is to be restricted to that\nThe very object of registration would be defeated by any other construction of the act\nIf then a person whose name does not appear upon the list furnished to the deputy-returning officer claims to vote his claim must be at once disallowed and he cannot be permitted to sustain it by referring to the list as originally revised.\nCan it then be said that such a person has a right to vote? The answer must be certainly in the negative. for although the name of such a claimant may by a misprision of the officer who certifies the list or otherwise have been omitted therefrom and he may thus be wrongfully deprived of his right to vote, still it cannot be said that he has a right to poll a vote which the officer to whom it is tendered could not without a gross dereliction of duty, receive. It may be that this consideration is a reason, why statutory precautions greater than the act actually provides for should been acted to insure accurracy in the lists.used in the polling, but this is nothing to the purpose of the present inquiry. As the law at present stands no one can have a right to vote whose name does not appear on the list according to which the poll is to be taken.\nTo hold otherwise and permit deputy-returning officers to enter upon inquiries as to the right of per Sons whose names do not appear on the lists to vote, would be to set at naught the whole scheme of the statute and to restore the evils and inconveniences which it was the especial object of the legislature to obviate by providing for a system of registration.\nIt is to be observed that the words of the 41st section, which says that all persons whose names are registered on the lists as revised shall be entitled to vote are not absolute, but that the enactment is expressly declared to he subject to the other provisions of the act. Then one of these provisions of the act, if not expressed yet to be derived from necessary implication is that the vote of a person whose name does not appear on the list furnished to the deputy-returning officer for the purpose of the poll shall not be received.\nTherefore section 41 must necessarily be read subject to this provision just as much as if it was in so many words inserted in that section itself\nHaving thus ascertained the fact required to be proved, the next inquiry must be: How is that fact to be established? This fact is susceptible of very easy and inexpensive proof. By section 58 of the Dominion Elections Act before set. out the deputy-returning officers are to return the lists used by them to the returning officer who in his turn is by section 65, sub- section 3 to transmit the same to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery in whose hands they are to remain deposited.\nThen by a copy certified by the last named officer under sec. 32 of the electoral Franchise Act the proof required may be made without subpoenaing the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to produce the original list returned to him\nNo such proof was, however, made by the appellant in the present case.\nIt does not follow that because the name of the appellant appeared as a voter duly registered, or on the original list as revised that it is to be presumed that it was also on the list furnished to the deputy-returning officer by which alone he could legally be guided.\nIn dealing with questions of evidence courts do not permit facts in themselves susceptible of easy proof to be established by mere inference from other facts from which they are not necessary consequences.\nThis was the point insisted upon by Mr. Belcourt at the argument but I did not see the force of it until I had examined the several provisions of the statute. I am, however, now of opinion that there was no evidence before the court below from which the fact essential to be proved appeared.\nIt is to be remembered in connection with this point that the appellant does not prove, nor does he even allege in his petition, that he actually voted at the election.\nFurther, it is to be observed that as regards the fact which he had to prove the petitioner himself in his petition takes the view of the law now enunciated for in the third paragraph he distinctly avers: \"Que son nom \u00e9tait inscrit sur les listes des electeurs qui ont servi a la dite \u00e9lection \" As regards the motion to open the enqu\u00eate for the purpose of letting in proof of the list of voters returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery proof which as I have said could easily have been made and which need not have occasioned any serious delay it is not for me to pronounce upon the course the learned judge thought fit to pursue.\nThe statute has made him the final judge upon that incidental proceeding. No appeal lies to this court from that decision, and we have no authority in any way to review it. I may, however, be permitted to add that the appellant suffers a severe penalty for having made a slip in his evidence, and for that reason I very much regret to be compelled to come to the conclusion that it is impossible to say the court below was wrong in dismissing the petition.\nThis appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNiER J.

C'est dans le bureau de cc dernier qu'elle est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e comme record.\nAu jour fix\u00e9 pour la preuve sur les objections preliminaires, le p\u00e9titionnaire, au lieu de faire produire par le greffier en chancellerie la liste de record chez lui, qui avait servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection, l\u00e9 p\u00e9titionnaire a fait entendre comme t\u00e9moin J. N. Mondor qui a produit une copie de liste d'\u00e9lection du comt\u00e9 de Richelieu.\nApr\u00e8s cela la cause ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e pour la preuve du d\u00e9fendeur, le p\u00e9titionnaire fit motion pour rouvrir son enqu\u00eate et appela comme t\u00e9moin le m\u00eame J. N. Mondor qui d\u00e9posa que la liste produite par lui \u00e9tait une vraie copie de la liste des \u00e9lecteurs du comt\u00e9 de Richelieu qui avait servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection. Le d\u00e9fendeur fit objection a cette preuve.\nLe p\u00e9titionnaire ne produisit aucun des documents publics par lesquels ii aurait pu prouver l\u00e9galement l'\u00e9lection, tels que le bref d'\u00e9lection, les proclamations de l'officier-rapporteur, les livres de poll, les listes \u00e9lectorales, le retour de 1 election, etc. Il pr\u00e9tendit pouvoir remplacer cette preuve par la production de la copie de la liste \u00e9lectorale produite par Mondor. Celui-ci, quelques jours auparavant, s'\u00e9tait procur\u00e9 cette liste de I'honorable juge Grill qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 officier reviseur. Mondor dans son t\u00e9moignage, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question. \" De sorte que cette liste exhibit A n'a pas servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection? \" R\u00e9pond, \" non.\" Mais ii avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 corrig\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage sur le principe que sa r\u00e9ponse n'avait pas \u00e9te correctement consign\u00e9e dans sa premi\u00e8re deposition, en ajoutant \u00e0 sa r\u00e9ponse les mots suivants:\nQui est une copie de la. dite liste qui a. servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection du 11 janvier 1892 dont le retour est contest\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nLa production de la liste par Mondor et son t\u00e9moignage sont-ils suffisants pour prouver que te liste en question est une vraie copie de la liste qui a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection? Non, certainement.\nD'abord, Ia liste \u00e0 sa face ne comporte aucun indice, aucune d\u00e9claration qu'elle a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection. Le juge Grill comme reviseur pouvait certainement donner une copie authentique de la liste qu'il avait faite lui-m\u00eame, et elle fait preuve compl\u00e8te de son contenu, mais seulement de son contenu. Il n'y est nullement fait mention qu'elle est la liste qui a servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection dont ii s'agit il certifie seulement quelle est la liste des \u00e9lecteurs de l'arrondissement de votation n un Richelieu, dans le district \u00e9lectoral de Richelieu, telle que d\u00e9finitivement revis\u00e9e pour l'ann\u00e9e 1891, en vertu de l'acte du cens \u00e9lectoral. il ne dit pas que c'est la liste qui a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection. La simple production de cette liste ne prouve pas le fait essentiel, qu'elle est celle qui a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection Il faut aller chercher cette preuve ailleurs. C'est pour cette raison que le p\u00e9titionnaire a fait revenir Mondor, pensant pouvoir faire preuve par lui de ce fait.\nMais loin de faire cette preuve ii dit que ce n'est pas une copie de celle qui a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection. En effet, celle-l\u00e0 est chez le greffier en chancellerie, et la copie donn\u00e9e par le juge Grill n'a pas m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9e avec celle qui avait servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection.\nLe fait que la liste a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 par une preuve en dehors de la liste mais est-ce par t\u00e9moignage ou par \u00e9crit qu'elle doit \u00eatre faite? Cette preuve ne peut r\u00e9sulter que l'ensemble de la production des documents publics, comme le bref d'\u00e9lection, les proclamations, les livres de poil, les listes \u00e9lectorales, et le retour de la dite \u00e9lection. En effet, la liste qui a servi est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9e au greffier en chancellerie avec tous les autres documents, et cette preuve ne peut \u00eatre faite que par la production de ces documents.\nC'est en vain que l'on voudrait invoquer les inconv\u00e9nients qu'il peut y avoir \u00e0 faire voyager le greffier en chancellerie dans tous les comt\u00e9s o\u00f9 ii peut y avoir des contestations, pour la production de ses documents. La chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, sans que les \"plaideurs en aient souffert. D'ailleurs cet argument n'a aucune valeur l\u00e9gale, et ne peut justifier la violation d'une des premi\u00e8res r\u00e8gles concernant la preuve qui est que les parties doivent fournir la meilleure preuve possible, et cette preuve est la preuve \u00e9crite lorsqu'elle peut \u00eatre produite. Elle le peut dans ce cas-ci. Le greffier en chancellerie, par la production de ses documents concernant la dite \u00e9lection aurait fait la preuve complete de la liste qui a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection. Ce n'est pas pour dispenser de cette preuve qu'un amendement \u00e0 la loi a permis au reviseur et \u00e0 l'imprimeur de la Reine, de donner des copies de listes \u00e9lectorales qui out certainement toute la force probante de celles que peut donner le greffier en chancellerie. Mais ces copies ne feraient aucune preuve du fait qu'elles out servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection,nsans la production en m\u00eame temps de celles d\u00e9pos\u00e9es chez le greffier en chancellerie, il y aurait toujours une lacune dans la preuve. C'est uniquement pour la commodit\u00e9 du public qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 permis \u00e0 ces officiers d'en donner des copies,\u2014car en temps d'\u00e9lection ii en est fait un grand usage.\nL'objection faite \u00e0 la liste produite n'est pas parce qu'elle vient du reviseur, mais parce qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 l\u00e9galement qu'elle est celle qui a servi \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mondor ne pouvait faire l\u00e9galement cette preuve qui existait dans les documents \u00e9crits du greffier en chancellerie. Leur production \u00e9tait indispensable.\nMais on fait l'objection que si l'\u00e9lection a lieu par acclamation, il n'y aura pas de liste qui aura servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection, puisqu'il n'y a pas eu de votation, et partant personne de qualifie \u00e0 attaquer une telle \u00e9lection. On en conclut que la liste qui a servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection n'est pas indispensable puisque dans ce cas m\u00eame ii y a toujours des \u00e9lecteurs qualifi\u00e9s qui ont droit de prouver leur qualification. A celaje r\u00e9ponds que m\u00eame dans le cas d'une \u00e9lection par acclamation, qu'il y a toujours une liste qui a servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection. Comme on l'a vu par la section 13 du chapitre 8, cit\u00e9e plus haut, le premier devoir de l'officier-rapporteur, en recevant le bref d'\u00e9lection, est de se procurer du reviseur la liste \u00e9lectorale. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s cela qu'il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la publication de ses proclamations pour la tenue de l'\u00e9lection, la nomination des d\u00e9put\u00e9s officiers-rapporteurs. Lorsque l'\u00e9lection a lieu m\u00eame par acclamation, l'officier-rapporteur est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession des listes \u00e9lectorales\u2014et ii doit les renvoyer au greffier en chancellerie avec son retour de l'\u00e9lection. C'est cette liste qui a servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection et que le p\u00e9titionnaire doit produire, on une copie d'elle donn\u00e9e par le greffier en chancellerie, ([8]) pour faire la preuve de sa qualification. Il est facile de voir que cette objection n'est d'aucune force et ne peut dispenser en aucun cas de la production de la liste du greffier en chancellerie\nJe suis d'avis que le jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 et l'appel renvoy\u00e9. TASCHEREAU J. concurred in dismissing the appeal for the reasons given by Strong and Fournier JJ.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the month of January, 1892, an election took place for a member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of Richelieu at which the respondent was returned as duly elected. The appellant filed a petition in the Superior Court for the province of Quebec, in which the electoral district of Richelieu is situate, and therein complained that the return of the respondent was obtained by means of bribery and corruption committed by the respondent and his agents and that the said election and return of the respondent might be declared null and void, To this petition the respondent filed certain preliminary objections and among them\u2014\nThat the petitioner had no right to vote at the said election and that he was not and is not inscribed on the list of voters in force at the time of the said election and that he has not the quality entitling him to be a petitioner against the election and return of the respondent.\nThe question raised by this preliminary objection came down for trial on the 23rd day of July 1892 before Mr. Justice Grill when the petitioner produced in evidence a list of voters qualified to vote at the said election in the form prescribed by the statute in that behalf, signed and certified by the revising officer for the said electoral district who was the judge himself before whom the question raised by the said preliminary objection was being tried, by which it appeared that a person bearing the name of the petitioner was a duly qualified voter entitled to vote at the said election, and evidence was given which established that the person whose name was so entered on the list was the petitioner. Counsel for the respondent objected to the reception in evidence of this certified list upon the contention that the said list could not be used as tending to the proof or for the purpose of proving that the petitioner was an elector and so qualified to be a petitioner. The learned judge disallowed the objection, \" l'objection renvoy\u00e9e,\" and received the list in evidence. Afterwards the learned judge, upon the 10th of August, 1892, in giving judgment upon the preliminary objection, dismissed the election petition upon the ground that the certified list of voters, qualified to vote at the said election which had been produced by the petitioner, and so received by the learned judge, was not \"the best proof possible,\" and he refused to extend time to the petitioner to enable him to produce the evidence, whatever it might be, which the learned judge deemed to be the best proof, of the last revised list of voters in the said electoral district. It is from this judgment of the learned judge dismissing the election petition that this appeal is taken.\nAs the list produced by the petitioner was received by the learned judge after an objection to its reception had been disallowed by him, it certainly appears to me that if upon further consideration he formed the opinion that it was not sufficient proof of the fact in proof of which it was offered and received, he, in common justice, should have extended the time to have enabled the petitioner to produce whatever the learned judge deemed to be the requisite and only sufficient proof instead of dismissing the petition. But, as it appears to me, the learned judge's first ruling when he disallowed the objection to the reception of the list as evidence and received the list in evidence was quite right; for in my opinion it is plainly enough made, by the statute, sufficient evidence of the fact in proof of which it was offered, and I cannot conceive what better evidence of any fact can be required than that which a statute makes sufficient. The petitioner had the status which qualified him to be a petitioner if he was a person whose name was registered on the list of voters for the electoral district of Richelieu in force under the provisions of the Electoral Franchise Act, on the day of the polling at the election held for such electoral district in January, 1892 ([9]). The only question raised by the preliminary objection of the, respondent that the petitioner had not the status qualifying him to be a petitioner was whether or not the petitioner was a person whose name was upon the last revised list of voters for the said electoral district in January, 1892, when the election under consideration took place. If it was the petitioner's status was established, whether he voted at the election or not. Now by the 21st section of the Electoral Franchise Act, as amended by 53 Vic. ch. 8, s. 7, it is enacted that every list as finally revised, and a duplicate copy thereof, shall be forwarded to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, at Ottawa, who shall cause such list so forwarded to him to be printed by the Queen's Printer, and after verification of the printed copy by the revising officer who has prepared such list, he shall transmit a sufficient number of such printed copies to such revising officer.\nThen by section 22, it was enacted that every list of voters so finally revised should remain in force until other lists in a future year should be revised and brought into force in their stead as in the act provided; and that the persons whose names are entered upon such lists as revised should alone be entitled to vote at any election in the polling districts and electoral districts for which such lists are respectively made; and it is thereby expressly enacted that\u2014\nThe said lists shall be binding on every judge and other tribunal appointed for the trial of any petition complaining of an undue election or return of a member to serve in the House of Commons of Canada\nWhat is here made binding upon courts of justice is the l last revised list of voters\" in force at the time of the election which is complained of being held, and not' the copy of such list which was used at such election and which itself was a list of the same character precisely as the one which the learned judge at first received, and after having received rejected, in the present case as appears by the 31st section of the Electoral Franchise Act which enacts that\u2014\nThe revising officer shall furnish to the returning officer for his electotal district, or portion of an electoral district, within forty-eight hours after demand of the returning officer therefor \"one copy \" of the list of voters then in force for each polling district in the electoral district or portion of ah electoral district, with a copy of the description of each such polling district as contained in the order of the revising officer constituting the same and then in force \"each of which copies shall be duly certified by the revising officer.\"\nThat list, if produced, would have proved no more ' than the one produced having\" been itself but a copy certified by the same revising officer in the same manner as the one which was produced both of them were equally authentic,and either one or the other was equally sufficient to be received in proof of or to assist in \"proof of, the fact in issue, namely: whether the petitioner was on the last revised list of voters in force in the electoral division not whether he was on the copy of that list supplied by the revising officer to the returning officer. If the petitioner's name was on the last revised list his status was proved and that a person of his name was on that list was proved by the certified list produced and that he was such person was also proved. Then immediately follows the 32nd section which, as amended by 53 Vic. ch. 8, sec. 9 enacts that\nThe revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Queen's Printer shall supply certified copies of the said lists finally printed and verified as hereinbefore provided to any person or persons applying for the same and paying therefor and 2nd. Every copy of a list of voters supplied by the revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery or the Queen's Printer, and certified by one of such officers as correct in the form E in the schedule to this act shall he deemed to be an authentic copy of such list.\nNow for what purpose should, a list so certified be deemed to be a authentic \" unless it be for the purpose of \" being binding \" (as specified in the 22nd section) on every judge and other tribunal appointed for the trial of any petition complaining of an undue election or return of a member to serve in the House of Commons in Canada. The meaning of the term a authentic \" as given in Webster's dictionary is:\u2014\nHaving a genuine original or authority.; being what it purports to be\u2014genuine\u2014true; as applied to things\u2014\"an authentic paper or register \"; and in law\u2014\"vested with all due formalities, and legally attested \"\nNow the form of the certificate prescribed by the act in order to qualify it to be received as an a authentic' genuine and true list or register of voters, legally attested is as follows:\nCERTIFICATE OF LIST OF VOTERS.\nI , the undersigned revising officer for the Electoral District of or Clerk of the Crown in Chancery or Queen's Printer for Canada (as the case may be) do hereby certify that the foregoing list, consisting of pages, and containing names is a true copy of the t of voters for Polling District number , as finally revised' (or as finally, revised and corrected on appeal, as the case may be) for the year under the Electoral Franchise Act 54-55 Vic ch 18 sec 3\nThe certificate which was given in evidence by the petitioner upon the trial of the preliminary objection to his petition that he had not the status to be petitioner was in the above form duly filled in and. signed by the revising officer whose duty it was to sign it, and the effect of the certificate was (as is provided by the act, and by the prescribed form of the certificate appears) that the list of names so certified is a genuine, true, authentic\u2014legally attested, list or register of the names of persons entitled to vote at the election in question, and the name of the petitioner having been proved, to be on the list Jus status as a petitioner was established. I find it difficult to conceive what better proof of the petitioner's right to be on the voters list in force at the time of the election than that his name appears on the list made by statute, an authentic list of such voters legally attested and certified to be such by a duly authorized officer. The Clerk of the Crown in Chancery could have given no other. The law does not authorize him to give a certificate of a copy of the copy of the list used at the election, nor if given does it attach any value to such a certificate. The certificates of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and of the revising officer are both equally authentic and are certificates that the lists certified are authentic copies of the original revised lists. The law \"which declarers the certificate of the revising officer or of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to be authentic would be wholly inoperative if it should be held to be so far useless that, notwithstanding its production, it would be necessary to call upon the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to produce the original in his charge or the copy returned to him as used at the election as, in my opinion, would be necessary if the certificate produced by the petitioner in the present case was insufficient. For my part I cannot entertain a doubt that the object of the statute, in attaching authenticity to the lists certified by the revising officer well as to those certified by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery in the form prescribed by the act, was to give to lists so certified the authenticity and character of genuine originals, and that such authenticity was given to them to obviate the necessity, and the utter impracticability of the Clerk of Crown in Chancery attending under a subpoena duces tecum to produce the list or lists in his charg\u00e9, as he might be subpoenaed to do at a dozen or more different electoral divisions at remote Places throughout the Dominion upon the same day.\nThe result of the judgment of the learned judge which is appealed from in the present case being maintained, will be to prove how utterly defective the law is for the purpose of enabling electors of members for the House of Commons to call in question any election, however much the return of the member elected thereat may have been procured by the bribery, corruption and other illegal acts of himself and his agents; the simple process being for every person whose election is contested to question, by preliminary objection, the status of the petitioner. I cannot concur in the opinion that the law as it stands is so utterly defective that the status of a petitioner cannot be established otherwise than by subpoenaing the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to reproduce the list in his custody and so insisting upon a mode of proof which is quite impracticable. In my judgment the appeal should be allowed with costs and the election petition should, be remitted for trial upon its merits.\nPatterson J\u2014By the Dominion Controverted Elections Act ([10]), an election petition may be presented by \"a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates.\nThe election to which the petition now in question relates took place in January, 1892.\nThe persons entitled to vote at that election -were those whose names appeared on the voters lists revised in 1891. The petitioner resides in the city of Sorel in the electoral district of Richelieu.\nThe voters' list for that electoral district was revised. \" by the Honourable Judge Grill as revising officer.\nThe petitioner in stating his qualification in his petition, unfortunately as I think, did not confine himself to the statutable form of words by simply alleging that he had a right to vote at the election ([11]).\nHe introduced those words, it is true, but he amplified them by additional verbiage which added nothing to their force while probably suggesting the discussion of one or two topics not entirely relevant to the main inquiry which is: Did the petitioner give sufficient evidence upon the trial of the preliminary objections to prove that he was a person who had a right to vote at the election for the electoral district of Richelieu on the 11th of January, 1892?\nThe persons who may present a petition under section 5 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, are \"(a) A person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates; or (b) A candidate at such election.\" This petitioner was not a candidate. He relies on his being a person who had a right to vote.\nIt happens that at this election for Richelieu there was a poll. The returning officer and his deputies had, as we may assume, lists of voters, and it is assumed that the returning officer transmitted those lists with his return to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery as directed by section 65 of the Dominion Elections Act ([12]). At the trial of the preliminary objections the petitioner did not produce the list used at the polling and returned to the Clerk of the Crown in order to show that his name was on it. The respondent contends that he ought to have done so.\nThe contention of the respondent is, in my opinion, founded upon a misapprehension of the law.\nThe right to petition is not confined to elections at which a poll is demanded.\nIt may be scarcely accurate, in view of our present mode of conducting an election, to use the old term election by acclamation but a return under section 24 of the act comes to the same thing. Such a return may be petitioned against as well as a return made under section 65 after a poll. In each case that is to say whether there has been a poll and lists of voters used at it or a return without a poll the test of the qualification of a petitioner against the return is the same. The right to question the return by an election petition under section 5 does not depend on the accident of a poll being or not being demanded and held. Therefore the point touching the proof of the particular printed list which was in the hands of some one of the deputy-returning, officers which has been elaborated by the respondent in his factum and vigorously pressed in argument before us, cannot be entirely relevant unless there is something in the statutes which one is not prepared to expect.\nThe proceedings of the revising officer are regulated by various sections of the Electoral Franchise .Act ([13]) ending with section 21. Under the second subsection of that section as re-enacted by 58 Vic. ch. 8, after the lists for the several polling districts have been finally revised the revising officer prepares the final list of voters. For this some directions are given which we need not notice and he \"shall certify the original list as so corrected in form E in the schedule to this act.\"\nI stop to notice this form E, in anticipation of something which I have to say further on.\nIn the original statute, as we have it in the Revised Statutes, the form was for a certificate by the revising officer, and by no one else, certifying that the list was a true copy of the list of voters for polling district number (blank) in the electoral district, as finally revised for the year. An amended form was substituted in 1889, by 52 Vic. ch. 9, not differing from the other in substance, but prepared not for the revising officer only but also for the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and for the Queen's Printer.\nThe significance of this amendment will appear further on. In the meantime I remark that under subsection 2 of section 21 the revising officer is to certify the original list as corrected in that form, and, by subsection 3 he is to prepare copies in duplicate of such revised and amended lists and is to retain one duplicate copy and send the other to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.\nThe original or certified list is retained, as I understand, by the revising officer.\nBy subsection 4 the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery on receipt of all the lists for an electoral district\u2014 \"the lists \" here meaning the copies sent by the revising officer, the two expressions being used interchangeably \u2014inserts in the Canada Gazette a notice that he has received the lists of voters finally revised for all the polling districts of the electoral district for the year and thereupon the persons whose names are entered on the lists as voters are to be held to be duly registered voters in and for the electoral district, subject to an appeal given by section 33 in cases where the revising officer is not a judge. Subsection 7 directs that the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery shall, as such lists are received by him, cause them to be printed by the Queen's Printer, and after verification of the printed copy by the revising officer who has prepared such list he shall transmit a sufficient number of such printed copies to such revising officer.\nThen we have section 22 which declares, that after the lists of voters have been so finally revised or amended and corrected on appeal, if any such appeal takes place, and after they have been certified and brought into force as therein before prescribed those persons only whose names are entered on such lists as so revised, or amended and corrected on appeal, if any, shall be entitled to vote at any election in the polling districts and electoral districts for which such lists are respectively made; and the said lists shall be binding on every judge and other tribunal appointed for the trial of any petition complaining of the undue election or return of a member to serve in the House of Commons for Canada.\nUnder these provisions it is plain that the task of the petitioner was to prove that he was a person named in the list for 1891 finally revised, certified and brought into force under section 21.\nSubsection 6 of section 21 enacts that every such list shall be so finally revised and certified, and the duplicate copy thereof forwarded to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery at Ottawa, on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year, and the notice in the Canada Gazette under subsection 4 is to be in the issue next after the receipt of all the lists for the electoral district by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.\nNo question has been made as to the regular proceedings having been taken by the revising officer and the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, in the year 1891, or as to the notice appearing in the first issue of the Gazette after the receipt of the lists., Those are things which I apprehend must be presumed to be properly done unless the contrary appears.\nThe ground on which the judgment appealed from is rested is that the petitioner had not given the best proof possible of his qualification.\nThe judgment does not intimate what proof the court regarded as the best proof which the petitioner had failed to produce, but I gather from the position taken before us, as well as from the notes of the position taken before the election court that it was considered to be incumbent on the petitioner to prove that his name was on the printed list used by the deputy-returning officer of polling district no. 1 at the election, and that his failure was in being unable to prove that the paper he produced was the one so used. He in fact affirmatively proved the .contrary. His witness, Mr. Mondor, the returning officer, produced a list of voters for the polling district containing the name of the petitioner and certified in statutory form E by the revising officer, but it had been procured long after the election, and apparently for the purpose of being produced in evidence as it was now produced.\nI have shown why, in my opinion, it was unnecessary to produce or to give evidence of the particular paper used at the poll and why I consider that the provisions of the Electoral Franchise Act are those to which resort must be had and I have referred to some of those provisions. They contain no reference to the proceedings at a Poll, and, as I have pointed out, the same rule must apply to all elections whether a Poll has or has not been held\nI suppose the view which, if I correctly understand the grounds of the judgment, was acted on in the Court below is founded on a construction of some pro-visions of the Dominion Elections Act ([14]). Section 41 of that act declares that, subject to certain provisions, all persons whose names are registered on the lists of voters for polling districts in any electoral district in force under the provisions of the Electoral Franchise Act or of the act of 48 & 49 Vic. ch. 40, on the day of the polling at any election for such electoral district, shall be entitled to vote at any such election for such electoral district and no other person shall be entitled to vote thereat. So read the section agrees in effect with section 22 of the Electoral Franchise Act and is not unlike it in terms. But when we look at the interpretation cla\u00fases of the two statutes we find that the expression \" list of voters,\" when used in the Franchise Act means \"the list of voters to be revised and completed under the provisions of that act in each year for each polling district of an electoral district when finally revised, and includes a list corrected in appeal; \" and that the same expression, when used in the Dominion Elections Act, means the certified copy of the list or corrected list of voters for a polling district furnished to the returning officer or any deputy-returning officer under the Electoral Franchise Act, or the act 48 & 49 Vic. ch. 40.\nWe have thus the one act declaring that every per-son whose name is entered as a voter on the lists as finally revised shall be entitled to vote, and the other apparently confining the right to those persons whose names appear on a particular copy of the list.\nIt is only at first sight that any discrepancy between these provisions suggests itself.\nThe copy of the list for the polling district furnished to the returning officer or deputy-returning officer is one of those printed by the Queen's Printer after verification by the revising officer.\nUnder subsection 7 of section 21, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery transmits a sufficient number of- these copies to the revising officer, and section 81 provides for the revising officer supplying one copy for each polling district when the returning officer asks for them, which will, of course, be only in cases where a poll is demanded.\nThe copy in the hands of the deputy-returning officer is thus a verified copy of the list as finally revised.\nWhy then is the expression \"list of voters\" defined differently in the two statutes? The explanation may be that provisions of the Dominion Elections Act like section 41 being intended for the guidance of the officer conducting the poll he is instructed by that section, in connection with the interpretation of the expression \"list of voters,\" that he has not to. look beyond the paper in his hands and is not to receive the vote of any one whose name does not appear on the paper.\nThe explanation of the legislation is not a matter that much concerns us at present, but one effect of it is that at an election at which a poll is not demanded there is absolutely no list of voters for the electoral district or the polling districts, within the meaning of the term \"list of voters\" as used in section 41 or any other section of the Dominion Elections Act, and, therefore, if we are to look to that statute for the test of a petitioner's qualifications, there is no one entitled to contest the validity of the election.\nIt is practically impossible, under the present methods, for the names on the copy to differ from those on the list; but suppose, for argument's sake, that at an election where a poll was held a name did happen to be dropped in making the copy, or suppose a copy of a wrong list to be inadvertently furnished\u2014the list of 1889 for example which was continued in force till that of 1891 was finally revised ([15]),\u2014the officer at the poll would of course reject any voter whose name was not on the paper in his hands; but can it be argued that a person whose name was on the true list, and who was therefore entitled to vote under the provisions of the Electoral Franchise Act was disabled by the omission, of his name from the copy used at the poll from contesting the validity of the election on any ground, even on the ground that his name was omitted from the copy of the list of voters used at the poll or that the list used was not what the statute re~ quired?\nIt is almost unnecessary to say that there is no conflict between the two statutes, regard being had to the scope and purpose of each of them; still I am clearly of opinion that it is to the Electoral Franchise Act which applies in all cases whether there is or is not a poll and not to the Dominion Elections Act that we ' must look to ascertain if the person who presents an election petition is a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates.\nI think, moreover, that that opinion is supported by the unanimous decision of this court in the Megantic Cass decided in 1884 ([16]).\nSection 32 of the Electoral Franchise Act, as now framed in 53 Vic. ch. 8, reads as follows: \u2014\n32. The revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Queen's Printer shall supply certified copies of the said lists, finally printed and verified as hereinbefore provided, to any person or persons applying for the same and paying, &c.\n2. Every copy of a list of voters supplied by the revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery or the Queen's Printer, and certified by any one of such officers as correct in the form E in the schedule to this Act, shall be deemed to be an authentic copy of such list.\nThe expression a authentic copy \" is adopted from the forensic vocabulary of the province of Quebec, and denotes a copy which is of such authority as to prove the contents of the original document from which it is taken.\nThe copy of the list of voters put in evidence at the trial was under section 32 an authentic copy of the list as finally revised, and it proved the status of the petitioner as a person who had, under the Electoral Franchise Act a right to vote at the election.\nBut I go further than that. I am of opinion that even if it were necessary to prove that the petitioner's name was on the list used at the poll sufficient evidence was given.\nI have already adverted to the manner in which the terms \"copy \" and \"list\" are used interchangeably in the statute, and how what is in one place called a copy is in another called the list. For all practical purposes the copies made by the Queen's Printer, particularly when given authenticity by the certificate, are regarded as the lists of voters, each one being like every other, and the idea of there being an original to which the copies may be referred being apparently absent. I make no point at present on this view of the statute beyond noticing it as consistent in its effect with what I am about to argue.\nThe copy of the list for any polling district furnished by the revising officer to the returning officer under section 31 is obviously one of those printed by the Queen's Printer and transmitted to the revising officer under section 21 subsection 7. It is the copy of the list of voters which by force of the interpretation clause is denoted by the expression \" list of voters in section 41 of the Dominion Elections Act.\nIt is the law, at least as settled in English courts, that all printed copies struck off in one common impression, though they constitute only secondary evidence of the contents of the paper from which the year taken, are primary evidence of the contents of each other. That doctrine will be found stated and illustrated by reference to decisions in Taylor on Evidence ([17]).\nOn this principle the copy of the list procured by Mr. Mondor, being a print from the same type as the copy which was used at the poll, was primary evidence of the contents of the latter.\nLooking therefore at the case from the respondent's point of view I am not prepared to affirm the decision. I think it proceeds on a fallacious conception of the nature of the document which it was held to be necessary to produce. It regards that document as an original document the contents of which must be proved by its production, whereas the document can have been nothing but one of the printed copies. The very definition of the term in the interpretation clause which introduces or includes the fact of the document being that which was in the hands of the returning officer describes it as a copy.\nI rely most strongly on the ground I have first discussed, but on both grounds, or on either of them I think the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Ethier & Lefebvre.\nSolicitors for respondent : Bru\u00e6eau &c Plamondon.\n[1] 12 Rev.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nPractice\u2014Misdirection\u2014New trial ordered by court below\u2014Interference with order for\u2014Negligence\u2014Damage by fire\u2014Spark arrester.\nOn the trial of an action for damages for the destruction of a barn and its contents by fire, alleged to have been caused by negligence of defendants in working a steam engine used in running a hay press in front of said barn, the main issue was as to the sufficiency of a spark arrester on said engine, and the learned judge directed the jury that \"if there was no spark arrester in the engine that in itself would be negligence for which defendants would be liable.\" Plaintiff obtained a verdict which was set aside by the court en banc and a new trial ordered for misdirection. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, Strong J. dissenting, that the judge misdirected the jury in telling them that the want of a spark arrester was, in point of law, negligence and such direction may have influenced them in giving their verdict; therefore the judgment ordering a new trial should not be interfered with.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nThe plaintiff had employed the defendants to press his hay by means of a steam engine, and while the defendants were engaged in doing the work the plaintiff's barn was set on fire, as he alleged, by sparks from said engine and was destroyed with the hay and other property in it at the time. The plaintiff brought an action for the loss of said property in which he charged defendants with negligence in not having the engine provided with a spark arrester and in the manner of working it in pressing the hay. The defendants denied the negligence charged and on the trial the case mainly turned upon whether or not the spark arrester, which it was proved the defendants possessed, was in its place in the engine when the fire occurred, and if it was whether or not it was effective to prevent the escape of sparks. The judge directed the jury, among other things, that \"if there was no spark arrester in the engine that in itself would be negligence for which defendants would be liable,\" and submitted to them certain questions, some of which, with the answers thereto, were as follows: \u2014\n\"1. Did the fire which destroyed plaintiff's property originate from defendants' engine? Yes.\n2. Did defendants in the use of the engine take all such reasonable and necessary precautions against fire as prudent men should have done under the circumstances? No.\n\"3. Was defendants' engine fitted with appliances for preventing the escape of sparks from the engine, such as were most effective and approved generally for that purpose? No.\n\"4. Was the spark arrester made by Hewson in the engine at the time of the fire? No.\n\"5. Was the spark arrester made by Hewson effective for the purpose of preventing the escape of sparks? No.\nUpon these findings a verdict was entered for the plaintiff. The defendants moved the full court to have such verdict set aside and judgment entered for them, or a new trial ordered. The court held that the learned judge at the jury had misdirected the jury in telling them that the want of a spark arrester was in itself negligence and ordered a new trial. From this decision the plaintiff appealed. Dickie Q.C. for the appellant. As to what will constitute negligence see Pickard v. Smith[2]; Scott v. London Dock Co.[3]\nThe findings of the jury fully warranted the verdict and they could not have been influenced by the direction of the judge. Freemantle v. London & North Western Railway Co.[4]\nW. B. Ritchie for the respondent referred to Nash v. Cunard Steamship Co.[5]; New Brunswick Railway Co. v. Robinson[6]; Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. Moxley[7]; North Shore Railway Co. v. McWillie[8].\nSir W. J. RITCHTE C.J.\u2014The judge stated that the want of a spark protector was in point of law negligence[9]. It cannot be denied that this was misdirection which may have had an influence on the jury.\nThe court having granted a new trial we should not interfere. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. I agree that if the court had been confined exclusively to the findings of the jury they would not warrant the entering of a judgment for the plaintiff; but it was competent for the court under the Judicature Act[10] to take the evidence into consideration, and if that clearly established a case of negligence to direct a verdict to be entered entirely irrespective of the findings of the jury. Having read the evidence I think it does establish a very clear case of negligence and that a new trial will probably not result in any other conclusion by a jury. Under these circumstances it seems to me useless to send the case to another trial because those findings are not sufficiently comprehensive or because the judge is to be taken to have misdirected the jury by expressing himself too strongly on a question of fact which was for their consideration.\nThe case seems to be just one of those to which the provision of the Judicature Act before referred to was intended to apply.\nFor these reasons, which are the same as those of Mr. Justice Graham in the court below, I think the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that we cannot interfere with the judgment of the court below ordering a new trial in this case for the reasons stated in Mr. Justice Meagher's judgment in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I do not think we can interfere with the judgment of the court below in ordering a new trial. There was some evidence given pointing to the possibility of the fire having originated from fire escaping from the ash pan, in which case they might not, it may be, have found the defendants chargeable with negligence. The attention of the jury should, I think, have been drawn to this point. In view also of the divers alternative suggestions of negligence causing the fire alleged in the statement of claim it would have been better if the jury had been simply asked to say from what cause, in their opinion, the fire did in fact take place, and whether it was attributable to any, and if any, what negligence of the defendants.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Townshend, Dickey & Rogers.\nSolicitor for respondents: Charles R.

In 1849 land devised by the testator to A.M., another son, was sold under execution issued on said judgment and purchased by D.M., who, in 1853, conveyed it to another brother, W.M. In 1865 it was sold under execution issued on a judgment against W.M. and again purchased by D.M. In 1888 A.M., the devisee of the land under the will, took forcible possession thereof and D.M. brought an action against him for possession.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Strong J. dissenting, that the sale in 1849 being for his own debt D.M. did not acquire title to the land for his own benefit thereby, but became a trustee for A.M., the devisee, and this trust continued when he purchased it the second time in 1865.\nHeld, also, that if D.M. was in a position to claim the benefit of the statute of limitations the evidence did not establish the possession necessary to give him a title thereunder.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the defendant which reversed the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe action was instituted to recover possession from the defendant of the west half of the east half of lot number 18 in the 7th concession of township of Cornwall in the county of Stormont, province of Ontario. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is under certain sheriff\u2019s deeds whereby the lands in question were with other lands conveyed to him in pursuance of sales under execution, and he also claimed that he had acquired title by possession.\nThe defendant claimed title to the lands as devisee under the will of his father, Lachlan McDonald, and alleged that the plaintiff merely held the lands for his benefit and was not entitled to any beneficial interest therein, and that the defendant was in possession thereof for his own use and benefit and was entitled to retain the same.\nThe following facts are clearly established and are now practically undisputed:\u2014\n\u201cThat Lachlan McDonald, the father of both the parties, was at the time of his death in 1846 the owner of the lands in question herein and other lands.\u201d\n\u201cBy his will he devised the lands in question to the defendant and the other lands to other members of his family and appointed the plaintiff and two other persons the executors of his will.\u201d\n\u201cAt the time of his death the Commercial Bank were the holders of a promissory note for the sum of \u00a3200, made by the plaintiff and endorsed, for his accommodation solely, by said Lachlan McDonald.\u201d\n\u201cAfter Lachlan McDonald\u2019s death the plaintiff having failed to pay the promissory note in question the bank took proceedings against the executors of Lachlan McDonald\u2019s will and (although they had not proved the will) judgment was recovered against them for the amount of the promissory note with interest and costs.\u201d\nIn 1849 the said lands were sold by the sheriff under execution issued on said judgment and were purchased by the plaintiff, who gave a mortgage thereon to the bank. He subsequently, in 1853, conveyed said lands to his brother William who paid off the mortgage, and in 1865 they were again sold under execution on a judgment against his said brother and again purchased by the plaintiff. The defendant took forcible possession of the land shortly before this action was brought.\nAt the trial judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, the learned judge stating in giving judgment that he did not see his way clear, forty years after the transaction took place, to declare plaintiff a trustee for the devisees under the will as regarded his purchase under the judgment of the bank. He also stated that plaintiff could probably maintain his claim to the land by the length of possession since the death of his mother who had a life interest in the land. The Divisional Court reversed this judgment giving no reasons for their decision, and declared the plaintiff a trustee for the defendant of the legal estate in the land. The Court of Appeal having affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court the plaintiff appealed to this court.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Leitch Q.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff can only be held to be a constructive trustee as to which the statute of limitations operates. Lewin on Trusts[2]; Petre v. Petre[3]; Johnson v. Kr\u0153mer[4]; Gibbs v.

Gregory[10].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014For the reasons given in the court below by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Maclennan, concurred in by the rest of the court, in which I entirely concur, I think this appeal should be dismissed. I should regret very much if the state of the law was such that the plaintiff could benefit by his own fraud and deprive his brother of the property in dispute which, on every principle of justice and equity, belonged to his brother. Mr. Justice Maclennan has gone so fully, and to my mind so satisfactorily, into the facts and law that I cannot with advantage add anything to his able judgment.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have extracted the following statement of the facts principally from the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Chancery Divisional Court, which reversed a judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbridge in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought for the recovery of fifty acres of land composed of the west half of the east half of lot number eighteen, in the 7th concession of the township of Cornwall.\nThe plaintiff and defendant are brothers the sons of one Lachlin McDonald, in his lifetime a prosperous farmer, who owned 300 acres of land, 200 of which, composed of the west half of 17 and the east half of 18 in the 6th concession, were his homestead on which he resided with his family and the other hundred of which lay in the 7th concession immediately in rear of the west half of the homestead. Lachlin McDonald\u2019s dwelling house and his cleared land and improvements were all upon the front 200 acres, and the rear 100 acres were in his lifetime and ever since, until a recent period, uncleared, unfenced, unimproved and unoccupied, with but a very slight exception.\nOn the 22nd December, 1845, Lachlin McDonald endorsed a note for \u00a3200 made by his son the plaintiff, Duncan, for the accommodation of the latter, payable four months after date, and this note was held by the Commercial Bank unpaid at the time of Lachlin\u2019s death which occurred in or soon after April, 1846, about the time the note became due.\nThe plaintiff, Duncan, had been engaged in some kind of business in which he failed, and he was unable to pay the note at maturity.\nOn the 6th of April, 1846, Lachlin made his will by which he gave the westerly 100 acres of his homestead to his widow and his daughter Mary for life, with remainder in fee to his son William. He also gave all his stock, utensils and furniture to his widow and Mary and whatever might be left of it at their death to William. He gave the east half of the homestead to his son John in fee, with certain qualifications not material to this case.\nThen he divided the rear one hundred acres, namely, east half of 18 in the 7th between his sons William and Alexander, giving William the east half and the defendant Alexander the west half, the fifty acres in question.\nHe then appointed three executors of whom his son, the plaintiff, Duncan, was one, and requests \u201cthat they will be good enough to cause this, my last will and testament, to be duly executed.\u201d\nThis will was never proved but it was registered in the registry office for the county by a memorial signed by one of the executors, not the plaintiff, on the 3rd of October, 1846, and the plaintiff says in his statement of claim that he and the other executors took upon themselves the administration of the testator\u2019s estate, and his evidence is to the same effect.\nAbout July, 1847, the Commercial Bank commenced an action on the \u00a3200 note against the three executors of the testator and the executors defended jointly, denying endorsement, presentment and notice of dishonour but not denying their executorship, and the action proceeded to trial and judgment was entered on the 6th of November, 1847, against the defendants, as executors, in the usual form for \u00a3236 8s. 1d., for debt and costs.\nIt appears that some \u00a350 of this judgment were recovered by execution against goods, and ultimately the sheriff, under a writ of ven. ex. and fi. fa. residue against the lands of the testator, put up for sale and sold thereunder the whole 300 acres of the testator\u2019s lands for the sum of \u00a3201 10s.\nThe plaintiff, Duncan, was the purchaser from the sheriff, and he obtained from him a conveyance dated the 4th of August, 1849, of the 300 acres, and this conveyance is the foundation of his paper title in the present action.\nImmediately after obtaining the sheriff\u2019s deed the plaintiff made a mortgage of the land to the Commercial Bank for \u00a3259 12s. 6d., and he says this was done in pursuance of an arrangement made with the bank before the sale that he was to buy the property at the sale and the bank would take a mortgage from him for the purchase money and would give him time for payment.\nHe says he bought the property for himself, adding \u201cI bought it to protect the property.\u201d He admits that at the time of the sale the 300 acres were worth \u00a31,000 and might be worth $6,000 or more in 1865, and there is other evidence to the same effect.\nThe mother and sister of the plaintiff remained in undisturbed possession of the homestead until their death, the sister having died in 1872 and the mother in 1883; but one Alexander Fraser, who lived in the neighbourhood, was looking after the land for the plaintiff, and he had a written power of attorney for that purpose from March, 1875.\nOn the 15th of November, 1853, the plaintiff executed a conveyance of the 300 acres to his brother William for the expressed consideration of $2,000, out of which William was to pay the mortgage to the bank which was done, but William afterwards got into difficulties and the land was again sold by the sheriff under execution against William\u2019s lands and was bought by the plaintiff for $599. The plaintiff then obtained a second conveyance of the lands from the sheriff, dated the 15th day of April, 1865, and this conveyance constitutes his present paper title.\nAt or about the time of the death of the testator there appears to have been a small shanty upon the half of the north hundred acres, with a small clearing of an acre or a little more of the land about it. This shanty was soon afterwards pulled down, and from that time until three or four years before action there was no actual occupation of the fifty acres in question by any person. The land was covered by forest, with the exception of the small piece already mentioned, and that small piece was an unenclosed, open common growing up with a new growth of bush.\nIn 1876 the front 200 acres were let to one Alex. McGuire who occupied under the plaintiff until the time of the trial, as I understand, in common with the widow until the time of her death in 1883. McGuire says he had to pay taxes on the whole 300 acres; that in about three different years persons, by arrangement with him, tapped the maple trees on the north hundred acres and made syrup, sharing the produce with him; that three years ago he rented it to one Keefe, who put some fences upon it and cropped it. He further says that he took fallen trees for his firewood from the north hundred sometimes. That is all the use McGuire made of the north hundred acres, and he adds that after the first two years of his tenancy, which would be about 1878, until he let it to Keefe the whole place, that is the north hundred acres, was a common.\nKeefe says he has known the property (the north hundred acres) since 1843, and that before he fenced it, three or four years ago, it had been a common and unenclosed for may be more than twenty years.\nThis evidence agrees altogether with that of Alexander Fraser, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and that of the other witnesses who spoke on the subject.\nI should add to the foregoing statement that the plaintiff appears to have contributed to the support of his mother and sister, for whose maintenance the profits of the farm seem to have been insufficient, from, at least, the date of the second sheriff\u2019s sale until their death in 1872 and 1883 respectively.\nAbout December, 1888, the defendant took possession of the land and built a small shanty thereon, and this action was brought immediately by the plaintiff to recover possession.\nIn his statement of claim the plaintiff sets up title under the sheriff\u2019s sales and conveyances which have been referred to, and by length of possession, claiming that he and his brother William have been in possession ever since 1849.\nThe defendant sets up that the first sheriff\u2019s sale being for the plaintiff\u2019s own debt he became, and still is, a trustee for the devisees. He denies the possession of the plaintiff and William, and alleges that the land was vacant and unoccupied and that the legal possession was always in himself, and, by way of counter claim, asks for damages for timber lately cut and removed by the plaintiff. The action was tried at Cornwall and the learned judge gave judgment for the plaintiff with costs, saying that it was too late for the defendants to raise the objections he had taken to the plaintiff\u2019s title, and that the plaintiff could also probably maintain his claim by length of possession and that after forty years he could not see his way to declare the plaintiff a trustee for the devisees as regards his purchase under the Commercial Bank judgment.\nThe defendant appealed to the Chancery Divisional court from this judgment and the appeal was allowed.\nThe plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Appeal which court dismissed the appeal. The present appeal was then brought.\nThere can be no doubt that the appellant by his purchase at the first sheriff\u2019s sale acquired the legal title to the land. It is clear, however, that he so acquired it as a constructive trustee for those beneficially interested under his father\u2019s will. Aside altogether from the relationship of principal and surety which existed in respect of the execution debt between the appellant and his father, and the obligation resulting therefrom by which the appellant was bound to indemnify his father\u2019s devisees by paying off that debt, he was, as one of the executors of the will, disqualified from purchasing for his own benefit. If any authority for this proposition is required the case of Fosbrooke v. Balguy[11] is conclusive against the appellant.\nThen the appellant being thus a constructive trustee the sole question remaining to be decided in the present action is, whether or not the respondent is barred by lapse of time from asserting this constructive trust, either by force of the Statute of Limitations or upon an application of the principles upon which courts of equity act in dealing with stale demands. It appears from the case of the Marquis of Clanricarde v. Henning[12] that there is some question if the Statute of Limitations applies to a case of this kind in which, upon the principle of constructive trust, it is sought to set aside or get the benefit of a purchase of an estate by a person standing, in respect of it, in a fiduciary relationship towards the party making the claim.\nChapter 111 R.S.O. sec. 4 (which is taken from section 2 of the English act 3 & 4 W. 4c. 27) enacts that no person shall bring an action to recover any land but within 10 years after the time at which the right to bring such action first accrued. By section 15 of the same act it is provided that at the determination of the period limited to any person for bringing an action the right or title of such person to the land shall be extinguished. This latter section is taken from, and is in substance identical with section 34 of the Imperial statute 3 & 4 W. 4 c. 27.\nThen section 31 of the R.S.O. c. 111 enacts that in every case of a concealed fraud the right of any person to bring an action for the recovery of any land of which he may have been deprived by such fraud shall be deemed to have first accrued at and not before the time at which such fraud was, or with reasonable diligence might have been, first known or discovered. This section 31 is identical with the first part of section 26 of the English act.\nBy section 32 of R.S.O. ch. 111 it is declared that nothing in the last preceding section shall enable any owner of land to bring an action for the recovery of such land, or for setting aside any conveyance of such land on account of fraud, against a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser without notice. This is a re-enactment of the last clause of section 26 of 3 & 4 W. 4 ch. 27. Section 33 of the Ontario act is in these words:\u2014\nNothing in this Act contained shall be deemed to interfere with any rule of equity in refusing relief on the ground of acquiescence or otherwise to any person whose right to bring an action is not barred by virtue of this act.\nThis re-produces section 37 of the English act.\nThen the English act contains a section (24) as follows:\u2014\nNo person claiming any land or rent in equity shall bring any suit to recover the same but within the period during which, by virtue of the provisions hereinbefore contained, he might have made an entry or distress or brought an action to recover the same respectively, if he had been entitled at law to such estate, interest or right in or to the same as he shall claim therein in equity.\nThis was also contained in the original Ontario Statute of Limitations but was dropped from the revision for the obvious reason that since the fusion of law and equity brought about by the Judicature Act it had become superfluous it being considered that section 4, referring to actions generally, embraced all actions, as well those claims which before the act would have been the subject of suits in equity as those which would have been the subject of ordinary actions at law.\nIf the Statute of Limitations applies it seems clear that it would be a bar to the equitable defence which the respondent opposed to the appellant\u2019s claim to recover on his legal title. We may consider the case as if, under the former practice of the courts, the appellant had brought an action of ejectment seeking to recover on his legal title and the respondent had then filed his bill asserting his equitable title and seeking to have the appellant declared a trustee for him and, as such, ordered to convey the land. To such a suit if the case comes with the Statute of Limitations at all that statute would, upon the facts in evidence, have undoubtedly constituted a bar. The right and title of the respondent, Alexander McDonald, to impeach the purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale made by the appellant accrued as far back as the 4th of August, 1849, nearly forty years before the respondent asserted his title, which he did not do in any way until he took possession in December, 1888. There is nothing in the point suggested that the appellant was during part of\u2019 this time resident without the jurisdiction. The statute, as now applicable to all cases within its terms, recognizes no such disability. Further, there is no allegation, suggestion or pretence that there was any concealment practiced, or that there was concealed fraud bringing the case within section 31. Therefore, the statutory time began to run so soon as the purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale was completed by the conveyance. Then, if the statute applies, at the expiration of the statutory period of time (formerly twenty now ten years) not only would the respondent\u2019s action be barred but under the express enactment of section 15 his right and title would then be extinguished.\nThe application of the statute depends upon the following consideration: If Alexander McDonald, the respondent, had brought a suit or action to have the appellant declared a trustee for him could that action have been properly described as an action to recover land within the meaning of section 4 of the present act? I have been careful to point out that section 24 of the original English statute, 3 & 4 W. 4, c. 27, contained a provision expressly making the statute applicable to suits in equity to recover land, just as the 2nd section of the same act had declared it a bar in the case of actions at law brought for the same purpose; and this was the state of the law in England when the Marquis of Clanricarde v. Henning[13] was decided. But for that decision I should have thought it clear that a suit in equity by a person equitably entitled to land, having for its object relief against a constructive trustee having the legal estate by compelling him to convey the legal title, was undoubtedly a suit for the recovery of land. The implied recognition by sections 24, 26 and 27 of the English act of a class of cases which would, under the former system of procedure, have been the subject of equitable jurisdiction, and which would be comprised in the description of \u201csuits to recover lands,\u201d and in which class (as section 26 particularly indicates) a suit to set aside a conveyance for fraud would have been included, would, but for the authority I have referred to, be conclusive to show that a claim such as that set up by the respondent in his statement of defence would formerly have been within the definition of a suit to recover land. If this is correct it follows that such a claim set up by way of defence, as in the present case, is still in the nature of an action to recover land within the meaning of those words as used in the 4th section of the present statute and, as such a claim, liable to be extinguished at the end of ten years by the operation of the 15th section of R.S.O. cap. 111.\nIf, however, the statute does not apply, and the respondent\u2019s equitable title is consequently unaffected by it, I should in that case be of opinion that the respondent was barred by laches from asserting the equitable title he sets up in his statement of defence. I consider it to be clear that in cases not within the statute the courts will now, as courts of equity formerly did, act in analogy to the statute and give effect to that analogy by holding the lapse of a period of time, equal to that which would have been a bar if the case had been within the statute, fatal to a claim based upon an equitable title. And this, too, in cases where there has been only laches in the sense of an abstinence from suing with a mere knowledge of the right without further acquiescence. Hovenden v. Lord Annesley[14], and Beckford v. Wade[15], are old and well known authorities on this head.\nIn the last edition of Lewis on Trusts[16] I find the following passage which I think correctly states the law:\nHow far knowledge of a right to sue in respect of a breach of trust, and the abstaining to sue, will without any other act constitute laches in the eye of a court of equity and disentitle the plaintiff to relief, as in the particular instances of purchases by trustees, &c., above referred to, was until lately very uncertain, but it seems to be now settled that gross laches as for twenty years will disentitle a cestui que trust to relief.\nIn Lord Clanricarde v. Henning[17], Lord Romilly, M.R., says:\u2014\nIn this case I assume that the transaction would have been set aside if a suit had been instituted within a reasonable time after the death of William Trenchard. The bar as to time is not imposed by any statute, it is only by analogy to the statute of limitations that the rule has been laid down as to the period from which time begins to run.\nIn this case of Lord Clanricarde v. Henning17, it was sought to set aside a purchase made by a solicitor from his client. The sale had been made in 1807, and the purchaser had received the rents and profits from that date; the conveyance had been executed in 1823; the solicitor died in 1828; the vendor died in 1829; and the bill was filed in 1859.\nIn Hodgson v. Bibby[18], twenty eight years was held a bar to a suit for relief against a clear breach of trust by an express trustee. In Bright v. Legerton[19] it was held that though no statute of limitations ap- plied the lapse of twenty years without more was a bar to a suit against a trustee[20].\nI have therefore come to the conclusion that whether the respondent\u2019s equitable claim to this land set up in his statement of defence was in the nature of an action to recover land, and so within the statute or not, in either case the lapse of time was a bar, and that the primary judge, Mr. Justice Falconbridge rightly so held.\nThe appeal should consequently be allowed, and judgment in the action entered for the plaintiff, with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred in the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I have carefully read the report of the evidence in this case and I see no reason for doubting the correctness of the judgment of the divisional court which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, much less for saying that the judgment is so decidedly mistaken as to make it proper for this court to reverse it. The question is one of fact, the fact of possession. It is not now disputed on the part of the plaintiff, who is the appellant, that his purchase of the farm, which included the fifty acres in question, when it was sold in 1849 under execution against his father\u2019s executors but for the plaintiff\u2019s own debt, constituted him a trustee for those beneficially interested in the different portions of the 300 acres under the father\u2019s will. The trust was constructive, not express, and the defendant was cestui que trust of the fifty acres in question. Nor is it disputed that after the conveyance of the land by the plaintiff to his brother William in 1853, and the repurchase of it by the plaintiff in 1865 when it was sold under execution against William, the same constructive trust continued. The title of the defendant to the fifty acres is therefore established unless the plaintiff has displaced it by proof of possession for ten years before the entry by the defendant in 1888. The affirmative of that issue was upon the plaintiff. He has the unanimous judgment of two courts against him, and he cannot appeal to the decision of the trial judge, which was reversed by the divisional court, as having found that issue in his favour. The decision at the trial rested upon the conveyance from the sheriff, the learned judge thinking that the defendant was too late in taking the position that the land vested in the plaintiff only as trustee, and as to the other issue merely remarking that \u201cthe plaintiff can also probably maintain his claim to the land by length of possession since the death of his mother.\u201d Under these circumstances it would require very clear demonstration of error or oversight in the judgment appealed from to justify this court in interfering with it. For my own part I should come to the same conclusion from a perusal of the evidence. It is by no means clear that there was any possession of these fifty acres, which were at the back part of the farm and the part most remote from the buildings, until a time within ten years of 1888, or any such ouster of the defendant as would have given occasion for an action on his part. The main reliance on the part of the plaintiff seems to be on evidence that the whole farm of 300 acres was let en bloc to tenants, but the evidence of this is very loose and has not the support of any written lease. Maguire who became tenant in 1876 makes it very clear that, with the exception of a small piece, less than an acre, which was fenced in with an adjoining lot and was therefore not in Maguire\u2019s possession, there was not any continuous occupation of the fifty acres until three years or so before action when Keefe went in under Maguire.\nIt would be useless to attempt to analyse the evidence.\nIt is sufficient to say that in my opinion the conclusion of the courts below is amply supported and the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Leitch & Pringle.\nSolicitors for respondent: McLennan, Liddell & Cline.\n[1] 17 Ont.

On this water lot they erected a mill on cribwork built on the bottom of the lake. A mortgage given to R. of the village lots and certain other lands was intended to comprise the water lot and mill but the latter were omitted by mistake of the solicitor who prepared the instrument. M. & B. afterwards executed separate instruments in the form of a chattel mortgage purporting to mortgage certain chattel property and the said mill to two other persons.\nM. & B. having become insolvent assigned all their property for the benefit of their creditors and the assignee sold at auction all their property including the mill. The sale was made subject to certain printed conditions one of which was that as all the information relating to the titles of the property was set out in the schedules, stock list and inventory the vendor would not warrant the correctness of the same and that no other claims existed \u201cbut the purchaser must take subject to all claims thereon, and whether herein mentioned or not, and subject to all exemptions in law.\u201d These conditions were signed by the purchasers to whom the assignee executed a conveyance of all the property so sold. Before the sale the assignee had procured the two last above mentioned mortgages executed by M. & B. to be paid off by a person who advanced the money and he took an assignment to himself after the sale paying the amount out of the purchase money. The conveyance to the purchasers at the sale purported to be made in pursuance of all powers contained in these mortgages.\nR., the mortgagee of the village lots, brought an action to have his mortgage rectified so as to include the water lot and mill property omitted by mistake. The purchasers at the auction sale set up the defence of purchase for valuable consideration without notice.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that there being ample evidence to establish, and the trial judge having found, that the mortgage was intended to cover the water lot and mill, and that the purchasers had notice of R\u2019s equity before paying the purchase money and taking a conveyance, these facts must be taken to be established and the findings deemed final on this appeal and they establish R\u2019s right to have his mortgage reformed.\nHeld, per Strong J.\u20141. The water lot and mill thereon were capable of being mortgaged as real estate and might, in equity, be dealt with by an instrument in form of a chattel mortgage if sufficiently described, and the description \u201cmill property\u201d in the mortgages in question would pass the land covered with water on which the mill was erected.\n2. In the case of charges upon equitable property where the legal estate is outstanding the defence of purchase for valuable consideration without notice is, in general, inapplicable, the rule being that all such chargees take rank according to priority in point of time, but R., not having an actual charge but merely an equitable claim for rectification such defence was not precluded.\n3. The purchasers at the sale could not set up want of notice in themselves and their immediate grantors without showing that the original mortgagees in whose shoes they stood were also purchasers for valuable consideration with notice.\n4. By the condition of sale which they signed the purchasers incapacitated themselves from setting up this defence.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nLaidlaw Q.C. for the appellants agreed that the original mortgagors, Mahood & Brown, had no title to the water lot and that the mill and machinery were improperly dealt with as real estate in the courts below, citing Moffatt v. Coulson[1]; Tidey v. Craib[2].\nBlackstock Q.C, and Dickson for the respondent referred to Adams v. Watson Manufacturing Co.[3]\nSir W.J. EITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think there was ample evidence to sustain the finding of the judge of first instance, confirmed by the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal, viz., that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was intended to cover the mill and machinery and water lots and that they were omitted from the mortgage by mutual mistake, and defendants acquired the title after they had actual notice of plaintiff\u2019s claim, and subject to which defendants hold their title to the mill property in question; therefore this appeal must be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014An accurate statement of the facts and the documentary evidence is indispensable to a right understanding of this case.\nMessrs. Brown & Mahood were lumberers and mill-owners carrying on their business at the village of Port Sydney in the township of Stephenson in the Muskoka district. At this place they had a property consisting of village lots nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, and they were also in possession of a water lot in Mary\u2019s Lake in front of the property mentioned. Upon this water lot they had erected a shingle mill. This mill was built upon a crib. Mahood in his evidence given at the trial describes it thus:\u2014\nThe main part of the building is built on a crib thirty feet by forty feet and then there is an extension of twenty-five feet.\nThis description, which is the only one I find in the evidence, implies that the mill was built upon and fastened to a cribwork which itself was affixed to the realty, being built upon the bottom of the lake. The title to this water lot was in the crown and the onlytitle of Brown & Mahood was that arising from the mere fact of possession, coupled with the right of preemption, which, according to the practice of the Crown Lands Department as proved by Mr. Kirkwood, an officer of that department, they as owners of the adjacent lots on the shores of the lake would be, and were in fact, recognized as having. The mill lot and the buildings upon it and the machinery affixed in the mill were, therefore, as far as Brown & Mahood had any title thereto, realty dependent on a mere equitable title.\nThen on the 21st of November, 1887, Brown & Mahood executed an instrument in the ordinary form of a chattel mortgage which purported to be a mortgage upon the machinery in the mill, and, also, upon the mill itself described in the instrument as the \u201cmill building\u201d to Joseph H. Parkinson to secure $1,994.\nOn the 8th of December, 1887, the same parties executed a mortgage of the village lots and certain other lands to the plaintiff Simpson Rennie, the present respondent, to secure $2,500 which sum was actually lent and advanced by the respondent and appropriated to the payment of a prior mortgage made by Brown & Mahood to a Mr. Stephenson. It is proved beyond question, and as the learned judge who tried the action, Mr. Justice Falconbridge, has so found, it must on the present appeal be taken as an established fact, that the mortgage to the respondent was intended to comprise the water lot and mill erected thereon, and that this latter property was omitted therefrom by the mistake of the solicitor who prepared it. Subsequently to the mortgage to the respondent, and on the 2nd of January, 1888, Brown & Mahood, the mortgagors, executed an instrument in the ordinary form of a chattel mortgage, by which they purported to mortgage certain chattel property, and, also, the mill described as \u201cthe mill building\u201d to one George Hughes to secure the payment of certain monies therein mentioned. Further, on the 17th of January, 1888, and on the 16th February, 1888, the same mortgagors executed instruments comprising the mill property in all respects similar to that formerly executed in favour of Hughes to one Alfred Hunt to secure monies therein respectively mentioned.\nOn the 25th of May, 1888, Brown and Mahood, having become insolvent, made an assignment for the benefit of their creditors to Robert Gray pursuant to the Ontario act respecting assignments and preferences by insolvent persons.\nOn the 6th November, 1888, Gray; the assignee, caused all the assigned property including the mill property in question to be sold by auction. At this sale Messrs. William A. Mitchell, John W. Lang, William W. Park, James Todhunter and Thomas H. Steele, all creditors of the insolvents, became the purchasers of the insolvents\u2019 real estate and other property for the price of $16,050.\nThis sale was made subject to certain printed conditions of sale, the 10th of which is as follows:\u2014\nThe vendor has in the schedules hereto annexed; and in the stock list and inventory hereinbefore referred to, set forth all the information that he has been able to obtain relating to the titles to the various parcels, and the vendor shall not be understood to contract or warrant that the said information is correct or that no other claims are existing upon the said properties or any or either of them but the purchaser must take subject to all claims thereon whether herein mentioned or not and subject to all exemption in law.\nThese conditions of sale were duly signed by the purchasers. Subsequently, and on the 5th February, 1889, the assignee Gray executed a conveyance to the purchasers of all the property comprised in the sale by auction, and the purchasers having afterwards, in accordance with the statute law of Ontario, formed themselves into a trading corporation or joint stock company under the title of the Utterson Lumber Company (Limited) which company is the present appellant, the original purchasers on the 12th March, 1889, conveyed all the property acquired under their purchase to the appellants.\nPrior to the auction sale, and in the month of June, 1888, Gray had procured one Jenkins to advance the money required to pay off Parkinson, Hughes and Hunt, which Jenkins did, taking an assignment of the previously mentioned securities held by those mortgagees respectively.\nSubsequently to the auction sale, but possibly before the conveyance to the purchasers, Gray acquired these securities by assignment from Jenkins who appears to have been paid off out of the purchase money paid by the purchasers at the sale of the 6th November, 1888. The purchase deed of the 5th February, 1889, executed by Gray for the purpose of conveying the estate purchased to the purchasers at the sale purports to be made in exercise of all powers contained in any of the prior mortgages. It is impossible, however, that if the mill property is to be regarded as realty any benefit could accrue to the purchasers from this form of conveyancing inasmuch as the powers of sale in the several mortgages to Parkinson, Hughes and Hunt, in which the mill property was included, were restricted in terms to the chattel property comprised in those instruments.\nThis being the state of facts and the history of the title the respondent brought this action against the appellants for the rectification of his mortgage by including therein the mill property which, as before stated, he clearly and satisfactorily establishes had been omitted therefrom by the error and mistake of the conveyancer who prepared the mortgage deed.\nThe appellants set up that they are purchasers for valuable consideration without notice.\nSo far as the appellants\u2019 own purchase at the sale of the 6th of November, 1888, is concerned it is out of the question to say that they are purchasers for value without notice, and this for two reasons. First, they had beyond all doubt or question, if the evidence given on behalf of the respondent is to be credited, full and precise notice of the respondent\u2019s equity before they paid their purchase money and took their conveyance, and the learned trial judge who tried the action without a jury having distinctly found in the respondent\u2019s favour on this point his finding must for all present purposes be deemed final. This finding of Mr. Justice Falconbridge is in these words:\u2014\nThe evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was intended to cover the water lot including the mill is irrefragable. As to notice I think the plaintiff has proved his case. The testimony of Mr. Gray is confirmatory of plaintiff\u2019s position, and I regard the evidence of defendant Mitchell as pointing in the same direction. I find both facts in plaintiff\u2019s favour.\nThis is conclusive of the only contested facts in the case, and in the face of this finding the appellants are not entitled to be considered as purchasers without notice. There is, however, an additional reason for holding them disentitled to the benefit of such a defence. By the 10th condition of sale they expressly purchased subject to all outstanding equities and have thus incapacitated themselves from claiming to be purchasers without notice of any equity, whatever it may be, to which the property was subject in the assignee\u2019s hands. We have, however, to consider what the position of the defendants is as assignees of the chattel mortgages transferred to Gray by Parkinson, Hughes and Hunt respectively.\nThey are now the holders and assignees for value of those mortgages which have not merged in the equity of redemption and which they are therefore still entitled to set up as existing securities.\nThe water lot, the mill erected upon it and the machinery affixed being, as I hold, all realty, but realty to which the mortgagors Brown and Mahood had only a precarious equitable title dependent entirely on their possession and pre-emption right, the legal estate being in the crown, was nevertheless susceptible of being made the subject of a mortgage security as real estate. That this property might in equity be effectually dealt with by an instrument which was in the usual form of and purported to be a mortgage of chattels, provided it appeared to be sufficiently ascertained by an appropriate denomination sufficient to describe it, cannot be doubted. Then the description given of it in the several chattel mortgages executed in favour of Parkinson, Hughes and Hunt as the \u201cmill property\u201d was ample for the purpose of passing not only the mill building, but also the land covered with water on which it was erected and was, so far as the limits of an ordinary water lot extended, appurtenant to it, and would probably be held a sufficient description for the purposes of a formal legal conveyance. This being so there were at the time the appellants got in their chattel mortgages, at least so far as we know from the evidence before us, four equitable charges or claims in respect of this mill property which in order of date stood as follows: Parkinson\u2019s mortgage first, then the respondent\u2019s equity to have his mortgage rectified so as to include the mill, and then the subsequent mortgages of Hughes and Hunt in order of their respective dates. Now in the case of charges upon equitable property where the legal estate is outstanding the defence of purchase for valuable consideration without notice is in general inapplicable, the rule being that all such chargees take rank according to their priority in point of time. The respondent had not, however, an actual charge as the other mortgagees had, and although as between mere equitable chargees the defence of a purchase for value without notice does not apply, yet an equitable chargee for Value not having the legal estate is, it has been held, entitled to set up the defence of want of notice as against one who has not an actual charge, but a mere equity such as the respondent\u2019s here, to have a conveyance or mortgage rectified. This is the law of courts of equity as laid down by Lord Westbury in the case of Philips v. Philips[4] where the whole doctrine of equity in connection with this peculiar defence of purchase for valuable consideration without notice is analysed and explained, and the different cases to which it applies analysed and classified, Lord Westbury there distinguishing between the case of an actual equitable estate or interest and \u201cthose in which there are circumstances that give rise to an equity as distinguished from an equitable estate as for example an equity to set aside a deed for fraud or to correct it for mistake,\u201d lays it down that in the latter class of cases it is not essential that a defendant should have the legal estate. And to the same effect is the decision of Lord St. Leonards in the case of Bowen v. Evans[5].\nIf there had been no assignment of these mortgages by Hughes and Hunt, and those persons had been brought before the court by the respondent claiming priority over them, it would have been open to them to have pleaded this defence and it must have prevailed in default of proof of notice to them of the respondent\u2019s equity before they paid their money or took these mortgages. Then, although the appellants had notice before they took their conveyance from Gray and were therefore, as regards their own purchase, not entitled to insist on the defence of purchase for value without notice, yet they would still have been in a position as regards the mortgages of Hughes and Hunt to set up the defence that these assignors were such purchasers and to shelter themselves under the equitable defence which the latter would have been entitled to. There are, however, in my opinion, reasons why the appellants are not now entitled to insist on this defence to the clear prim\u00e2 facie right to equitable relief which the respondent has established. First, whilst the appellants do plead that they were themselves, and that their immediate grantors who purchased at the auction sale also were, purchasers for value without notice, a defence which utterly fails on the evidence, they have not pleaded that the mortgagees Hughes and Hunt, in whose shoes they stand, were such purchasers; and they have not, therefore, put the respondent, as they should have done, to prove notice to those incumbrancers. It is impossible, therefore, that they can now be entitled to the benefit of the defence. Further in the face of the 10th condition of sale under which they purchased and by which they expressly undertook to be subject to all outstanding equities against the property, I should have thought it impossible that they could have maintained this defence in respect of securities which they also acquired from Gray under the same deed. I cannot agree with Mr. Justice Osler who was of opinion that the condition of sale referred to was superseded by the conveyance. As regards Parkinson\u2019s mortgage, in the view which I take, that charge is anterior in point of date to the respondent\u2019s mortgage and the appellants are clearly entitled to priority in respect of it over the respondent. There is, however, nothing in the formal judgment pronounced by Mr. Justice Falconbridge to prejudice this right of the appellants to priority in respect of the mortgage debt assigned to them by Parkinson. The judgment merely directs that the respondent\u2019s mortgage shall be reformed so as to cover the water lot, mill and machinery.\nIt is possible that it may be entirely immaterial whether the respondent has priority over the mortgages given to Hughes and Hunt or not. Should it turn out upon taking the accounts (which are not, however, directed by the judgment and in respect of the omission to direct which no complaint has been made by either party) that the proportion of the purchase money attributable to the property held in security by the plaintiff including the mill property is sufficient to pay his principal, interest and costs, as well as the amounts due on the mortgages of Hughes and Hunt, and also that due on Parkinson\u2019s mortgage, no question of priority will, of course, arise, but it is impossible to foresee, from the materials before the court on the present appeal, how this will be.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question in this case simply is whether the evidence discloses such a case as justifies the court, as against the defendants who derive title under certain mortgages, to decree the reformation of a mortgage by the insertion therein of certain property not inserted therein upon the suggestion and allega- tion, that the property sought to be inserted in the mortgage was by the mere error and mutual mistake of the mortgagors and mortgagee omitted, and that the defendants purchased with full notice that it was so omitted by mistake.\nEarly in the year 1887 one Stephenson, then a practising attorney in the city of Toronto, appears to have made, or to have procured to be made, pecuniary advances to a firm carrying on the business of a general store and lumbering at Utterson in the county of Muskoka under the name of Brown and Mahood. Mr. Brown, the senior member of the firm, was a man advanced in years and Mahood, the other member of the firm, was his son-in-law. In security for the repayment of these advances a mortgage securing repayment of the sum of $2,500 was executed by, as I understand the evidence, Brown, in whom the fee was vested, upon lot 22 in the 7th concession of the township of Stephenson in favour of Stephenson the attorney, or his father, as mortgagee; the whole transaction was negotiated and arranged by Stephenson the attorney. In the summer of 1887, and after the execution of the above mortgage, Mahood contracted with one Alfred Hunt, the owner in fee of certain village lots known as village lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the village of Port Sydney as shown on Mary Anne Ladell\u2019s survey of part of that village registered in the registry office for the district of Muskoka on the 8th day of May, 1875, for the purchase of the said village lots. These village lots were conveyed by Hunt to Mahood by a deed of bargain and sale, bearing date the 20th and registered upon the 24th August, 1887. These village lots were separated from the waters of St. Mary\u2019s Lake, in the township of Stephenson, by a piece of land which, in the original survey of the township of Stephenson, was reserved as a road allowance reserve along the water\u2019s edge of the lake, and between the lake and lot no. 25, in the 6th concession of the said township of Stephenson, upon which lot the said village lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the village of Port Sydney were laid down. When Mahood contracted to buy the village lots he and his father-in-law, constituting the said firm of Brown and Mahood, contemplated erecting a steam shingle mill in the waters of the said lake opposite to the said village lots. At this time there was another person who either in point of fact was, or was believed by Mahood to be, trying to get possession of a water lot in front of the said village lots with the view of preventing Brown and Mahood from erecting the mill contemplated to be erected by them there; and in consequence Mahood came down to the Crown Land Office in Toronto to see, as he says, what could be done, and if they could buy, and he was told at the Crown Land Office that they could not buy unless they brought a plan prepared by a provincial surveyor showing the property applied for. This must have taken place as early as July, 1887, for in that month Mahood employed a provincial surveyor to survey and make a plan of a water lot in the lake on the north side of the said reservation for road allowance and opposite to the said village lots 5 and 6.\nThe surveyor so employed accordingly surveyed and made a plan of the water lot, which plan, however, Mahood says he did not get until some time after. Upon this subject he says:\nI don\u2019t remember when we bought the lots (the village lots). I think they were bought some time in June, if I am not mistaken, but it was about three weeks or a month afterwards before we got the surveyor out surveying, working to lay out the mill site for us. He said he would send us up a little plan of it when he had time to make it, we were not in a hurry for it we said; we would get it in the fall.\nThe plan was produced at the trial and it bore date July 13, 1887. Upon this Mahood said in his evidence that it must have been prepared about the time it bears date, but that he did not get it then, and he added:\u2014\nI got it prepared with the intention of making application to the Crown Land Department for that water frontage. The application was never made until late in the same winter of 1887-8. I think it (the plan) lay in Mr. Brown\u2019s office for a long time after we had it prepared. It was prepared shortly after we bought the village lots\u2014prepared to apply for the water frontage. We never made application. I was intending to make application. I went personally to the department and asked about how to proceed in the matter.\nHaving thus learned how to proceed to acquire title to the water lot upon which they proposed erecting the mill they proceeded with its erection upon a crib built out in the waters of the lake and they put in the machinery, so that they had the mill in operation in October, 1887. Upon the whole, then, it would seem, I think, very probable that the negotiations for the purchase, and perhaps the contract for the purchase, of the village lots was made, as Mahood in one place says he thinks the purchase was made, in June, 1887, and that about that time Mahood went to the Crown Land Office to ascertain how to acquire a water lot for their mill site. In another part of his evidence, not already quoted, he says:\u2014\nWe were informed that one Sydney Smith was going to make application for the water lots to prevent us building the mill, and in order to prevent that I went to the Crown Land Department to get information.\nHaving been there informed that no sale could be made without a plan of the property made by a Provincial Surveyor, he employed a surveyor for the purpose, and being apparently satisfied with the information he obtained in the Crown Land Office that thus he could acquire a title he proceeded at once to erect the mill and had it in operation in October, not doubting but that on making his application at some future time to the Crown Land Department he could get a title to the lot on which the mill was so erected. In the month of November, 1887, Brown and Mahood effected a loan of $1,194.00 from one Parkinson; the security agreed upon for such loan was a chattel mortgage upon the said mill, and the machinery therein, and a quantity of logs and a stock of dry goods, groceries, &c., and a policy of insurance upon said chattels, and also a mortgage upon said village lots nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, and other lands. To perfect this transaction a chattel mortgage was executed by the mortgagors Brown and Mahood respectively, and also a real estate mortgage, bearing date respectively the 28th day of November, and registered in the proper offices for the registration of such respective instruments on the 26th day of November, 1887, and a policy of insurance was, upon the 24th day of said month of November, effected by the mortgagors in the sum of $3,000 upon the said mill and the machinery therein, by which policy, which was delivered with the said mortgages to Parkinson as his security, it was provided that the loss if any should be paid to him. By the chattel mortgage the said mortgagors conveyed, bargained and assigned to the mortgagee all and singular the goods and chattels enumerated as follows, namely, one shingle machine bought from Polson iron works, all the shaftings, pulleys, belting and piping, and one incubator, a quantity of hose, one mill wheel, and jackladder and drag saw in the mill building in the village of Port Sidney, in the township of Stephenson, on the shore of Mary Lake, and also the said mill building belonging to the said mortgagors, and also all the pine timber cut and being cut into logs upon lot number 8, in the 2nd and 3rd concessions of the said township of Stephenson, also all the dry goods, groceries, wooden ware, ready-made clothing, boots and shoes, and generally all the stock in trade and fixtures owned by the mortgagors in and upon the premises at Utterson, in said township of Stephenson where the mortgagors carried on the business of merchants. And in the said chattel mortgage it was declared that it was executed upon the express condition that if the mortgagors should well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the said mortgagee the full sum of $1,194.00 as follows: $645.00 on the 22nd day of January, 1888, $345.00 on the 22nd day of February, 1888, $345.00 on the 22nd day of March, 1888, $337.50 on the 22nd day of April, 1888, and the sum of $322.00 on the 22nd day of May, 1888, then that the said chattel mortgage and everything therein contained should cease and determine; but it was thereby provided that in case default should be made in the payment of the said above sums together with interest or of any part thereof then and in such case it should be lawful for the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns, to enter upon any premises whatsoever where the said chattels or any part thereof should be and to sell the same or any of them, or any part thereof, either by public auction or private sale as to them or any of them should seem meet; and it was further provided that it should not be incumbent on the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns, to sell the said goods and chattels, but that in case of default in payment of the said sum of money with interest it should be lawful for the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns, peaceably and quietly to have, hold, use, occupy, possess and enjoy the said goods and chattels without the let, molestation, eviction, hindrance or interruption of the mortgagors, their executors, administrators or assigns, or any of them or of any other person whom- soever. By the real estate mortgage, which was executed in pursuance of the act respecting short forms of mortgages, the mortgagors did grant and mortgage unto the said mortgagee, his heirs and assigns, the said village lots nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 and also lots nos. 15 and 16 in the 6th concession and part of lot no. 15 in the 7th concession of the said township of Stephenson upon which last mentioned lot was situate the store of the said mortgagors where they carried on their business as merchants. This mortgage contained a power of sale of the lands thereby mortgaged upon default in payment of any part of the monies thereby secured. In this month of November, 1887, Stephenson the attorney, who had procured from Brown and Mahood the mortgage on lot 22 in the 7th concession of Stephenson in security for $2,500.00, was negotiating with Rennie for the sale to him of that mortgage, and within a week after the perfection of the securities upon the loan effected by Brown and Mahood with Parkinson, Stephenson took Rennie to Port Sidney to Brown and Mahood\u2019s place there. Brown was then living on his farm on the lot 22 and Mahood was at Utterson attending to their general store business. Hugh Brown, the son of Brown the senior partner in the firm of Brown and Mahood, was in charge at Port Sidney. He says that on that day Stephenson said to him that Mr. Rennie was not satisfied with the security on the farm alone, which was the property in the Stephenson mortgage, that he wanted the village lots and the mill put in, to which Hugh, as he says, replied that he did not think that he (Stephenson) would have any trouble about that. This was all that Hugh Brown professed to know upon this point. Rennie never spoke to him upon the subject. He knew nothing in point of fact, as far at least as appeared by his evidence, as to what authority, if any, Stephenson ever got from Brown and Mahood, or either of them, as to adding the mill or the village lots to the farm lot in the Stephenson mortgage as a security to Rennie; in short, Hugh Brown\u2019s evidence as to what was the intention of Brown and Mahood, or either of them, or of Stephenson himself or Rennie upon the subject, was utterly valueless. He did not profess to have any knowledge whether Brown and Mahood, or either of them, had come to any definite agreement with Rennie or with Stephenson on his behalf upon the subject. Mahood was at the time attending to the store at Utterson where Stephenson and Rennie stopped on the evening of the day that they had been at Port Sidney, namely, the 30th of November or 1st December, \u201987. Now, Mahood\u2019s evidence is that on that occasion Stephenson came into the store at Utterson and taking him apart said to him that Rennie was not satisfied with the security of the Stephenson mortgage and asked him if they (that is if Brown and Mahood) would have any objection to putting in the mill property. Nothing with regard to the mortgage or money was mentioned in Mr. Rennie\u2019s presence. He was asked if Stephenson had spoken of the village lots, to which he replied, yes. He was then asked what he had said about them, to which he replied: \u201cWell it was just mentioned\u2014the mill property.\u201d Again, he said that \u201cthe mill went with the village lots;\u201d and again, that as they had no deed for the mill property, that is, for the water lot on which the mill was situate, the description of the village lots was supposed to cover the mill; and he said that Mr. Stephenson asked him for a description of the mill property and that he replied that the only description they had was that of the village lots, which he wrote on a slip of paper and gave it to him. Mahood did not give Mr. Stephenson any information as to the mortgage transaction with Parkinson which, as we have seen, was completed only a few days previously, and the money, a loan of which was effected thereon, had been paid to Brown and Mahood, but it may be presumed that Mr. Stephenson, who was himself an attorney, and who by Mr. Rennie\u2019s evidence appears to have been acting for him, became aware of the negotiations which had been effected on the 20th November. Mr. Rennie says that he told Mr. Stephenson to find out that the mill and the village lots were clear, and that the money should be ready as soon as he should get the papers executed; and he says that on the 15th December he paid the money to Stephenson. He received it, not at all for Brown and Mahood, but for himself or his father. On the 8th day of December, 1887, Brown and Mahood executed a mortgage sent to them by Stephenson for their signatures. By that instrument the farm lot no. 22 in the 7th concession of the township of Stephenson and the village lots nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, in the village of Port Sidney, by the precise description given to them in the deed from Hunt to Mahood, and in the mortgage from Brown and Mahood to Parkinson, were purported to be conveyed to Simpson Rennie as security for $2,500 therein alleged to have been advanced and lent by Rennie to Brown and Mahood. This instrument when executed by Brown and Mahood was returned by them to Stephenson, and the plaintiff Rennie says that he received it from Stephenson on the 18th December and then paid him the $2,500. In point of fact, as Mahood admits, (and he is the witness upon whom the plaintiff mainly relies in support of the contention raised by him in this suit,) Brown and Mahood never received any portion of this money nor was it ever intended that they should; the mortgage was the re- sult of a transaction wholly between Stephenson and the plaintiff, and was executed by Brown and Mahood wholly by way of substitution for the Stephenson mortgage. On the 2nd day January, 1888, Brown and Mahood effected a loan of $693 from one Greorge Hughes in security for which they gave Hughes a chattel mortgage upon the mill building and the machinery therein by the same description as that given in respect thereof in the chattel mortgage to Parkinson. The chattel mortgage to Hughes contained precisely the same powers as to sale and otherwise in case of default in payment of the said amount thereby secured as were contained in Parkinson\u2019s chattel mortgage, and was duly filed of registry in the proper office in that behalf on the 12th day of January, 1888.\nOn the 17th day of January, 1888, Brown and Mahood executed a further chattel mortgage upon a large quantity of chattels therein enumerated, including the stock in trade of dry goods, groceries, &c. in their store at Utterson, and \u201cthe shingle bolts, mill machinery and plant which are at and beside the mill owned by the mortgagors on the shore of Mary\u2019s Lake,\u201d &c., to one Alfred Hunt in security for $2,519.73, due by them to him. This mortgage also contained all the provisions as to powers of sale and otherwise that were contained in the Parkinson mortgage, and was duly filed of registry on the 18th January, 1888.\nUpon the 16th of February, 1888, Brown and Mahood, in security for a further advance of $2,500.00 made to them by Alfred Hunt, executed in his favour a further chattel mortgage upon the same property as that described in the mortgage of the 17th January, and containing similar provisions as to sale and otherwise in case of default in payment of the moneys thereby secured. This mortgage was duly filed of registry in the proper office in that behalf on the 25th day of February, 1888, and on the same 16th February Brown and Mahood also executed in favour of the said Alfred Hunt a mortgage upon certain real estate therein mentioned in security for the same sum of $2,500. Now Mahood said in his evidence that at the time he gave to Stephenson a description of the village lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 the Parkinson loan had not been arranged for at all, and that he always thought the Rennie mortgage was prior to that of Parkinson until the summer of 1888. He also said that before executing the Rennie mortgage he read it and saw that the mill was not included in it. He was asked by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in relation to this the following question:\nWhat did you think and intend the discription to cover?\nTo which he answered\u2014\n\u201cWe always held the description to cover the water frontage as well as the lots.\u201d\nHe was then asked\u2014\nWhat he meant when he said on his cross examination that when he executed the Rennie mortgage he knew it did not cover the mill?\nTo which he answered\u2014\n\u201cI mean to say that it did not expressly mention the mill.\u201d\nWhereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel put a question to him in the following form:\nYou mean to say by that it did not mention the mill in so many words but you thought the mill was covered by the description of the lots?\nTo which he answered\u2014\nYes.\nNow Mahood knew that he had purchased the village lots from Hunt. We have it from his own lips that at the time of his purchasing them he was informed that another person was trying to acquire the water frontage for the purpose of preventing him and his partner Brown erecting the mill they contemplated erecting there, and that in order to prevent that he went down to Toronto to the Crown Lands Depart- ment for the purpose of endeavoring to secure the water frontage himself, and that he was there instructed how to proceed for that purpose, viz: to get a Provincial Land Surveyor to make a survey and plan and description of the water lot as required; that in adoption of these instructions he employed a surveyor to make and that such surveyor did make for him a plan of the lot for the express purpose of his making application to the Crown Lands Department for the water frontage as and for the site of the mill. The plan was prepared as we have seen in July, 1887. On the 21st of November following he executed to Parkinson a mortgage on the village lots by the description given to them in the deed from Hunt to him and on the same day he also gave Parkinson a chattel mortgage executed by Brown and himself upon the mill and machinery therein which they covenanted to insure in the interest of Parkinson, and on the 24th November they procured a policy as covenanted with a provision that in case of loss the amount should be paid to Parkinson. Now from all this it is quite plain that Mahood knew well that the description of the village lots in the deed from Hunt to him did not and could not cover any water lot in front and that the title to a water lot in front of the village lots which were separated from the lake by a road could only be obtained from the Crown Lands Department, for which purpose he had the plan made which shewed the metes and bounds of the water lot desired to be acquired by Mahood and upon which he and Brown erected their mill. Mahood thus well knew that the water lot upon which the mill was erected was wholly distinct from the village lots and was not covered by their description. When, then, he told Mr. Stephenson, if he did tell him, that the description of the village lots covered the mill, and that this was the only description he had or could give of the mill property; and when he said that he and Brown always held that the description of the village lots did cover the water lot in front upon which the mill was erected; and when he said that the Parkinson loan had not been arranged for at all when he gave Mr. Stephenson the description of the village lots, and that he always thought until the summer of 1888 that the Rennie mortgage was prior to that to Parkinson, and that when he executed the Rennie mortgage although he knew the mill was not mentioned in it still that he considered it to be covered by the description of the village lots; he was stating what is shown from his own lips in other parts of his evidence to be untrue. Indeed it is utterly impossible to believe that within the short space intervening between the 21st and 30th November he could have forgotten the transaction as to the Parkinson mortgage. The dealings also of Brown and Mahood with the mill property subsequently to the execution of the Rennie mortgage by giving chattel mortgages thereon in security for further loans show a deliberate intention to deal with that property as property in which they had only a chattel interest and which was wholly distinct from the village lots of which Mahood was seized in fee. If at the time of the execution of the Rennie mortgage Brown and Mahood entertained any intention to give to Rennie any security upon the mill property it could only have been to put Rennie in the same position in relation to the mill as he was by the mortgage which they executed placed in relation to the village lots, that is to say, as a second mortgagee only subsequent to Parkinson; and that intention, if entertained, would, it is reasonable to assume, have been given effect to by chattel mortgage as in the case of Parkinson. Now it is quite apparent that this would not have been at all in accord with Mr. Rennie\u2019s intention, for he says that he told Mr. Stephenson, who appears to have been negotiating with him for the sale to him of the Stephenson mortgage which was on the farm on lot 22 on the 7th concession alone, that if the mill and the village lots were clear, and if a mortgage were drawn to him including them with the farm he would take it, otherwise not; and he told Mr. Stephenson to find out if the mill and the village lots were clear so that he could have what he was stipulating for on a clear mortgage upon the farm and on the mill and on the village lots. I can, therefore, arrive at no other conclusion than that the plaintiff has failed to establish the first step necessary to be established by him in support of the contention asserted in this case, namely, that by an agreement entered into between Brown and Mahood and Rennie the mill property and the right thereto, such as it was, of Brown and Mahood should have been inserted in the mortgage executed to Rennie and that this was, merely by their mutual mistake, omitted. It may be and perhaps is the fact that Rennie has been deceived and defrauded by Stephenson, who, it is said, subsequently left the country, and who appears to have been the only person who, in the character of or in the interest of the holder of the Stephenson mortgage, had any agreement with the plaintiff in respect of the transaction which Stephenson perfected by procuring Brown and Mahood to sign the mortgage which Stephenson prepared for them to sign, and which they did sign just as he had prepared it, in perfect ignorance, so far as appears, of its not expressing, if it did not express, the intention Stephenson had in preparing it in the form in which he did prepare it. But whatever equity the plaintiff may have against Stephenson it is obvious that against the defendants he can have none to the prejudice of the rights vested in Parkinson and his assigns by the instruments executed by Brown and Mahood if the defendants come within the designation of assigns of Parkinson, and as such entitled to the benefit of the powers which were vested in him. It is only necessary now to show how the defendants claim title.\nOn the 25th May, 1888, Brown and Mahood made an assignment of all their property, real and personal, to one Robert H. Gray for the benefit of all their creditors. At this time all the estate which Brown and Mahood had in the property in question, and in the village lots also, was an equity of redemption; all the legal estate of Brown and Mahood and the absolute power of sale thereof was vested in the mortgagees Parkinson, Hunt, and others. Nothing whatever, in the property now in question, passed to Gray by the assignment made to him by Brown and Mahood but such equity of redemption as was in them subject to the provisions in the mortgages to Parkinson and others. All the property of Brown and Mahood was mortgaged by instruments conveying to the mortgagees full power of sale in case of default in payment of any of the monies secured by the respective mortgages, and so Gray could not convey to any one any legal interest whatever in any part of the mortgaged property; the assignment to him for the benefit of creditors was therefore in effect almost illusory, and this fact he soon realised, for immediately upon the execution of the assignment to him bailiffs were put in possession of the mill and other chattel property mentioned in certain of the chattel mortgages under the powers in that behalf vested in the mortgagees for default in payment of moneys by these mortgages secured. In this state of things the assignee Gray, who was himself a creditor of Brown and Mahood, endeavoured to procure one Jenkins to purchase the mortgages held by the parties who had taken possession with the view, apparently, of acting conjointly with him so as to effect a sale of the estate of the insolvents. Jenkins, before agreeing to complete such purchase, had an interview with Robert Brown and James Mahood, members of the firm of Brown and Mahood, and Hugh R. Brown, son of Robert Brown, who claimed to have had an interest in some part of the property mortgaged, and upon the 18th June, 1888, an agreement was entered into by and between the above parties, to which also the assignee Gray was a party, whereby it was agreed that Jenkins at the request of all of the said parties should buy the Hunt mortgages at the sum of $5,170.85; the Hughes mortgage at $696.48; and the Parkinson mortgages at $2,493.34; and pay all costs incurred in respect thereof and the costs of the assignment of the said mortgages and insurance policy to him, and in consideration thereof all the parties to the said agreement ratified and confirmed the said mortgages as valid and subsisting securities to Jenkins and he was thereby vested with full power to realize all the said assets as mortgagee in possession with power to sell the stock of logs in the log or manufactured and sell the product or in any way he might think expedient deducting all costs, outlay and expenses and a reasonable compensation for care, risk, time and trouble and interest at the same rate as Brown and Mahood had been paying and all expenses incurred by him, and it was declared that he should not be liable for any loss or depreciation of assets unless they arose by his wilful neglect or default. Under this agreement Jenkins purchased the mortgages mentioned therein.\nSubsequently conditions of sale upon which the property should be offered for sale were prepared by a solicitor acting for Jenkins and approved by a solicitor acting for Gray the assignee. In these conditions under the head real estate the lands to be offered for sale were inserted including the village lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the village of Port Sidney. Also all the following:\nTIMBER INTERESTS.\nAll the right, title and interest of Robert Brown, James Mahood, Janet Brown, Janet Mahood and Hugh Reside Brown, and of Robert Jenkins the assignee of certain mortgages given by the said parties or some of them to Alfred Hunt, Richard H. Parkinson and George Hughes in and to the timber now standing, lying and being on the following lots, viz., (naming them) timber licenses, &c., cut timber, &c., also the mill of Brown and Mahood at Port Sidney and the machinery thereon in running order subject to the claim of Polson & Company for about $500.00.\nThen among the conditions of sale were inserted the following:\u2014\n1. All the said property shall be sold in one parcel.\n5. The properties are sold subject to the five several mortgages set forth in the schedule annexed and marked \u201cNo. 5,\u201d and to the liens on machinery set forth in \u201cSchedule No. 6,\u201d and any other liens thereon, particulars of the amounts due upon which are set forth as accurately as obtainable, and also to any government dues upon any timber cut or uncut.\n9. The vendor agrees to obtain, contemporaneously with the making of the final payment, a conveyance, assignment or discharge, as may be preferred by the purchaser of Robert Jenkins\u2019 interest in the several parcels above mentioned.\n16. The purchaser shall at the time of sale sign the agreement hereto annexed for the completion of the purchase, and in the event of his failure to do so the property may be put up at any time within two hours after the acceptance of the purchaser\u2019s bidding without any further advertisement of sale; and any deficiency in the price obtainable upon the second offering for sale together with any costs occasioned by such failure shall be made good by the bidder whose bid shall be first accepted and who shall make default as aforesaid.\nThen followed the contract of purchase to be signed by the purchaser. Among the five mortgages mentioned in the schedule no. 5 was inserted Rennie\u2019s as follows:\u2014\nSimpson Rennie $2,500 and interest at 9 per cent. from 8th December, 1887, payable quarterly. Principal payable in five annual instalments of $500 each, first payable 8th December, 1888. Land covered lots 5, 6, 7 and 8, Port Sidney, and lot 22 in 7th concession Stephenson.\nThe sale was advertised to take place on the 6th November, 1888, but prior thereto and on the 2nd day of November, 1888, a further indenture under seal was entered into by and between the said Robert Brown, Janet Brown, his wife, and Hugh R. Brown of the first part; James Mahood and Janet Mahood, his wife, of the second part; Robert Jenkins of the third part and Robert H. Gray, assignee of the assets of Brown and Mahood, of the fourth part, whereby the parties of the first and second parts:\u2014\nBy way of confirmation and further assurance in consideration of the position of Gray as assignee of Brown and Mahood for benefit of creditors and of the purchase by Jenkins of the Hunt, Parkinson and Hughes mortgages and of future advances by him and of the management of affairs by Gray in the interest and for the protection of the estate and of the dealings and transactions on account of the parties interested in the assets grant, assign and release all their and each of their partnership and several assets, estate and effects to Gray his heirs and assigns subject to the said mortgages assigned to Jenkins his heirs and assigns which are hereby confirmed to him his heirs and assigns and to his future advances commission and expenses which are declared to have priority over the claims of unsecured creditors.\nAnd it was thereby among other things further agreed that the sale of the said assets, estate and effects should be in one lot subject, by the consent of Jenkins, to the incumbrances on each parcel which had priority over him and that the price should be payable fifty per cent at the time of sale, balance in thirty days, to be applied first in payment of the claim of Jenkins as aforesaid and the balance if any to the unsecured creditors; that the sale should be proceeded with on the day advertised by the assignee; and that Jenkins should be at liberty to bid at the sale and buy the said assets, estate and effects as any other bidder and should if he bought take the absolute title as purchaser free from any objection that he is assignee of the said mortgages or is interested in the said assets, estate and effects and all legal objections were waived; and it was further agreed that all necessary parties should join in and sign all necessary deeds and papers to perfect a registered title of the said assets, estate and effects to a purchaser. In accordance with the provisions of this instrument the sale was proceeded with on the day advertised by the assignee, viz., the 6th of November, and at such sale one Mitchell on behalf of himself and others associated with him was the highest bidder and became purchaser subject to the conditions of sale and signed the contract of purchase at the foot thereof.\nUnder the circumstances above detailed and in view of the two special agreements of the 18th June and of the 2nd November signed by the respective parties thereto and of the conditions of sale it cannot, I think, be disputed that the sale in point of fact was, and was intended to be, a sale made by Jenkins as possessed of the legal estate and by Gray as assignee of the equity of redemption of all the parties interested in the property sold, and so made for the purpose of securing an undoubted title to the person becoming purchaser under the conditions of sale. In so far as the plaintiff in the present action is concerned the sale of lot 22 in the 7th concession of Stephenson, and of the village lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 in Port Sidney, was by the special consent of Jenkins made subject to Rennie\u2019s mortgage thereon; shortly after the execution of the agreement of the 18th June the assignee Gray instructed his solicitor, who is now the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, to ascertain the particulars of the Rennie mortgage. This gentleman had, it seems, been partner of Mr. Stephenson who drew the mortgage, and who received from Rennie the moneys advanced upon the security thereof. He applied to Mr. Rennie and received from him the mortgage for the purpose of supplying the particulars required, and on the 20th July, 1888, addressed the following letter to Mr. Gray:\u2014\nRE BROWN & MAHOOD.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014The Rennie mortgage bears date 8th day of December, 1887, is made by Robert Brown, James Mahood and their wives to bar dower only to Mr. Simpson Rennie, Scarborough, farmer, securing $2,500 with interest at 9 per cent per annum, payable in five equal annual instalments of $500 each on the 8th day of December in each year, with interest quarterly on the 8th days of March, June, September and December, the first of such payments of interest to be made on the 8th day of March, 1888. The property charged is lot 22 in the 7th concession of Stephenson containing one hundred acres more or less, and village lots nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 as shown on Mary Ladelle\u2019s survey of part of the village of Port Sidney in the township of Stephenson, these said lots forming a part of lot 25 in the 6th concession of Stephenson. Nothing has been paid on account of this mortgage.\nVery truly yours,\nR.M. DICKSON.\nUpon the faith of the accuracy of this information the conditions of sale were prepared wherein the mill is shown as offered for sale wholly distinct from all real property under the description of the mill of Brown & Mahood at Port Sidney, and the village lots separately as real estate. Upon the 6th December, the purchaser Mitchell appears to have paid the balance of his purchase money and thereby, under the terms of his contract and the conditions of sale and of the instruments of the 18th June and 21st November became entitled to the benefit of the interest acquired by Jenkins as assignee of the Parkinson mortgage on the mill as the first chattel mortgage excuted thereon which title was in most express terms ratified and confirmed by the instruments of the 18th June and 2nd of November by all the parties called as witnesses on the part of the plaintiff in the present action for the purpose of avoiding the expressed purport tenor and effect of so many instruments ex- ecuted under their hands and of defeating the title of the persons who have purchased upon the faith of those instruments. Now the means adopted for giving effect to the condition upon which Mitchell became purchaser at the sale, that the benefit of the title and interest acquired by Jenkins as assignee of the mortgages assigned to him, which title and interest were expressly ratified and confirmed by the instruments of the 18th June and 2nd November, 1888, should be secured to Mitchell the purchaser at the sale, was that a deed of assignment by Jenkins to Gray of the mortgages which had been assigned to Jenkins was prepared for execution and executed by Jenkins and a deed was prepared for execution and executed by Gray, the party thereto of the first part to and in favor of Mitchell, and the persons jointly associated with him in the purchase made by him at the sale, the parties to the said deed of the second part, whereby after recital of the deed in trust for creditors, executed by Brown & Mahood to Gray, and the several mortgages which had been executed by Robert Brown and James Mahood to Parkinson and the others of which Jenkins had become the purchaser, and the assignment thereof to Jenkins and the several instruments of the 18th of June and the 2nd November, 1888, and that Gray had by and with the consent and concurrence of Robert Brown, Janet Brown, Hugh R. Brown, James Mahood, and Janet Mahood, and by and with the consent and concurrence of the said Jenkins, duly advertised all the real and personal estate mentioned in the instruments of the 18th June and 2nd November, for sale on the terms mentioned in the conditions of sale by public auction at Toronto, on the 6th November, 1888, and the assignment by Jenkins to Gray of the said several indentures of mortgage so as aforesaid assigned to him, he (Gray) for the consideration of the sum, which was the sum for which Mitchell purchased at the sale, and in pursuance of the powers contained in the several recited instruments, did grant and convey unto the said parties of the second part to the said deed all the real and personal estate therein mentioned and described, being the property as described in the conditions of sale under which Mitchell had become the purchaser at the sale, to have and to hold to the said parties of the second part to the said deed, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns for ever. I cannot entertain a doubt that the effect of this deed was to vest in Mitchell and his associates, the parties thereto of the second part, the title and interest which by his purchase at the sale he became entitled to on payment of his purchase money the balance of which appears to have been paid in accordance with the conditions of sale, on the 6th December, 1888, and that the deed vested in Mitchell and his said associates the legal right and title to the mill which was vested in Jenkins by the assignment to him of the chattel mortgages thereon, which were ratified and confirmed by the instruments of the 18th June and 2nd of November in pursuance of the powers contained in which instruments the deed is expressed to be executed. Upon no principle of law, equity or morality, can the decree made in his cause be, in my opinion, supported in so far as it directs that the mortgage executed to Rennie:\u2014\nShall be reformed so as to cover in addition to the lands therein described (the water lot particularly described in the decree,) and that the said water lot together with the shingle mill, engine, boilers, machinery and fixtures situate therein be charged with the plaintiff\u2019s said mortgage in the same manner as if the same had been originally described in the said mortgage when it was executed and delivered.\nAs to this water lot Brown and Mahood never had any title thereto vested in them, and as to the mill and the machinery therein they had already when the mortgage to the plaintiff was executed been mortgaged for more than their value by instruments to the protection and benefit of which Mitchell by his contract of purchase became entitled as purchaser from Jenkins the assignee of those mortgages under the powers of sale contained therein. The principle which lies at the foundation of the case made and the relief prayed by way of reformation of the mortgage is that there was an agreement between the mortgagors and the mortgagee that the water lot in question should have been inserted in the mortgage, and that it was omitted merely by mutual error, inadvertence and mistake. I have already given my reason for arriving at the conclusion that the evidence fails to show that there ever was any such agreement, or that when Brown and Mahood executed the Rennie mortgage they intended that the water lot should have been inserted therein. That they entertained such intention is wholly inconsistent not only, as I have shown, with Mahood\u2019s own evidence in divers particulars, but with all the chattel mortgages and with the provisions of the instruments of the 18th June and 2nd of November, which ratified and confirmed those mortgages in the hands of Jenkins as the assignee thereof, and inconsistent, also, with the conditions of sale of which Brown and Mahood were well aware and under which Mitchell purchased. That Rennie when he received the mortgage entertained the belief that the water lot was or was intended to be inserted in the mortgage is wholly inconsistent with the letter of his solicitor of the 19th November, 1888, to Mitchell after the sale at the auction and with Rennie\u2019s own affidavit by way of proof of his mortgage debt made in April, 1889, in both of which he makes his claim solely upon the farm lot, no. 22 in the 7th concession of Stephenson, and the village lots describing them as lots nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, according to Ladelle\u2019s survey of part of the village of Port Sidney. If it were necessary I should also be obliged to arrive at a conclusion adverse to the plaintiff upon the question of notice, in view of the positive denial of every one of the parties sought to be affected with the notice charged of the truth of the statements in that respect of the witnesses testifying to such notice. Moreover the notice as spoken of by those witnesses seems to have been not that Rennie claimed that it was intended that the water lot should have been inserted in the mortgage in addition to the other lands and that this had been omitted by the mutual mistake and inadvertence of himself and of his mortgagors, but that, in point of fact, his mortgage did cover the water lot, a wholly different thing, and which as we see the mortgage clearly did not. However, for the reasons that under the conditions of sale upon which Mitchell became purchaser he and those claiming through him are entitled to the full protection and benefit of the Parkinson chattel mortgage and the other chattel mortgages on the mill and machinery therein assigned to and held by Jenkins, and for the reason that the evidence fails to establish any agreement or intention upon the part of Brown and Mahood that the water lot and mill should have been included in the mortgage to Rennie, I am of opinion that the passage to which I have referred must be eliminated from the decree whatever may have been Rennie\u2019s belief when he received the mortgage, and that the ordinary decree on foreclosure of the property mentioned in the mortgage must be substituted. The case is not, in my opinion, at all one for the peculiar relief prayed and by the decree granted.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The respondent, who is plaintiff in the action, claims: (1). To have the said mortgage reformed so that it may become charged upon the said water lot, shingle mill, engine, boiler, machinery and fixtures: (2). Foreclosure of the said mortgage.\nHis right to a foreclosure is not disputed. The appeal relates altogether to the first claim. There is no case whatever made for charging the water lot. It never was the property of the mortgagors, nor did they ever pretend that it was. It was crown land. The mortgagors had taken some preliminary steps with a view to the purchase of the lot but they had not purchased it. Relying on their ability to purchase it they had constructed on it the shingle mill, not attaching it to the soil but resting it on cribs. In this way they occupied as much of the ground as the cribs stood upon, but without any title. The mill and machinery were chattels. The mortgagors so understood and treated them. They mortgaged them as chattels to Parkinson and to Hughes and to Hunt who filed their mortgages under the Chattel Mortgages Act, and at a later date seized the property by their bailiff. The Parkinson mortgage was made a few days before that which the plaintiff asks to have reformed, but, as Mahood one of the mortgagors says, after the agreement with the plaintiff. The mortgages were all made within three months, viz.: in November and December, 1887, and in January and February, 1888. Looking at the evidence of Mahood and of Hugh Brown and the plaintiff, who are the only people who speak of the negotiation on which the claim for reformation is based, we do not find a word of mortgaging the water lot. What they speak of is the mill. No doubt that term would colloquially include the land the mill stood on, and a conveyance of a building forming part of the freehold would have in law the effect of conveying the land; but here \u201cthe mill\u201d means the chattel structure. That is unquestionably so in the mouth of Mahood. He explains his idea in one place by saying: \u201cThe mill we had went with the village lots,\u201d apparently regarding the mill as in a sense appurtenant to the village lots, though of course it would not pass under a conveyance of those lots with the appurtenances. It is possible, and perhaps not unlikely, that the plaintiff when he stipulated for security on the mill had not his attention called to the fact that the mill was merely a chattel and did not form part of the freehold, but Mahood was under no misconception on that score, and what the plaintiff has to establish is not merely that he thought he was to get the water lot but that that was the mutual understanding.\nThis apprehension of the character of the mill and machinery, as being chattels and not realty, is very important in one aspect of the case. It is not discussed in the judgment of the court below though made prominent in the formal reasons of appeal, but Mr. Justice Maclennan, who delivered the judgment of the court, when he says that he thinks it \u201cclearly proved that it was the intention and agreement of the parties that the security the plaintiff was to receive for his advance of $2,500 included the mill and machinery, and that the latter were omitted from the mortgage by mutual mistake.\u201d does not hint that that property was not regarded as chattel property. I take it that the reporter\u2019s note of the observation attributed to the learned judge who tried the action, viz., \u201cthe evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was intended to cover the water lot, including the mill, &c., is irrefragable,\u201d must be incorrect, there being no evidence whatever that the water lot was intended to be conveyed, whatever may have been the case as to the mill, &c., but the contrary being obviously the fact. It may also be noticed that in the scheduled description of the properties sold by Gray, the assignee, the mill appears as a chattel and not as realty. Assuming, then, that there was a verbal agreement to give security on this chattel property, and therefore in equity a mortgage of it, the Ontario statute respecting Mortgages and Sales of Personal Property[6] has to be reckoned with. A mortgage, or conveyance of personal chattels intended to operate as a mortgage, which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued charge of possession of the things mortgaged, is absolutely null and void as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration, unless registered as provided by the act with the prescribed affidavits.\nThe appellants are purchasers in good faith for valuable consideration. Notice of an unregistered chattel mortgage does not save it as against the statute. Some evidence was given for the purpose of showing notice in this case before the payment of all the purchase money. It was, as I think, beside the question under the Chattel Mortgage Act. The property passed without delivery by the sale made by the assignee. Blackburn on Sales c. 3. And by R.S.O.[7]:\u2014\nIt shall in no case be necessary, in order to maintain the defence of purchaser for value without notice, to prove payment of the mortgage money or purchase money or any part thereof.\nIt appears to me impossible for the plaintiff to maintain his claim against these purchasers in the face of the Chattel Mortgage Act.\nBut dealing with the matter apart from that statute, and on the same principles as if the asserted agreement were for the conveyance of land, the difficulties in the way of the plaintiff seem equally insuperable.\nThere were four mortgages ahead of him, the Parkinson mortgage being earlier in time, and the mortgage to Hughes and the two mortgages to Hunt having been taken without notice of the asserted equity. The legal estate was in Parkinson. The judgment proceeds, if I understand it correctly, on the ground that those four mortgages had been redeemed by Gray the assignee and that the appellants purchased simply from Gray who could convey only what the original mortgagors could have conveyed, namely, the mill charged with the plaintiff\u2019s debt, and that the actual conveyance not having been made till after the lis pendens was registered the plaintiff can assert against the purchasers his right to a reformation of his deed.\nI do not so understand the transaction.\nThe conditions of sale expressly bound the vendor\nto obtain, contemporaneously to the making of the final payment, a conveyance, assignment or discharge, as may be preferred by the purchaser, of Robert Jenkins\u2019 interest in the several parcels above mentioned.\nRobert Jenkins\u2019 interest was all the title under the Parkinson mortgage and the other mortgages. Those mortgages were never discharged, but were assigned to Gray and so kept alive, and Gray by his deed, which recited the mortgages, the assignment of them to Jenkins and the assignment of them by Jenkins to Gray, together with other matters, did \u201cin pursuance and exercise of the powers contained in the said in part recited instruments and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf,\u201d convey the lands to the purchasers.\nThe purchasers take, as I understand it, all the estate and rights of Parkinson, Hughes and Hunt against whom it is not pretended that the present claim could be asserted.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Bain, Laidlaw & Kappelle.\nSolicitors for respondent: Dickson & Erwin.\n[1] 19 U.C.Q.B. 341.\n[2] 4 O.R. 696.\n[3] 15 O.R. 218; 16 Ont.

The grounds upon which the appellants based their claim and. which are stated in the report of the case in M. L. R. 7 Q. B. 317, are for alleged losses on two shipments of cattle made, as they alleged in September, 1883, at the request of James McShane, junior, and which shipments they contended were guaranteed from loss by the Exchange Bank of Canada, which, on the 15th September, 1883, suspended payment and went into liquidation. The following letter of credit, cheque and telegram were annexed to the claim, viz:\u2014\n(Copy Letter of Guarantee.)\nEXCHANGE BANK OF CANADA.\nHEAD OFFICE, MONTREAL, 11th Sept., 1883.\nMessrs.

This daim was contested by the respondent, a creditor of the bank, and the principal grounds relied on H were that the said bank could not legally become surety against loss on a contract of the character alleged by the claimants;\nThat at the time the said cattle were delivered to McShane, if at all, said bank had suspended payment to the knowledge of the claimants;\nThat the pretended transaction upon which claimants rely was not the act of the bank, but merely the personal act of Thomas Craig.\nThe cattle were consigned to appellants' agents in Liverpool and at the trial the only witness examined to prove the alleged loss was one Arthur E.

The appeal will therefore be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I entirely agree with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The appellants base their claim against the Liquidators of the bank on their losses on two shipments of cattle, which they allege to have made at the request of James McShane, which shipments were guaranteed from loss, as they contend, by the bank,. The bank went into liquidation on the 15th of September, 1883. The appellants rely upon a letter dated the day before the suspension of the bank, addressed to them and signed by Craig, the accountant of the bank in the following words : \" This letter will be presented by James McShane, whose cheque on the bank to the amount of $40,000 will be good.\" The appellants rely also upon a telegram dated on the 18th day of September, three days after the suspension of the bank, signed by the said Craig, and addressed to the appellants in the following words : \" Load steamer next week for McShane; we guarantee you against loss.\"\nIt seems to me unquestionable that this guarantee simply meant that the appellants should deliver over to McShane the cattle that they had sold him but not that they would ship them in their own name. Now, the appellants never delivered the cattle to McShane, but shipped them themselves on their own account, in their own name to their own order and for their own benefit. Assuming that there ever had been any valid contract with the bank they themselves put an end to it. On the 18th of September Craig could not bind the bank by his telegram he sent to the appellants.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, however, without entering into the consideration of any of the other questions raised in the case, dismissed the appellants' claim on the ground that they had failed to prove the alleged loss on the said shipments. And upon that ground alone this appeal must be dismissed. The only witness examined to prove their loss was their clerk, who knew nothing personally of anything connected with it. His evidence amounts to nothing else but hearsay evidence. The appellants seem to be under the impression that the respondent filed no general denial to their claim; but that is an error. The plea contains an allegation that all, each and every the allegations, matters and things set forth and contained to the said claim are false untrue and unfounded in fact and each and every of them is and are specially denied by the said contestant.\"\nThey contend that the respondent's right to contest their daim has not been established : but they joined issue with him without questioning his right, and it is now too late for them to raise that objection\nGWYNNE J,\u2014 It is unnecessary to determine whether or not the guarantee under consideration was one which it was competent for the Exchange Bank to have entered into or whether the contract against loss in respect of which the guarantee upon its face appears to have been given was determined by the mutual agreement of the parties to that contract as was sworn by James McShane one of the parties thereto; for assuming the contract not to have been determined and the guarantee to be valid and binding, there was no evidence whatever offered of the claimants having sustained any loss in the performance by them. of the contract.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Chapleau, Hall, Brown & Sharp.\nSolicitors for respondent : Greenshields & Greenshields.\n[1] M.

The note was not endorsed by the payees, and no notice of dishonour was given to W. when it matured and was not paid. An action was brought against W. as maker of the note jointly with the debtor, on the trial of which a nonsuit was entered with leave reserved to plaintiffs to move for judgment in their favour, if there was any evidence to go to the jury as to W.'s liability.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that there was no evidence to go to the jury that W. intended to be liable as a maker of the note, and plaintiffs were rightly nonsuited.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment of nonsuit at the trial.\nThe action in this case was against the respondent and one Clark as joint makers of four promissory notes. Clark allowed judgment to go against him by default, and the trial of the action against the respondent resulted in a nonsuit with leave reserved to plaintiffs to move to have it set aside and judgment entered for them, \"if there was any evidence which should have been left to the jury of defendant's (respondent's) liability.\" This appeal is from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick sustaining the nonsuit. The following statement of facts is taken from the judgments of the court below:\u2014\nIt appeared by the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs that they were manufacturers of agricultural implements in Ontario, and in May, 1887, sent Archibald B. Walker to this province as their agent, to effect sales. He called on the defendant Clark, who agreed to purchase a quantity of the goods. Walker, (whose evidence was taken under a judge's order previous to the trial) says that he sold the goods to the defendant Clark; that in conversation with the defendant Clark about the sale he told Clark that he required security for the payment, and that Clark said he would give satisfactory security, that he would give W. B. Wallace (the other defendant). Wallace was not present at the time, but on the following day Walker met both the defendants in Wallace's office when the matter of the sale of the goods was talked over, and the arrangement was that Wallace was to become security for the payment by Clark; that he (Walker) said to them that he was selling the goods cheap and that he wanted absolute security, and that Clark and Wallace agreed to give him their obligations. He also stated that he told Wallace that he would not sell the goods to Clark without security. That Wallace then commenced to draw a note payable to his own order when Walker interposed and said that the plaintiffs advised him always to take notes on their forms, which they had printed, and he produced some of the printed forms and gave them to Wallace who struck out some parts which he considered objectionable and filled in the date, amount, and time of payment, and Clark signed them, and Wallace indorsed them and delivered them to him (Walker).\nThe printed forms which Walker gave to Wallace to fill up were in the following form: \"$ 188\n\"On or before the 1st of , 188, I promise to \"pay to The Ayr American Plough Company \"(Limited), or order, at the sum of \"for value received, with interest at 7 per cent. per \"annum until due, and 10 per cent after due, till \"paid.\"\n(Then followed a condition that the title to the goods sold should not pass from the company till the note was paid with interest, and that the company had power to take possession of the goods at any time they might deem themselves insecure.)\nBefore the notes were signed Wallace struck out with a pen that portion of them relating to the payment of interest, and to the power of the company to take possession of the goods if they considered themselves insecure.\nAt the trial the parties directly contradicted each other as to what took place when the notes were signed. The respondent swore that he only intended to become an indorser, and that he told the agent Walker that until the notes were indorsed by the company he, Wallace would not be liable. Walker, on the other hand, swore that nothing was said about indorsing, that he only asked for security and was accustomed to take joint notes in such cases and thought that he was getting such in this transaction.\nIn the court below the judges were equally divided, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tuck, who had tried the case, being of opinion that the nonsuit should be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff, Palmer and King JJ., giving judgment in favour of affirming the nonsuit.\nEarle Q.C. for the appellant. There was evidence to go to the jury that Wallace intended to become liable as maker. See Piers v. Hall[1]; Bell v. Moffalt[2]; Good v. Martin[3]; Singer v. Elliott[4].\nIn a New Brunswick case the court will follow the decision of the courts of that province.\nCurrey for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I cannot see that there is any evidence whatever to be presented to the jury that Wallace intended to be a maker of these notes. He was to become surety as an indorser, and the notes would have been drawn in the usual form payable to his order but for the interposition of Mr. Walker himself, who would not have them drawn in that way but insisted on having them on the form used by the company. I do not say that the plaintiffs could not have maintained an action if they had given due notice of dishonour, but however that may be, as they have chosen to proceed without it, and as I cannot see that Wallace ever intended to be a maker, the plaintiffs' action fails and this appeal must be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion upon authority of Ex parte Yates[5] and Steele v. McKinlay[6] that the respondent might have been made liable as an indorser of the notes if proper notice of dishonour had been given to him. As no such notice was, however, given he was discharged. The parol evidence was not, I think, admissible, though if taken into consideration it would have shewn that the respondent never intended to come under any other liability than that of an indorser. Steele v. McKinlay (6) is a strong authority against the admissibility of this parol evidence. The want of a memorandum in writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds would have been a defence available to the defendant if it had been sought to charge him as a guarantor. In the case of Singer v. Elliott[7] cited in the argument, the defendant was held liable as a guarantor upon a letter written and signed by him after he had indorsed the bill.\nAs the law now stands since the Dominion Bills of Exchange Act, 1890, it is clear that under section 56 the respondent would have been liable as indorser, but only as indorser. It has been frequently said as regards the English Act (Bills of Exchange Act, 1882), that it was not intended by it to enact new law but merely to declare and codify the law as it stood when the act was passed. Section 56 of the English act is identical in words with the same section of our act. This seems to me conclusive.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014If the question had been whether there was evidence to go to a jury that the defendant signed as an indorser, if he had been sued as such, the answer must have been that there was abundant evidence. But the defendant was sued as maker, and I concur that there was no evidence to go to the jury in support of the issue upon the plea of non fecit, and that therefore this appeal must be dismissed and the nonsuit maintained.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014After hearing all that Mr. Earle has been able in his very full examination of the case to urge to the contrary, the evidence seems to me consistently to show that Wallace was to be indorser of the notes, and I find no evidence that he was to be maker, or that he was understood by Walker, or represented himself, to be signing otherwise than as indorser. That is the view of two of the four learned judges who heard the case in the court below, and unless I misunderstand the opinions expressed by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tuck, who took a different view, they would have agreed with the other members of the court if they had not been impressed by the idea that unless Wallace was liable on the notes as maker he was not liable at all. Under that idea they seem to have treated his defence as evidence of a dishonest contrivance from the imputation of which they shielded him by holding that, because there was proof of his intention to be surety for the purchaser of the goods, there was evidence of his being liable as joint maker of the notes. I am not able to concur in those views.\nI see nothing to have prevented the plaintiffs as payees of the notes indorsing them, expressing the indorsement to be without recourse if they chose to do so though under the circumstances that would not have been essential, thus creating in Wallace the legal character of indorsee from them and indorser to them[8]. I am not aware that the legal right of parties in the position of the plaintiffs to do this was ever questioned. It was not questioned in the case of Bell v. Moffatt[9] on which Mr. Earle relied so much. We find from the report of that case in 3 P. & B. that in one count the declaration charged that Fulton made his note payable to Bell or order, and that Bell indorsed the note to the defendant who indorsed it to the plaintiff. A plea that Bell the payee and Bell the plaintiff were the same person was met by a replication that Bell the plaintiff indorsed the note to the defendant without recourse, and that replication was held good on demurrer as is stated by Wetmore J. at p. 267 of the report. The report relates to another replication, pleaded perhaps to meet the facts more fully, by which the plaintiff stated his title through an intermediate indorsement and not as indorsee direct from Bell. That replication was properly held bad as a departure from the declaration. Mr. Justice Wetmore referred to a number of cases, one of which, Smith v. Marsack[10] was a case of demurrer to a replication as a departure, which pleaded the same essential facts which would exist if the plaintiffs had in this case indorsed the notes without adding the words \"without recourse,\" but relying on the fact that the defendant had indorsed for the purpose of being surety to them for the maker of the note. The replication in Smith v. Marsack (1) was held good. No question of circuity of action could arise here unless the defendant would have had recourse against the plaintiffs as prior parties to the note, but indorsing as he did as surety to the plaintiffs he had no such recourse against them. The report of Bell v. Moffatt in 4 P. & B.[11] and the case of Piers v. Hall[12], bear on the present discussion in the way in which they were used by Mr. Earle as showing that a man may write his name on the back of a note and yet be liable as maker of the note. That is a question of fact more than of law. The evidence in those cases proved the intention to be maker while here the whole evidence is that he was to be indorser.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: A. C.

She lived with him until she was twenty-five when she married. The grandfather died shortly after leaving her by his will a much smaller sum than his daughters received, and she brought an action against the executors for specific performance of the agreement to provide for her as amply as for the daughters, or, in the alternative, for payment for her services during the eleven years. On the trial of the action it was proved that S., while living with her grandfather, had performed such services as tending cattle, doing field work, managing a reaping machine, and breaking in and driving wild and ungovernable horses.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the alleged agreement to provide for S. by will was not one of which the court could decree specific performance. But\nHeld further, that S. was entitled to remuneration for her services and $1,000 was not too much to allow her.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts necessary to understand the decision in this case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nThe case was tried by Mr. Justice Falconbridge who held that the agreement made with the plaintiff by her grandfather was sufficiently proved, and that she was entitled to have the same specifically performed. He made a decree accordingly, allowing the plaintiff $1,000 to place her in the same position under the will as the testator\u2019s daughters, which amount was to include her legacy. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision and the defendants appealed to this court.\nGlenn for the appellants.\nJ.A. Robinson for the respondent.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The strong inclination of my mind is against the agreement in this case being one as to which the courts could decree specific performance, but I think the evidence shows quite clearly that the services performed by the plaintiff were not intended to be gratuitous. Then it becomes a question as to what the plaintiff is entitled for such services under the quantum meruit, there being no wages fixed by the testator who had only agreed to provide for her remuneration by his will.\nThe plaintiff performed work which no woman should be called upon to perform, such as breaking in wild and ungovernable horses, cleaning out stables, doing all sorts of field work and other things usually done by a man. She appears to have been a very capable young woman, and I do not think that $1000 is too much to allow for her services from the time she was fourteen years of age until she was married, which would be about eleven years. To give her that amount would only be paying at the rate of $7.50 a month, and if I may be allowed to speak from my own knowledge of what services of the kind are worth I would say that the remuneration is very moderate as I have never been able to procure servants here at such a rate.\nUnder the circumstances shown in the case I think this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the court of first instance varied by assessing the damages at $1000 in full for the plaintiff\u2019s services, including the amount left her by the will.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have no doubt that the agreement sought to be enforced in this case is one as to which specific performance would not be decreed. I very much doubt if it has any validity at all as an agreement, or if it is anything more than a representation or promise of future favours.\nThe grandfather of the respondent did not stand in loco parentis towards her. He considered her to be a capable worker and knowing that was anxious to secure her services. Then to look at the nature of the services that were performed, if they had been ordinary household services, such as are usually performed by a young girl, the case would have been different; but she performed very extraordinary services. We are told that she looked after 20 or 30 cattle; cleaned out stables, cut grass, drove horses; managed a reaping machine; broke in and managed wild, ungovernable horses. This, then, is not a case in which to apply any presumption arising from the relationship of the parties that the services were rendered gratuitously.\nThe respondent is, in my opinion, entitled to recover as on a quantum meruit without regard to the representation.\nAs regards the amount recoverable I should be prepared to give the respondent $1,000 in addition to her legacy, but I think that at all events she should have the $1,000 inclusive of the legacy, and she should be at liberty to apply if necessary for an administration order.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Concurred. GWYNNE J.\u2014The question is not whether the plaintiffs grandfather has treated her as well in his will as he ought to have done but whether she can assert the claim which she does as one enforceable in law.\nI can not consider myself bound by the finding of the trial judge in this cause as to the precise terms of the contract. I concur entirely with Mr. Justice Osler. Moreover, having all the evidence before us, I do not think the trial judge was justified in finding the contract to have been as stated by the plaintiff\u2019s mother. If it was as stated by the plaintiff herself I think the legacy left by the will was in full compliance with that agreement; moreover the Ontario statute that the contract sued upon should be confirmed was not complied with. The respondent by her counsel agreeing to accept $1,000 in full satisfaction of legacy and all claims the appeal is dismissed with costs and the judgment of the court below ordered to be altered accordingly. Costs of action to be out of the estate.\nPATTERSON J. concurred\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: James M. Glenn.\nSolicitor for respondent: John A. Robinson.\n"}

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSolicitor\u2014Bill of costs\u2014Order for taxation\u2014R.S.O. (1887) ch. 147 s. 42\u2014Appeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Discretion\u2014Proceeding originating in Superior Court\u2014Final judgment.\nBy R.S.O. (1887) ch. 147 s. 42 any person not chargeable as the principal party who is liable to pay or has paid a solicitor\u2019s bill of costs may apply to a judge of the High Court, or of the County Court, for an order for taxation. An action was brought against school trustees and a ratepayer of the district applied to a judge of the High Court for an order under this section to tax the bill of the solicitor of the plaintiff, who had recovered judgment. The application was refused, but on appeal to the Divisional Court the judgment refusing it was reversed. There was no appeal as of right to the Court of Appeal from the latter decision, but leave to appeal was granted and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the Divisional Court and restored the original judgment refusing the application. From this last decision an appeal was sought to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J., Strong and Gwynne JJ., that assuming the court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal the subject matter being one of taxation of costs this court should not interfere with the decision of the provincial courts which are the most competent tribunals to deal with such matters.\nPer Ritchie C.J., Strong and Patterson JJ., that a ratepayer is not entitled to an order for taxation under said section.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014The court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal as the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act; the matter was one in the discretion of the courts below; and the proceedings did not originate in a Superior Court. Per Patterson J.\u2014The making or refusing to make the order applied for is a matter of discretion and the case is, therefore, not appealable.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2].\nAn action was brought in the County Court against the trustees of a school section of the township of Southwold to have the solicitor\u2019s bill in an action brought by said trustees against the school board, and delivered by the solicitor to the board, referred to a taxing officer for a report thereon, and for a decree ordering the amount disallowed from said bill to be repaid to the treasurer of the school section. The county court judge decided that he had no jurisdiction to try the action but that he had power to transfer it to the High Court, whereupon the defendants applied to the High Court for an order prohibiting such transfer or any further proceedings by the County Court in the action. The plaintiff made a cross-motion for a summary order to refer the bill of costs to taxation pursuant to sec. 42 of R.S.O. (1887) ch. 147. The motions were argued together before Mr. Justice Rose who dismissed plaintiff\u2019s motion for an order for taxation and reserved judgment on the other. The plaintiff appealed to the Divisional Court which reversed the decision of Rose J. and granted the order for taxation. On further appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of the Divisional Court was reversed and that of Rose J. restored. The plaintiff then sought to appeal to this court.\nRiddell and J.A. Robinson for the appellants referred to the case of Ex parte Bass[3].\nThe court raised the question of jurisdiction and concluded that the appeal could not be entertained.\nGlenn for the respondents was not called upon. Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am not prepared to admit at present that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, because I think it was a pure matter of discretion in the judge to make the order or not, and moreover it was discretionary with the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal from the judge\u2019s decision or not, and the judgment sought to be appealed from was not a final judgment. But assuming that we have jurisdiction I think this is not a case in which we should interfere, more especially as it appears in the record that an action is now pending in the Superior Court to try the issue raised in this matter. More than that I very much doubt that a ratepayer is a person entitled to an order for taxation of costs. But admitting all this in favour of the appellant I think this court should not interfere in a matter of this kind. I think it would be a monstrous thing for us to interfere in matters relating to costs, for there can be no better tribunal for dealing. with such matters than the courts of the provinces in which the proceedings are taken. If we hear an appeal in one case of the kind we must do so in every such case that comes before us.\nFor these reasons I am clearly of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Without actually deciding the case upon that ground I am strongly of opinion that we have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal. In the case referred to by my brother Taschereau of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. St. Th\u00e8rese[4] it was determined, on appeal from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec, that a matter in which the proceedings originated before a judge in chambers, pursuant to statute, was not within the provisions of the Supreme Court Act which require cases brought to this court on appeal to originate in a Superior Court. I agree in the ratio decidendi of that case and think it is decisive here. True, the statute says that the application in the present case may be made to a judge of the High Court of Justice or of the County Court, and the judge of the County Court is a local judge of the High Court, but it is to be made to a judge in chambers, and I cannot see any difference in this respect between the case referred to and the present case. There was an alternative mode of commencing the proceedings, and if the application had been made to the Divisional Court the case might have been appealable, but the parties chose to adopt the other course. It makes no difference to say that a judge in chambers exercises the powers of the court. That was the argument in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. St. Th\u00e8rese4. We are bound by that decision, and I think it should be conclusive.\nHowever, I do not rest my decision on that ground alone. I agree with what the Chief Justice has said. Nearly a year ago the case of O\u2019Donohoe v. Bealty[5] came before this court, and during the argument my brother Patterson raised the question of jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and Mr. Justice Gwynne said, \u201cI think that sitting as a Court of Appeal we should not interfere with the judgment of the Divisional Court on a question of this kind.\u201d Afterwards the judgment of the court in that case was delivered by my brother Gwynne, who said, \u201cI have entertained, and still entertain, great doubt whether an appeal should be entertained, by this court in a matter of this description, which relates wholly to the practice and procedure of the High Court of Justice and of an officer of that court in construing the rules of the court, and in executing an order of reference made to him by the court.\u201d I think, therefore, that on the grounds indicated, even admitting that the party strictly has a locus standi so far as regards jurisdiction, we ought not to exercise jurisdiction in such a case as this, not merely because the order was made in the exercise of discretion but for the reason mentioned by the Chief Justice, namely, that it was never intended that this court should interfere in such matters.\nLastly, in considering the case upon the merits, and having heard what was urged by counsel, I am of opinion that the case of Re Barber[6] is a decision that ought to govern this case. It is undistinguishable in its facts from the present appeal. I entirely disagree with the Divisional Court in their construction of the statute and of the words \u201cshall be liable to pay.\u201d Shall be liable to pay whom? It must mean liable to pay somebody; but a ratepayer is not liable to pay a solicitor though he may be liable to contribute to a fund for the purpose; but he is not liable in the sense of the statute. The statute meant liable to pay directly which is not the liability of a ratepayer.\nOn these grounds I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In my opinion the appeal should be quashed on three grounds, namely, that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act; that it was a matter entirely within the discretion of the court below; and that the proceedings did not originate in a superior court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Without determining whether or not we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal upon the question raised as to whether or not the matter originated in a superior court I do not think we ought to interfere in a matter of this nature relating to orders for reference of a bill of costs to taxation, the more espe- cially (as just observed by the Chief Justice) as an action appears to be preceding in which the identical matter in question is raised.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree with the other members of the court as to the result of this appeal. I think this order was one of those that are in the discretion of the court below and on that account not appealable to this court. I do not express any final opinion upon the question as to whether or not these proceedings originated in a superior court. It is very difficult to gather from the statute what the proceeding really is, but I do not think that a judge of a County Court, with the jurisdiction given him in matters of this kind, represents the High Court of Justice. Section 41 of the act R.S.O. (1887) ch. 147, provides that a judge of the High Court, or a county judge, on proof to his satisfaction that there is probable cause for believing that the party chargeable is about to quit Ontario, may authorise an action to be commenced, &c. Then there are other provisions which authorise an order to tax to be made by the High Court or a judge thereof, or a judge of a County Court. I think this treats a judge of the County Court as such simply, and not as exercising the powers of the High Court.\nAs to the merits I agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal. I do not think the ratepayer in a case such as this is a party chargeable within the meaning of the statute so as to be entitled to apply for an order for taxation. I entirely agree with the result dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: John A. Robinson.\nSolicitor for respondent: James M. Glenn.\n[1] 19 Ont.

H. and his brother were partners in business and the latter having died T. H. became by will his executor and residuary legatee. A legacy was left by the will to E. H., part of which was paid and judgment recovered against the executor for the balance. T. H. having encumbered both his own share of the partnership property and that devised to him one of his creditors, and a mortgagee of the property, obtained judgment against him and procured the appointment of receivers of his estate. E. H. then brought an action to have it declared that his judgment for the balance of his legacy was a charge upon the moneys in the receivers' hands in priority to the personal creditors of T. H.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that it having been established that the moneys held by the receivers were personal assets of the testator, or the proceeds thereof, E. H. was entitled to priority of payment though his judgment was registered after those of the other creditors.\nHeld also, that the legacy of E. H. was a charge upon the realty of the testator the residuary devise being of \"the balance and remainder of the property and of any estate \" of the testator, and either of the words \" property \" and \" estate \" being sufficient to pass realty. This charge upon realty operated against the mortgagees who were shown to have had notice of the will. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThis was an action brought to have a judgment of the plaintiff against the defendant Thaddeus Harper, executor of the estate of one Jerome Harper, declared a charge upon the assets of said estate in priority to the mortgages and judgments of the other defendants. The circumstances which gave rise to the action were as follows:\u2014\nIn 1871 and for many years previously Jerome and Thaddeus Harper, two brothers, had carried on in British Columbia, and also in the neighbouring States and Territories, the business of stock-raising, and had accumulated the ownership of much land, cattle and horses, and some plant and machinery. The land in British Columbia was all registered in the sole name of Jerome but the whole property, land and stock live and dead, was owned in equal shares by the two brothers in partnership ; and they were reputed to be wealthy, worth $300,000 in British Columbia. The value of the personal estate at the time of Jerome's death exceeded $80,000.\nIn November, 1874, Jerome died. By his will he appointed the defendant, Thaddeus, sole executor, and after bequeathing several legacies, among them $10,000 to the plaintiff Ezekiel, another brother, he gave the residue of all his estate, real and personal, to the defendant, Thaddeus, for his own benefit. Thaddeus entered into possession of the whole property and has ever since dealt with it as being entirely his own. In or about the year 1875 he paid the plaintiff $5,000 on account of his legacy of $10,000, and has paid, or promised to pay, interest on the balance ever since. Ezekiel frequently asked Thaddeus for payment of the balance of the legacy but never took any steps to en force payment until December, 1888, when he commenced an action in which, Thaddeus admitting the amount, he obtained a judgment on the 24th January, 1889, for $6,865, legacy, interest and costs.\nDuring the 14 or 15 years since the testator's death during which Thaddeus had, as has been said, dealt with the whole partnership property, his own original share as well as that which he derived from Jerome's will, he had very heavily encumbered the whole. He had between March, 1885, and March, 1888, created five mortgages aggregating $141,750 of principal moneys on which there was a large arrear of interest, and was indebted to other creditors as well. Among other speculations Thaddeus purchased a mine from one John Cameron for $50,000, for which sum he gave his own promissory notes. He became involved in financial difficulties and on the 10th day of December, 1888, Cameron recovered a judgment on his notes for the sum of $50,029.00. The mortgagees and other creditors of Thaddeus also sued and recovered judgments against him.\nOn the 19th day of December, 1888, Cameron obtained the appointment of the receivers J. C. Prevost and H. S. Mason. They took possession of the estate and subsequently it was sold for $225,000 to John Galpin who insisted, however, that the mortgages on the real estate should be paid off by him, and only paid over to the receivers the balance after payment of the mortgages.\nWhen it was discovered that there would be a deficiency of assets to pay all the creditors of Thaddeus the present action was commenced, in which it was prayed that the Ezekiel's claim might be declared a charge on the fund in the hands of the receivers prior to the claim of the personal creditors of Thaddeus, and for an injunction to prevent the receivers from distributing the fund without payment of Ezekiel's claim. The action was tried before the Chief Justice who gave judgment for the defendants, dismissing the action with costs. The plaintiff thereupon appealed to the full court where the decision of the Chief Justice was reversed and judgment was given against the present appellants. From that order the present appeal is brought to this court.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the appellant cited In re Jane Davis[1] ; Kitchen v. Ibbetson[2] ; Culhane v. Stuart[3].\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for the respondent referred to Wedderburn v. Wedderburn[4] ; Pennell v. Deffell[5] ; Harford v. Lloyd[6] ; In re Hallett's Estate[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nSTRONG J.\u2014This action was instituted by the respondent Ezekiel Harper to obtain payment of the residue remaining unpaid of a legacy of $10,000 bequeathed to him by the will of of his brother Jerome Harper. The defendants were Thaddeus Harper, the executor of the testator, and certain judgment creditors of the executor who have recovered judgment against him, de bonis propriis, in respect of personal demands and not for any debts or liabilities of the testator. These judgment creditors having obtained the appointment of receivers and these receivers having got into their hands moneys which the respondent alleges formed part of, or were derived from, the assets of the testator Jerome, the respondent seeks to have these assets applied in payment of his legacy, there being no debts or other legacies of the testator remaining unpaid. The judgment appealed against directs the payment of the unpaid balance of the legacy out of these moneys, as claimed by the respondent.\nAssuming that these moneys were, in fact, assets of the testator, or the proceeds of such assets, I can see no possible objection to the respondent's demand. The appellants are personal judgment creditors of the executor, and as such have no right whatever to the testator's assets so long as any of his pecuniary legatees remain unpaid. If all the legacies had been paid off then, inasmuch as the executor is also the residuary legatee, any assets remaining would no doubt be exigible by the creditors of the residuary legatee ; but these creditors can have no possible right to have these assets applied in satisfaction of their debts to the prejudice of a legatee of the testator.\nTo admit the contrary of such a proposition would be to sanction the application of one man's property to the payment of another man's debts. Judgment creditors are only entitled to have applied to the satisfaction of their judgments such property as the debtor has a beneficial interest in, and they are not entitled to enforce their claims against property or assets which their debtor holds as an actual or constructive trustee for another.\nThe court below find that one-half of the sum of $45,497.50 in the receivers' hands belongs to the estate of Jerome Harper, the testator, and they direct that out of this moiety the amount of the judgment recovered by the plaintiff for the unpaid residue of the legacy, together with interest and costs, should be paid. Assuming that there are assets in the receivers' hands to the amount mentioned this judgment must surely be unimpeachable. That there are moneys in the receivers' hands which properly belong to the estate of Jerome is a fact which I consider concluded by the finding of the court below, the evidence of Thaddeus, the executor, being quite sufficient to warrant in this respect the judgment appealed against.\nThere is a further ground upon which the judgment might be sustained. The legacy bequeathed to the respondent was charged upon the testator's realty. There can be no doubt upon this head. The testator having first given several legacies, including that mentioned to his brother Ezekiel, gives and devises to his brother Thaddeus Harper, the executor, all \" the balance and remainder of the property and of any estate \" of which the testator might die the owner. The words \"property\" and \"estate\" are of course both sufficient to pass realty. Then it is established by Greville v. Browne[8], a decision of the highest authority, that where there is no specific devise of real estate, and a pecuniary legacy is given without any words making it an express charge upon the real estate, and the will contains a subsequent gift of the residue of the realty, there is by implication a charge of the legacy on the real estate.\nThis being so, and the evidence establishing that the testator's share of the realty has been sold by the receivers and the proceeds applied to the payment of the judgment creditors of the executor, including amongst others the present appellants, the respondent would, to the extent to which the appellants' judgments have been satisfied by a misapplication of real assets in the hands of the receivers to his prejudice, be entitled to stand in the appellants' place against moneys now remaining in the hands of the receivers applicable to the payment of the judgment creditors, even though not assets of the testator. This, however, would involve an account, which, under the judgment appealed against, proceeding as it does upon the ground that the assets remaining in the receivers' hands are personal assets of the testator, is not required.\nAs regards the real assets, if it were necessary to resort to the principle of subrogation which I have just referred to, it would be no answer to such a proceeding to say that the judgment creditors were also mortgagees of the executor Thaddeus.\nGranting that they were mortgagees of Thaddeus; the executor and residuary legatee and devisee, they must be held to have had notice of the will and the charge thereby created for, even assuming in their favour that the will was never properly registered, as to which I find some obscurity in the evidence, yet Mr. Maine, through whose agency the mortgages were obtained, expressly admits in his evidence that he saw and examined the will before taking the mortgages ; so that he must be taken to have had express notice of the charge of the legacy on the real estate.\nThis action being brought to enforce the judgment recovered by the respondent in 1889 for the unpaid balance of the legacy the statute of limitations can, of course, be no defence to it.\nI do not very well understand why the judgment creditors other than the appellants who were originally made parties to the action were dismissed. It would certainly seem that if their judgments were still in any part unsatisfied, they were interested in maintaining their right to be paid in preference to the respondent, out of moneys in the hands of the receivers, who were appointed at their instances as well as at the instance of the appellants. They have not, however, appealed, and in default of any appeal by them I am of opinion that we ought not to interfere with the judgment on this ground.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.

On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada :\nHeld, per Strong, Fournier and Taschereau JJ. that the respondent's right could not be prejudiced by the delay of the court in rendering judgment which should be treated as having been given on the 30th September when the case was taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and therefore the case was not appealable. Hurtubise v. Desmarteau. (19 Can. S. C. R. 562) followed.\nPer Gwynne and Patterson JJ That the case did not come within the words of s 3 ch 25 54 & 55 Vie inasmuch as the judgment being for less than \u20a4500 sterling, was not a judgment from which the appellant had a right to appeal to the Privy Council in England. Arts. 1178, 1178 a C. C. P.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada sitting in review unanimously confirming\" the judgment of the Superior Court for the sum of $2,006 in favour of the respondent.\nThe appellant was sued for a sum of 22,066 and arrested under a writ of capias in virtue of articles 796 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judgment of the Superior Court was delivered on the 31st August, 1891 and was inscribed in review on the 8th of September and argued and taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 on the 30th September, 1891. Judgment was pronounced some weeks later by the Superior Court sitting in review.\nFrom this judgment the appellant appealed direct to the Supreme Court of Canada, under the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Amending Act, 1891, 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25 s. 3 ss. 3. The section reads as follows\n\"3. Provided that such appeals shall lie only from the Court of Queen's Bench, or from the Superior Court in review in cases where, and so long as, no appeal lies from the judgment of that court when it confirms the judgment rendered in the court appealed from, which by the law of the Province of Quebec, are appealable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\"\nCasgrain Q.C., Attorney General of Quebec, for respondent: The case was argued on the day On which the act was passed and upon the principle that actus Circe neminem gravabit I contend the judgment must be held to have been delivered on the 30th September, 189.1, and if so Hurtubise v. Desmartequ ([1]) decided by this court, applies.\nMoreover the case is not appealable the amount not being for \u00a3500 sterling, as regulated by art. 1178 C. C. P.\nPelletier for appellant: The jurisprudence in the Province of Quebec has always been to consider the date of the judgment and not the day of the argument for all purposes of appeal. See art. 483, C. C. P. As to the amount it is over $2000 and comes within the very terms of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R.S.C ch 135 and the Parliament of Canada alone has jurisdiction to regulate the amount which is appealable to this court. STRONG J. stated that he had read Mr. Justice Taschereau's judgment and that he concurred with him\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Il s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve en cette cause une importante question concernant la juridiction de cette cour, c'est de savoir, si l'on peut appuyer le jugement sur une loi qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9e que le m\u00eame jour que cette loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e.\nLes faits sont ainsi qu'il suit: l'appelant \u00e9tait demandeur pour la somme de $2,006 devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Chicoutimi, qui a rendu jugement pour la somme de $684.14 le 31 ao\u00fbt 1891. Port\u00e9 en appel devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en revision \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 8 septembre 1881, ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirme le 30 septembre 1891. Ce m\u00eame jour \u00e9tait sanctionn\u00e9 le statut 54 & 55 Vie. ch. 25, amendant la juridiction de cette cour de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre l'appel ici dans des causes d\u00e9cid\u00e9es en revision qui n'y \u00e9taient pas appelables auparavant, savoir : celles dans lesquelles le jugement en \"premi\u00e8re instance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9.\nEn cons\u00e9quence du jugement de confirmation cette cause ne pouvait \u00eatre port\u00e9e en appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc de la Reine. il ne restait que l'appel an Conseil Priv\u00e9 si le montant \u00e9tait suffisant. Mais la demande qui n'\u00e9tait d'abord que de $2,006, et le jugement qui d'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence du Conseil Priv\u00e9 doit servir de base pour r\u00e9gler le droit d'appel, n'\u00e9tant que de $684.14, la cause n'y \u00e9tait pas appelable.\nPriv\u00e9 du droit d'appel \u00e0 la cour du Bane de la Reine et au Conseil Priv\u00e9 l'appelant a pens\u00e9 que la 54 & 55 vic. ch 25 lui offrait un moyen de sortir de difficult\u00e9 en lui ouvrant l'appel \u00e0 cette cour.\nEn effet, une disposition de ce statut a introduit un important changement dans le droit d'appel. il fallait auparavant que la demande fut an moins de $2,000. Un jugement de cette cour avait m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9, comme au Conseil priv\u00e9, que cc serait le montant adjug\u00e9 et non celui demand\u00e9 qui servirait de base an droit d'appel. Mais ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par le statut ci-haut cite, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (sec. 3 ss. 4,) que lorsque le droit d'appel d\u00e9pend du montant en litige, ce montant sera estim\u00e9 \u00eatre celui demand\u00e9 et non celui obtenu, s'ils sont diff\u00e9rents.\nLa demande de l'appelant \u00e9tant au-del\u00e0 de $2,000 savoir de la somme de $2,006, ii a cru que la voie lui \u00e9tait ouverte pour l'appel \u00e0 cette cour. Mais ii se trouve encore un malheureux obstacle dans son chemin, ii se trouve trop t\u00f4t pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la loi.\nIl est de principe qu'une cause soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de la cour pour jugement et qui est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e pour consid\u00e9ration ou prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9re, doit, quelle que soit la date du jugement rendu plus tard, \u00eatre jug\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s la loi en force, lorsque la cour, apr\u00e8s audition des parties, a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la cause. L'application de ce principe ruine les esp\u00e9rances de l'appelant. La cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la cause le 30 septembre et les parties out droit \u00e0 leur jugement d'apr\u00e8s la loi, telle qu'alors en force; mais c'est ce jour-l\u00e0 m\u00eame que par la sec. 3 ss. 4 la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue appelable en d\u00e9clarant que l'appel serait d\u00e9sormais r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par le montant demand\u00e9 et non celui obtenu.\nUne cause absolument semblable a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans cette cour. C'est celle de Hurtubise v. Desmarteau ([2]). D'autres causes out aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s le m\u00eame principe comme on le voit par les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans le rapport.\nIl est d'autant plus regrettable que l'appel ne puisse avoir lieu qu'il s'agit d'une cause o\u00f9 la libert\u00e9 du sujet est mise en question. L'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur cap. ad resp. et sera priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9, tant qu'il ne pourra payer son jugement.\nNe serait-il pas plus raisonnable d'accorder l'appel dans un cas semblable que dans beaucoup d'autres o\u00f9 il ne s agit que de sommes insignifiantes dues \u00e0 titre de rentes annuelles, honoraires d'office etc. Il faut esp\u00e9rer que cette anomalie va bient\u00f4t dispara\u00eetre de nos codes.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case comes up on a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction. The motion must be allowed. The ruling in Hurtubise v. Desmarteau ([3]) applies here. It is true that the judgment appealed from here was in fact pronounced in the Court of Review after the coming into force of the act 54 & 55 Vic, ch. 25, which allows for the first time appeals from that court but, as regards this appeal, the case having been put en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 on the 30th September 1891, on the very day that the act was sanctioned, the judgment is to be treated as if it had been given on that day, on the principle actus circes neminem gravabit. Nothing that happens after the case is en \u00e9tat can alter in any way the rights or position of the parties. It cannot be that a judge can render a case appealable or not at his will by simply delaying or hastening the judgment thereon.\nI refer to the following authorities: Lawrence v. Hodgson ([4]) in which Garrow B. says :\nWhere a case stands over for judgment the party ought not to be prejudiced, by that delay, but should be allowed to enter up his judgment retrospectively, if necessary, to meet the justice of the case.\nFreeman v. Tranah ([5]) where Cresswell J. says:\nThe maxim actus curice perineum gravabit is founded upon justice and good sense, and affords a safe and certain guide for the administration of the law. And Maule J. says:\nIt is an established principle of law that the act of the court shall injure no one, such as the courts taking time to deliberate on its judgment.\nAnd the writer's remarks on Pinhorn v. Sonster ([6]) in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes ([7]):\nThe judgment was, in strictness, due before the act, and the delay of the court ought not to affect it.\nSee also Evans v. Rees ([8]); Green v. Cobden ([9]); and Miles v. Williams ([10]).\nI rest my judgment on that ground without expressing any opinion one way or the other on the ground relied upon by my brothers Gwynne and Patterson.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be quashed but upon the following grounds only, namely, that the judgment from which the appeal is taken was not one which this court has authority to entertain under the provisions of the Dominion statute, 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 125. inasmuch as it was not a judgment- which the appellant had de jure, by the statute law of the Province of Quebec, a right of appeal to the Privy Council in England, the above statute of the Dominion authorizing in my opinion this court to entertain appeals from all judgments of the Court of Review thereafter delivered, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in such cases only as were de jure appealable to the Privy Council.\nI cannot concur in the opinion that upon a question of right to appeal a judgment delivered, it may be months after the day upon which the case is argued and judgment is reserved, shall be referred back to the day upon which the argument was closed so as to be deemed to have been delivered on that day. The logical deduction from such, holding\" would be that the right to appeal might be barred by the time allowed for appealing from a judgment having elapsed before the judgment should he in point of fact delivered.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This appeal being from a judgment of the Superior Court sitting\" in review cannot be heard by this court, unless the judgment is one which by the law of the Province of Quebec is appealable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ([11]) The law of the Province of Quebec on the subject of appeal to the Privy Council is found in articles 1178 and 1178a of the Code of Procedure and in cases like the present it confines the right of appeal to those wherein the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of \u00a3500 sterling. The sum or value in dispute in this action which according to the statute of 1891 we understand to he the amount demanded, or $2,000, is less than \u00a3500 sterling. This is a fatal objection to our jurisdiction and upon that ground I agree in quashing the appeal. The other objections, founded on the time when judgment was pronounced in its relation to the 30th of September, 1891, when the statute received the royal assent, have to be dealt with in one or two cases now standing for judgment. I therefore forbear to discuss them now, merely remarking that I do not assent to the proposition that a judgment, given after argument and after time taken for deliberation, relates back to the date of the argument, as if given nunc pro tunc.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Pelletier & \"Fontaine.\nSolicitors for respondent : casgrain, Angers & Lavery.\n[1] 19 Can.

M. undertook to cut and store ice provided:\u2014 That said ice houses and all implements were to be the property of P. who after completion of the contract was to convey same to M.; and that M. was to deliver said ice to vessels to be sent by P. who was to be obliged to accept only good merchantable ice so delivered and stored. The ice was cut and stored and M. affected insurance thereon and on the buildings and tools. In the application for insurance in answer to the question \"Does the property to be insured belong exclusively to the applicant, or is it held in trust or on commission or as mortgagee?\" the written reply was \"Yes, to applicant.\" At the end of the application was a declaration \"that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation and value and risk of property to be insured so far as the same are known to the applicant, and are material to the risk.\"\nThe property was destroyed by fire and payment of the insurance was refused on the ground that the property belonged to P. and not to M. the insured. On the trial of an action on the policy the defendants also sought to prove that P. had effected insurance on the ice and that under a condition of the policy the amount of M's. damages, if he was entitled to recover, should be reduced by such insurance by P. This defence was not pleaded. The policies to P. were not produced at the trial and verbal evidence of the contents was received subject to objection. A. verdict was given in favour of M. for the full amount of his policy.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the property in the ice was in M.; that it was the buildings and implements only which were to be the property of P. under the agreement and not the ice which was at M's. risk and shipped.\nHeld, further, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the insurance to P. and the condition of the policy should have been pleaded but if it had been the evidence as to it was improperly received and must be disregarded.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J., that the application of M. for insurance not being made part of the policy by insertion or reference the statements in it were not warranties, but mere collateral representations which would not avoid the policy unless the facts mis-stated were material to the risk. If materiality was a question of law the non-communication of the agreement with P. could not affect the risk; if a question of fact it was passed upon by the jury.\nPer Strong J.\u2014The application, being properly connected with it by verbal testimony, formed part of the policy and the statements in it were warranties, but as M. only pledged himself to the truth of his answers \"so far as known to him and material to the risk\" and such knowledge and materiality were for the jury to pass upon, the result was the same whether they were warranties or collateral representations.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe plaintiff, McLellan, a resident of St. John, N.B., entered into the following agreement with one Palmer of the same place:\n\"1st. Said McLellan agrees to cut, store and put in proper houses secured and properly protected from the weather, from 5,000 to 10,000 tons of pure fresh water ice, free from foreign matter in blocks of the following sizes, viz.: 22 in. x 32 in. and the thickness that the block ice will cut.\"\n\"2nd. That the said ice, houses, and all implements are to be the property of said Palmer, but after the completion of this contract he is to convey same to the said McLellan.\" \"3rd. The said McLellan to build a good sluice or shute for delivering ice to vessels where they can load to 16 feet and proceed to sea and of such a character that he can deliver and load at least four hundred tons per day.\"\n\"4th. Said McLellan is to deliver the said ice free on board and stowed to vessels to be sent by said Palmer in July and or August and or September, 1890, and do all things necessary in the premises and usual by the shippers of ice.\"\n\"5th. Said Palmer is to pay said McLellan for all said ice as follows: The sum of one dollar and twenty-five cents per ton of 2,240 lbs. of good merchantable ice put on board and stowed in good merchantable condition, the quantity to be ascertained on the shipping documents of each vessel.\"\n\"6th. Said Palmer is to advance the said McLellan the sum of sixty cents per ton of ice as housed and secured and for the purpose of ascertaining quantity housed fifty cubic feet to be reckoned as a ton, such advances to be deducted from payments of the first cargoes shipped.\"\n\"Said Palmer shall be only liable to accept and pay for under this document the good merchantable ice delivered and stowed on board vessels sent by him or assigns.\"\nThe land on which the buildings in which plaintiff proposed to store the ice were situate was leased by the owner to Palmer, the lease containing a covenant of renewal in favour of plaintiff. The buildings were mortgaged by plaintiff to one Barnhill as security for money due.\nMcLellan, the plaintiff, cut and stored the ice, and before shipment he effected insurance with the defendant company for $15,000 on the ice, and smaller amounts on the buildings and tools. In the application for insurance was printed the following question: \"Does the property to be insured belong exclusively to applicant, or is it held in trust or on commission, or as mortgagee?\" To this question the answer written was \"Yes, to applicant.\" At the foot of the application and just before plaintiff's signature, the following memo. was printed:\u2014\n\"It is hereby declared that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk, of the property to be insured, so far as the same are known to the applicant and are material to the risk; and the said applicant hereby agrees and consents that the same shall be held to form the basis of the liabilities of the company.\"\nOne of the conditions of the policy was as follows:\u2014\n\"13. If at the time of any loss or damage by fire happening to any property hereby insured, there be any other subsisting insurance or insurances, whether effected by the insured or by any other person, covering the same property, this corporation shall not be liable to pay or contribute more than its ratable proportion of such loss or damage.\"\nThe property insured was destroyed by fire, but payment of the insurance was refused by the defendants, who claimed that plaintiff had no insurable interest in the property, but that it belonged to Palmer. An action was brought on the policy on the trial of which defendants, in addition to the defence as to the whole claim, set up a partial defence under the 13th condition, and sought to prove that Palmer had also insured the ice and received the sum of $3,250 for such insurance. This 13th condition was not pleaded and the policies to Palmer were not produced at the trial. Defendants tendered secondary evidence of their contents which was received by the trial judge subject to objection that it was inadmissible.\nThe plaintiff obtained a verdict for the full amount of his policy which the court in banco affirmed. The defendants appealed.\nWeldon Q.C. and Jack for the appellants. McLellan had no insurable interest in the property. Calcutta & Burmah Steam Navigation Co. v. DeMattos[1]; Castellain v. Preston[2].\nPlaintiff cannot recover profits on his business as part of his damages. Wilson v. Jones[3].\nThe application contained a warranty of the truth of the answers of plaintiff to the printed questions and some of the answers being untrue the policy was void. Thomson v. Weems[4]; Fowkes v. Manchester &c. Assurance Assoc.[5]; Gore District Mutual Insurance Co. v. Samo[6]; Marshall v. Times Insurance Co.[7]; Cashman v. London & Liverpool Insurance Co.[8].\nThe question of materiality should not have been left to the jury.\nBarker Q.C. for the respondent. As to plaintiff having an insurable interest see The North British & Mercantile Insurance Co. v. The Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Co.[9]; and as to misrepresentation National Bank v. Hartford Insurance Co.[10]; Hopkins v. Provincial Insurance Co.[11]; Stock v. Inglis[12].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The whole property was substantially plaintiff's, in his possession and at his risk, and there was an insurable interest in plaintiff in the whole property. If destroyed by fire the loss would fall on him because he could never deliver the ice and so fulfil his contract and obtain payment, and if the building and tools were destroyed, which were only held by Palmer to secure the fulfilment of the contract, they could never be returned to him as contemplated by the agreement; and the same observation is applicable to Barnhill's bill of sale which was also only by way of security.\nI think as the application was not referred to in the policy and therefore formed no part of it by insertion or reference the statements contained in it were not warranties but merely representations collateral to the policy, and therefore, unless material to the risk, would not avoid the policy; and inasmuch as the ice, buildings and tools were at the risk of the plaintiff I cannot, if the materiality was a question of law, see how the non-communication of the contract with Palmer, and the bill of sale to Barnhill, could possibly have been material to the risk. If the ice, houses and tools were all destroyed the loss, for reasons before stated, must necessarily fall on the plaintiff and therefore he was substantially and practically for the time being the owner of the ice, buildings and tools. If the materiality was a question of fact then the jury have passed on it in a manner I think entirely satisfactory. Thinking therefore, as I do, that the application contained a representation only and not a warranty; that if not literally it was substantially correct, and that if not substantially correct it was not material to the risk; and that the plaintiff had an insurable interest to the full value of the amount insured, I think he is entitled to recover the amount so insured, which is the whole marketable value of goods insured at the time of the loss, and they cannot cut that amount down by reason of transactions between plaintiff and Palmer and Scammel, to which the insurance company is in no way a party. They received the agreed premium for insuring this property; the market value of the property has been satisfactorily established; and this is the legitimate amount of the loss under the 9th condition of the policy, and this amount they must pay.\nAt the time this agreement was made there was no ice cut to which the second paragraph could refer if ice is to be read as separate from the houses, and I think the general scope of the clause indicates that it had reference to the houses and implements alone which for the time being are to be the property of Palmer and not to the ice itself, because \"after the completion of this contract he is to convey the same, that is the ice houses and implements, to the said McLellan.\" How could this apply to the ice which, by the same agreement, McLellan is to deliver free on board and stowed to vessels to be sent by Palmer in all July, and\/or August, September, 1890, and do all things necessary in the premises and usual by shippers of ice.\nIt is said there should be a deduction by reason of there having been other insurance by other parties under the 13th condition which is as follows:\n13. If at the time of any loss or damage by fire happening to any property hereby insured there be any other subsisting insurance or insurances, whether 'effected by the insured or by any other person, covering the same property, this corporation shall not be liable to pay or contribute more than its ratable proportion of such loss or damage.\nBut this was not pleaded, and had it been there was no legal evidence of any other insurance beyond that of the plaintiff. It was sought to prove the contents of the alleged policies by verbal evidence; this was objected to and the policies required to be produced. The evidence was objected to and received subject to objection, the learned judge intimating that the evidence was not receivable, but it was pressed in subject to the objection and was clearly not admissible and must be rejected.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.,\nSTRONG J.\u2014The principal objection which has been raised to the respondent's right to recover in this action is that the answer recorded as his to the 14th question in the application on which the policy was issued was untrue, and constituted either a breach of warranty or at least material misrepresentation.\nThe jury have found that there was no misrepresentation or concealment of facts material to the risk, and the court on an application for a new trial have held that this finding was justified by the evidence. And the learned judge who presided at the trial, Mr. Justice Tuck, having ruled that as a matter of law and legal construction the answer to the question referred to did not constitute a warranty the court in banc have confirmed that ruling.\nThe first question to be considered is that as to the legal effect of this answer to the 14th question assumed to have been put to and answered by the appellant; whether it forms part of the contract of insurance, and is therefore to be regarded as a warranty, or whether it was a mere collateral representation, and as such of no effect save in so far as it mis-states some fact or facts material to the risk.\nThe 14th question is as follows:\nDoes the property to be insured belong exclusively to the applicant, or is it held in trust or on commission or as mortgagee?\nThe answer recorded as the response of the responddent is \"Yes, to applicant.\" At the foot of the application, after the last question and immediately preceding the signature of the respondent, this declaration appears:\nIt is hereby declared that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured so far as the same are known to the applicant and are material to the risk; and the said applicant hereby agrees and consents that the same shall be held to form the basis of the liabilities of the said company.\nThe application is not dated, but the evidence shows that it was signed on the 18th or 19th of April, 1890.\nThe policy is dated the 25th of April, 1890, and is not under seal. The risk was from the 18th April, 1890, until the 18th of October, in the same year. At the time of the application there was no other insurance on the property, the insurance effected on the ice by Mr. Charles A. Palmer not having been made until afterwards, namely, on the 23rd of April, 1890.\nThe policy does not in terms contain any reference to the application.\nI am, however, of opinion that it is impossible to come to any other conclusion, having due regard to the express terms of the clause of the application before set forth, than that the statements embodied in the answers of the respondent, and which were \"to form the basis of the liabilities of the company\" were not mere representations or anything else than warranties, forming part of the contract between the parties. The case of Thomson v. Weems [13] was, it is true, a stronger case inasmuch as the proposal was there referred to in the body of the policy, but this difference is not conclusive against holding the statements in the answers contained in the proposal or application warranties for there is no reason why the statements in the application may not be connected with the policy by parol evidence, and if this is done, and these statements are read as the basis of the contract, they are as much part of the contract of insurance as if they had been written on the face of the policy. The case of Wheelton v. Hardisty [14] contains nothing adverse to this construction for it was not there stipulated by the insurers that the answers to the questions contained in the proposal should form the \"basis\" of the insurer's liability.\nThere would, however, be little difference between the effect of a warranty expressed in the terms used in the concluding clause of the application and a mere representation. In the latter case the questions of materiality and knowledge of the assured of the truth or falsehood of the facts stated would be the principal questions to be determined, and these would, of course, be questions for the jury. But under a warranty framed as this is the questions to be determined are identical, for the party proposing the insurance only states that his replies are just, full and true statements \"so far as the same are known to the applicant and are material to the risk.\"\nI do not at all agree in the meaning and construction attributed to this clause at the foot of the application which is relied on by the appellants, and which is set forth in their factum. This would make the applicant pledge himself to the truth and materiality of his statements absolutely, which is just what the words \"so far as the same are known to the applicant and are material to the risk\" protect him against. It would be impossible to attribute to these words the meaning contended for without perverting the language actually used.\nIt appears to me that the respondent only undertook to affirm the truth of his statements so far as they were known to him, and so far as they were material to the risk. The questions of materiality and of the respondent's knowledge must therefore, even in the view which I think is the correct one, be for the jury. The result must consequently be that the questions for determination are practically the same whether we regard this last clause of the application as forming part of the contract and so constituting a warranty, or as being a mere collateral representation.\nThe principal objection to the truth and accuracy of the answer to the 14th question is that it states the property insured, which includes the ice, ice houses and tools, to belong exclusively to the respondent.\nThis was not strictly the answer which, according to the concurrent testimony of the respondent himself, and that of Mr. Brittain and Miss Wholley, the clerks of Mr. Russel Jack, the appellant's agent, was given to the question by the respondent, for according to all the witnesses what he, the respondent, said was that he was the owner of the ice but was under bonds to deliver it which, making due allowance for the difference between a technical and non-technical mode of expression, was strictly true. The respondent, in my opinion, was the absolute and exclusive owner of the ice, whilst he was by the contract into which he had entered under an obligation to deliver it or other ice to Messrs. Palmer and Scammels.\nIt is to be observed in the first place that the correctness of this statement does not depend on any question of fact, but on a question of law or rather of legal construction, a matter for judicial opinion. There is no question as to the fact that the respondent had duly executed and become bound by the agreements of the 18th March, 1890, and that his title to the leasehold property on which the ice house was erected depended on these agreements and the agreement for the lease entered into between Mr. Raynes and Mr. O. A. Palmer. Something might have turned upon this if the legal effect of those instruments had not been, as I think it was, such as entirely to warrant the construction the repondent put upon them.\nThis depends upon the question whether the property in the ice was by the terms of the agreement to vest in Mr. Palmer before its shipment. I entirely concur in the opinions of the learned judges who delivered judgment in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the words \"ice houses and all implements\" in the second clause of the agreement of the 18th March, 1890, do not refer to the ice, but to the houses in which it was to be stored; this, in my judgment, necessarily results from the provision that after the completion of the contract Mr. Palmer was to convey \"the same\" to the respondent. What was to be so conveyed was the property which was to become vested in Mr. Palmer, and it could not have been meant that the ice was to be conveyed inasmuch as the completion of the contract would involve the shipment and delivery of that. The second paragraph of the 6th clause is, however, conclusive to shew that the property in the ice was not to pass. It reads as follows: \"Said Palmer shall be only liable to accept and pay for under this agreement the good merchantable ice delivered and stowed on board vessels sent by him or his assigns.\" Nothing, in my opinion, could shew more plainly that the ice was not only to be at the risk of the respondent, but that he was to be the actual owner of it, and to retain the property in it until shipment.\nClearly Palmer could not be the owner of the ice which he had not accepted, and the time for his acceptance had not arrived when the insurance was effected, nor when the loss occurred. This is so plain that no further demonstration is required. As regards the tools, which were not consumed or damaged by the fire, and in respect of which no loss is alleged, there is no pretence for saying they vested in Mr. Palmer.\nThe legal property in the lease was no doubt in Palmer, but the clause in the agreement providing that he was to reconvey this property to the respondent after the completion of the contract, coupled with the stipulation in the agreement with Raynes that he was to renew in favour of McLellan, shows that Mr. Palmer held this property in the leasehold merely as a mortgagee and by way of security. Then there was nothing in this nor in the bill of sale to Barnhill inconsistent with the respondent's statement that he was the owner. A mortgagor is deemed the owner of property mortgaged both in a popular and in a technical sense, and the last alternative of the 14th question shows that the word \"property\" in the first part of the interrogation is used as contra-distinguished from the interest of a trustee, mortgagee or commission agent, and the question being read and construed in this sense the respondent was perfectly justified in saying that he was, according to the meaning thus attached to the word \"property\" by the appellants themselves, the exclusive owner of the icehouse as well as of the ice.\nI have therefore no difficulty in holding that the absolute and exclusive ownership in all the property insured was in the respondent, and assuming the answers to the questions propounded to have been strictly warranties there has been no breach of the warranty contained in the answer to the 14th question.\nThe pleadings did not under the New Brunswick rules put the plaintiff to proof of the notice of loss required by the 6th condition and this objection requires no further notice. The 9th condition does not apply; the respondent does not seek to recover for profit but for the amount of insurance on the substantial property actually in his possession at the date of the loss and of which he was the absolute and exclusive owner, and which on sufficient evidence the jury have found to have been of the value of $18,000 and upwards.\nThe objection founded on the 13th condition has given rise to some difficulty. That condition is in the following words:\nIf at the time of any loss or damage by fire happening to any property hereby insured there be any other subsisting insurance or insurances, whether effected by the insured or by any other person, covering the same property, this corporation shall not be liable to pay or contribute more than its ratable proportion of such loss or damage.\nIt is said that Mr. C. A. Palmer, subsequently to the respondent's insurance with the appellants effected by the policy sued upon in this action, effected insurance upon the ice to the amount of $4,000 in two other offices, $2,000 being insured by each company, and that Mr. Palmer after the loss received from each company $1,625, being $3,250 in all.\nThe first observation to be made on this head is that it is a partial defence requiring to be pleaded and that it is not merely a matter of reduction of damages. Apart from this condition the respondent would, upon the finding of the jury that the ice, all of which was destroyed or so damaged by fire as to be of no value, was worth $18,000 and upwards, be entitled to recover upon this head the full amount insured, namely, $15,000. If his right to recover is to be partially reduced under this condition it should therefore have been pleaded. The only plea or notice of defence applicable is the 6th which alleges that Charles A. Palmer was jointly interested in the assured property with the plaintiff, that he (Palmer) effected other insurance and after the loss recovered and received such further insurance for a total loss and to the extent of the full value of the property insured and of the property destroyed. This plea is not proved. Palmer was not jointly interested with the plaintiff, nor did he recover the full value of the property lost. No application to amend this plea or to add a proper plea founded on the 13th condition was made either at the trial or in banc or in argument at this bar.\nHad the defence, however, been properly pleaded the evidence to sustain it is not sufficient. It is true that Mr. Palmer says that he did effect insurance on the 23rd of April on the ice, but the policies were not produced, the terms of them were not even stated, and the evidence, manifestly irregular, being persistently objected to was received subject to objection. Mr. Palmer says he was unable to state the terms of the policies and as these might, had they been produced, have shewn that they did not come within the condition, the evidence ought not to have been received and ought to have no weight.\nBut assuming that these preliminary objections had been got over there would still have remained a more substantial objection to this partial defence.\nIt does not appear from the agreement that Mr. Palmer had any lien or charge upon the ice which was the subject of his insurance, for his advance or otherwise. This specific ice need not have been delivered by the respondent. He was free to sell it and purchase or otherwise obtain other ice with which to fulfil his contract with Messrs. Palmer & Scammels. The contract contains no provision for any security on the ice for the advances, and the provision before noticed that the ice was not to be accepted by Palmer until it was shipped repels the presumption that it was for any purpose, either by way of security or absolutely, to vest or that Mr. Palmer was to have any property equitable or legal before actual shipment. It follows that any insurance upon the ice effected by Mr. Palmer subsequently to the policy upon which this action is brought could not have covered the same property, since Mr. Palmer was a stranger having no legal or equitable interest in the ice to which his insurance as he states it was restricted. It would be impossible so to construe the 13th condition as to make it apply to any case in which an entire stranger, having no interest in the property which formed the subject of insurance, should subsequently to the date of the policy and without the privity of the assured assume to insure it by effecting what might be a mere wager policy. Such a proceeding could not under this condition operate to the prejudice of the owner of the property regularly insured by means of the policy to which this condition is attached, by reducing the amount of the risk or otherwise. And yet if we were to hold the 13th condition applicable to the present case it would also apply to such a case as that supposed.\nFor these reasons I have reached the same conclusions as have been arrived at by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I think the plaintiff had an insurable interest as proprietor to the full value of the property insured whatever may have been the nature of Palmer's claim on the property by virtue of the contract entered into by plaintiff, and this I think is the extent of the representation made by the plaintiff that he was solely interested; that representation was never intended to be a warranty or assertion that no one else had any interest subject to which the policy was issued. The 13th condition of the policy shows this for it points to the contingency of any other person effecting an insurance upon the same property or any part thereof, and provides for what should take place in such an event. This was in fact done, and I must say I think that in justice the defendants are entitled to the benefit of a reduction provided for by that condition, whatever the amount may be. It was not disputed before us, on the contrary it was admitted, that in point of fact Palmer had effected an insurance upon the ice insured by the plaintiff or some part thereof, and that he had received thereon $3,250; I think, therefore, a reduction from the $15,000 insured upon the ice by the plaintiff should be made under the 13th condition.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in the opinions expressed by the Chief Justice and my brother Strong.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: I.

[1887] c. 184) relating thereto, undertook the construction of a drain along the town line between the townships of C. and S. but the work was not fully completed according to the plans and specifications, and owing to its imperfect condition the drain overflowed and flooded the lands of M. adjoining said town line. M. and the township of S. joined in an action against the township in which they alleged that the effect of the work on the said drain was to stop up the outlets to other drains in S. and cause the waters thereof to flow back and flood the roads and lands in the township, and they asked for an injunction to restrain C. from so interfering with the existing drains and a mandamus to compel the completion of the drain undertaken to be constructed by C. as well as damages for the injury to M.\u2019s land and other land in S.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that M. was entitled to damages, and, reversing such decision, Taschereau J. dissenting and Patterson J. hesitating, that the township of S. was entitled to a mandamus, but the original decree should be varied by striking out the direction that the work should be done at the cost of the township of C., it not being proved that the original assessment was sufficient.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J., Strong and Gwynne JJ., that s. 583 of the Municipal Act providing for the issue of the mandamus to compel the making of repairs to preserve and maintain a drain does not apply to this case in which the drain was never fully made and completed, but that the township of S. was entitled to a mandamus under the Ontario Judicature Act (R.S.O. [1887] c. 44.)\nHeld, further, that the flooding of lands was not an injury for which the township of S. could maintain an action for damages even though a general nuisance was occasioned. The only pecuniary compensation to which S. was entitled was the cost of repairing and restoring roads washed away.\nHeld, per Patterson J. that it might be better to leave the decision of the Court of Appeal undisturbed and let the township of S. give notice to repair under sec. 583 of the Municipal Act, and work out its remedy under that section.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson at the trial in favor of the township of Sombra, and affirming it in favor of the plaintiff Murphy.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nMeredith Q.C. for the appellants.

RITCHIE C.J., and STRONG J., concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal. GWYNNE J.\u2014In the interval between the years 1874 and 1880 several drains were constructed in the township of Sombra, bringing down large quantities of water collecting in that township into and through the gore of Chatham which lies to the south of Sombra. The lands in the gore of Chatham lay lower than the lands in Sombra and a great part constituted a marsh. Some of the waters brought down by the drains in Sombra were conducted into, and left in, this marsh from which there was no outlet. In 1880 some persons in Chatham who had brought actions against the township of Sombra recovered judgment in those actions for injury to their lands from waters so brought down in some of the drains from Sombra. At this time the gore of Chatham appears to have been interested in having a drain made which should prevent all water coming down from Sombra from flowing at all through or into the gore of Chatham. The township of Sombra had also an interest in procuring a sufficient outlet for the waters which might be brought down by drains already constructed or thereafter to be constructed in Sombra. It seems to have been considered that there would have been a difficulty in getting the inhabitants of Sombra to petition for any drain which would be adequate for the purpose required, and that a petition could readily be obtained in Chatham, the inhabitants of which had a deep interest in preventing the Sombra waters flowing into the gore of Chatham; accordingly, either by agreement between the Reeves of the respective townships, or independently, one William Whitebread and others, inhabitants of the gore of Chatham, in or about the month of September, 1880, petitioned the council of the township of Chatham for a drain to be dug along the northerly side of the road between the gore of Chatham and the township of Sombra to extend from the north branch of the river Sydenham to the channel Ecart\u00e9. The council thereupon employed their engineer, a Mr. W.G. McGeorge, to make an examination of the locality and to report to the council thereon under the provisions of the drainage clauses of the Municipal Institutions Act. The petition for this drain would seem to have been presented upon previous consultation with the said township engineer, for he, in his report to the council in pursuance of the reference to him by the council, recommended a drain of certain dimensions in width and depth to be constructed along the precise line of that petitioned for, and in his report he assessed the lands and roads in Sombra to be benefited by the work and to a greater amount than he assessed the lands and roads in Chatham. Upon this report the council of the township of Chatham, on the 6th December, 1880, provisionally passed a by-law under ch. 174 of R.S.O. of 1877, whereby they provisionally adopted the report of their engineer and the assessments made by him upon the lands and roads which, in his opinion, would be benefited by the proposed work, and they appointed a day for the sitting of a Court of Revision for the hearing and trial of all appeals against the assessments made in the engineer\u2019s report The municipality of Sombra, under the provisions of section 540 of said ch. 174, appealed against the assessment so made on the lands in Sombra as too great, and as made on some lands and roads that would not be benefited, and against the assessment in Chatham as omitting some lands therein that would be benefited by the proposed drain, but they did not, in their notice of appeal, allege as a ground of appeal a point much pressed upon the trial of this action, that a portion of the plan of the Whitebread drain which provided for the damming of one of the drains in Sombra, called the Pacific drain, where it crossed the town line and the carrying the waters coming down by it from Sombra through the Whitebread drain along the town line to the channel Ecart\u00e9 instead of conducting the waters to be brought down the latter drain into the Pacific drain and thence through that drain as constructed in the gore of Chatham to its mouth. Had they appealed upon that ground much of the evidence received and relied on in the present action, and irrelevant as so given, would have been relevant. See Chatham v. Dover[9]. Their objections as to the amount of their assessments were entertained and adjudicated upon by the arbitrators, and there having been no appeal against their award under section 380 and 385 of said ch. 174 R.S.O. 1877 their award became conclusive and the by-law was thereupon finally passed on the 14th Oct., 1881, and the said Mr. McGeorge was thereby appointed commissioner to let the contract for constructing the said drain and works connected therewith by public sale to the lowest bidder (not exceeding the estimates made by the engineer in his report adopted by the by-law), and it was by the by-law enacted that it would be the duty of the said commissioner to cause the said drain and works connected therewith to be made and constructed in accordance with his plans and specifications, which were adopted by the by-law, not later than the 31st December, 1881, unless otherwise ordered by the council. This by-law was passed under the provisions of sections 547, 548, 549, and 550 of said ch. 174, R.S.O. 1877. This latter section 550 introduced the application of section 542 of the act which is identical with section 583 of R.S.O. 1887, and which enacted that:\nAfter such deepening or drainage is fully made and completed it shall be the duty of each municipality in the proportion determined by the engineer or arbitrators under the same formalities, as nearly as may be, as provided in the preceding sections, to preserve, maintain and keep in repair the same within its own limits either at the expense of the municipality or parties more immediately interested or at the joint expense of such parties and the municipality as to the council, upon the report of the engineer or surveyor, may seem just.\nIt is to this and this case only, namely, of a work which it is the duty of two or more municipalities to preserve, maintain and keep in repair, and when any one of such municipalities neglects or refuses to make all necessary repairs within the limits of such defaulting municipality, after notice in writing, requiring such repairs to be made, that subsection 2 of said section 542 applies, which subsection, as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 32, s. 18, now subsection 2 of section 583 of R.S.O. 1887, enacts that:\nAny such municipality neglecting or refusing so to do (that is to make the necessary repairs within its own limits) upon reasonable notice being given by any party interested therein, and who is injuriously affected by such neglect or refusal, may be compellable by mandamus to be issued by any court of competent jurisdiction to make from time to time the necessary repairs to preserve and maintain the same; and shall be liable to pecuniary damages to any person who or whose property is injuriously affected by reason of such neglect or refusal.\nThis subsection, as I have already observed, is, as it appears to me, expressly limited to the case of one of two or more municipalities whose duty it is to execute all necessary repairs within its own limits neglecting or refusing to make some particular repairs after notice in writing given by any person interested in such repair being made and who becomes injuriously affected by neglect or refusal to make the necessary repairs after such notice. In such a case a mandamus may be obtained in addition to the municipality being liable to an action at the suit of any person who or whose property may be injured by the neglect or refusal of the municipality to make the necessary repairs after such notice. In such an action the occurrence of damage from such neglect after such notice may be taken as conclusive evidence of negligence, but what in cases where no want of repair is apparent to any person interested and who may become injuriously affected and consequently no notice is given under the section, but the municipality with full knowledge, or means of knowledge, that a drain which they are bound to maintain has been suffered to fall into a state of disrepair omit negligently to make necessary repairs and negligently fail to discharge their duty of maintaining the work in an efficient state of repair and damages result to individuals by reason of such negligence? In my opinion the section in question has no reference to any such case; for such damage sustained by neglect to discharge a statutory duty any person injured has his remedy by action at common law which the section in question does not, as it appears to me, purport to restrict or affect in any manner. However the section has no reference whatever to the present case where the drain authorized to be constructed has never, in point of fact, been fully made and completed.\nBy the by-law the work designed was declared to be the digging of the drain upon the town line between Sombra and the gore of Chatham, but on the Sombra side of such line, and the raising of the residue of the town line so as to form a permanent embankment which should prevent all water descending from Sombra from flowing into the gore of Chatham, thus damming up all water courses, natural and artificial, flowing from Sombra across the town line between the River Sydenham and the Chenal Ecart\u00e9 and the giving to the drain a uniform level bottom of the width of nine feet throughout and the width of eleven feet at the surface with side slopes of one to one. Although the by-law appointed Mr. McGeorge, the township\u2019s engineer, commissioner for letting the contract for the work and enacted that the work should be completed by the 31st December, 1881, unless otherwise ordered by the council, and although no order of council was ever made ordering otherwise, it appears that the engineer entered into no contract for constructing the work until in or about the month of September, 1882. It appears also that the contractor with whom this contract was entered into shortly afterwards wholly abandoned his contract and that Mr. McGreorge, the engineer of the township of Chatham, without any intervention of or authority from the council, from time to time afterwards let out the work in separate sections to divers persons who either could not, or if they could did not, complete the work let to them respectively at one and the same time. In fact it appeared that without any order in council authorizing such a mode of letting the work and such deviation from the provisions of the by-law the work was still incomplete in the month of January, 1887. On the 15th day of that month Mr. McGeorge addressed to the township council a letter in the following words:\u2014\nGentlemen: I beg to report to your honourable council that the Whitebread drain is now completed, with the exception that some of the excavated earth taken out late in the season has not been properly spread on the road. This will be done as soon as the frost is out and the earth is sufficiently dry.\nThe present action was commenced in the month of November, 1887, and in the statement of claim filed therein the plaintiffs, the corporation of the township of Sombra and Peter Murphy, whose claims and rights of action respectively, if they have any, are quite independent the one of the other, unite in complaining that in point of fact the drain has never been com- pleted according to the plan and specifications in the by-law, and in consequence thereof the drain does not answer the purpose for which it was constructed:\u2014\nBut on the contrary thereof that the effect of it is to collect together and to cast upon the lands of the plaintiff Peter Murphy, and the roads of the plaintiffs, the corporation of the the township of Sombra, large quantities of water from the neighbouring lands, which would not but for the said drain have flowed upon the said land and roads, and the said plaintiffs and the said land and roads have been greatly damnified and injured by reason thereof in each year since the year 1882, and that the said drain was so unskilfully and negligently constructed that the above evils complained of have been greatly aggravated.\nAnd they alleged, further, that the effect of the acts of the defendants with reference to the said drain and works is to prevent certain drains constructed in the township of Sombra from carrying off the waters brought down by them from lands and roads in Sombra and to pen back such waters upon and to flood the said roads and said lands of the plaintiff Murphy, and that the said defendants have refused to complete the said Whitebread drain; and they prayed among other things that the defendants may be ordered to complete the said drain in accordance with the provisions of the by-law, and that they may be ordered to pay to the plaintiffs and to each of them damages for the wrongful acts of the defendants complained of by the plaintiffs. Now it is obvious that as to the damage alleged to be done to the lands of the plaintiff Murphy and to the roads of the plaintiffs, the township of Sombra, the interests and rights of action of the respective plaintiffs are wholly distinct and independent. The lands of the plaintiff Murphy being flooded for a longer or a shorter period might render them unfit for cultivation more or less according to the duration of the flooding, while no injury of a like nature could be done to the corporation by the flooding of their roads. Their roads might thereby become impassable for a longer or shorter period, but that would constitute an injury in the nature of a nuisance to Her Majesty\u2019s subjects generally requiring to use the roads, but would give no cause of action to the corporation to recover pecuniary damages by way of compensation for such nuisance or otherwise. The only pecuniary compensation which the corporation in an action of this nature could, as it appears to me, claim would be for the cost of repairing and restoring any of their roads which might be washed away by floods occasioned by the wrongful or negligent conduct of the defendants.\nThe learned judge who tried the case, after taking a vast amount of evidence, has in effect found the defendants never did complete the drain to the width, depth and bottom level throughout as was provided by the plans and specifications adopted by the by-law, and he adjudged that the defendants should pay the plaintiff Murphy the sum of $150 for his damages in respect of the injuries complained of by him; and without entering into the evidence at large it is sufficient to say that there can, I think, be no doubt that the learned judge was right in his judgment that the defendants never did complete the drain in accordance with the plans and specifications adopted by the by-law, and that the damages sustained by the plaintiff Murphy were occasioned by such default of the defendants and by the negligent, unskilful and wrongful manner which their engineer adopted of letting the work in several sections to different persons, and in not securing the completion of the several sections at one time, and in not taking care that the bottom of the drain should be constructed at one level throughout as required by the by-law. The consequence of this mode of procedure, according to the engineer\u2019s own evidence, was that one section having been constructed before others caused, as he says, that section to become out of repair and to be choked with silt and earth before others were dug down to their proper level. The engineer\u2019s contention was that the drain after its completion became naturally out of repair, but the learned judge has found, and the evidence abundantly supports his finding, that in point of fact the drain never was completed in accordance with the provisions of the by-law. The question, therefore, is not one of non\u2011repair after completion but of non-completion, and section 583 of the chapter 184 of the acts of 1887 has no application in the present case at all. The learned judge has not accorded to the plaintiffs, the corporation of the township of Sombra, any sum by way of compensation for damage done to any of their roads, and indeed no evidence of any damage enabling the corporation to any such sum appears to me to have been adduced; but the learned judge has in and by his decree ordered and adjudged that the defendants should, within one year from the 23rd day of October, 1888, complete the drain to the width and depth and in the manner provided for by the plans and specifications upon which the work was undertaken, such depth being that indicated by the red line in the plan prepared by John H. Jones put in by the plaintiffs at the trial of the action and numbered exhibit 7, and with proper and sufficient outlets at both ends thereof to carry off all the water which enters the same from time to time. The learned judge in his said decree did further declare that the amount provided by the by\u2011law for the completion of the drain, and which came to the hands of the defendants, was sufficient to complete the drain in accordance with the said plans and specifications, and would have completed the same but for the want of skill, negligence and unnecessary delay of the defendants in proceeding with and carrying out the work, and he therefore adjudged and decreed that the cost of the works necessary for the completion of the said drain should be defrayed by the defendants, and that they should not be at liberty to levy or assess the same or any part thereof as a special rate against the lands and roads by the said by-law assessed for the cost of the construction of the said drain. From this judgment the defendants in the action appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That court ordered and adjudged that such appeal should be allowed as to the relief granted to the plaintiffs, the township of Sombra, and that the action so far as it was the action of the plaintiffs the township of Sombra should be dismissed, and that as regarded the plaintiff Murphy the appeal should be and the same was dismissed with costs to be paid by the defendants the township of Chatham to the said Murphy. The effect of this judgment appears to have been to have left the whole of the decree of Mr. Justice Robertson, as well as to the mandamus as to the damages awarded to Murphy, to stand while the action in so far as the plaintiffs, the township of Sombra, were concerned was dismissed. From this judgment the municipality of the township of Sombra have appealed and their appeal is against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the action. They never appealed against the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson on the ground of his not having awarded them any pecuniary damages. The case was argued before us upon the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was erroneous as depriving the township of Sombra of the right to the mandamus awarded by the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson as if that portion of his judgment had been rendered in their favor alone, for on the present appeal the township of Sombra did not claim any damages. None having been awarded them by the original decree from which they had never appealed they could not well have claimed any on the present appeal. A difficulty now arises attributable to the fact that the original judgment was single and given in a case wherein the two parties, the plaintiffs in the action, asserted totally distinct and independent claims for damages and a joint claim for mandamus. If on this appeal we should reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the action of the plaintiffs the township of Sombra, upon the ground that no question as to their right to pecuniary damages was before us, and that it would be useless to adjudicate upon their right to the mandamus claimed because our judgment could not affect the plaintiff Murphy in whose favor, equally as in favor of plaintiffs the township of Sombra, the mandamus would seem to have been awarded by a literal construction of the original judgment, we should confirm the confusion and difficulty in which the case would seem to be. The better way therefore of getting over the difficulty would seem to me to be to entertain the case as it was argued before us, namely, that that judgment affirmed the original decree in favour of Murphy as to the damages awarded to him, treating the original judgment in his favour as limited to the question of damages, and the award of mandamus in the original decree as a judgment rendered in favour of the township of Sombra. I see no better way at present of getting over the difficulty, and so regarding the case I am of opinion that although the plaintiffs, the township of Sombra, were awarded no pecuniary damages by the original decree against which they have not appealed, they have a substantial interest in maintaining their right to the mandamus awarded by the original decree which entitles them to our judgment upon that question. It has been established by the original judgment in the case and, in my opinion, upon abundant evidence that the drainage work for constructing which the by-law was passed never was, in point of fact, completed as required by the by-law. The municipality of the township of Sombra were, and it is unnecessary to say that the plaintiff Murphy also was, entitled to an adjudication to that effect, and the township of Sombra, therefore, on this appeal are entitled to have the original judgment restored in so far as it awarded a mandamus or mandatory injunction requiring the municipality of the township of Chatham to complete the drain as originally designed and in the manner required by the by-law. To that relief they are, in my opinion, entitled, wholly irrespective of section 583 of the Municipal Institutions Act, under the provisions of the Ontario Judicature Act, ch. 44 R.S.O. 1887. The original decree, however, further adjudged that the plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration that the work of completing the drain should be executed at the proper cost and charges of the defendants and not at the cost and charges of those of the ratepayers who had already, by special assessment, contributed funds sufficient to have completed it. This portion of the decree is based upon a declaration contained in the decree that the amount for which those parties were assessed was sufficient to complete the work as directed by the by-law. This declaration or finding of the learned judge who tried the case does not appear to me to have been warranted by the issues or the evidence thereon in the action. On the contrary, the fact that the original contractor for the work who had entered into a contract to complete the work as originally designed within the original estimates as required by the by-law abandoned his contract, and that the engineer could get no other contractor to undertake the work on like terms, and that the engineer felt himself compelled to proceed with the construction of the work in the imperfect and unauthorized manner in which it was proceeded with, can, I think, be explained only upon the assumption that the original estimate of the cost of the work was insufficient. Now, the only authority that I can see in the act for charging monies necessary to complete a drainage work undertaken under a by-law, and left in an unfinished state, upon the parties originally assessed for the work is under section 573 chapter 184 R.S.O., 1887, namely, in the case of the original assessment proving insufficient for that purpose. I do not think that the defendants should be precluded by a judgment rendered in the present case, as they might be if that portion of the original decree should be left to stand, from showing their right if they can to act under said section 573.\nThe original decree must also be varied now as to the time within which the defendants were required to do the work, and the defendants should be left unfettered as to any right they may have under the acts relating to drainage works to raise the funds necessary to complete the work. In so far as the mandamus is concerned the decree should simply direct a mandatory injunction to issue requiring the defendants to complete the drain to the width and depth and in the manner provided for by the plan and specifications adopted by the by-law upon which the said work was undertaken, or to provide some substitution therefor under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, reserving leave to the plaintiffs to apply to the court for such other relief as in case of neglect or delay, or otherwise upon the part of the defendants as occasion may require; the decree should be varied by striking out the paragraphs numbered 3 and 5 and being so varied the appeal should be allowed with costs and the decree of Mr. Justice Robertson affirmed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The learned judge who tried this action awarded to the plaintiff Murphy $150 damages, and ordered, on the prayer of the two plaintiffs, the municipality and Murphy, that the defendant municipality should proceed to complete the Whitebread drain.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the latter part of the judgment leaving the award of damages undisturbed. The plaintiffs join in appealing to this court and ask to have the order for the completion of the drain restored.\nThere is room for difference of opinion as to whether the Court of Appeal was so clearly wrong in disallowing the order as to make it proper for us to interfere with the judgment of that court in view of all the circumstances of the case, but it is manifest that if the order of the trial judge is to be restored it must undergo important variations.\nMy brother Gwynne has, in his careful examination of the case, given reasons for expunging from the order all reference to the manner in which and the persons from whom the money to pay for the work ordered to be done is to be raised, leaving the council quite untrammelled by any direction from the court upon that point. I agree with that conclusion.\nThen, considering that the duty to be enforced is only that which arose under the proceedings taken in 1880 and 1881 which resulted in the making of the by-law, we must be careful not to enlarge that duty by the order which we sanction. That would seem to be done, however, by the order of the High Court which after directing the completion of the drain \u201cto the width and depth and in the manner provided for by the plan and specifications upon which the work was undertaken,\u201d adds \u201cand with proper and sufficient outlets at both ends thereof to carry off all the water which enters the same from time to time.\u201d\nIf the plan and specifications or the by-law provide for this well and good.\nThey speak for themselves and the amplification is unnecessary.\nWe cannot say and are not called upon judicially to decide that it is possible, having regard to the levels of the lands and rivers, to make outlets sufficient to carry off, by way of those rivers, all the water the drain was originally designed to carry off. Much less can we say so with respect to all the waters that may from time to time enter the drain. This excessive mandate must be corrected.\nThere is a complaint against the township of Sombra, pleaded by way of counter claim, for sending into the Whitebread drain by means of new drains in that township more water than the drain was originally intended to receive. I do not think there was any finding at the trial respecting the facts on which the complaint was founded, but we have in evidence a formal protest by the council of Chatham by resolution passed in May, 1887, on the subject, and there is also a report made by Mr. McGeorge, the engineer, in November, 1887, to the council of Chatham, stating that excessive quantities of water were being sent down from the higher township by numerous drains.\nThe order as it was made at the trial requires a sufficient outlet for all these waters and is in that respect entirely unwarranted.\nFor my own part I should prefer to leave the judgment of the Court of Appeal undisturbed, and to allow the appellants to work out their object by a regular notice to repair and proceedings upon it under section 583, or by any other machinery available under the statute. It may be true, and I assume in deference to the opinions of my learned brothers that it is true, that the drain was never completed in full accordance with the original design. That the evidence is capable of being differently understood has been shown in the court below, particularly by Mr. Justice Maclennan. But the council of Chatham having adopted, in January, 1887, the report of Mr. McGeorge, who certified that the work was complete, could not allege the non-completion of the work in bar of the application of section 583. \u201cRepair,\u201d under that section, includes deepening or widening in order to fit a drain to do the work it was originally intended to do.\nIt is now more than eleven years since the work was initiated. The action was not commenced until nearly six years after the date first fixed for the completion of the work. If the work had been promptly completed it would, in the natural course of things, have required repair by this time, and all the more so if the additional waters from Sombra helped to injure the embankment and to silt up the waterway. To put the drain now into the state it should have been in ten or eleven years ago will combine repairing with construction. The order now in question is not a mandamus such as, in cases under section 583, becomes, under proper conditions, claimable as of right.\nIt is one that is more in the discretion of the court to grant or refuse in view of all the circumstances, and I cannot say that, under all the circumstances, the decision of the court ought to have been different.\nThe order as originally made, freeing the appellants from liability to special assessment, was obviously better worth insisting upon than when shorn of that feature and with the question of the assessment left at large. I am not sure that the appellants will be better off with the order in the shape it is now to take than if left to work out their object under such provisions of the statute as may apply to the case, nor am I entirely free from doubt as to the proprietry of bringing an action like the present, or quite prepared to hold, what the judgment seems to involve, that a council can be compelled to carry out, without alterations, the plans and specifications on which a drainage work may be launched. My doubt as to the propriety of proceeding by action is partly suggested by subsection 16 of section 569, which declares that the provisions of that section shall be deemed to extend to the re-execution or completion of any works which have been executed or have been partly or insufficiently executed under any provision of any act of the Legislature of Ontario (as this case was) or of the Parliament of the Province of Canada.\nBut while I should prefer to do as the Court of Appeal decided to do, and leave the appellants to such remedies as the act affords them, I am not so clear about those remedies as to feel warranted in formally dissenting from the judgment of the court.\nThe proceedings referred to in subsection 16 of section 569 would apparently be proceedings at the instance of the Chatham people, not those of Sombra, and so would the action, if any, taken under section 573 to raise more money for the completion of the drain. The amendment of section 583 by 52 Vic. ch. 36 s. 35 does not aid the appellants or give them any better remedy under that section, while, curiously enough, the duty of Chatham to maintain and repair the drain, which depends on section 583, does not seem beyond dispute. The drain is not in either of the municipalities but on the road between them. The right to make a ditch in that position is given, and the liability to pay for it is provided for, by section 596. Then, by section 597, the chain of sections from 569 to 632 apply, as far as applicable, to it; but the duty of any municipality, under section 583, to maintain is confined to works within its own limits.\nI agree without any hesitation in the variations of the original order proposed by his lordship the Chief Justice, and I also concur, though with hesitation, in allowing the appeal.\nThe cross appeal against the damages awarded to Murphy should, I think, be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gurd & Kittermaster.\nSolicitor for respondent: Charles E.

The rest of the policy was applicable to insurance on the ship only. L. & Co. were managing owners who had expended considerable money in repairs on the vessel. In an action on the policy the insurers claimed that the insurance was on advances by the owners which was not insurable.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the instrument must, if possible, be construed as valid and effectual and to do so the words \"on advances\" might be treated as surplusage or as merely a reference to the inducement which led the owners to insure the ship.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action in this case was upon a policy of marine insurance which contained the following as the subject matter of the insurance: \"William Law & Co., on account of owners, in case of loss to be paid to William Law & Co., do make insurance and cause to be insured, lost or not lost, the sum of two thousand dollars on advances upon the body, tackle, apparel and other furniture of the good barque Lizzie Perry, etc. The only question involved in the appeal was as to the nature of the insurance effected owing to the use of the words \"on advances,\" the insured being the owners of the vessel and the object of the insurance being to cover monies expended by them. The trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs and his decision was affirmed by the judges of the full court being equally divided on an appeal to that court. The judgments against the company proceeded on the ground that the insurance was really on the ship itself.\nHenry Q.C., for the appellants, referred to Lowndes on Insurance[1].\nBorden Q.C. for the respondents, cited Williams v. Roger Williams Insurance Co.[2]; Insurance Co. v. Baring[3]; Hooper v. Robinson[4].\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an action upon a policy of marine assurance bearing date the 28th October, 1887, for the sum of $2,000 effected by the respondents with the appellants. The respondents were owners of the barque Lizzie Perry. The two first clauses of the policy are in the following words:\u2014\nWilliam Law & Co., on account of owners in case of loss to be paid to William Law & Co. do make insurance and cause to be insured, lost or not lost, the sum of two thousand dollars on advances upon the body, tackle, apparel, and other furniture of the good barque Lizzie Perry, whereof \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 is master for the present voyage, or whoever else shall go for master in the said vessel, or by whatever other name or names the said vessel, or the master thereof, is or shall be called.\nBeginning the adventure upon the said vessel, tackle and apparel, at and from Port Eads to Buenos Ayres against the risk of total loss of vessel only. The remainder of the policy, which is a printed form with the blanks filled in, is applicable to an insurance on the ship and on the ship only.\nThe vessel was totally lost on the voyage from Port Eads to Buenos Ayres.\nThe appellants by the 8th, 10th and 11th paragraphs of their statement of defence set up that the policy was not on the ship but on advances made by the insured (who were the owners) to the ship, and that such advances were not insurable and the policy was therefore void. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Meagher without a jury, who gave judgment for the respondents. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court in banc the learned judges who heard the appeal were equally divided in opinion. Weatherbe and Townshend JJ. agreed with Mr. Justice Meagher that the respondents were entitled to recover, whilst the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Ritchie were of a contrary opinion. The appeal was therefore dismissed.\nThe difficulty in the construction of the policy is caused by the two words \"on advances\" in the first clause of the policy before set out. This is the only reference to \"advances\" contained in the policy. Each of the learned judges before whom the cause came in the courts below delivered a written judgment in which their different views are very ably presented. The majority, whose opinion prevailed, base their judgments on the argument that the words \"on advances\" when read in conjunction with the context and the rest of the policy and in the light of the surrounding circumstances as disclosed in the evidence, were so repugnant to the other parts of the instrument that they either ought to be rejected, or to be construed as indicating something different from their ordinary primary meaning. I am of opinion that this was the correct conclusion. The well established rule of construction applicable to all deeds and written instruments, and especially to policies of marine insurance which are mercantile deeds not prepared by lawyers, is that they should be so interpreted, if possible, as to be valid and effectual and not in such a way as to be void. An insurance upon advances made by the owners to their own ship would, of course, be a nullity, and such a policy would necessarily be void if strictly construed. What ever may be the terms used in mercantile bookkeeping and generally by commercial men it is, in a legal point of view, not merely inaccurate but absurd to speak of the owner of a ship making advances to his own chattel. Therefore, to construe this policy as the appellants invite us to do as an attempt to insure that which never was nor could be insurable, and which could never by itself give rise to an insurable interest, namely, as an insurance of money expended in repairing and refitting the vessel, would be to declare that the policy which the appellants granted, and for which the respondents paid a premium, was an instrument upon its face void ab initio. Before we can do this we must be sure that no way is open by which such a result can be avoided. I think there is really no difficulty in doing this. Throughout the subsequent part of the policy the insurance is treated as one upon the ship herself and not upon any special or limited interest in her. In the second clause, before set forth, it is expressly said that the \"adventure,\" that is the insurance contract embodied in the policy, is \"upon the said vessel, tackle and apparel, at and from Port Eads to Buenos Ayres against the risk of total loss of vessel only,\" and all the usual provisions contained in a voyage policy upon the vessel are to be found in the instrument. It is true that these clauses are in a printed form and that the words \"on advances\" are in writing, but I do not consider that this circumstance, which, no doubt, has weight in some questions of construction, is sufficient here to warrant us in treating the policy as absolutely void as it would be if it is to be considered as an insurance of advances only. Then there are two ways of avoiding such a result. First, we may, to use the words in which Mr. Justice Weatherbe has expressed himself in his clear and forcible judgment, say: \"There is no such thing as advances by owners on their own ship and in the light of the circumstances shewn by the evidence the words 'on advances' may, if necessary, be expunged from the policy.\" Or we may read those words in a secondary way as mere immaterial words of reference to the inducement which led the owners to effect the insurance, as indicating that all they meant by those words was that having advanced or expended money upon the ship in repairing or refitting her they were, therefore, led to make the insurance in order that the enhancement in value of the vessel caused by such expenditure might be covered by insurance. By reading the words \"on advances\" as if in a parenthesis, there can, it appears to me, be no difficulty in adopting this construction. Or (and this is the view which I am inclined to think the more correct one) we may treat the policy as its language requires us to do as an insurance on the ship, and then read the words \"on advances\" as intended to indicate a special interest which the assured supposed they had entitling them to insure the ship, and not as limiting the insurance to the advances; read in this way they would be immaterial and irrelevant since their interest as owners of course entitled them to insure. If, however, none of these constructions were admissible, there would be no alternative, if we are to give effect to the rule res magis valeat quam pereat at all, but to reject the words in question altogether as being repugnant to the other parts of the policy and at variance with the clear intent of the parties to insure the ship and the ship only, which is apparent therefrom.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing this judgment I have been referred to the case of Providence Washington Insurance Co. v. Bowring[5] decided in February last by the United States Circuit Court of Appeal for the second Circuit, in which the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the present case was cited. Judge Wallace, in his judgment in the case referred to, points out the distinction between the two cases; and the learned judge's concluding observations entirely confirm the opinion I have stated in the present judgment.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014If the word \"advances\" as used in the policy be construed in the limited technical sense insisted upon by the learned counsel for the appellants then the policy was, in point of law, null and void from the beginning. We must impute to the parties knowledge of the law affecting the matter with which they were dealing, and it must follow as a necessary consequence that we must impute to them the intention, to the respondents to pay, and to the appellants to receive a sum of money by way of premium or consideration for the latter's entering into a contract of insurance with the former which both parties knew to be null and void. To avoid such a conclusion we must seek for some other explanation for the word \"advances\" being inserted in the policy than that insisted upon by the appellants, and the question simply appears to be whether that suggested by the learned counsel for the respondent can be accepted, namely, that the relation of both parties to the contract was to insure the vessel on account of the owners as is expressed in the policy, but to the amount only of $2,000 as part of a larger amount paid by the respondents, who were part owners, for advances made by them in payment of repairs on the vessel, such amount being by the policy made payable to the respondents in case of loss. Ut res magis valeat quam pereat. I think we may accept this explanation and hold the policy to be a valid policy upon the vessel and that the word \"advances\" was used unadvisedly, unguardedly, and not at all with the intention of its being taken in the sense now insisted upon by the appellants for the purpose of making their contract void. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The appellant company has not, in my opinion, shown any good reason for disturbing the judgment of the court below. The construction which we are asked to put upon the policy would not bring it into accord with any precedent cited to us, or with any recognized meaning of the word \"advances,\" as far as I can gather from the treatises on the subject of Marine Insurance, while it would be contrary to what the evidence satifies me was the real intention and understanding of the persons concerned in making the contract. The oral evidence is that of William Law alone, which I must say is expressed in several of his statements in terms that may seem to favour the contention of the appellants if the surrounding circumstances, and the facts appearing from documents and formal admissions, are not kept in view. The writers on insurance point out that the old printed form of policy which is adhered to by underwriters was framed for insurance on goods and on the hull, tackle, &c., of the ship, and that when freight, profits or other interests are to be insured they resort to the expedient of writing in the body, at the foot, or on the margin of the policy a statement of the real nature of the subject matter intended to be insured, (as e.g. \"on profits,\" \"on freight,\" \"on bottomry,\" \"on 100 bales of cotton marked, &c.\") leaving the printed clause entirely unaltered. I take this language from Arnould on Marine Insurance[6], where it is added:\nThe written words thus inserted in the body, margin, or at the foot of the policy apply indefinitely to the whole instrument, and are considered as controlling the sense of the general printed clause applicable to ship and goods, and narrowing it in point of construction to the particular species of interest whether \"ship,\" \"goods,\" \"freight,\" \"profits,\" &c., the name of which is so inserted.\nThis being so, we are not assisted in ascertaining the force of the words \"on advances,\" in this policy by the circumstance to which Mr. Borden called attention that the word \"advances\" does not again occur, the ship alone being mentioned in the other clauses of the instrument.\nA remark made by the learned Chief Justice in the court below to the effect that the words \"advance\" and \"advances\" are of frequent occurrence in insurance contracts, and have well defined meanings in insurance law, must, in my judgment, be taken with a slight qualification. I do not find the word used by itself as it is in this contract, though such an expression as \"advances on freight\" or \"advances on bottomry\" may now and then be found in insurance contracts, though when bottomry is insured it is more usual to find that term without the word \"advances.\" The word \"advances\" in such situations as these is not ambiguous. It is obviously used in its ordinary meaning of money lent, and I find no authority for saying that in insurance contracts or with regard to insurance law it has any peculiar significance, or that it has the character of a technical term. The four cases noted by the learned Chief Justice certainly afford no such authority. In one of them in Palmer v. Pratt[7] the subject of the insurance was two bills of exchange. Another case Briggs v. Merchant Traders Assn.[8] related to salvage and general average, and another Simonds v. Hodgson[9] to an insurance on bottomry. In the fourth Manfield v. Maitland[10] the insurance was declared to be on a bill of exchange drawn by the master on the charterers. In none of the cases did the word \"advances\" occur in the policy. It is used in the discussion of the bills of exchange in the first case and in the fourth, the two bills in the first case having been given by the captain for money lent to him\u2014or \"advances\"\u2014to buy goods with, and the bill in the fourth case representing advances on freight. The cases are examples of discussion of the description of the subject of the insurance as written in the policy, but as explained by the details of the transaction. They do not in any more direct way touch the present questions.\nWe have to construe this policy in accordance with the rules applicable to written instruments in general.\n\"Such\" said Lord Ellenborough in Robertson v. French[11] as apply to all other instruments apply equally to this, viz., that it is to be construed according to its sense and meaning; that the terms of it are to be understood in their plain, ordinary and popular acceptation, unless by the known usage of trade they have acquired some peculiar and appropriate meaning, or unless the context evidently shows that they must, in the particular instance, and to effectuate the manifest intention of the parties, be understood in some other special and peculiar sense.\nBY THE BRITISH AMERICA ASSURANCE COMPANY.\nWilliam Law & Co., on account of owners, in case of loss to be paid to William Law & Co., do make insurance, and cause to be insured, lost or not lost, the sum of two thousand dollars, on advances upon the body, tackle, apparel and other furniture of the good barque Lizzie Perry.\nHere we have the words \"on advances\" in writing, and we have the printed words of the form \"upon the body,\" etc. The term \"on advances,\" by itself, is an incomplete expression and very indefinite. If read with the following words:\nOn advances upon the body, tackle, apparel and other furniture of the good barque Lizzie Perry\u2014\nit makes an intelligible sentence and imports a loan on the security of the ship which ought to create in the lender an insurable interest. There are reasons, however, for not so reading the document, and some of those reasons are furnished by the context. From the context it appears that the insurance is on account of the owners of the vessel, and is effected by William Law & Co., to whom, in case of loss, the insurance money is to be paid. We learn from other evidence that the persons trading under the firm of William Law & Co. were among the owners of the vessel and were the managing owners. We learn further that several owners had insurances on their respective shares in the vessel, amounting together to something over $20,000, and that Law & Co. had, on behalf of all the owners, expended $6,000 or thereabouts in connection with the vessel, the firm obtaining the money from the bank and being liable for it to the bank, but raising it, as Mr. Law says, \"on the credit of the vessel and the owners\" whatever the exact meaning of that may be. Four thousand dollars and upwards, out of the $6,000, was expended in repairs upon the vessel. The insurance of $2,000 was in respect of these moneys which are what the policy designates as \"advances.\" The premium for that insurance was $40 and was contributed, or refunded to Law & Co., by all the owners ratably according to their proportionate interests in the vessel, the owners who had not previously insured their individual shares being interested with the others in this joint insurance and paying their share of the premium. They would, of course, be interested in the insurance money in case of loss in the proportion of their respective shares in the vessel, and in the meantime those shares were enhanced in value by the expenditure in the same ratio.\nThe word \"advances\" requiring, as we have seen, some added word to give it a definite meaning what can it reasonably be supposed to have in this instance conveyed to the underwriters? The owners on whose account the insurance is effected cannot have been understood to say that they have lent money which is to be repaid to them in money, as advances on freight by a stranger or a loan on bottomry is to be repaid.\nIn the cases referred 1o, such as Palmer v. Pratt[12], or Manfield v. Maitland[13], or others of that class, where a loan of money for purposes connected with a vessel or her cargo or freight was held not to create an insurable interest, that result followed from the loan resting on the personal credit of the borrower.\nHere we have no lender or borrower, as we might have had if the bank that advanced the money to pay the disbursements had assumed to effect the insurance. We have simply the owners insuring their own property. The occurrence of the word \"advances\" may be accounted for by the history of the transaction. It is not a well chosen word and does not serve any purpose in connection with the contract, yet it is not entirely inapt as a concise allusion to, the reason for effecting this joint insurance by or for the owners who had not joined in the insurances previously effected. There is no legal or technical force in the word, nor is there a suggestion that the underwriters were misled by it, to require us to treat it as describing the subject of the insurance. On the other hand it is impossible to assign to it, when read with the context, any meaning which the underwriters can be supposed to have attached to it, and which, if not descriptive of an interest in the vessel, would describe any other subject of insurance.\nI agree with the learned judges in the courts below who held that the insurance is upon the ship, and am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henry, Harris & Henry.\nSolicitors for respondents: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\n[1] 2 ed. p. 19.\n[2] 107 Mass. 377.\n[3] 20 Wall. 159.\n[4] 98 U.S.R. 528.\n[5] 50 Fed.

S. 5th ser. c. 84 s. 21\u2014Registered judgment\u2014Priority\u2014Mortgage\u2014Rectification of mistake.\nBy R. S. N. S. 5th ser. c. 84, s. 21, a registered judgment binds the lands of the judgment debtor, whether acquired before or after such registry, as effectually as a mortgage; and deeds or mortgages of such lands, duly executed but not registered, are void against the judgment creditor who first registers his judgment.\nA mortgage of land was made, by mistake and inadvertence, for one-sixth of the mortgagor's interest instead of the whole. The mortgage was foreclosed and the land sold. Before the foreclosure judgment was registered against the mortgagor and two years after an execution was issued and an attempt made to levy on the five-sixths of the land not included in said mortgage. In an action for rectification of the mortgage and an injunction to restrain the judgment creditor from so levying.\nHeld,\u2014affirming the judgment of the court below, Strong and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that as to the said five-sixths of the land the plaintiff had only an unregistered agreement for a mortgage which, by the statute, was void as against the registered judgment of the creditor. Grindley v. Blakie (19 N. S. Rep. 27), approved and followed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nOn the 1st day of September, 1878, the respondent, Johanna Duggan, executed to the appellants two mortgages to secure the sum of $20,000, which was then due and owing by her to them. The time for payment was extended by the mortgage and the rate of interest was reduced.\nOne of the properties which the said Johanna Duggan had agreed to so mortgage had been conveyed to her late husband, through whom she claimed, by four different deeds. Three of these deeds conveyed each a one undivided sixth interest in that lot of land, and the fourth deed conveyed a one-half interest. The conveyancer who prepared the mortgages had before him one of the deeds which conveyed a one-sixth interest in this lot. By mistake and from inadvertence a one-sixth interest in that lot instead of the entire interest therein was described in and conveyed by the mortgage. Neither Johanna Duggan nor the appellants knew of the mistake until after the mortgage had been foreclosed in 1887.\nOn the 3rd day of December, 1887, the property was sold under foreclosure, and by sheriff's deed bearing that date the lands and premises covered by the mortgages were conveyed to the appellants. On the 27th September, 1887, the respondent, Charles Cogswell, recovered judgment upon a mortgage bond against Johanna Duggan, and the said judgment was on the same day duly recorded in the office of the registry of deeds at Halifax. On the 3rd of July, 1889, the said Charles Cogswell caused to be issued out of the Supreme Court upon the said judgment a writ of execution, whereby the sheriff was commanded to levy on the real property of the said defendant, Johanna Duggan. Under the said execution and the instructions thereon endorsed the sheriff of the County of Halifax attempted to levy upon five undivided sixth parts of the lot already mentioned. On the 3rd of July, 1839, the said sheriff, by the direction of the said respondent Charles Cogswell, advertised the said five undivided sixth parts for sale at public auction. Thereupon this action was brought to have the mortgage rectified, and to restrain the said Charles Cogswell from levying upon or selling the said undivided sixth parts.\nThe Chief Justice, before whom the action was tried, gave judgment in favour of the defendants upon the ground that the defendant, Charles Cogswell, had by the registry of his judgment acquired a legal lien upon these lands at the date of such registry.\nThe plaintiffs appealed and the appeal was heard before the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Weatherbe and Mr. Justice Townshend. Mr. Justice Townshend delivered a judgment dismissing the appeal, which was concurred in by the Chief Justice. Mr. Justice Weatherbe delivered a dissenting judgment.\nFrom this judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the present appeal is taken.\nBorden Q.C. for the appellants referred to Eyre v. McDowell[1]; Kinderley v. Jervis[2]; Barrow v. Barrow[3]; Murray v. Parker[4]; In re Boulter[5]; Kerr on Frauds[6].\nRoss Q.C. for the respondents relied on Grindley v. Blakie[7] and Ross v. Hunter[8].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The statute upon which this case depends is chapter 84 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series, the material sections of which are the following:\u2014\nBy section 8 of the said act it is enacted as follows:\nAll deeds, judgments and attachments affecting lands shall be registered in the office of the county or district in which the lands lie.\nSection 18 of said act enacts as follows: Deeds or mortgages of lands, duly executed but not registered, shall be void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration who shall first register his deed or mortgage of such lands.\nSection 21 of said act enacts as follows:\nA judgment, duly recovered and docketed, shall bind the lands of the party against whom the judgment shall have passed, from and after the registry thereof in the county or district wherein the lands are situate, as effectually as a mortgage, whether such lands shall have been acquired before or after the registering of such judgment; and deeds or mortgages of such lands, duly executed but not registered, shall be void against the judgment creditor who shall first register his judgment.\nIf a mortgage of these five undivided sixth parts of this land had been actually given, but not registered, can it be contended that the registered judgment would not cut out such unregistered mortgage? That it would is abundantly clear from the express words of chapter 84, section 21, which I have just read. If so, in what better position is a party who has no mortgage but merely an unregistered agreement to give a mortgage, than a party with an actual unregistered mortgage? In this last case Mrs. Duggan was at the time of the registration of this judgment at law the legal owner of these five-sixths; in the former she had parted with both the legal and equitable estate. The statute has declared the deed void against the judgment creditor. Does not the voiding of the deed, as against the judgment creditor, leave the property in the judgment debtor as if the deed had never been made? The difference between the English and Irish statutes and the statute of Nova Scotia is most material, as the former do not declare the deed void as the latter does. I cannot conceive how the court could have held differently from what they did in Grindley v. Blakie[9] which decision they have followed in this case, unless they read out of the statute the 22nd section of ch. 79 R. S. 4th series, under which the question in that case arose.\nIt seems to me to be reducing the Registry statute to an absurdity to say the legislature could have intended that a mortgage, duly executed but not recorded, should be void as against a judgment creditor whose judgment is duly recorded, and that a mere parol agreement not recorded to give a mortgage should have priority over the duly recorded judgment, thereby giving greater effect to a mere parol unrecorded promise to give a mortgage than to the unrecorded mortgage itself: such a result the legislature could, in my opinion, never have contemplated.\nUnder these circumstances I think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia quite right and this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts of this case are few and simple and are not seriously in dispute. The single question which has been argued before this court is one relating to the proper legal construction of the 21st section of the Nova Scotia Registry Act, chapter 84 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (5th series).\nOn the 1st of September, 1878, the respondent Johanna Duggan executed in favour of the appellants two mortgages to secure the sum of $20,000, the amount of a debt then due by her to them. These mortgages were so executed in pursuance of an agreement contained in a letter dated the 8th of July, 1878, written by Johanna Duggan to one of the appellants. The original letter has been lost, or destroyed, but it was satisfactorily proved by secondary evidence consisting of an examined copy of the letter. A proper foundation for the reception of this secondary evidence was established By proof of searches for the original letter. In this letter Mrs. Duggan wrote as follows:\u2014\nIn order to set your mind at rest I will give you a mortgage on my property at Mount Pleasant for \u00a33,000, the property is worth \u00a310,000, and a mortgage on my town property that I occupy for \u00a32,000.\nThe Mount Pleasant property referred to in the letter and which Mrs. Duggan agreed to mortgage had been conveyed to her late husband, whose devisee she was, by four different purchase deeds. One of these deeds conveyed a one-half undivided interest in the property, and the other three deeds conveyed each a one-sixth undivided interest in the same parcel of land. The conveyancer who prepared the mortgages having these deeds before him by mistake and inadvertence took the description contained in the mortgage deed from one of the conveyances of a one-sixth undivided interest, instead of comprising the whole property in the mortgage as it was agreed by the letter referred to, and as it was the intention of all parties, should have been done. This mistake is clearly proved by indisputable evidence. It is proved hot only by the letter referred to, but also by the testimony of Mrs. Duggan herself and by Mr. Justice Ritchie, who at the time of the execution of the mortgages was practising at the bar and as a solicitor, and who acted in the transaction as the solicitor of the appellants; by Mr. Justice Meagher who was also then in practice and who acted in the matter as the solicitor for the mortgagor, Mrs. Duggan; and by Mr. John Doull, who was the agent at Halifax of the appellants, a mercantile firm whose principal business establishment was in England. It is further proved that neither Mrs. Duggan nor the appellants discovered the mistake until some time after the mortgage had been foreclosed in 1887. On the 3rd December, 1887, the property was sold according to the practice prevailing in Nova Scotia by the sheriff under a foreclosure degree and was purchased by the appellants, and by the sheriff's deed bearing that date all the mortgagor's right, title and interest in the lands and premises comprised in the mortgages were conveyed by the sheriff to the appellants. This sale did not produce enough to satisfy the mortgages upon which a considerable balance still remains due.\nOn the 27th September, 1887, the respondent Charles Cogswell recovered a judgment upon a mortgage bond against Johanna Duggan, which judgment was upon the same day duly registered in the office of the registry of deeds at Halifax. On the 3rd of July, 1889, the respondent Cogswell caused a writ of execution to be issued upon his judgment whereby the sheriff was commanded to levy upon the real property of the respondent Johanna Duggan. Under this execution, and pursuant to the instructions of the execution creditor thereon indorsed, the sheriff of Halifax attempted to levy on the five undivided sixth parts of the Mount Pleasant property which had as before mentioned been intended to have been included in the mortgage to the appellants, but which had been inadvertently omitted therefrom by the error of the conveyancer. On the 3rd July, 1889, the sheriff, by the direction of the respondent Charles Cogswell advertised these five undivided sixth parts, upon which he had been directed to levy, for sale under Cogswell's execution. Thereupon, and on the 5th of August, 1889, the present action was brought for the purpose of having the mortgage deed rectified and for an injunction restraining the respondent Cogswell from proceeding to sell under his execution. The respondent Cogswell by his answer put the appellants to proof of their case, and pleaded the Statute of Frauds.\nThe respondent Johanna Duggan, and the respondent Patrick. Duggan who claimed as her assignee under a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, did not dispute the appellants' allegations and set up no defence to the action.\nThe cause was tried before the Chief Justice who gave judgment dismissing the action.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banc. This appeal was dismissed, a majority of the court, composed of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Townshend, giving judgment for the respondent, whilst the third judge, Mr. Justice Weatherbe, was of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to relief, and therefore dissented from the judgment of the court.\nFrom this judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the present appeal has been taken.\nThere can be no doubt that as between the appellants and Johanna Duggan, the mortgagor, the appellants would have been entitled to the relief prayed; the proof of the mistake did not depend on mere oral evidence but was clearly established by the informal agreement to give the mortgage contained in the letter of the 8th of July, 1878, written by Mrs. Duggan to the appellants, which was supplemented by the oral evidence of Mrs. Duggan, and also by that of Mr. Justice Ritchie, Mr. Justice Meagher and Mr. Doull, showing how the mistake occurred. The contention of the respondent Cogswell is that the appellants are not entitled to enforce this equity against him, claiming as he does as an execution creditor under an execution issued upon a judgment, which had been duly registered pursuant to the 21st section of chapter 84 Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (5th series). In other words that this equity, even though it may have been an equity clearly enforceable against Mrs. Duggan, was cut out and annulled by the force of the registry law.\nThe statutory enactments material to be considered and upon which the decision of the appeal must depend are the following. Section 21 of the Revised Statutes chapter 84, (5th series) enacts that:\u2014\nA judgment duly recovered and docketed shall bind the lands of the party against whom the judgment shall have passed from and after the registry thereof in the county or district wherein the lands are situate as effectually as a mortgage, whether such lands shall have been acquired before or after the registering of such judgment; and deeds or mortgages of such lands, duly executed but not registered, shall be void against the judgment creditor who shall first register his judgment.\nSection 1 of chapter 124 of the same series, entitled \"of the sale of lands under execution\" provides that:\nAny judgment recovered in the Supreme or County Courts, any final decree of the Supreme Court, in any matter or suit requiring payment of money by either party, shall bind the real estate of the debtor from the time said judgment or decree shall be recorded in the books of registry for the county or district wherein such real estate is situate, and the release from a judgment or decree of part of any lands or hereditaments charged therewith, shall not affect the validity of the judgment or decree as to the lands or hereditaments remaining unreleased, or as to any other property not specifically released, without prejudice nevertheless to the rights of all persons interested in the lands, hereditaments or property remaining unreleased, and not concurring in or confirming the release, provided that no lands shall be levied upon until one year after the registry of the judgment or decree as aforesaid.\nSection 6 of the same act is as follows:\u2014\nA judgment recorded shall bind the interest of any party or corporation benefically interested in lands held in trust for him or for said corporation, and the same may be taken in execution for the payment of his debts, or the debts of said corporation, in the same manner as if the said party or corporation were seized or possessed of such lands.\nSection 12 provides for the sale by the sheriff of lands seized under execution, and section 13 requires the sheriff first to sell such portion of the lands seized as the execution creditor may require him to sell. Section 14 of the same act enacts that:\nThe sheriff shall deliver to the purchaser, or his agent or nominee, a deed of such lands, which shall be sufficient to convey to the purchaser all the interest of the execution debtor in the lands therein described, whether situate in his bailiwick or in an adjacent county, as hereinafter mentioned, subject to prior incumbrances.\nThe court below have held that the appellants' equity to have their mortgage reformed as claimed in the action so as to make it comprise the whole of the Mount Pleasant property which Johanna Duggan agreed to mortgage to them instead of a mere undivided one sixth part was cut out and avoided by the registry of the respondent's judgment by force of that part of section 21 of chapter 84 which says that \"deeds or mortgages of such lands duly executed but not registered shall be void against the judgment creditor who shall first render his judgment.\"\nIn so deciding the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia followed its previous decision in the case of Grindley v. Blakie[10], in which case Mr. Justice Weatherbe also dissented from the judgment of the court. In an unreported case of Miller v. McKeen the same question arose. That case was heard before Sir John Thompson, then a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. In this case of Miller v. McKeen the facts were as follow:\nLands purchased with partnership monies and for partnership purposes had been conveyed by a deed made to one partner only. Judgment was afterwards recovered against him but not against the other partner. The partnership was dissolved and was wound up in a suit brought for that purpose. It was contended that the entire interest in these lands was bound by the registration of the judgment, and that the individual creditors of the judgment debtor were entitled to the entire proceeds of those lands which had been sold under an order of the court, all persons interested being parties to the suit. Mr. Justice Thompson in giving judgment used the following language:\nFinally, I have to deal with the contention that the attachment and judgment creditors are entitled to liens on all lands standing in the name of George McKeen, irrespective of the rights of plaintiff, or of the partnership creditors, by virtue of sec. 22 of ch. 79 R. S., 4th series, \"Of the registry of deeds and encumbrances affecting lands.\" That section reads: \"A judgment duly recovered and docketed shall bind the lands of the party against whom judgment shall have passed, from and after the registry thereof * * * as effectually as a mortgage,\" &c., &c. My reading of this section is that the judgment creditor can only take the interest which the judgment debtor had. The lands which the judgment binds are lands of and belonging to the judgment debtor, and the judgment is to bind as effectually as a mortgage which the debtor might have a right to make. I cannot treat the judgment as being as effectual as a mortgage made in fraudulent disregard of the rights of others in the lands, and taken by a mortgagee without notice. I cannot suppose that the legislature meant to take away the rights of those who are not parties to the judgment or to confer on the creditor, by the involuntary lien, a larger right than he could get by any voluntary lien which the debtor could lawfully give.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, for reasons the same as those which are given in the judgments of Mr. Justice Weatherbe in the present case and in Grindley v. Blakie, and by Mr. Justice Thompson in Miller v. McKeen.\nIt has always been considered that a judgment creditor stands in a different and less advantageous position than a purchaser acquiring title without notice of the prior equitable interest of a third party. In England judgments were originally not a specific lien on the lands of the debtor at all, but bound them for the purpose of an elegit under the Statute of Westminster. Subsequently under the statute of 4 & 5 W. & M. ch. 20, it was required in order to have even this effect of binding lands as regards subsequent purchasers that the judgment should be docketed. Whilst this was the state of the law it was held that the elegit creditor could only take subject to the outstanding equities of third persons which had been acquired anterior to the docketing of the judgment[11]. In Benham v. Keane[12].\nWood V.C. says:\u2014\nThe first thing to be considered is the exact extent of the rights of a judgment creditor irrespective of the Act 1 and 2 Vic., ch. 110. In order to give him any right against land, the primary requisite is that the land sought to be affected should be the property of the debtor, and accordingly one of the earliest questions which arose was, what was the position of a judgment creditor with respect to lands which the debtor had alienated by a contract effectual in equity, but not perfected at law? As to this it was settled by an early decision, Finch v. The Earl of Winchelsea (1), that the judgment creditor takes nothing. The court will restrain proceedings against the legal ownership at the suit of the person who is entitled in equity under the contract. In the view of a court of equity the judgment creditor has no interest in the land so situated.\nThen by the 13th section of 1 & 2 Vic., c. 110 (English) a statute now repealed, a judgment creditor in England was for the first time placed in a position to acquire a specific lien by registering his judgment in the Court of Common Pleas. The statute provided that such registration should operate as a charge on all lands over which the judgment debtor should at the time of entering up judgment or afterwards have any disposing power which he might without the consent of any other person exercise for his own benefit. In cases which arose under this enactment it was contended that this provision gave a judgment creditor who had registered his judgment priority over equitable interests and charges, created or arising prior to his judgment, of which he had no notice. In the case of Whitworth v. Gaugain[13], heard before Sir James Wigram, V.C., and subsequently before Lord Cottenham on appeal, this question of priority arose between an equitable mortgagee by deposit of title deeds and a subsequent registered judgment creditor. It was held, however, by both those eminent judges, that under the statute, as before, the charge of the judgment creditor was to be subordinated to all equities to which the land was subject in the hands of the judgment debtor at the date of the registration, and that the absence of notice was immaterial. In Beavcn v. Lord Oxford[14], the decision in Whitworth v. Gaugain was approved and followed. Kinderley v. Jervis[15] was a decision to the same effect, and in Benham v. Keane[16] already referred to Whitworth v. Gaugain (1) was recognized as correctly expounding the law. In Eyre v. McDowell[17] an Irish appeal in the House of Lords heard before Lords Cranworth and Wensleydale, a case which is, in my opinion, a governing authority on the present question, and to which I shall have occasion to refer later on, this general principle that a judgment creditor is entitled to avail himself for the purpose of satisfying his debt of just what his debtor owns, subject to all equitable claims of third persons and no more, was recognized and acted on, and, indeed, formed the foundation of the judgment, and in this case both Lord Cranworth and Lord Wensleydale point out in strong language the fairness and justice of such a state of the law, and the grossly inequitable consequences which would follow if a judgment creditor were to be put on the same footing as a purchaser. Further this principle has not been confined in its applications to questions of priority arising between judgment creditors and prior equitable charge holders and claimants under elegits or registered judgments, but when lands are sold under writs of fieri facias, as is the practice in all the provinces of the Dominion in which English law prevails[18] it has been held by the Privy Council that the sheriff can only sell and give a title to a purchaser subject to such prior equities as the land was bound by in the hands of the debtor. Wickham v. The New Brunswick Railway Co.[19]. Again in the case of sales under execution of chattel interest the law is the same. Langton v. Horton[20]. As regards the course of decision in the Province of Ontario the same doctrine has always been acted upon. As far back as 1853 in a case of McMaster v. Phipps[21] arising upon a statute which was a verbatim reproduction of the English act 1 & 2 Vic., c. 110, sec 13, and which much resembled the present in the circumstances which gave rise to it, two of three judges before whom the cause was heard adopted this ground as one of the bases of their decision. It is true that in Watts v. Porter[22] in which the question for decision was as to the relative priorities of an equitable chargee of stock and a judgment creditor, the Court of Queen's Bench decided the other way, but Mr. Justice Erle dissented, founding his judgment on Whitworth v. Gaugain[23] and other kindred cases, and this dissenting judgment is said in Beavan v. Lord Oxford[24] to have proceeded on a correct view of the law. These authorities then are quite conclusive as to what the state of the law was when the enactment now embodied in sec. 21 of ch. 84 was passed. The foundation of the principle on which the rule of law established by these cases proceeds is most forcibly pointed out in the cases before quoted, and is one which must commend itself to any one who reflects a little on the different positions of a purchaser or incumbrancer for valuable consideration and a judgment creditor. The first has contracted for a particular interest in the land; a judgment creditor originally placed his reliance on the personal credit and solvency of his debtor and his right against the land is not founded on any contract but is only part of his remedy. It may here be said that even as regards purchasers, those who have contracted not for the land itself but only for such right, title and interest as their grantor might have, are not, under the registry laws, entitled to priority over purchasers claiming under antecedent unregistered deeds. For this proposition that where a deed purports to convey only the interest of the grantor, in other words is a mere quit claim deed, registration of it will not cut out a prior unregistered deed and postpone the grantee claiming under it many decided cases, of which I refer to a few, may be cited. Goff v. Lister[25]; Bethune v. Caulcutt[26]; Graham v. Chalmers[27]; Rice v. O'Connor[28]; Farrow v. Rees[29]; and Jones v. Williams[30] are all authorities to this effect. One of the points decided in Benham v. Keane[31] already referred to, well illustrates the position of a judgment creditor as distinguished from a purchaser; in that case one of the questions which arose was a contest for priority between two judgment creditors who had registered their judgments under the Middlesex Registry Act. The creditor who was second in order of date on the registry claimed priority over the first registered judgment on the ground that the creditor under the latter had notice of his judgment. It was held that, as regards a judgment creditor, notice to him of a prior judgment or conveyance was immaterial. It must therefore follow, if the judgment under appeal is to be maintained, that a registered judgment creditor will be actually in a better position than a purchaser or incumbrancer for value, inasmuch as the latter would undoubtedly be postponed if it were proved that he had had notice of a prior mortgage or conveyance.\nSuch being the state of the law prior to the enactment we have to construe, and the rational ground on which the decisions establishing it proceeded, it is proper in proceeding to construe the enactment under which the respondent claims to have priority over the appellants' equity to consider what was the object the legislature had in view in providing, as it has done by section 21 of chapter 84, for the registration of judgments. It must be apparent that the only objects which, consistently with the general policy of the registry laws and with the rights of purchasers as distinguished from those of judgment creditors, the legislature could have had in view was the protection and security of purchasers under execution sales by enabling them to ascertain from the registry what incumbrances by way of judgment the lands were charged with, and possibly also the protection of judgment creditors not against prior purchasers, but against fraudulent conveyances intervening subsequent to their judgments and before execution. It never could have been intended to put judgment creditors on the same footing as purchasers unless we are to ascribe to the legislature the design of arbitrarily doing away with the distinction which, as justice and reason require, should always be made between a purchaser or mortgagee who contracts to get the land itself and a mere creditor who allows the debtor to become liable to him, trusting to his personal credit, or in other words to what the debtor may voluntarily pay him, or to what, if forced to have recourse to his legal remedy, he may be able to get out of the debtor's exigible property. That I am fully justified in making these observations I shall show hereafter by some quotations from the opinion of Lord Cranworth in the case of Eyre v. McDowell[32].\nIn this case of Eyre v. McDowell (1), which arose under the Irish Registry Laws, a judgment creditor who had registered his judgment claimed priority over a prior unregistered charge created by an instrument which was clearly within the registry laws and ought as against a purchaser to have been registered. This claim of priority was based on the statute 13 & 14 Vic. ch. 29 (Ireland) ss. 6 and 7.\nThe material effect of section 6, as stated in the opinions of Lords Cranworth and Wensleydale in Eyre v. McDowell (1) from which I transcribe it, was as follows:\nWhere any judgment shall be entered up or decree or order shall be made after the passing of the act and the creditor shall know or believe that the debtor is seized or possessed of any lands, or has a disposing power over any lands, it shall be lawful for him to make and file in the court in which the judgment has been entered up, or the decree or order has been made, an affidavit stating among other things the name of himself and the name of his judgment debtor, the amount of the sum recovered and the particulars of the lands of which the debtor is seized or possessed and to register such affidavit in the office for the registry of deeds by depositing there an office copy of the affidavit which shall be entered in the book and indexes of the office as if it were the memorial of a deed.\nAnd the clause goes on to provide that for the purpose of such entries the judgment creditor shall be deemed the grantee, the judgment debtor the grantor and the amount of the debt the consideration. By section 7 it was enacted that the registration shall operate to transfer to and vest in the creditor \"all the lands mentioned in the affidavit for all the estate which the debtor had therein, subject, however, to redemption on the payment of the amount of the judgment debt, and that the creditor shall in respect of such lands have all such rights as if an effectual conveyance to him of all such estate and interest had been made, executed and registered at the time of registering the affidavit.\" Section 5 of the Irish Registry Act[33] is in the judgments in Eyre v. McDowell[34] epitomised as follows:\u2014\nDeeds unregistered shall be deemed to be fraudulent and void not only against registered deeds, but also as against creditors by judgment claiming against the party so registering.\nThis section 5 of the Irish Act is rather clumsily expressed and a hasty and superficial reading of it might convey the impression that unregistered conveyances were thereby avoided as against judgment creditors of the grantor, as it is contended here section 21 of chap. 84 has avoided them, but on an attentive consideration of its terms it will appear clearly enough that what was meant was only that which Lord Cranworth, in the summary of it which he gave in his judgment, and which I have just extracted, says was its effect, namely, that an unregistered deed should be void not only against a grantee claiming under a subsequent registered conveyance but also against the judgment creditors of such grantee. The words \"lands contained or expressed in such memorial registered as aforesaid,\" show this to be the proper construction, the only memorial registered being that of the subsequent deed. At all events the very fact of the controversy which the House of Lords was called upon to decide in Eyre v. McDowell (2) having arisen implies that this was the proper construction of the 5th section of the 6th Anne, since there would otherwise have been no necessity for the judgment creditor to resort to the later statute in order to support his claim to priority.\nThen under section 7 of 13 & 14 Vic. cap. 29, the registry of the affidavit operating to transfer to and vest in the judgment creditor all the lands mentioned in the affidavit registered for all the estate which the debtor had therein, and it being declared thereby that the judgment creditor should have in respect of such lands the same rights as if an effectual conveyance to him of all such estate and interest had been made, executed and registered at the time of registering the affidavit, this enactment, taken in conjunction with the prior statute, (the General Registry Act, of the 6th Anne cap. 2, sec. 5,) by which the rights of a purchaser registering a conveyance subsequent in date to a prior unregistered conveyance by the same grantor are declared to be that he shall have priority over such antecedent unregistered deed, and that it shall be avoided in his favour, we have presented by these Irish enactments, the construction of which was in question in Eyre v. McDowell[35], exactly the same question which is presented in the present case in which we are called on to construe the Nova Scotia Act, cap. 84, sec. 21. The two enactments are equivalent in their terms unless, indeed, it may be said that the Irish statutes were stronger in favour of the contention of the judgment creditor than the Nova Scotia statute since the former clearly pointed out in the 5th section of the earlier act that the unregistered deeds to be avoided were deeds prior in date, whilst the Nova Scotia act leaves it doubtful whether by the words, \"deeds or mortgages duly executed but not registered\" prior or only subsequent deeds and mortgages were intended to be referred to. In Eyre v. McDowell[36] the Irish Court of Appeals had held the judgment creditor entitled to priority, thus overruling a prior decision of the same court in a former case of McAuley v. Clarendon[37].\nNow I would call attention to a general observation with which Lord Cranworth prefaces his speech in Eyre v. McDowell (1); he says:\nIt it hardly possible to suppose that the legislature could have intended so to alter the relative positions of debtor and creditor as to enable the latter to satisfy himself out of property in which the former had no disposing power. If for any reason such a change had been contemplated we should surely have had some recital indicating an intention to make such an unusual deviation from principle.\nAgain in McAuley v. Clarendon (2), in the Irish Court of Appeals, Lord Justice Blackburn, whose judgment was in all respects approved by the House of Lords, had expressed the same opinion in even more forcible language. The Lord Justice there, after adverting to the principle that the judgment creditor was in justice and equity and according to the authorities prior to the statute entitled to make available for his satisfaction only the beneficial interests of his debtor, thus proceeds:\nThis is all plain according to the settled principles of equity and being so it is sought to be subverted by an Act of Parliament under whose provisions the judgment is registered. If such were the effects of that act I have no hesitation in saying that never was there any enactment so essentially unjust or subversive of the established rules of law and the rights of parties.\nAnd we find Lord Wensleydale, of whom it may be said (as many of his decisions indicate) that no judge in modern times was more inclined to a strict and literal construction of acts of parliament, calling indeed the rule of strict construction, \"the golden rule,\" joining in these denunciations of a construction which would put a judgment creditor on an equal footing with a purchaser. The actual ratio decidendi in Eyre v. McDowell[38], is thus tersely put by Lord Cranworth:\u2014\nThese enactments [referring to sections 5 and 8 of the 6 Anne ch. 2[39]] will be found not to affect the question in dispute. By the joint operation of this act[40] and the act 13 & 14 Vic. ch. 29 the registered affidavit gives to the judgment creditor priority over all prior unregistered deeds. Be it so. It gives him, however, only the same priority as he would have had if the debtor had executed to him a mortgage of the lands enumerated in the affidavit, i.e., a mortgage of such interest as was enjoyed by the debtor beneficially, such interest as might have been taken in execution; the debtors' interest in the lands after satisfying the equitable claims of the unregistered mortgage. The registration of the affidavit gives to the respondent a right against all persons claiming subsequently to the registration; and by the effect of the 8th section against all voluntary settlements executed subsequently to the date of the judgment or order.\nI am of opinion that this decision exactly applies to the enactment which is involved in the present case. In the first place what is it that section 21[41] says shall be bound by the judgment when registered? It is \"the lands of the party against whom the judgment shall have passed.\" This, interpreted according to the general law and in the light of the numerous judicial decisions before referred to, can only mean the beneficial interest of the debtor in those lands subject to all outstanding interests, charges or liens whether constituted by instruments susceptible of registration or not. This would sufficiently appear from the clause itself construed in the way I have just mentioned, but it is further borne out by the context of the Revised Statutes contained in other chapters in pari materi\u00e2. For what purpose are the lands to be so bound? Clearly for the purpose of the execution to be issued on the judgment. Lands in Nova Scotia are not extended under a writ of elegit but for the purposes of satisfying a judgment are sold by the sheriff under a writ of fieri facias pursuant to a statute which applies to all the colonies[42]. Then in chap. 124 of the same series (5th) of the revised statutes which is entitled \"of the sale of lands under execution,\" we find contained in sections 1 and 6 (which I have set out in extenso in the early part of this judgment) provisions material to the present question. Section 1 declares that the lands to be bound shall be the real estate of the debtor, and section 6 shows that what is to be bound by a registered judgment in the case of lands to which the judgment debtor's title is equitable is his beneficial interest. Then section 14 of the same chapter provides that the sheriff having sold the lands\nshall deliver to the purchaser, or his agent or nominee, a deed of such lands which shall be sufficient to convey to the purchaser all the interest of the execution debtor in the lands therein described.\nAnd section 15 declares that:\nThe sheriff's deed shall be presumptive evidence of the execution debtor's title having been thereby conveyed to the purchaser.\nNow even without the high authority of the decision in Eyre v. McDowell[43], and without going beyond the statute book of Nova Scotia, it must surely be apparent from these enactments that there could have been no object in providing that the judgment should bind anything more than the judgment creditor would have had a right to have sold by the sheriff under execution, and what the sheriff may so sell, it is clearly enacted, shall be only the interest of the execution debtor. These enactments seems to me to make the case one much stronger in favour of the appellant than was the case of Eyre v. McDowell (2). If it be said in answer to this that the effect of a mortgage attributed by section 21 to a registered judgment was not merely to bind the lands for the purpose of legal execution, but also to give the creditor a right to equitable execution and therefore the equitable charge might be larger than the legal charge for the purpose of legal execution, a twofold reply may be given to such arguments.\nFirst inasmuch as by section 124 the sheriff can sell equitable interests there would be no necessity to resort to equitable execution, and indeed the very first allegation of a bill in equity for such relief, that the plaintiff could not have execution at law, would, having regard to section 124, be untrue.\nNext, if a court of equity should have jurisdiction, and if that jurisdiction were to be invoked for the purpose of having the charge of the judgment raised by a sale of the lands bound by it, the inquiry would still be the same. What lands were bound by that charge? The answer to this question would clearly be that which courts of equity have so often given in such cases, only the debtor's beneficial interest.\nIt is said, however, that the last paragraph of section 21, \"And deeds or mortgages of such lands duly executed but not registered shall be void against the judgment creditor, who shall first register his judgment,\" enlarges the effect of the former part of the section, and gives the same effect to a recorded judgment as regards prior unregistered deeds and mortgages as is attributed by section 18 to the registration of a purchaser's conveyance. I am clearly of opinion that this construction is inadmissible. As I have already pointed out these words are not so strong as were the conjoined provisions of the two statutes under consideration in Eyre v. McDowell[44]. The words are not \"prior deeds and mortgages of such lands,\" but deeds and mortgages generally, which is quite consistent with an intention on the part of the legislature to avoid only subsequent deeds and mortgages, a construction which would have the effect of showing clearly that conveyances or mortgages intermediate between the registry of the judgment and the sale under execution should be void. Without this declaration the provision that the lands should be bound would probably have been sufficient for the purpose, but still the legislature may have deemed it better to give a clear expression to this consequence, which would, as I have said, have probably followed without more by the enactment that the lands should be bound by the registry.\nThe decided cases and the principles established by those authorities already fully referred to require the adoption of this construction, and, as was held by Mr. Justice Thompson in his judgment in the case of Miller v. McKeene, I consider it inevitable, even if we should confine ourselves to section 21 alone interpreting it in the light of the general law and the principles of justice, and with a due regard to that which is manifestly the general policy of all registry laws.\nThere is, however, what I must repeat appears to me a conclusive argument in favour of this view, deducible from the provisions relating to the sale by the sheriff and the restricted effect of his deed to pass only the debtor's beneficial interest.\nIt is further said, however, that the words \"but not registered\" in section 21 show that what was meant was to avoid deeds and mortgages executed anterior to the registry of the judgment and preclude the construction I have just indicated restricting these words to instruments which might be executed subsequent to the registry. I cannot think there is any force in this; at most the restriction to unregistered deeds gives rise to an inference or implication, or I might rather say to speculation, as to the intention of the legislature in thus confining the avoidance to unregistered deeds, but I think this wholly insufficient to overcome the arguments in favour of the construction I adopt, and here again, I say, that the difficulties to be overcome in Eyre v. McDowell[45] were far greater than any which are created here by this specification of unregistered deeds. The word \"prior\" is in no sense the correlative of the word \"unregistered\" so as to require us to supply it, and I can find no warrant, either in authority or principle, for interpolating the words \"former\" or \"prior\" or \"antecedent\" or some equivalent expression before the words deeds or mortgages merely from the use of this word \"unregistered\" when all reason, justice and authority require me to read the same words as limited in their application to instruments subsequently executed.\nI admit that I can assign no rational meaning to a distinction between subsequent deeds which are unregistered and those which might happen to be registered, and that such a distinction appears to me to be purely arbitrary, but this consideration is quite insufficient to authorize a re-modelling of the statute by the introduction of words not expressed in it, and that in the very teeth of what, upon every just and reasonable presumption, we must conclude to have been the intention of the legislature.\nFor these reasons I come to the same conclusions as those which were arrived at by Mr. Justice Weatherbe in the present case and by the same learned judge in Grindley v. Blakie.[46] and by Mr. Justice Thompson in Miller v. McKeen. It is right that I should notice another argument advanced on behalf of the appellants and state the reason why it does not appear to me to be admissible.\nIt was said that the appellants' equity to have their mortgage deed reformed by the insertion of the omitted parcels is one not within the registry laws at all, in other words that it was an equity insusceptible of registration, and therefore one which it must be presumed the statute was intended to apply to, and consequently one not liable to be avoided by the registration of a subsequent deed.\nI concede that this argument ought to prevail in a case like Miller v. McKeen where there was a mere equity not arising directly from any written instrument which might have been registered. The authorities on this head are conclusive in a case properly arising within the principle. Sumpter v. Cooper[47]; Re Burke's Estate[48]; McMaster v. Phipps[49]. But in a case like the present where the letter by which Mrs. Duggan agreed to give the mortgage was a writing which might have been registered, and which, however informal, was in equity equivalent to a mortgage, I cannot agree that such an argument should prevail.\nOn the whole, on the ground first stated, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and a judgment entered in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia directing that the appellants' mortgage be reformed as claimed by them.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014was of opinion, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014concurred in the appeal being dismissed. PATTERSON J.\u2014Mrs. Duggan owed money to the appellant. On the 8th of July, 1878, she wrote to him proposing to give him a mortgage on her property at Mount Pleasant for \u00a33,000 and a mortgage on other property for \u00a32,000. The mortgage was made on the 1st of September, 1878, but although the solicitor who prepared it understood that all Mrs. Duggan's property was to be covered, a mistake was made in describing a part of the Mount Pleasant property, by which it happened that one undivided sixth part of one parcel, in place of the entirety, was conveyed. It need scarcely be said that although the mortgagee failed to get by virtue of the deed the legal estate in the omitted five-sixths of the piece of land he became equitably entitled to the whole, and that as to that parcel, as well as to the other mortgaged lands, the title of Mrs. Duggan was in equity reduced to the equity of redemption.\nThat was the state of the affair on the 27th of September, 1887, when the respondent, Dr. Cogswell, recovered a judgment against Mrs. Duggan and registered it. The mortgage had, of course, been registered.\nUnder his judgment Dr. Cogswell was undeniably entitled to take in execution, by whatever process was appropriate, all the interest of Mrs. Duggan in the Mount Pleasant property and the other mortgaged property\u2014that is to say her equity of redemption, for she had not at that date been foreclosed. But he insists that the effect of the registry law is to enable him to take also the legal estate which, nine years before the recovery of his judgment, had been in equity charged with the debt but had been by an oversight omitted from the mortgage deed.\nFor this he relies on a clause in the Registry Act[50] which says that:\u2014 A judgment duly recovered and docketed shall bind the lands of the party against whom the judgment shall have passed, from and after registry thereof in the county or district wherein the lands are situate, as effectually as a mortgage, whether such lands shall have been acquired before or after the registering of such judgment; and deeds or mortgages of such lands, duly executed but not registered, shall be void against the judgment creditor who shall first register his judgment.\nThat clause contains two enactments; let us look at them separately.\nIf Dr. Cogswell's judgment had happened to be against Mr. Miller instead of Mrs. Duggan he could have enforced it against Mr. Miller's interest in the Mount Pleasant property, which would have appeared, by proof of what has now been proved, to be the whole value of the property subject nominally to an equity of redemption, but only nominally because the property was not worth the amount of the mortgage. The lands of Mrs. Duggan included only this nominal equity of redemption and that was all that, as against her, the first part of the clause had to operate on.\nThen we pass to the second enactment. \"Deeds and mortgages of such lands\u2014\" What lands? \"The lands of the party against whom the judgment shall have passed\"\u2014the lands that are bound as effectually as if, at the time of the registration of the judgment, the judgment debtor had made a mortgage of them. Not a mortgage to a purchaser for value without notice of the equity of Mr. Miller; nothing like that is said or implied; but a mortgage of the interest the mortgagor had power to convey, and which, if she had made a mortgage to the debtor, we must assume to be all that she would have professed to convey. \"Deeds and mortgages of such lands, duly executed but not registered, shall be void against the judgment creditor who shall first register his judgment.\" That is not a very intelligible sentence even at first sight, and when we come to see, as we have seen, what is meant by \"such lands,\" the perspicuity is not thereby increased. We cannot hold the meaning to be that a man who has in good faith, and violating no rule of law or morals, bought a piece of land is to have his title divested or charged with another man's debt merely because the judgment creditor happens to get to the registry office before him without reading into the enactment something that is not found there. We need not complicate the question of construction by any of the considerations of equity which affect the titles of Mrs. Duggan or Mr. Miller. The contention is that an out and out sale of land leaves that land liable, if the deed is not registered, to be bound as the land of the person who has ceased to own it. It is impossible so to read the first enactment of the clause, and therefore that land cannot be \"such land\" under the second enactment. The necessity for finding a meaning for everything in an act of parliament is not absolute. The general rule is to find a meaning if possible, and further, that when one of two meanings would lead to an injustice which the legislature would seem not to have intended we should choose the other. An illustration of this rule is found in the case of Ex parte Wicks[51], where the Chief Judge in Bankruptcy adopted one meaning, a literal one, of a statutory provision, and the Court of Appeal adopted a different one, Brett L.J., observing \"I think we have no right to reduce an act of parliament to a wicked absurdity.\"\nIn the court below the effect of the enactment under consideration has been discussed from opposite points of view by Mr. Justice Townshend and Mr. Justice Weatherbe. I agree with the latter learned judge in the result of his reasoning and probably in the reasoning itself, though I am not quite sure that I would put it in precisely the same way. We must bear in mind that we are dealing not with a bankruptcy law, under which transactions are sometimes avoided for reasons of policy connected with the equal distribution of a bankrupt estate among the creditors, but with a registry law the object of which is to afford to persons dealing with lands information as to the state of the title to the particular soil they are purchasing or taking as security. A judgment creditor is not a purchaser and he gets security, by virtue of this statute and of another which regulates the sale of lands under execution, upon the lands of his debtor, not upon any land or any interest in land that his debtor has parted with before the registration of the judgment. At least that is all he gets unless this second enactment gives him more. An earlier section of the registry act declares that \"deeds or mortgages of lands duly executed but not registered shall be void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration who shall first register his deed.\" It is to be noted that the effect now claimed for the registration of the judgment might have been appropriately provided for by inserting two or three words in this section, making the unregistered instrument void against any judgment creditor, or subsequent purchaser or mortgagee who should register his judgment or deed. That, however, was not said nor, as I should infer, was it intended. What was done was to frame this second enactment of the clause we are considering in terms generally similar to those of the earlier section, but with the important difference that it relates expressly to deeds of \"such lands,\" or of the lands just declared to be bound by the judgment, viz., the lands that belong to the judgment debtor. Now what does it say of deeds of those lands which were still the property of the judgment debtor though liable to be taken in execution? It explains what is meant by being bound by the judgment. The owner may deal with them but they may be followed by the execution. Deeds of them shall be void against the creditor who first, that is before the sale of them, registered his judgment. The obvious argument in reply to this is that first here does not mean before the conveyance but before the registration of it? If that is meant it is not so expressed as to exclude the other construction. \"Shall first register\" is, both in this and in the earlier clause to which I have adverted, a very loose expression. We understand the earlier section, in spite of its looseness, to mean that a subsequent registered deed is to prevail against a prior unregistered one, because we are aided by the policy of the registry law. The known object of registration is carried out by that understanding. But when it is sought to charge one man's property with the debt of another and to make it liable to be taken in execution for that debt, no principle of bankruptcy law intervening, we ought not so to construe the statute unless compelled to do so by the clear force of its language.\nIt will be said that by referring the word \"first\" to the making of a deed and not to the registration of it we silence the words \"but not registered.\" Perhaps we do; but if those words are to be heard they should give no uncertain sound. If we let them speak, and read the enactment as declaring that a judgment shall prevail against an unregistered deed of land provided the judgment was registered before the deed was made, we give effect to every word of the sentence. An unexpected result that might follow would be that by registration before the land was seized in execution the deed would regain its priority, because a judgment prevails only by means of the execution, and to be void against a judgment practically means to be voidable by seizure of the land in execution. I do not suppose the legislature meant to say that the deed should be void against the execution only in the event of its being allowed to remain unregistered until the land was seized, and I do not advocate the adoption of that rendering as giving the true effect of the statute. I merely point to it as more consistent with the language as we find it, and as a construction that would do less injustice than the other reading which requires us to supply by intendment what the enactment falls short of expressing. I am inclined to think that the confusion may have arisen from following too literally the wording of the earlier section by using the words \"duly executed but not registered,\" which, unprecise as they are in the one clause, seem out of place in the other.\nOn these grounds, and for the reasons fully given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Weatherbe, I think we ought to adopt his conclusions rather than the view acted on by the learned Chief Justice at the trial and ably supported in the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend, and should allow the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\nSolicitors for respondents: Gray & Mac Donald.\n[1] 9 H.

Notice was given to the electric company but the injury continued and an action was brought by the owners of the warehouse for damages.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, that the act causing the injury violated the rule of law which does not permit one, even on his own land, to do anything, lawful in itself, which necessarily injures another, and the persons injured were entitled to damages therefor more especially as the injury continued after notice to the company.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiffs are owners of a warehouse for storing ironware in the city of Halifax and had occupied the same premises for some twenty years. Early in 1889 the defendant company set up an electric light station in the premises adjoining the warehouse and began operating an engine in connection with the same. Attached to the engine was a condenser, the pipe from which passed through from the floor of defendants' premises and discharged into the dock below at a distance of some twenty feet from the warehouse. In March, 1889, plaintiffs' warehouse was discovered to be full of steam and complaint was made to the officials of defendants' company who stated that they were unable to understand how it could have been caused by their engine but took no steps to prevent its continuance. In May, 1889, a writ was issued by the plaintiffs, and the statement of claim filed charged negligence in the construction and working of defendants' engine, and claimed damages and an injunction. At the trial the amount of damages was agreed upon subject to the right to maintain an action. Judgment was given for the plaintiffs for the said amount, and the injunction asked for was granted. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the judges were equally divided and the judgment of the trial judge was affirmed. The defendants appealed to this court.\nF. H. Bell for the appellant. The action as framed is for negligence and no negligence has been proved. See remarks of Alderson B. in Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Co.[1]; Beven on Negligence[2].\nThe court below has treated it as a nuisance though the action is not so brought. That defendants were not guilty of a nuisance see Robinson v. Kilvert[3]; Fletcher v. Rylands[4]; Thomson on Negligence[5]; Middlesex Co. v. McCue[6]; Harrison v. Southwark & Vauxhall Water Co.[7].\nDefendants are not liable as they were acting in exercise of a statutory right. Dixon v. Metropolitan Board of Works[8]; Truman v. London Brighton, &c., Railway Co.[9]. Newcombe for the respondents relied on Fletcher v. Rylands[10], and on the question of nuisance cited Reinhardt v. Mentasti[11].\nBell in reply referred to Dunn v. The Birmingham Canal Co.[12].\nSTRONG and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed. The respondents' goods were undoubtedly injured as found at the trial, by steam or vapour, from the condenser used by the appellant company in the building adjoining the respondents' warehouse. The trial judge also found that this injury could have been prevented, and that the respondents were not guilty of contributory negligence. The appellants have infringed the maxim sic utere tuo ut alieno ne l\u00e6das. They have injuriously affected the respondents' property and violated that rule of law which will not permit any one, even on his own land, to do an act, lawful in itself, which yet, being done in that place, necessarily does damage to another.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The defendants are liable upon a very simple principle. They did something which caused injury to the plaintiffs. It may be true, and doubtless is true, that the act was done on their own land, but its influence did not end there. The hot water poured from their machinery, in their own premises, was liable to flow elsewhere or to be carried elsewhere in the form of vapour, and in the form of vapour it injured the property of the plaintiffs. The defendants must, therefore, pay the damages. The law was thus laid down two centuries ago in Lambert v. Bessey[13].\nIn all civil cases the law doth not so much regard the intent of the actor as the loss or damage of the party suffering;......for though a man doth a lawful thing, yet if damage do thereby befall another he shall answer for it if he could have avoided it.\nThe report illustrates these propositions by a number of instances in which a defendant had been held answerable for the consequences of an act done ipso invito or casualiter et per infortunium et contra voluntatern suam.\nThere are many modern decisions on this branch of the law which it might be instructive to examine in detail, including, of course, the important case of Fletcher v. Rylands[14], but I shall content myself with quoting a passage from the judgment of Mr. Justice Denman in Humphries v. Cousins[15] where the result as applicable to facts of the same character as those before us is accurately stated:\nThe prim\u00e2 facie right of every occupier of a piece of land is to enjoy that land free from all invasion of filth or other matter coming from any artificial structure on land adjoining. Moreover, this right of every occupier of land is an incident of possession, and does not depend on acts or omissions of other people; it is independent of what they may know or not know of the state of their own property, and independent of the care or want of care which they may take of it. That these are the rights of an occupier of land appears to me to be established by the cases of Smith v. Kenrick[16]; Baird v. Williamson[17]; Fletcher v. Rylands[18] and the older authorities there referred to; and the recent decision of Broder v. Saillard[19].\nThe facts to which this law was applied in Humphries v. Cousins (3) afforded stronger ground for argument for the defence than do the present facts, because the defendant there did not know of the existence under his house of the part of the drain the defective condition of which permitted the escape of the sewage that found its way into the cellar of the plaintiff's adjoining house under which the same drain ran, and the judgment assumed that the defendant had not brought the sewage on to his premises. That feature of the case is discussed with reference to other authorities including Lambert v. Bessey[20] which I have already cited.\nI understand the opinion of the learned judges in the court below who held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to retain their judgment to have turned to some extent on the facts, as apprehended by them, that the defendants discharged the hot water from their condenser in the ordinary way of using their machinery in their own building, and without reason to anticipate its doing injury to their neighbour. With great respect for those learned judges I am of opinion that adopting the findings of fact by the trial judge, as we must do, those findings being moreover in clear accordance with the evidence, the discussion of that legal question is rather irrelevant. The finding is that notice that injury was being done in fact, not merely that the tendency of the discharge was to injure the plaintiffs, was given to the defendants, and the greater part of the injury was done after that.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Pearson, Forbes & Covert.\nSolicitors for respondents: Drysdale, Newcombe & McInnes.\n[1] 11 Ex. 784.\n[2] P. 111.\n[3] 41 Ch.

S. N. S. 5th ser. ch. 74.\nIn an action by A., a married woman, against a sheriff for taking, under an execution against her husband, goods which she claimed as her separate property under the Married Woman's Property Act (R. S. N. S. 5th ser. ch. 74) the sheriff justified under the execution without proving the judgment on which it was issued. The execution was against Donald A. and it was claimed that the husband's name was Daniel. The jury found that he was well known by both names and that A.'s right to the goods seized was acquired from her husband after marriage which would not make it her separate property under the act.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the action could not be maintained; that a sheriff sued in trespass or trover for taking goods seized under execution can justify under the execution without showing the judgment; Hannon v. McLean (3 Can. S.C. R. 706) followed; and that under the findings of the jury, which were amply supported by the evidence, the goods seized must be considered to belong to the husband which was a complete answer to the action.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff was a married woman residing in the county of Colchester and the defendant was high sheriff of the county. The action was one of replevin to recover possession of goods seized by defendant on execution against the plaintiff's husband, it being claimed that the goods were the separate property of the plaintiff. Evidence was given at the trial that plaintiff had filed a license with her husband's consent to carry on a separate business of farming, and that the husband had never interfered in said business and did not live with her. Also, that after marriage the husband had conveyed land to trustees to hold in trust for his wife, and that she had taken an assignment of a bill of sale of stock which her husband had given to one McMillan.\nThe jury found that the goods seized were not the separate property of the plaintiff, and that she had not carried on a separate business in respect to said goods. The trial judge set aside these findings and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff, holding that the sheriff in order to justify the seizure was obliged to prove a valid judgment, and the judgment on which the execution issued was defective in varying from the pleadings by giving a different name to the defendant in the action. The full court affirmed the judgment of the trial judge and the defendant appealed to this court.\nNewcombe for the appellant.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appellant is sheriff of the county of Colchester, and he appeals against a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in a statutory action of replevin brought against him by the respondent Annie Adams. The appellant, under a writ of execution against the goods of Donald Adams purporting to be issued upon a judgment recovered by John McDougall, seized the goods which have been replevied in the action. The appellant, amongst other defences which need not be mentioned, pleaded that the goods seized were not the goods of the plaintiff and also justified under the writ of execution before mentioned. The trial of the action took place before Mr. Justice Ritchie and a jury. The appellant did not put in evidence the judgment upon which the writ purported upon its face to have been issued, namely, a judgment against Donald Adams. It was proved sufficiently to warrant the finding of the jury to that effect that Donald Adams, the execution debtor named in the writ of execution, was the respondent's husband. It is quite clear on authority that the sheriff sued in trespass or trover for taking or converting goods seized by him under an execution, can justify under the writ without showing the judgment[1]. It is true that under the old forms of pleading, when the sheriff was made a defendant together with the execution creditor and the defendants joined in pleading, it was essential to show the judgment inasmuch as according to the old rules of common law pleading it was requisite that a plea should be good in its entirety, and the execution creditor could only justify under a judgment as well as an execution, but it was never doubted, so far as I know, that the sheriff sued alone might justify under a writ of fieri facias, and for obvious reasons it would have been unreasonable that the law should have been otherwise.\nThe only question in the cause is, therefore, that which has been dealt with in the very well reasoned judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend, viz., whether the goods seized by the appellant and which have been replevied in the present action were or were not the property of the execution debtor, the respondent's husband. Prim\u00e2 facie goods in the actual possession of the wife of an execution debtor are the goods of the latter. It lies on the wife to show if she can that they are her separate property, that is her separate property under the statute law or under the doctrines of courts of equity as to the separate property of married women. It was argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that these chattels were equitable separate property. There is no evidence whatever of this from the deeds and documents in evidence. Then the jury by their findings, on evidence amply sufficient to warrant them, have negatived the facts upon which alone this property could have been separate property under the statutory law of Nova Scotia; they found, first that the property levied on was not nor was any part of it acquired by the plaintiff in any other way than from her husband, and secondly that this property was not obtained by the earnings of the plaintiff since 19th April, 1884, in any employment, occupation or trade carried on by her separately from her husband. The respondent is then a woman married before the 19th of April, 1884, who does not bring herself, as regards a title to the separate ownership of this property, within any of the provisions of the Married Woman's Property Act (N.S.) and therefore, as Mr. Justice Townshend has, I think rightly, held, the goods seized must, under the findings of the jury which were warranted by the evidence, be considered to belong to her husband the execution debtor. The appeal must consequently be allowed with costs and judgment entered for the appellant with costs in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed. I adopt Mr. Justice Townshend's reasoning in the court below. Proof of a judgment by the sheriff was unnecessary in this case, the plaintiff not having shown a title in herself apart from her husband. It is not necessary for a defendant to prove his plea of justification if the plaintiff has not proved an act which requires justification.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014 I am also of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The plaintiff is a married woman who carries on the business of farming at Wittenburg in Colchester County in Nova Scotia, and lives on the farm. She was married before the year 1884. Her husband does not make his home at the farm, but is occasionally there. The goods in question were in the plaintiff's possession on the farm and were in use for the purposes of the farm when the defendant, who is the sheriff of Colchester county, seized them.\nThese facts, which have not been formally found by the jury, I take from the evidence of the plaintiff herself. Other facts on which her evidence bears we must, as I apprehend, take from the findings of the\nThe jury specifically found that the plaintiff's husband did not interfere in the management of the property and affairs at Wittenburg.\nWe have thus the fact that the plaintiff had an employment, occupation or trade which she carried on separately from her husband, and that therefore the provisions of the Married Woman's Property Act of Nova Scotia relating to a married woman's separate business, which provisions begin with section 52 of chapter 94 of the Revised Statutes, 5th series, apply to her. They do not, however, apply to the property now in question, because the jury find that no part of it was obtained by the plaintiff since the 19th day of April, 1884, in any employment, occupation or trade carried on by her separately from her husband. The jury further find that no part of the property seized was acquired by the plaintiff in any other way than from her husband.\nWe have therefore to regard the goods as having been acquired by the plaintiff from her husband after marriage, and to discuss her right of action from that point of view.\nThe goods being seized in her possession, and a married woman having power when carrying on a separate business, and also in some other circumstances, to hold personal property apart from her husband, she made a prim\u00e2 facie title to the goods by showing her possession of them. Were it not for the statute under which these rights are given the possession of the wife would have been ascribed to the husband and would have been evidence of title in him, but as under the effect of the statute the possession is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of property in the plaintiff the defendant has to meet the charge of wrongfully seizing the goods. For this purpose he relies in the first place on the fact found by the jury that the plaintiff's right to the goods, whatever it was, was acquired from her husband after marriage. That fact has been held by the learned judge who dissented in the court below to be a complete answer to the plaintiff's action. I think he is correct in that opinion. If the plaintiff has any title to these goods as her separate property she must derive it under the third section of the statute which reads thus:\u2014\nSec. 3.\u2014Every married woman who shall have married before the nineteenth day of April, A.D. 1884, without any marriage contract or settlement, shall and may from and after the said date, notwithstanding her coverture, have, hold and enjoy all her real estate not on or before such date taken possession of by her husband, by himself or his tenants, and all her personal property not on or before such date reduced into the possession of her husband, whether such real estate or personal property shall have belonged to her before marriage or shall have been in any way acquired by her after marriage otherwise than from her husband, free from his debts and obligations contracted after such date and from his control or disposition without her consent in as full and ample a manner as if she were sole and unmarried.\nThat section gives separate rights in property acquired after marriage but only when acquired otherwise than from the husband. Property acquired from the husband is not touched but is left as at common law.\nThe same legislation is applied in sections 4 and 5 to women marrying after the 19th of April, 1884, both sections excluding property received from the husband during coverture, with the exception only of wearing apparel and other articles necessary for the personal use of the wife.\nThe act does not contain any provision like the first section of the English Married Women's Property Act, 1882,[2] which in general terms confers upon a married woman the capacity to hold real or personal property as her separate property in the same manner as if she were a feme sole without the intervention of any trustee, though the effect of sections 3, 4 and 5 may be fully as wide as regards any property except that which is acquired by the wife from her husband.\nOn this ground I think the plaintiff has no right of action even if the defendant were, as against her husband, a trespasser.\nBut if section 3 could properly be read, as it seems to have been by the other members of the court below, as giving to the married woman power to acquire property from her husband with the two limi tions upon her ownership, viz., that the property should not be free from his debts or obligations contracted after the specified date or from his control or disposition without her consent, I should be clearly of opinion that the sheriff established his plea of justification. He seized under a fi fa issued, as the writ recited, upon a judgment against Donald Adams. The plaintiff says her husband is \"Daniel\" Adams, and the jury find as a fact that Donald Adams and Daniel Adams are one and the same person. This is found on ample evidence including some documents. Daniel or Donald would seem to be a rather illiterate man. His signature, by his mark against the name Donald Adams, appears to three papers, viz., two promissory notes made jointly with John McDougall, who joined in them as surety and paid them, and a conveyance of land in which the plaintiff joins. All three were drawn and witnessed by Mr. Urquhart, a justice of the peace, who gave his evidence at the trial and who wrote the name \"Donald Adams\" to each paper, knowing the man very well and thinking Donald his right name. Mr. Fraser, to whom the joint notes were given for money lent, and who had known Adams from the time he was a little boy, says he went by the name of Daniel and Donald and understood one as well as the other. Robert Adams, his brother, gave evidence to the same effect, and said that at home he was mostly called Dan, and was, as Robert understood, named after their uncle Donald Tulloch. The plaintiff herself, while she says that her husband's name is Daniel, shows also that when the sheriff's officer came asking for Donald she knew who was meant and answered accordingly that he was not there, her explanation being that he was \"at home that day,\" meaning evidently at the place where he lived which was not on the farm where she lived. When she was recalled, apparently to prove that when the sheriff came to serve the writ of summons in McDougall's action she told him that her husband's name was Daniel, she made it clear that she was under no mistake as to the person who was sued. She knew it as well as her husband did when he filed his appearance as \"Daniel Adams sued as Donald Adams.\"\nThere is no pretense of disputing, as a matter of fact, the identity of the man who borrowed the money from Fraser which McDougall had to pay, the man who was sued by McDougall and who, after appearing in the action suffered judgment by default, and the plaintiff's husband from whom she acquired the property that was taken in execution.\nThe learned judge who tried the action, while he felt himself bound to hold that the proof of the plea of justification was technically insufficient, was sensible of the hardship of which, under the circumstances, the defendant was entitled to complain. It is, in my judgment, a hardship that would be a reproach to our jurisprudence, and I think it may be avoided without straining any principle of evidence, though, if astuteness were called for, it should be exercised in favour of what is manifestly the justice of the case and against the formal objections by which that is opposed.\nI am not disposed to admit without proof that Daniel and Donald are different names, but assuming them to be different I do not find it formally established that the man's name is not Donald. The evidence for its being Donald seems as strong as that on which it has been taken to be Daniel.\nSuppose, however, that \"Donald\" is a misnomer, what then? In old times in England, and I suppose also in Nova Scotia, a defendant sued by a wrong name might have pleaded the misnomer in abatement; at a later period (under 3 & 4 Wm. IV., c. 42) he might have had the declaration amended at the expense of the plaintiff, and his remedy under the more elastic system of the present day is not less ample. Adams did nothing but file an appearance which acknowledged that he was the person sued by the name of Donald, and judgment proceeded against him by that name. The duty of the sheriff to execute the process issued upon that judgment is clear. It would be sufficient to refer for authority for this proposition to the one case of Reeves v. Slater[3], but I shall first notice two other cases which illustrate the difference between the consequence of misnomer in mesne process and in final process.\nCole v. Hindson[4] was a case of mesne process. Aquila Cole was summoned to appear in Chancery by a writ erroneously addressed to Richard Cole, and he did not appear. Thereupon a distringas was issued against Richard under which the goods of Aquila were distrained. Aquila brought this action of trespass for the seizure of his goods and recovered. Lord Kenyon C.J. said:\nThe defendants were not justified in seizing the goods of Aquila Cole under a distringas against Richard Cole, and the averment in the plea that Aquila and Richard are the same person will not assist them, as they have not also averred that the plaintiff was known as well by one name as the other.\nIn the present case the man was known as well by the name of Donald as Daniel, so that, even if the seizure had been under a distringas and not a fi fa, the writ would have protected the sheriff, as far as the law in Cole v. Hindson (2) is concerned.\nWe have an early case of final process in Crawford v. Satchwell[5]. The defendant there had omitted to plead the misnomer, and it was held that he might be taken in execution under a ca. sa. by the wrong name.\nIn Reeves v. Slater (1) the sheriff had a fi fa against John Stone Lundie, under which he seized the goods of John Stowe Lundie who was the person sued by the wrong name of John Stone Lundie, but he gave up the goods without selling them and returned the writ nulla bona. The action was for a false return. Lord Tenterden C.J. said:\u2014\nThe party himself having suffered judgment to be entered up against him by the name of John Stone Lundie, it was not for the sheriff to render that nugatory by refusing to execute the fi, fa and he must be liable for the consequences of having done so.\nThese cases, which are among the earliest of a mass of cases on the subject of misnomer, show that the sheriff did what under long established principles it was his duty to do, notwithstanding that the real name of the debtor may have been Daniel while the fi fa recited a judgment against Donald and commanded him to ake the goods of Donald.\nBut if section 3 can properly be read, as it seems to have been read by the learned judge who tried the action and by the majority of the court in banc, as giving the wife some property in the goods the justification was, in my opinion, sufficiently proved as against her.\nThe production of the fi fa would be sufficient proof as against the judgment debtor who could have set aside the writ if it were not warranted by a judgment. Now, if the wife takes any property under section 3 in goods acquired from her husband it is not \"free from his debts and obligations contracted after such date and from his control and disposition without her consent.\" I am inclined to think that, by reason of these limitations, any seizure which would be good against the husband is good also against the wife. It was established by White v. Morris[6], which is a case of recognized authority and one in which previous decisions are fully discussed, that when a sheriff takes goods from the possession of an assignee under a deed alleged to be fraudulent as against creditors, the title being good against every one but a creditor, he must prove a judgment in order to show that he represents a creditor against whom the deed is void, and that that, is not sufficiently shown by the writ of fi fa; but that reasoning does not strike me as applicable to a title which, if it exists at all, is of such a shadowy character as to leave the goods subject to every debt and obligation of the husband contracted after a named date and to his control and disposition.\nBut I see no reason to doubt that the judgment was proved. The recital in the fi fa issued by the court is some evidence of a judgment though not of all the particulars concerning it; but there was also, as I understand, evidence of all the proceedings. The specially endorsed writ which Vas filed when judgment was entered was produced. Under Order XX., rule 1, the special endorsement constituted the statement of claim. The appearance was proved and the entry of judgment for default of defence under Order XXYII., rule 2, and in the form and manner provided by the statute. I think the objections supposed to exist had reference chiefly to the matter of misnomer which I have already disposed of.\nI think the judgment of the court ought to have been to dismiss the action.\nI have not overlooked the cross appeal of the plaintiff in the court below.\nThe appeal there was by the present appellant, and there was a cross appeal with respect to the findings of fact and the direction to the jury at the trial.\nThe appeal below was dismissed and the order made at the trial was varied in a matter of costs. The cross appeal was not otherwise dealt with, nor was it necessary formally to notice it inasmuch as the principal appeal was dismissed. In the opinions expressed in pronouncing judgment Mr. Justice Townshend was against the respondent on the matter of the cross appeal, and the Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Graham concurred, confined his observations in effect to the other branch of the case. The respondent now renews his objections to the charge and to the findings of fact.\nIn my opinion we cannot interfere as he invites us to do. I find evidence, which I need not discuss in detail, that justifies the findings, and I see no sufficient reason for ordering a new trial.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and action dismissed.\nSolicitor for appellant: Hector McInnes.\nSolicitor for respondent: W.

S. N. S. 5th ser., c. 92, ss. 4 and 11.\nThe act in force in Nova Scotia relating to bills of sale (R. S. N. S. 5th ser. c. 92) requires by section 4 that every such instrument shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the grantor, and section 11 provides that the affidavit shall be, as nearly as may be, in the form given in schedules to the act. The form prescribed begins as follows: I, A. B., of.................., in the County of............ (occupation) make oath and say. An affidavit accompanying a bill of sale having omitted to state the occupation of the grantor:\nHeld, per Strong, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. that as the affidavit referred in terms to the instrument itself, in which the occupation of the deponent was stated, the statute was complied with.\nPer Taschereau J. The onus was upon the persons attacking the bill of sale to prove, by direct evidence, that the grantor had an occupation which they had failed to do.\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was reversed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs are merchants of the city of Halifax who took a bill of sale from one Cunningham, of Sable Island, Lunenburg Co., as security for a debt. The statute governing bills of sale, R. S. N. S. 5th ser. ch. 92, provides that such an instrument must be accompanied by an affidavit \"as nearly as may be\" in the form given in a schedule. The affidavit in this case conformed to the statute in every respect save one, namely, that the occupation of the deponent was not given, the form in the schedule being \"I, A. B., of ................, in the County of............... (occupation) make oath and say,\" etc. W. C. Silver & Co., of Halifax, judgment creditors of Cunningham, seized under execution goods covered by the bill of sale and the same were replevied by the plaintiffs. On the trial of the action of replevin judgment was given for plaintiffs, the trial judge holding that if the mortgagor had an occupation it was sufficiently stated in the bill of sale itself to which reference was made in the affidavit. The full court reversed this decision holding that the statute had not been complied with and that the affidavit was bad on the authority of Archibald v. Hubley[1]. The plaintiffs appealed.\nWhitman for the appellants. The onus is on the parties attacking the bill of sale to show that the mortgagor had an occupation. Sutton v. Bath[2].\nThe evidence shows that he had no occupation, Trousdale v. Sheppard[3]; Ex parte Chapman[4]; Smith v. Cheese[5].\nThe object of requiring a description is to identify the party and he is sufficiently identified in this bill of sale. See Ex parte Wolfe[6].\nThis act has been construed to mean that the occupation is only to be stated when there is one; Cunningham v. Morse[7]; and it has been amended subject to such construction thus showing the intention of the legislature to approve of it. Windham v. Chetwynd[8]\nSilver for the respondent cited the following cases on the contention that the statute must be strictly complied with. Pickard v. Bretz[9]; Castle v. Downton[10]; Allen v. Thompson[11]; In re Lowenthal[12].\nAs to burden of proof the learned counsel argued that Sutton v. Bath[13] and similar cases cited only put the onus on the attacking party when he claimed that a wrong description had been given but not when none was given.\nSTRONG and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion, first, that the onus to allege and prove that the grantor of the bill of sale had an occupation was upon the defendant, now respondent; and secondly, that of such a fact direct evidence was required and not mere inferences from documents in the record.\nI would allow the appeal.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014We may assume for the purpose of this case that the word \"occupation,\" which appears in parenthesis or between brackets in the blank left in the form of affidavit given by the schedule of the statute, is meant to show that the deponent's occupation is to be stated in the affidavit, perhaps with some idea of identifying him with the grantor of the instrument to which the affidavit relates; but the facts of this case make it unnecessary at present to consider what would be the effect on the validity of the instrument of the grantor having no occupation, or of the omission to state his occupation, the blank being left unfilled, or, as might easily happen, some other equally apt description of the deponent being substituted. It is, I think, correctly remarked by Mr. Justice Graham in the court below that it appears from the deed executed by the grantor that he had an occupation and was a trader. That is a reasonable inference of fact from the deed which the plaintiff claims under, and which in this particular is legitimate evidence against the plaintiff. But whatever the deed shows respecting the grantor the affidavit also shows respecting the deponent who swears that he is the same person as the grantor. By this reference to the deed the occupation is shown and the statute satisfied.\nOn this short ground I think the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Alfred Whitman.\nSolicitor for respondent: Alfred E.

These bills not being paid at maturity notice of dishonour was given to V., the managing owner, who sent his son to the solicitors who held the bills for collection to request that the matter should stand over until the ship arrived at St. John where V. lived. This was acceded to and V. signed an agreement in the form of a letter addressed to the solicitors, in which, after asking them to delay proceedings on the draft for \u00a3753, he guaranteed, on the vessel's arrival or in case of her loss, payment of the said draft and charges and also payment of the draft for \u00a3173 and charges. On the vessel's arrival, however, he refused to pay the smaller draft and to an action on his said guarantee he pleaded payment and that he was induced to sign the same by fraud. By order of a judge the pleas of payment were struck out.\nOn the trial the son of V. who had interviewed the solicitors swore that they told him that both bills were for disbursements, but it did not clearly appear that he repeated this to his father. V. himself contradicted his son and stated that he knew that the smaller bill was for difference in freight, and there was other evidence to the same effect. His counsel sought to get rid of the effect of V.'s evidence by showing that from age and infirmity he was incapable of remembering the circumstance, but a verdict was given against him. It was admitted that if there had been any misrepresentation by the solicitors it was innocent misrepresentation only.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, that the defence of misrepresentation set up was not available to V. under the plea of fraud, and, therefore, was not pleaded; that if available without plea it was not proved; that nothing could be gained by ordering another trial as, V. having died, his evidence would have to be read to the jury who, in view of his statement that he knew the bill was not for disbursements, could not do otherwise than find a verdict against him.\nHeld, further, that the delay asked for by V. was sufficient consideration to make him liable on his guarantee, even assuming that he would not have been originally liable as owner of the ship.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] refusing to set aside a judgment for the plaintiff and order a non-suit or new trial.\nThe following statement of the facts of the case is taken from the judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser in the court below:\u2014\nThis is an action brought to recover from the defendant \u00a3173 9s. 1d. sterling, the difference of freight coming to the plaintiffs under the charter party of the ship Eurydice, of the burden of 1,247 tons register, of which the defendant was a part owner.\nThe charter party was made on the 13th October, 1881, between S. Vaughan & Co., agents for the owners of the ship, of the first part, and the plaintiffs, who were merchants at Savannah, doing business by the name and style of Richardson & Barnard, of the second part. The voyage was to be from Savannah to Liverpool, Havre or Bremen direct, as might be ordered on signing bills of lading. The parties of the second part agreed to pay the party of the first part for the charter or freight of the vessel during the voyage, the sum of thirty-five shillings per net register ton. The captain was to sign bills of lading at any rate of freight as and when presented on gross receipts without prejudice to the charter party, any difference between charter party and bills of lading to be adjusted at Savannah before the vessel sailed; if in vessel's favour, to be paid in cash at the current rate of exchange, less insurance, if in charterer's favour to be secured by captain's bill, payable ten days after arrival at the port of discharge; sufficient cash for ship's disbursements to be advanced by the charterers (if desired by master) at current rate of exchange at port of loading, charging 2 1\/2 per cent commission, and current rate of insurance, to be secured by captain's bill, payable ten days after arrival at port of discharge.\nThe vessel was loaded at Savannah, and was ordered to go to Bremen or Bremerhaven.\nThe amount of the disbursements account was \u00a3753 5s. 4d. sterling, and the difference of freight coming to plaintiffs as charterers was made up and agreed upon at Savanah at \u00a3173 9s. 1d. sterling, the difference of freight being in their favour.\nRobert M. Vaughan, the son of the defendant, had been sent by him to Savannah to look after the vessel, and had, it appeared, a full power of attorney to act for the defendant.\nInstead of the account for disbursements and the difference of freight being secured by the captain's bills payable ten days after arrival at the port of discharge, by arrangement between Robert M. Vaughan and the plaintiffs, the captain gave two bills, of date the 20th March, 1882, on S. Vaughan & Co., of Liverpool, for the \u00a3753 5s. 4d. sterling, and \u00a3173 9s. 1d. sterling, respectively, and each payable sixty days after sight.\nS. Vaughan & Co. were, as already stated, the agents who acted for the owners in the making of the charter party. Simon Vaughan of this firm was, as appeared by the evidence, a part owner of the vessel, and was managing owner of her down to the 12th June, 1882. S. Vaughan & Co. acted as defendant's agents at Liverpool and as agents for the ship, and did all the business connected with her.\nThe bill of exchange for \u00a3173 9s. 1d. sterling is in the words and figures following:\u2014\nAccepted 5th April, 1882, payable at Messrs. Barnett, Hoares.& Co., London, on the 7th June, 1882. (Sgd.) S. Vaughan & Co.\nSavannah, Ga., 20th March, 1882.\nExchange for \u00a3173 9s. 1d.\nPayable in London.\nSixty days after sight of this first of exchange (second and third of same tenor and date unpaid) pay to the order of Richardson and Barnard one hundred and seventy-three pounds nine shillings one penny sterling, value received, for necessary difference in freight of my vessel at this port, for which, besides the responsibility of the owners, my vessel and freight are hereby hypothecated.\n(Signed) W. W. Sprague,\nMaster of ship \"Eurydice.\"\nTo Messrs. S. Vaughan & Co.,\nLiverpool, Eng.\nThe bill of exchange being accepted was duly protested for non-payment and being dishonoured notice of dishonour was, inter alia, given to the defendant on the 17th June, 1882, by the plaintiffs through their attorneys in this suit, Messrs. Seely & McMillan. The notice of dishonour was addressed to the defendant, as follows: \"To Henry Vaughan, part owner and managing owner of the ship Eurydice.\"\nThe defendant who, all through these transactions, owned 20-64 shares of the ship, became managing owner on the 12th June, 1882.\nThe firm of S. Vaughan & Co. failed after the acceptance and before the maturity of the two bills.\nFinding that the bills were about to be dishonoured the plaintiff, Richardson, came on to St. John and retained the firm of Seely & McMillan, of that city, attorneys-at-law, to give notice of dishonour of the bills to the defendant, and to collect the amount of them from him.\nThe notices of dishonour were given as already stated for the \u00a3173 9s. 1d. bill, and also for the disbursement bill, \u00a3753 5s. 4d.\nThe defendant upon receiving notice of dishonour of the bills sent his son, Lorenzo H. Vaughan, to Seely & McMillan who said they had the bills of exchange which had been protested for non-payment and that they were for disbursements, and asked him what arrangements would be made about the matter, when he said his father would like the matter held over until he could communicate with the other owners, and on that understanding an agreement was drawn up, taken by him to his father, signed by him and returned to Seely & McMillan.\nThe agreement is as follows: \u2014\nSt. John, N.B., June 19th, 1882.\nTo Messrs. Seely & McMillan,\nAttorneys for Richardson & Barnard:\nDear Sirs,\u2014I ask you to delay proceeding on the captain's draft, ship Eurydice, for \u00a3753 5s. 4d until the vessel's arrival here, and on such arrival here, or in case of her loss or of any delay happening to her, I guarantee immediate payment of the said draft, with cost of protest, re-exchange, interest, and charges of sending notices.\nAnd I also guarantee payment of a draft for \u00a3173 9s. 1d. drawn by the master of the same vessel, with above charges.\nHenry Vaughan.\nWitness: L. H. Vaughan.\nIn one of the counts in the declaration this agreement is set out and the defendant is sought to be made liable on the \u00a3173 9s. 1d. sterling bill by virtue of the agreement. Application was made to Mr. Justice King to set aside certain of the pleas and his order made thereon was the subject of an application to the Supreme Court to rescind such order. Richardson v. Vaughan[2].\nThe ship Eurydice arrived in Saint John about the 1st August, 1882, and on that day the defendant paid the \u00a3753 5s. 4d. bill, but declined to pay the bill for \u00a3173 9s. 1d., saying to Mr. McMillan that he was consulting Mr. C. A. Palmer about it, and afterwards Mr. Palmer said he would accept service of a writ for defendant when this suit was commenced.\nThe principal objections to the right of the plaintiffs to maintain action were that what took place at Savannah, i. e., the taking of the captain's draft, payable at 60 days after sight, instead of ten days after the arrival of the vessel at the port of discharge, as per the terms of the charter party, relieved the owners of the vessel from liability, and left the whole liability against the captain upon the draft; that there was no consideration for the defendant's alleged promise to pay in his letter to Seely & McMillan; that there was no evidence to show that the plaintiffs agreed to give time; that Seely & McMillan had no authority to make the agreement, and no assent of plaintiffs to the agreement to give time; that the direction of plaintiffs to the master to remit the whole of the freight to S. Vaughan & Co., and the remittance of the freight accordingly, amounted to payment; that there was improper rejection of evidence in refusing to allow a witness to state what S. Vaughan & Co. said to him as to the receipt of the freight, and misrepresentation by McMillan to Lorenzo Vaughan before the agreement of the 19th June was signed, in stating that both of the bills (the \u00a3173 9s. 1d. bill, as well as the \u00a3753 5s. 4d bill) were for disbursements. The trial of the action resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs and a motion to set the same aside and order a non-suit or new trial was refused. The defendant having died in the meantime the action was revived in favour of his executors who appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBarker Q.C. and Palmer Q.C. for the appellants. The defendant was prejudiced on his trial by the striking out of the pleas of payment. Wallingford v. Mutual Society[3].\nOn the merits the verdict was not justified by the evidence which proved misrepresentation.\nHazen and Currey for the respondents referred to Harris v. Venables[4]; Alliance Bank v. Brown[5]; Callisher v. Bischoffsheim[6].\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts are fully set forth in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser who tried the cause, and to this I refer for a statement of them.\nIt does not seem to be at all material to consider what was the effect of the agreement entered into by Robert Vaughan, as the agent of his father, with the respondents at Savannah, in pursuance of which the two bills, the payment of which was guaranteed by Henry Vaughan, were drawn by the captain on the firm of S. Vaughan & Co., of Liverpool, the larger one for disbursements for the ship and the smaller one, the recovery of which is sought in this action, for the difference between the chartered freight payable to the owners of the Eurydice and the freight to be received for the cargo at Bremerhaven.\nI incline to think that S. Vaughan & Co. must be taken to have accepted this bill, not as owners of the ship but as agents of the respondents and for their accommodation. I do not, however, enter into any further consideration of this question for I agree with Mr. Justice Fraser that, even assuming Mr. Henry Vaughan not to have been liable at all for the payment of the bill for \u00a3173 9s. 1d. drawn against the difference of freight, he would still, though an entire stranger to that transaction, have been liable on the guarantee. This bill had been placed in the hands of Messrs. Seely & McMillan at St. John, the attorneys for the respondents, with instructions to collect it. Mr. Henry Vaughan, in order to obtain time and in consideration of delay which was in fact granted, gave the guarantee contained in his letter to Messrs. Seely & McMillan of the 19th June, 1882. There was clearly consideration for this guarantee, and conceding that Henry Vaughan was a mere surety he would therefore be liable upon it unless the appellants can show some good defence to the respondents' action.\nIt is contended that such a defence is made out. It is said that Mr. McMillan made a representation, not, it is conceded, intended to be fraudulent but which was untrue in fact, which induced Henry Vaughan to give the guarantee. The first question upon this head is: Has this defence been properly pleaded? The only plea upon the record which can be referred to as setting up this defence is that of fraud. It is, however, clear, as was admitted by the learned counsel for the appellants on the argument of the appeal, that no fraud, that is moral fraud such as the plea must be construed to allege, was proved. What, if anything, was proved was innocent misrepresentation on the part of Mr. McMillan in representing to Lorenzo Vaughan, the son of Mr. Henry Vaughan, that the smaller bill was drawn not against the difference of freight but, like the larger one, on account of disbursements for the ship. It would be necessary then, in the first place, in order to let in this defence, to permit the appellants to add a plea to the record. This, in my opinion, ought not now to be done after the great delay which has taken place and at this stage of the litigation, especially as such an amendment does not seem to have been applied for at the trial. No doubt any misrepresentation on the part of the creditor or his agent which may mislead a surety and induce him to enter into a contract of suretyship constitutes a good defence provided it is properly pleaded. But not only has this defence not been pleaded but it does not appear from the evidence at the trial that it would be sustained in point of fact even if it were pleaded. Mr. Henry Vaughan in his evidence states that he knew that this bill for \u00a3173 9s. 1d. was not drawn for ship's disbursements but was drawn on account of freight, and that he signed the guarantee knowing and believing this. It is suggested that Mr. Vaughan, who has since died, was at the time of the trial, from age and infirmity, incapacitated from giving a reliable account of the circumstances under which he was induced to sign the guarantee, but should we grant a new trial his evidence must be read to the jury who in the face of it could hardly find otherwise than for the plaintiffs. Moreover, there is another circumstance mentioned in the following passage from the judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser which confirms Henry Vaughan's evidence in this respect. The learned judge says:\nIf anything further were wanting to show that the defendant had previous to the agreement full knowledge that the smaller bill was for difference of freight it would be this, that Robert M. Vaughan in his evidence states that he sent from Savannah to the defendant at St. John the plaintiffs' letter relating to the remittance of the difference of freight to S. Vaughan & Co., and this letter would explain to him why the whole freight was to be remitted to S. Vaughan & Co.\nReferring to the deposition of Mr. Robert M. Vaughan I find this statement of Mr. Justice Fraser as to the purport of his evidence entirely borne out. Mr. Robert M. Vaughan appears to have assented somewhat reluctantly to the proposition that the provision of the charter party as to payment of freight should be so far derogated from that the whole freight should be remitted to S. Vaughan & Co. at Liverpool, and that the captain should draw on that firm against it in favour of the respondents as the respondents desired, but that he at last did so on the understanding that a letter explaining the transaction should be given to him; that such a letter addressed to the captain of the vessel was accordingly written and signed by the respondents, and that this letter, which appears to have been lost, was given to him. And upon being asked by one of the learned counsellor the appellants: What was done with that letter? the witness answers: \"It was sent to Mr. Henry Vaughan, St. John.\"\nFurther, it is by no means clear from the evidence of Mr. Lorenzo Vaughan, who says that it was to him that Mr. McMillan made the representation that this bill was on account of the ship's expenses, that he communicated such representation to his father.\nMr. Lorenzo Vaughan's evidence on this point is as follows:\u2014\"In answer to a letter received from them\" Messrs. Seely & McMillan), \"I called; they said they had the bills of exchange which had been protested for non-payment, and that they were for disbursements, and they asked me what arrangements would be made about the matter, and I said my father would like the matter held over until he could communicate with the other owners. On that understanding the agreement was drawn up and my father signed it and it was returned to them.\"\nIt is somewhat ambiguous from the statement of the witness whether he means to say that the agreement was signed by his father On the understanding referred to, or whether he is only then referring to the agreement being drawn up. Conceding, however, that Mr. Lorenzo Vaughan meant to say that his father did sign the guarantee on the understanding that the smaller bill was for disbursements and not for difference of freight he is directly contradicted by Mr. Henry Vaughan himself, who says in answer to his own counsel that his son when he came back from seeing Seely & McMillan told him (the defendant) what Seely & McMillan had told him (the son); and being further asked \"what was it?\" the defendant answered, \"the large bill was for disbursements and the other for difference of freight. They chartered the ship.\"\nIn the face of this evidence already on record, from which it appears that the defendant admitted that he knew that the bill was for freight, a statement which derives confirmation from the evidence of Robert Vaughan as to his disposition of the letter to Captain Sprague before referred to, it would not, in my opinion, be proper to send the case down to another trial in order that the issue on this defence of misrepresentation, which is not at present upon the record, might be tried. More especially is this so when we find the only evidence in support of it at the former trial, that of Mr. Lorenzo Vaughan, contradicted and neutralized by that of the original defendant himself. With this evidence before them no jury could be expected to do otherwise than to find a verdict for the respondents.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014No appeal lies, in my opinion, from the order striking out the 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 12th pleas, and did an appeal lie I would not interfere with the ruling of the court below on such a question. On the merits I am of opinion that there is no ground for directing a non-suit, or for disturbing the verdict entered for the plaintiffs. I have nothing to add to Mr. Justice Tuck's and Mr. Justice Fraser's opinions in the court below.\nGWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C.

Ritchie C.J. was present at the argument but died before judgment was delivered.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nContract\u2014Application for insurance\u2014Agreement to forward\u2014Evidence\u2014Escrow.\nB. wishing to insure his vessel the C. U. Chandler went to a firm of insurance brokers who filled out an application and sent it by a clerk to K., agent for a foreign marine insurance company. In the application the vessel was valued at $2,500 and the rate of premium was fixed at 11 p.c. K. refused to forward the application unless the valuation was raised to $3,000 or 12 p.c. premium was paid. This was not acceded to by the brokers but K. filled out an application with the valuation increased and forwarded it to the head office of his company. On the day that it was mailed the vessel was lost and four days after K. received a telegram from the attorney of the company at the head office as follows: \"Chandler having been in trouble we have telegraphed you declining risk, but had previously mailed policy; please decline risk and return policy.\" The policy was received by K. next day and returned at once; he did not show it to the brokers nor to B. nor inform them of its receipt. In an action by B. against K. to recover damages for neglect in not forwarding the application promptly, with a count in trover for conversion of the policy:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as K. was never authorized nor requested to forward the application which he did forward, namely, that in which the vessel was valued at $3,000, and had refused to forward the only application authorized by the brokers on behalf of B., the latter could maintain no action founded on negligence.\nHeld, further, that as the property in the policy prepared at the head office and sent to K. never passed out of the company and was at the most no more than an escrow in the hands of K., the agent, trover would not lie against K. for its conversion.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick ordering, on motion of the defendant pursuant to leave reserved, a new trial on terms, or in default of the terms being agreed to a non-suit.\nThe facts of the case will sufficiently appear from the above head-note and the following judgments.\nPalmer Q.C. for appellants.\nMcLeod Q.C. for respondent.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The question is simply one of fact: Did the plaintiffs ever authorize Whittaker Bros. to accept such a policy as that they now seek to get the benefit of in this action?\nUpon the evidence it is plain that they never did. The only policy which the plaintiffs authorized Whittakers to procure for them upon the C. U. Chandler was one for $800 on a valuation of $2,500 at a premium of 11 p.c., whilst that which they now claim to be entitled to is one insuring $800 on a valuation of $3,000 at 11 p.c., and consequently at a premium which the plaintiffs never authorized. If the insurance company had sued for the premium it is manifest that they could not possibly have recovered.\nThe plaintiffs had never, before the policy was recalled by the company, assented to the terms of such a policy and they cannot, therefore, now sue for a conversion of it treating it as their policy. The instrument was, at the most, never anything more than an escrow in the hands of the company's own agents.\nAs regards negligence on the part of the defendant, which is charged in the first count of the declaration, there never was any privity between the plaintiffs and the defendant. The Whittakers never had authority to constitute Knowlton a sub-agent, and they dealt with him as the agent of the insurance company and in that character only. Knowlton, consequently, never owed any duty to the plaintiffs and the charge of negligence, therefore, wholly fails on the evidence.\nIn my opinion the rule absolute for a non-suit in default of the plaintiffs complying with the terms on which a new trial was granted to him was a proper disposition of the case. This appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Upon the question of amendment, as upon the whole of the controversy, I adopt Mr Justice Tuck's reasoning in the court below. The appellants have not proved the averments of their declaration. The rule for a non-suit or for a new trial upon terms must stand. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiffs have wholly failed to maintain the allegations in their statement of claim which are made the foundation of this action. The first count is framed upon the allegation that the plaintiffs, at the request of the defendant, retained and employed the defendant to cause to be made an insurance upon a ship of the plaintiffs called the C. U. Chandler for reward to be paid to the defendant in that behalf, and that the defendant accepted and entered upon such retainer and employment but neglected to effect the insurance and that the ship was lost, to the plaintiffs' damage, etc. Now, the evidence shows that no such contract as that alleged was ever entered into by the defendant, that, in point of fact, the plaintiffs never did retain or employ the defendant to effect any insurance upon the ship in question nor did the defendant ever undertake so to do. On the contrary what the evidence shows is that the plaintiffs retained and employed certain insurance brokers, practising as such under the name of Whittaker Brothers, to effect an insurance for $800.00 on the vessel valued at $2500.00, at the rate of 11 per cent premium, and that Messrs. Whittaker sent their clerk to the defendant, who was the agent at St. John, New Brunswick, of the Portland Marine Insurance Company, whose head office and place of business was at the City of Portland, in the State of Maine, for the purpose of procuring the defendant as such agent of the said insurance company to forward the said application to the said company, and that the defendant refused to forward such application or any application unless the plaintiffs should accept a policy wherein the vessel should be valued at $3,000.00 at such premium of 11 per cent or would pay 12 per cent on a valuation of $2500.00. The clerk of Messrs. Whittaker being unable to concur in such an arrangement was instructed by the defendant to communicate with his principals, and the defendant never did forward the application as proposed by the Messrs. Whittaker on the plaintiffs' behalf nor did he ever undertake so to do. But what he did do appears to have been that in the expectation that the Messrs. Whittaker would arrange with the plaintiffs that they should concur in the defendant's suggestion, which, however, they never did, he made application to the Portland Marine Insurance Company for a policy for $800 on the plaintiffs' vessel, valued at $3,000 at 11 p.c. premium. The letter enclosing this application would seem not to have been mailed at St. John until Sunday the 7th October, 1888. Upon the 11th of October the defendant received from his company a telegram from Portland as follows:\u2014\nChandler having been in trouble we have telegraphed you declining risk, but had previously mailed policy. Please decline risk and return policy. In fact upon the 8th October, and before ever the policy could have been prepared, the vessel had become a total loss occasioned by a fire which had arisen from lime with which she was loaded. Upon the following day, the 12th October, the defendant received by mail the policy wherein the vessel was valued at $3,000, and which in obedience to the telegram received the day before he returned to his company. It is plain that upon this state of facts the plaintiffs cannot recover upon the first count in their statement of claim because no such contract as therein alleged, nor any contract, was entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendant whereby the latter undertook for reward or otherwise to procure a policy of insurance upon their ship for the plaintiffs; neither can the plaintiffs recover upon the 2nd count, which is for conversion by the defendant of a policy upon their ship the property of the plaintiffs, for the policy which was received by the defendant on the 12th of October, and was returned by him to his company, never had been applied for by the plaintiffs\u2014nor had they ever agreed to accept such a policy. It is obvious, therefore, that it never had become the property of the plaintiffs, but still continued to be the property of the company in the hands of the defendant as their agent, and subject to their order and control. The appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The gist of the first count of the declaration, which is somewhat long, is that the plaintiffs, who are the present appellants, at the request of the defendant, the respondent, retained the defendant to effect for them a policy of marine insurance upon their ship; that the defendant neglected to effect the insurance; and that the vessel was lost by perils that were to have been insured against. The defendant lives at St. John and is the provincial correspondent of an association of marine underwriters doing business at Portland in Maine.\nThe plaintiffs desiring to effect an insurance of $800 on a ship, the C. U. Chandler, went to an insurance broker at St. John named Whittaker, and in his office signed an application for insurance, filling up the blank for the whole value of the vessel with the sum of $2,500.\nMr. Whittaker prepared another application, signing it with his own name, for insurance on the vessel in the name and on account of the plaintiffs, giving the same valuation of $2,500. He sent that application by a clerk to the defendant, and the defendant declined to forward it to the Portland association unless the valuation was put at $3,000, or, as he says, unless in the alternative the rate was made 12 per cent in place of 11 per cent. There is a conflict of evidence between the defendant on the one side and Whittaker and his clerk on the other as to whether the defendant went with the clerk, or went at all, immediately after receiving the application to Whittaker's office, but it is shown by Whittaker as well as by his clerk that the clerk informed Whittaker that the defendant required the valuation changed.\nThis all happened on Friday, the 5th of October, 1888. The vessel was then loading or loaded with lime at St. John. One of the plaintiffs had charge of her as master, and he gave charge of her to another master on Saturday evening, the vessel being then at anchor in the harbour of St. John. She was injured by a gale on Sunday, and early on Monday the 8th of October she was on fire from the sea water having got at the lime.\nIf nothing further had occurred than what I have mentioned how did the defendant incur any liability to the plaintiffs? The plaintiffs' case under the first count is based on the proposition that a contract existed between the plaintiffs and the defendant, a promise by the defendant to effect the insurance, or at all events to forward the application, being supported by a consideration arising from the compliance by the plaintiffs with the standing request made by the defendant to all insurers to send their applications through his hands. I do not for the moment touch the dispute concerning the form of the count.\nThis proposition may, in point of law, be sound or may be open to dispute, and it may or may not appear, on close examination, to apply to transactions of the class of that before us. We need not at this moment pronounce upon those questions. If the defendant declined to forward the application in the shape in which it was given to him it is impossible to infer a contract to forward it, or to effect a policy in the terms of it, from his being engaged in that line of business. That he did so decline is proved by the evidence given on the part of the plaintiffs by Whittaker's clerk and by Whittaker also who speaks of what the clerk told him. The defendant is distinct on the same point. There is the curious discrepancy as to whether the defendant was or was not at Whittaker's office and in communication at the particular time with Whittaker. But even if Whittaker and his clerk are correct in saying he was there then, nothing that they say took place displaces the evidence of the fact that he insisted on the change of valuation. The only thing that can be said to look in that direction is Whittaker's statement that he asked the defendant if he had received the application all right and that the defendant said he had. That is indefinite enough, and there is not a word of the defendant receding from his position about the valuation, or being spoken to on the subject by Whittaker to whom the clerk had reported what had been said, or of the subject being mentioned, although according to the clerk it was to speak of it the defendant went to Whittaker's office. Oh the contrary the evidence is that it was not spoken of.\nI do not understand it to be contended that, apart from such a contract as might be inferred from the delivery to and acceptance by the defendant of an application for insurance, the defendant owed any duty to the plaintiffs. They could not insist on his acting on an application which he chose to say he would not act on.\nThe defendants sent an application to the underwriters association but it was not the one he received from Whittaker. It was a fresh one prepared by himself, putting the value of the vessel at $3,000. In place of sending it by Friday evening's mail, which would be delivered in Portland on Saturday afternoon, he seems to have omitted mailing his letter till Sunday evening. A policy was sent to him, but before he delivered it to the plaintiffs or to Whittaker it was recalled by telegraph, and was returned by him to Portland. That was no doubt because of the loss of the vessel which had taken place before the application had reached the Portland office.\nThe second count, which was added at the trial, is in trover for that policy.\nI see no ground for differing from the majority of the court below with regard to that policy. It did not become the property of the plaintiffs. The application for it was unauthorized by them. They were not bound to accept it, and might have refused to do so if it had been offered to them.\nFor these reasons, and without entering into some other questions that have been discussed, I am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C. A. Palmer.\nSolicitors for respondent: E. & R. McLeod.\n"}

On such taxation evidence was taken before the taxing officer, who, in his report, found as follows:\u2014\n\u201cI further find that the plaintiffs are bound to give credit to the, defendant, Edward Oscar Bickford, for the sum of $4,000 received by the plaintiff, Hector Cameron, from the defendant, John McDougall, as set forth in the evidence of the said plaintiff, Hector Cameron, taken before me.\u201d\nBy the evidence referred to it appeared that the $4,000 was paid to Cameron under the following circumstances. The firm of solicitors were acting for all the defendants in negotiations for the sale of the Grand Junction Railway to the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the defendants having quarrelled Bickford declared he would not sell. McDougall thereupon said to Cameron that if he could get the agreement signed by Bickford and by Hickson, manager of the Grand Trunk, he, McDougall, would pay Cameron $4,000. Cameron performed the service of getting the agreement signed and received the $4,000, but it never went into the funds or accounts of his firm.\nThe plaintiffs appealed from the report of the taxing officer to the Divisional Court where the appeal was allowed and the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, pending which appeal Bickford made a settlement with Cameron by which he abandoned his right to the said sum of $4,000. The other defendants con- tinued the appeal on their own behalf, and the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the Divisional Court. The defendants then appealed to this court.\nRiddell and Nesbitt for the appellants referred, on the question of the right to appeal which was raised by the court, to O\u2019Donohoe v. Beatty[1], and on the merits to Cooper v. Ewart[2]; Russel v. Buchanan[3].\nRitchie Q.C. for the respondents.\nSTRONG J. I have great doubts as to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain this appeal, but assuming that there is jurisdiction it appears to me that the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal was perfectly right and must be sustained for the reasons given by them.\nThe set off of the $4,000 paid by McDougall to Mr. Cameron was originally claimed, not by McDougall but by Bickford. Bickford afterwards abandoned all claim to it but the taxing officer having allowed the credit insisted on McDougall supported it, and now appeals in order to have it allowed to him.\nIn the first place McDougall seeks to set off in this action, brought to recover a debt for solicitors\u2019 costs alleged to be due to Messrs. Cameron and Appelbe jointly, a separate debt which he claims to be due to him from Cameron alone.\nUnless we are to apply different principles as regards the law of set-off in an action by solicitors against a client to recover costs, a proposition for which no authority has been or could be quoted, it is very plain that the ordinary rule that a debtor cannot, when sued by joint creditors, set off a debt due to him by one of them, in other words, the rule that mutuality is of the essence of set off, must be conclusive against the appellants\u2019 contention. Upon that ground alone the appeal must be dismissed. I am of opinion, however, that the additional reason assigned by Mr. Justice Osler in his judgment, namely, that this was not a payment to Cameron on account of professional services generally, but a specific payment for a specific service rendered by him to McDougall, not as a partner in the firm of McDougall, Bickford & Cowans, but to him personally, in procuring the signature of the agreement by Mr. Hickson and Mr. Bickford, is also conclusive. McDougall has made no case showing that he is entitled to recover back the payment and could not on the facts have made any such case. Whether Bickford had any equity which he might have asserted in an action against Cameron in respect of this payment is a matter which we need not inquire into as he abandoned all claim to such relief, and as, moreover, such an equity would not in any case be the proper subject of inquiry in this action as a set-off or otherwise.\nUpon both grounds the decision of the Court of Appeal must be upheld and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The objection taken by the respondent against this appeal should, in my opinion, prevail. This is not an appeal from a final judgment. I would quash, no costs.\nGWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong for dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants McDougall & Cowans: Riddell, Armstrong & Nesbitt.\nSolicitors for appellants executors of E.O.

Notice of abandonment was given to the underwriters on the hull. The cargo was not insured. The owners of the cargo offered to take it out of the vessel but the underwriters preferred to do it themselves and an average bond was executed by the underwriters and owners by which they respectively agreed to pay the said loss according to their several shares in the vessel, her earnings as freight and her cargo, the same to be stated and apportioned in accordance with the established usage and law of the province in similar cases by a named adjuster. Efforts having been made to save both vessel and cargo, resulting in a portion of the latter being taken out but the remainder and the vessel being abandoned, the adjuster apportioned the loss making the greater part payable by the owners of the cargo. In an action on the bond to recover this amount:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the owners of the cargo were only liable, under the bond, to pay such amount as would be legally due according to the principles of the law relating to general average; that the cargo and vessel were never in that common peril which is the foundation of the right to claim for general average; that the money expended, beyond what was the actual cost of the salvage of the cargo saved, was in no sense expended for the benefit of the cargo owners; and the defendants having paid into court a sum sufficient to cover such actual cost the underwriters were not entitled to a greater amount.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2] which also affirmed the decision of Boyd C.[3] in favour of the defendants.\nThe claim in question arose under the following circumstances:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs were insurers of the schooner Gleniffer, which was stranded in the Humber Bay, a few miles from Toronto, on 27th November, 1889, whilst attempting to make the port of Toronto, bound from the port of Oswego, and laden with a cargo of coal belonging to the defendants, which was uninsured, and she was abandoned by her master and crew.\nOn the morning of the 28th November the owner of the vessel\u2014one Matthews\u2014called upon Mr. Kenny, the managing director of the appellant company, and notified him of the loss, and either on that or the following day he gave written notice of abandonment to the underwriters.\nMr. Kenny without delay secured the services of Captain Donnelly an experienced and successful wrecker, who visited the vessel at the earliest opportunity and who, after consideration, advised that the best course to take was to make an attempt to save both vessel and cargo.\nThe plaintiffs also secured by telegram, and with the utmost possible despatch, a wrecking expedition from Port Colborne, which was on the spot as soon as the exigencies of the weather would permit.\nOwing to stress of weather the wrecking expedition was not able to commence work until 2nd December, on which day the defendants gave notice to the plaintiffs to the effect that unless the latter would commence and continue delivering the coal in question on or before the 4th December, the defendants would proceed to unload the same, and would look to the underwriters for any damage suffered by reason of delay.\nOn the following day, and before any of the coal was delivered, the plaintiffs and defendants executed an average bond which, after setting out the loss of the vessel, contained the following covenant:\u2014\nNow we, the subscribers, being owners, shippers or consignees, or the agents or attorneys of owners, shippers or consignees, of said vessel or cargo, or underwriters on said vessel, cargo or freight, do hereby, for ourselves, our executors and administrators, and our principals, severally and respectively, but not jointly, nor one for the other, covenant and agree to and with each other, and also separately to and with the owners and underwriters of the said schooner Gleniffer, that the loss and damage aforesaid, and such other incidental expenses thereon as shall be made to appear to be due from us, the subscribers to these presents, or our principals either as owners, shippers or consignees of said vessel or cargo, or as underwriters upon said vessel, cargo or freight, shall be paid by us respectively, according to our parts or shares in the said vessel, her earnings as freight, and her said cargo, or our interest therein, or responsibility therefor, and that such losses and expenses be stated and apportioned in accordance with the established usage and laws of this province in similar cases, by Captain Robert Thomas, Adjuster of Marine Losses.\nThis bond was signed by their manager for the appellant company and the respondent company as owners of the cargo.\nAfter the execution of the said bond coal to the extent of 578 900\/2000 tons were removed from the vessel and delivered to the respondents, and attempts were made to save the vessel but without success, and she was accordingly abandoned. Only a small portion of the material was saved. After the expenditure had been incurred the matter was placed in the hands of Captain Robert Thomas for adjustment, and the total expenditure as found by him was $2,551.98, which was apportioned as follows:\u2014\nTo the appellants, as the owners of the material saved.....................................\n$ 237 53\nTo respondents, as the owners of the cargo, the sum of...................................\n2,314 45\n$ 2,551 98\nThe claim of the plaintiffs is for the amount apportioned against the defendant company, viz., the said sum of $2,314.45 and interest thereon, the whole expenditure, as is admitted, having been paid by the plaintiffs.\nThe defendants, without admitting liability, paid into court $557.98, which they alleged to be the amount for which they could have procured the delivery of the coal saved from the vessel to their docks in Toronto. The plaintiffs declined to accept it.\nThe action was tried before the Chancellor of Ontario, by whom it was dismissed and the money in court was directed to be paid to the plaintiffs. This decision was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nOsler Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C. for the appellants. This loss was the subject of general average. Kemp v. Halliday[4]; Svensden v. Wallace[5]; Job v. Langton[6]; Moran v. Jones[7]; Grover v. Bullock[8].\nThe vessel and cargo were in a common danger and the expenditure was made for the preservation of both. The case is therefore within the rule laid down by Brett M.R. in Svensden v. Wallace5; see also Walthew v. Mavrojani[9]; Nelson v. Belmont[10]. Lowndes on General Average[11], under the head of \u201cComplex Salvage Operations,\u201d where the cases are collected.\nDelamare Q.C. for the respondents cited Kemp v. Halliday4; Gerow v. British American Assurance Co.[12]; Dancey v. Burns[13]; Anderson v. Ocean SS. Co.[14]\nSTRONG J.\u2014The average bond sued upon must, I think, be construed, as all the three courts below have construed it, as an obligation to pay such sums as should be legally due according to the principles of the law relating to general average. The question, therefore, is whether beyond the amount paid into court anything is shown to have been due by the respondents in respect of general average.\nIt seems very clear, as has been successively held by the learned Chancellor who tried the cause, and by the unanimous judgments of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and the Court of Appeal, that nothing was properly due from the respondents.\nIn the first place the coal which formed the schooner\u2019s cargo and the vessel herself were never in that common peril which is the very foundation of the right to claim for general average. The money expended, beyond what was the actual cost of the salvage of the coal saved and which is covered by the money paid into court, was in no sense expended for the benefit of the cargo owners. The respondents offered to discharge their coal themselves at their own expense, but the underwriters refused this and insisted upon keeping the coal on board. This they clearly had no right to do.\nThe case of Kemp v. Halliday[15] is a conclusive authority in favour of the respondents. In that case Mr. Justice Blackburn says:\nI do not mean to say that in every case where a ship with a cargo is submerged and the two are in fact raised together by one operation the expenditure must necessarily be for the common preservation of both. I think it is in every case a question of fact whether it was so; and if the cargo could be easily and cheaply taken out of the ship and saved by itself it would not be proper to charge it to any portion of the joint operation which in that case would not be incurred for the preservation of the cargo.\nIt is abundantly proved in the present case that the coal could have been more cheaply saved by itself, as the respondents proposed it should be, than by the expensive and risky operations necessary to save the schooner, operations which, moreover, proved fruitless as regards the vessel. The case of Kemp v. Halliday was on appeal affirmed by the Exchequer Chamber[16].\nIn Job v. Langlon[17] the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had previously pronounced a similar decision; and in Walthew v. Mavrojani[18], the Court of Exchequer Chamber approved of the decision of Job v. Langton17.\nMr. Carver in his work on Carriage by Sea[19] thus states the law as settled by the decided cases:\nIf for example a ship is sunk with her cargo and the whole is raised together at an expense which, if made good by general average contributions, would throw a burden on the cargo greater than the cost of saving it separately, the whole expense ought not to be so treated.\nAnd again[20] the same learned writer says:\nThe burden thrown on the cargo must not be greater than the expense of saving it by itself.\nThe amount paid into court is ample to cover the cost which would have been actually incurred in sav- ing the cargo by itself, and if the above authorities are law, which there is no reason to doubt, that is the utmost amount for which the respondents could be made liable, which is conclusive of the case in their favour.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. Chief Justice Hagarty\u2019s judgment in the Court of Appeal seems to me unanswerable.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The true construction of the agreement, in my opinion, is that the respondents would pay to the appellants whatever amount, when settled by Capt. Thomas in accordance with the law of the province, should be found to be due by them for general average on their cargo. If nothing was so due, and clearly under the circumstances nothing was, nothing was recoverable under the bond. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\nSolicitors for respondents: Urquhart & Urquhart.\n[1] 19 Ont.

Ritchie C.J. was present at the argument but died before judgment was delivered.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Specific performance\u2014Time for completion\u2014Extension\u2014Rescission\u2014Conduct of party seeking relief\u2014Laches.\nThe exercise of the jurisdiction to order specific performance of a contract is a matter of judicial discretion, to be governed, as far as possible, by fixed rules and principles, but more elastic than in the administration of other judicial remedies. In the exercise of the remedy much regard is shown to the conduct of the person seeking relief.\nH. and R. agreed to exchange land and the agreement, which was in the form of a letter written by H. proposing the exchange, the terms of which R. accepted, provided that the matter was to be closed in ten days if possible. R. at the time had no title to the property he was to transfer but was negotiating for it. Nearly four months after the date of the agreement the matter was still unsettled, and a letter was written by H. to R.\u2019s solicitor notifying him that unless something was done by the next morning the agreement would be null and void.\nPrior to this there had been several interviews between the parties and their solicitors, in which it was pointed out to R. that there were difficulties in the way of his getting a title to the land he proposed to transfer; that there was no registry of the contract which formed the title of the man who was to convey to him, and that the lands were subject to an annuity; R., however, took no active steps to get the difficulties removed until after the above letter was written, when he brought an action against the proposed vendor and obtained a decree declaring his title good. He then brought suit against H. for specific performance of the contract for exchange.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the action could not be maintained; that R. not having title when the agreement was made H. could rescind the contract without giving reasonable notice of his intention, as he would be bound to do if the title were merely imperfect; that the letter to the solicitor was sufficient to put an end to the bargain; and that even if there had been no rescission the conduct of R. in relation to the completion of the contract was such as to disentitle him to relief by way of specific performance.\nHeld, also, affirming in this respect the judgment of the courts below, that time was originally of the essence of the contract, but there was a waiver by H. of a compliance with the provision as to time by entering into negotiations as to the title after its expiration\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming, by an equal division of the judges, the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] by which the judgment for defendants at the trial was reversed.\nThe material facts are set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court.\nReeve Q.C. for appellant referred to Dart on Vendors and Purchasers[3] and Fry on Specific Performance[4].\nHodgins and Coatsworth for the respondent. As to waiver see Salisbury v. Hatcher[5] and Hoggart v. Scott[6].\nPlaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice of rescission. Green v. Sevin[7]; Murrell v. Goodyear[8].\nAs to right of plaintiff to specific performance see Hall v. Warren[9].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by.\nSTRONG J.\u2014On the 1st of August, 1888, the appellant and respondent entered into an agreement for the exchange of certain landed property and houses in the city of Toronto. By this agreement the appellant was to convey to the respondent seven lots situate in Dupont and Kendal avenues, subject to a mortgage for $4,375, and the respondent was to convey to the appellant two houses on George street, and in addition to give the appellant a mortgage for $1,000 on the avenue lots and to pay to the appellant $175 in cash. This agreement was in writing in the form of an offer or proposal signed by the appellant, to which was subjoined an acceptance signed by the respondent.\nAt the date of the contract the title to the property in George street which was to be conveyed by the respondent was as follows:\u2014The legal estate in fee was vested in Mr. W.G. Schreiber who, by a contract dated the 1st of November, 1884, had agreed to sell the same to one Frank Simpson for the sum of $3,400, payable in certain instalments which need not be particularly specified. Part of the purchase money, amounting to $799, was to be paid by instalments before conveyance, and the residue was to be secured by a mortgage also payable by instalments. At the date of the agreement between the appellant and respondent $499 of these instalments had become due, and it does not appear whether at that time they had been paid by Simpson or not.\nOn the 26th of June, 1888, Simpson signed the following offer in the form of a letter of that date addressed to the respondent Francis Robinson:\u2014\nI hereby offer to sell you the lands and premises lots 95 and 97 east side George street, Toronto, for the sum of $5,000 payable in cash on completion of the title, and give you the refusal thereof for 30 days from this date.\nThere is no evidence in the case showing that this offer was accepted by the respondent within the thirty days limited for its acceptance. Caston in his evidence says it was accepted in writing, and when asked \u201chave you got that acceptance?\u201d answers \u201cit was forwarded,\u201d meaning, of course, forwarded to Simpson. The written acceptance was not, however, produced, and there is nothing to show, what was essential to make out a contract, that it was accepted within the time limited. In connection with this part of the case there is an important piece of evidence in the deposition of Mr. Henderson, who acted as the appellant\u2019s solicitor in carrying out the agreement. It is contained in the following extract:\u2014\nQ. Didn\u2019t Caston tell you he had an agreement with Simpson? A. No; I didn\u2019t understand that he had an agreement with Simpson.\nQ. He had a contract of some kind? A. He claimed it was a contract.\nQ. And that Simpson was entitled to a deed from Schreiber? A. So he stated.\nQ. It is not an unusual thing that there should not be a deed registered? A. There are transactions of that kind.\nQ. You would not have regarded that at all as serious? A. If he produced the agreement; he gave me to understand he could not produce.\nSimpson\u2019s father (Francis Simpson) being called as a witness for the respondent in reply does not prove an acceptance within the 30 days. What he says about it is contained in the following extract from his deposition:\u2014\nQ. You instructed counsel that no agreement had been signed with Caston? A. Yes, until I understood differently. I understood the contract to be only to allow 30 days to sell it; I understood it voided the agreement if the sale did not take place within 30 days, and then of course it fell through; that is the way I understood it. Afterwards I went to Caston and I saw the original agreement, and, of course, as it was my signature for my son I must agree to it.\nQ. That was just before the judgment was pronounced? A. It was at Caston\u2019s, some time before that.\nQ. You came to my office with Miller? A. That was some time afterwards?\nQ. You made an affidavit in this case at the request of Harris? A. Yes; but I want it understood that I made it before I understood that that contract was binding; we had no solicitor up to the time the writ was issued against us.\nHis Lordship\u2014You thought if he could sell it within 30 days it was binding? A. Yes.\nHis Lordship\u2014If he could not sell it, it fell through? A. Yes.\nQ. You did not discover that was binding till shortly before the judgment was delivered against your son? A. No; then I was informed by my solicitor.\nQ. Up to that time your son was refusing to carry out the contract? A. We refused to carry it out or had not done so; that was the way we refused.\nUp to the time of the trial of this action on the 16th September, 1889, nothing had been paid by Robinson to Simpson on account of the purchase money payable under his contract.\nSimpson, the father, speaks positively as to this. His evidence is as follows:\u2014\nHis Lordship\u2014They had not given you $5,000? A. No.\nHis Lordship\u2014Have they offered it since? A. No; I am pretty sure they have not; it has not been paid yet.\nQ. You would not know if it had been paid? A. Yes; they promised to do so.\nHis Lordship\u2014It still stands in the same position? A. Yes.\nMr. Henderson, a solicitor, having been employed to examine the title on behalf of the appellant, raised two objections: First, that the contract which formed Simpson\u2019s title had not been registered; and secondly, that there appeared on the registry to be an annuity or rent charge which formed an incumbrance upon the lands having been granted by one Perry in favour of Sir William Campbell when Perry purchased from Campbell as part security for payment of the purchase money on that sale. These objections having been taken at the outset nothing whatever seems to have been done by the respondent towards removing them up to the 19th of November, on which day, as will be hereafter shown, notice of rescission was given on behalf of the appellant. In the interval nothing, so far as appears, was done by the respondent towards the removal of the difficulties. There were interviews and correspondence, but Caston does not show that he was at all active in endeavouring to surmount the objections to the title. As to the annuity he said \u201che had been trying to see those parties but could not find out who the man was.\u201d There is no evidence that he offered compensation for the annuity. He did, however, offer to give indemnity by a mortgage upon lands at Ingersoll which were subject to an overdue mortgage containing a power of sale. The evidence of Mr. Henderson appears to have been satisfactory to the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench who tried the action. It is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Was there any other objection? A. There was an objection as to an annuity.\nQ. What position did Caston take respecting the annuity objection? A. He said he would inquire into it, and endeavour to clear it up; he said it was the first he heard of it.\nQ. Did you report the objections to Harris? A. Yes; Caston called at the office two or three times on the subject.\nQ. Did he remove these objections? A. Never to my knowledge.\nQ. What became of the matter, so far as you are concerned? A. He came in, and I met him upon the street once or twice, and he always told me he was endeavouring to get things into shape. He was in my office once or twice; he and Harris came in one morning and I said there was no use fooling away more time. He claimed there would be no difficulty in getting his title; he seemed to think that was a matter of very small moment at the time. I told him there was no use considering the matter till he had that settled. He said his client\u2019s title rested upon agreements. I asked him if he could produce copies of them; he could not even do that. I told him it was no use fooling about the matter; that I did not want to hear any more about it; that I was simply asked to report upon the title, and it seemed to me like a farce.\nThe evidence may therefore be summed up by saying that it is proved that two objections having been taken, the first as to the annuity and the second that neither the contract between Schreiber and Simpson nor that between Simpson and Robinson was regis- tered or produced, the respondent took no steps to remove the first objection and declared his inability to produce even an agreement which formed his own immediate title. In this state of things L. G. Harris, the appellant\u2019s son who acted for her in the matter, on the 19th November, 1888, wrote to Mr. Caston, as solicitor for the respondent, the following letter:\u2014\nTORONTO, November 19, 1888.\nMr. CASTON.\nDear Sir,\u2014Unless something definite is done re our \u201cexchange\u201d (of the day) we will have to call it null and void after to-morrow a.m. They have all been here to-day and say they are disgusted, so please, Mr. Caston, come over in the morning first thing and see what we can do.\nYours truly,\nL.G. HARRIS.\nNothing further material to be mentioned occurred until the 1st December, 1888, when the respondent commenced an action against Simpson for specific performance of his alleged agreement with the latter.\nSubsequently to this some letters appear to have been written by Mr. Caston to L.G. Harris, to one only of which the latter replied, in a letter written on the 29th January, 1889, in which he reiterated his abandonment of the purchase.\nThis action was commenced on the 22nd January, 1889, and came on to be tried before the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench at the Toronto Assizes on the 16th September, 1889, when his Lordship gave judgment dismissing the action. This judgment was subsequently set aside by the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, composed of Falconbridge J. and Street J., and judgment for specific performance was ordered to be entered for the respondent. From this judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, where his appeal was dismissed with costs. From this latter judgment the present appeal has been brought. No decree was obtained in the action brought by the respondent against Simpson until the 12th December, 1889, when a decree by consent was made. This decree, which was not drawn up until the 25th February, 1890, referred it to the master to inquire as to whether a good title could be made. The master\u2019s report was made on the 16th June, 1890, reporting the title good. It does not appear what, if anything, was done in the master\u2019s office to remove the objections.\nThus, to begin with, we have a contract entered into on the 1st August, 1888, to be completed within ten days from its date, and nothing to show that a good title could be made earlier than 10th June, 1890, more than a year and ten months after the time originally fixed for completion.\nThe jurisdiction which courts of equity formerly exercised by way of specific performance, a jurisdiction which is now in Ontario, since the Judicature Act, administered, but upon the same principles and subject to the same limitations, by all courts, is peculiar. It is not sufficient to entitle a party seeking this peculiar relief to show what would be sufficient to entitle him to recover in a court of law, namely, that a contract existed, but, as is well shown by the quotations made in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals from the judgment of the House of Lords in Lamare v. Dixon[10] and from Lord Justice Fry\u2019s Treatise[11], the exercise of the jurisdiction is a matter of judicial discretion, one which is to be said to be exercised as far as possible upon fixed rules and principles, but which is, nevertheless, more elastic than is generally permitted in the administration of judicial remedies. In particular it is a remedy in the application of which much regard is shown to the conduct of the party seeking the relief. There can be no doubt, upon the evidence before us, that both parties entered into this contract for speculative purposes, and that the property which is the subject of it was recognized by both as having a speculative value. This was the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, and I entirely agree with him in that opinion. It follows that originally time was of the essence of the contract, and if there had been no waiver on the part of the appellant by entering into negotiations as to the title he would have been bound to have completed it within ten days, for I do not regard the words \u201cif possible\u201d in the agreement as negativing this inference. The appellant did not, however, insist on a literal compliance with this term of the contract, but by negotiating as to the title after the expiration of the time limited recognized the existence of the contract. So far I agree with Mr. Justice Street\u2019s judgment.\nI am of opinion, however, that two propositions, both equally fatal to the respondent, may upon the facts in evidence and upon the law applicable to those facts be safely laid down. I say, then, that in the first place the letter of the 19th November, 1888, having regard to the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, was sufficient to put an end to the bargain. Secondly, the conduct of the respondent in relation to the completion of the contract has been such that without reference to any actual rescission he has been guilty of such laches as disentitles him to specific performance. First, as regards rescission: The evidence entirely fails to establish that the respondent had any title whatever, equitable or legal, to the property he was to give in exchange at the time he entered into this contract. It is to be observed that the letter from Frank Simpson to the respondent of the 26th of June, 1888, which is relied on by the respondent as containing his contract with Simpson, is a mere offer to sell, not a concluded contract but an option, which did not become a contract unless the respondent, according to the express terms of the letter, should accept it within thirty days from the date of the letter, the 26th of June, 1888. During that period of thirty days, and until his proposal was accepted, Simpson could at any time have revoked his offer. Further, I need scarcely say that in a unilateral offer of this kind time is strictly material, and acceptance after the thirty days without more, that is, without some extension of the time in writing signed by Simpson, would not be sufficient to constitute a binding contract. Now there is no evidence whatever that there ever was an acceptance within the thirty days. All that Caston says in the extract from his deposition before given is that it was accepted in a writing which was forwarded to Simpson; but the written acceptance itself is not produced, as it ought to have been and might have been if it existed since it must have been in the possession of Simpson, nor does Caston say that it was sent within the thirty days. Simpson does not say that there was an acceptance within thirty days; it is true he does not say there was not, but he understood there was to be a sale within thirty days and that otherwise it fell through, which gives much colour to the inference that there was not, in fact, an acceptance within the specified time. Again, Mr. Henderson says that when, finding this agreement was not registered, he pressed Caston to produce it the latter admitted he could not even do that. So that up to the present time there has been no legal evidence in this action that there was, anterior to the 26th July, 1888, when the thirty days option expired, any acceptance by the respondent, either written or oral, of Simpson\u2019s offer, and consequently it does not appear that any binding contract whatever existed between Simpson and the respondent on the 1st August, 1888, the date of the contract between the respondent and the appellant.\nThe appellant by her pleading directly puts in issue the defence that the plaintiff had not at the date of the contract any title to the George street property.\nThe second paragraph of the statement in defence is as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant further says that the plaintiff had not at the time of the making of the alleged contract, or the rescission thereof as aforesaid, any title to the said lands on George Street or any such title thereto as the defendant was bound to accept, and the plaintiff was unable to perform the said alleged contract on his part.\nBy the first paragraph of the defence the appellant pleaded the rescission of the contract. As a general rule, under the practice of courts of equity, questions of title were not disposed of at the hearing of a suit for specific performance but were made the subject of a reference to the master, but when the defence of the want of any title is raised, as it is in the present case, not with a view of compelling the plaintiff to show a good title but as a substantive defence to the action, there is no reason why it should not be disposed of at the trial. Upon these pleadings the burden of proving that he had at least some title to the property was upon the respondent, and it is manifest that he has failed in doing so; on the contrary, the evidence raises at least a strong presumption to the contrary.\nAnother reason for saying that the plaintiff had no title at the time of the contract is this: he professed to deal with the property itself and not with a mere contract to purchase it, and yet he had nothing, according to his own statement of his case, but an executory contract in respect of which $5,000 had to be paid before his vendor, Simpson, could be called on to convey. This money had not been paid at the date of the trial, and it does not appear satisfactorily that the respondent was in a position to pay it. Therefore, even assuming, what as I have said before is not proved, that the offer had been duly accepted before the contract with the appellant it still could not be said that the respondent had even an equitable title to the property. A purchaser under an executory contract is sometimes said, in loose phraseology, to have an equitable title, but the distinction as regards equitable title between his rights under such a contract before payment of the purchase money, and a true equitable title, is well marked, and is pointed out by Lord Cottenham in Tasker v. Small[12]; and by Lord O\u2019Hagan in Shaw v. Foster[13]. See also Wall v. Bright[14]. Whilst his rights under such a contract are incomplete owing to the non-payment of his purchase money a purchaser has an undoubted right to assign his contract, but he cannot sell the land itself, and cannot be properly called the equitable owner of it.\nMy conclusion is, therefore, that upon both the distinct grounds indicated the respondent had no title to the land which he could properly sell at the date of his contract. Had there been a sum of money in excess of, or equivalent to the amount which the respondent was to pay as purchase money to Simpson, payable in cash under the contract between the appellant and the respondent, this might not have been an objection since the appellant would in that case have had it in her power to apply a proportion or the whole of the price she was herself to pay to paying off Simpson, but the only cash payment from the appellant which the contract of the 1st of August, 1888, calls for is the sum of $175.\nTherefore, for this additional reason, the respondent had no title at the date of the contract. Further, assuming that there had been no acceptance by Robinson at the time of the contract with the appellant, then that agreement could only have been an attempt to transfer a mere option which, according to Lord Justice Fry, is not the subject of assignment. That learned judge lays down the law thus:\nIt must be added that even where a concluded contract would be assignable the benefit of an offer cannot, it seems, be transferred by the person to whom it was made to a third person.\nThen to apply the law to this fact of want of title in the respondent to any marketable interest in the land at the date of the agreement, taken in connection with the letter of the 19th November, 1888, rescinding the contract. It is said that this notice did not allow a reasonable time to the respondent. The authorities, however, are clear that when the vendor has no title whatever to the property he assumes to sell when he enters into the agreement, as distinguished from cases in which he has some, though an imperfect, title, that the purchaser may in the first case peremptorily put an end to the bargain and is not bound to give that reasonable notice which it is considered proper to require from him when the title is merely imperfect. The case of Forrer v. Nash[15], the circumstances of which are stated in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, is a strong authority for this proposition. Lee v. Soames[16] is to the same effect. That was an action by a purchaser claiming a declaration that the contract had been verbally rescinded; the defendant, the vendor, counterclaimed for specific performance.\nKekewich J. in his judgment says:\nAs to Mr. Barber\u2019s point, that time not having been made of the essence of the contract the plaintiff was not entitled to fix an arbitrary date in the absence of unreasonable delay on the part of the vendor, the doctrine is laid down in Sugden\u2019s Vendor & Purch.[17] and cited by Fry J. in Green v. Sevin[18] and also in Fry on Specific Performance[19]. But both these statements of the law assume that there is a contract. In the present case there never was a contract between the real vendor and the purchaser. Forrer v. Nash[20] and Brewer v. Broadwood[21] support this view. It was not a contract which the vendor could have carried out. I think the plaintiff was, on the 8th November, 1887, entitled to say \u201cthis bargain is at an end. There is no contract.\u201d\nThis last observation of the learned judge exactly describes what, by a fair intendment, the appellant is to be taken as meaning by the letter of the 19th November, 1888. I am, therefore, of opinion that that letter was sufficient to terminate the bargain between the parties to this appeal.\nIt is further to be remarked that, as appears from the judgment of Mr. Justice Kekewich in the case just quoted from, it is only in cases where there has been no unreasonable delay in making out a title that a vendor is entitled to reasonable notice of rescission. It is impossible to say that the respondent here has shown that he is free from the imputation of unreasonable delay, for down to the time of bringing his action he had wholly failed in taking any active steps to remove the defect in the title, or even to produce the contract (if he had any) which constituted his own title.\nThen there is another and wholly independent ground upon which, in my opinion, the action was properly dismissed by the original judgment, that of laches, which is distinctly pleaded by the fourth paragraph of the defence.\nGranting that time was not originally of the essence, or that if so it had been waived by the appellant, yet considering the nature of the property and the object for which, as must have been well known to the respondent, the appellant was seeking to acquire it, namely, for a speculative purpose, that is, in order to sell again at a profit, and that, therefore, it was of the utmost consequence to him that he should be promptly put in a position to take advantage of a rise in the real estate market, the delay from the date of the contract on the 1st of August, 1888, up to the date of the action on the 22nd January, 1889, nearly six months, was most unreasonable. The rule which governs the courts in giving relief by way of specific performance of agreements, even in cases in which time is not made of the essence of the contract, is that a plaintiff seeking such relief must show that he has been always ready and eager to carry out the contract on his part. Can it possibly be said that the respondent has brought himself within such conditions in the present case? Most certainly it cannot. We see, indeed, that he did not obtain a decree in his suit against Simpson until the 12th December, 1889, and that he allowed more than two months to elapse before he had even caused this judgment to be drawn up, and further, that no report on the title was obtained until the 10th June, 1890. There was, therefore, not only gross laches and delay anterior to bringing the present action, but afterwards in prosecuting his action against Simpson. To grant specific performance in such a case would, it seems to me, be to set at defiance the wholesome rule before adverted to, which requires promptitude and diligence on the part of one who seeks at the hands of the court this extraordinary relief.\nFor these reasons, which are in the main identical with those assigned for their judgments by both the learned chief justices in the courts below, I am of opinion that we cannot do otherwise than allow this appeal, thus restoring the original judgment, with costs to the appellant in this court and both the courts below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I dissent, and would dismiss this appeal. I adopt the reasoning of Street J. in the Divisional Court, and Maclennan J. in the Court of Appeal. It is a great satisfaction for me, seeing that I am alone of that opinion in this court, that the conclusion I have reached does not affect the result of the judgment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Reeve & Woodworth.\nSolicitors for respondent: McMurrich, Coatsworth, Hodgins & Geddes.\n[1] 19 Ont.

Tiernan gave plaintiff his note for $1,100, at thirty days, which was dishonoured at maturity and taken up by plaintiff. During the currency of the note Walters paid Tiernan $500 and he paid him $600 more, but when was not proved. The plaintiff registered a mechanic's lien against the property of Walters and brought his action under the statute which was tried before the Divisional Court and resulted in judgment for the defendants the court holding that the lien was extinguished by the plaintiff taking the note from Tiernan. The plaintiff appealed.\nCassidy for the appellant.\nChrysler Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSTRONG J.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. In the first place the lien was waived by taking the promissory note from the contractor and by its negotiation, inasmuch as, under ordinary circumstances, that would have been at least a suspension of the debt, and therefore the lien, for the time being, was as if it had never existed. The statute does not give the lien but only a potential right of creating it, and during the thirty days the note was running it having been discounted it was impossible that the lien could have been created and the potentiality of creating it was, therefore, gone. It is quite clear that when a statute gives a privilege in favour of a creditor the creditor must bring himself strictly within its terms, and there is nothing in the statute in question here which provides that if a lien has once been abandoned it is to be considered as being abandoned merely for a time. If we should hold that it was to be so considered we should be adding a clause to the act.\nIt follows, that if the evidence was that only $500 of the $1,100 was paid by the respondent to the contractor during the currency of the note, and whilst it was outstanding in the hands of a bond fide indorsee for value, the lien would be absolutely gone. I am satisfied, however, that the whole amount was paid during that time. Had the note not been negotiated by the appellant different considerations might have prevailed.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Corbould, McColl, Wilson & Campbell.\nSolicitors for respondents: McPhillips & Williams.\n[1] 2 B.

By that complaint the appellant was charged with having on the 19th October, 1887, caused to be delivered to the Registrar of deeds, of Charlevoix and Saguenay, to be registered, a false and untrue copy certified by him as notary of a deed of main lev\u00e9e and discharge which. never existed. and which appeared to have been executed before him on the 17th of the same month, in the city of Montreal, by Madame Josephine Eleonore d'Estimauville, widow of the late Leon Charles Clement of the mortgage created in her favour dated the 23rd October, 1882 upon an immovable being\" no. 277 of the official cadastre of Les Eboulements; and also with having on the 3rd March, 1887, caused to be delivered for registration to the same registrar of deeds, a document purporting to-be a true copy certified by him as notary of a false and forged deed of discharge, appearing to have been executed before him notarially on the 17th January, 1887,. at Les Emoluments, by Joseph W. Tremblay, of a mort-gage for one hundred dollars in his favour granted by Francois Tremblay, son of Paschal, by deed of the 14th December 1884.\nThe complaint also alleged that the first of these two deeds of discharge of mortgage had been declared false by a judge of the Superior Court for the district of Saguenay and the judgment affirmed in appeal, and. that the appellant was thereby guilty of acts derogatory to the honour of the profession.\nThe appellant was summoned to appear before the committee on discipline of the Board of Notaries to answer to these charges. He appeared by his attorney and then filed a declaration in writing by which he took exception to the jurisdiction of the committee on discipline appointed by the Board of Notaries, and objected to their power to deal with complaints of this nature. He also by special preliminary objections alleged that the complaint against him could not be maintained.\nThe preliminary objections having been overruled the appellant pleaded specially that inasmuch as the charge against him amounted to a felony the committee on discipline had no power to try him or pronounce in the matter so long as it had not been \"legally proved and followed by a final sentence of a competent court.\"\nThe complaint was thereupon proceeded with and a number of witnesses were examined, when the proceedings were suddenly arrested by the issue and service upon the respondents of a writ of prohibition at the instance of the appellant, who by petition, under art. 1031 C. C. P., had applied for a writ to prohibit the committee on discipline and the respondents nominatively from proceeding further with the accusation before them. The grounds urged in the petition were:\u2014\n1st. That the respondents were proceeding to take evidence of forgeries without producing the documents impugned; and\n2nd. That the charge against the petitioner being one of felony could not be inquired into by the committee on discipline so long as it had not been legally proved and followed by a final sentence of a competent court.\nin answer to the merits of the petition for prohibition the respondents inter alia pleaded:\n1st. That it was their right and duty to take cognizance of the complaint made against the appellant and that their proceedings were legal;\n2nd. That in acting as they have done the Board of Notaries have never pretended to exercise a jurisdiction, nor judicial powers.\nBe court, for the appellant, cited and relied on art. 3871, section 8 R. S. Q.; Abbott's Digest of the Law of Corporations ([3]); High's Extraordinary Legal Remedies ([4]); Brice on ultra vires ([5]); Lloyd on Prohibition ([6]). Mr. Fremont and .Mr. Languedoc for respondents, contended that respondents were proceeding within the scope of their powers under Title X. of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, and which is known as the .Notarial Code\" and that they had the right to investigate the charges made against the appellant.\nSTRONG J.\u2014We are all agreed that this appeal should be dismissed. My own opinion is based upon this: The act charged, which the writ of prohibition in this case would restrain the Committee of Discipline of the Board of Notaries of the Province of Quebec from investigating, was one derogatory to the honour of the profession of a notary, and comes within the first part of art 3871 R S Q. I do not read subsection 8 of this art. 3871 viz. \"The commission of a crime or felony l legally proved and followed by a final sentence of a \"competent court,\" as intended to restrict in any way the jurisdiction of the committee under the first part of the article. On the contrary I think it was intended to provide for cases where a crime or felony is committed by a notary outside of his duties, as, for instance, if such an officer should be convicted of arson or burglary an offence having nothing whatever to do with his professional quality, and the intention of the statute is that when such crime or felony has been legally proved the convicted person should not he allowed to remain a notary, and that it was not intended by this sub-section 8 that if a notary should be guilty of conduct derogatory to the honour of his profession, Which professional misconduct would also be a crime or felony that the committee should then be incapacitated from taking cognizance of the case and of suspending him until he was legally convicted on an indictment. For these reasons, which are the same as those upon which the Court of Queen's Bench proceeded, as stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Hall, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFournier and Taschereau JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I think it was quite competent for the court of committee of discipline to entertain a charge of the committal of acts which, if committed, would subject the person doing them to indictment for felony; such charge would be cognizable by the committee of discipline sitting\" in the present case, although the party accused had not been tried.\nPATTERSON J.I concur in dismissing the appeal. I have nothing of any importance to add to what my brother Strong has said. I would however like to make an observation as to the contention that under the 8th sub-section of art. 3871 R.S.Q. there is no \"jurisdiction to investigate any charge of felony except when a conviction has been obtained. It seems to me beside the question altogether. The one question is whether the charge is one which in the judgment of the board is derogatory to the honour of the profession. What was done may or may not have amounted to forgery. A man has been held guilty of forgery although the deed declared forged was in fact made and executed as it purported to be, and was what the parties to it intended it to be but was ante-dated with intent to defraud. The case of the Queen v. Ritson ([7]) is a case of this kind. But I do not think this a criterion of the jurisdiction of the board. The particulars mentioned in the 8th subsection of this article 3871 are declared absolutely to be derogatory in addition to those which may be so held by the board in their discretion, and there are certainly many cases in, which this discretion can be exercised.\nBesides things are some things under article 3871 which maybe felony, and, which do not come under subsection 8. For example, embezzlement is in several cases felony under the criminal statutes and subsection 6 which says nothing of conviction would cover some of these cases of felonious embezzlement\nThe board do not convict of felony. Their decision would have no effect in a prosecution for felony under the same facts on which they act, and could not be pleaded to an indictment founded on those facts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : L.

B.'s possession. See Ball v. McCaffrey (20 Can. S.C.R. 319).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in Three Rivers which dismissed the plaintiffs' action.\nThis was an action brought by the appellants for the recovery (revendication) of certain booms, chains, &c. which the respondent had been using on the Nicolet River and had stored in a shed ([1])\nThe appellants claimed title to the booms and chains replevined, Michael O'Shaugnessy as the legal depositary, and Francis McCaffrey as usufructuary under certain agreements entered into with and transfers made by Antoine Mayrand and Charles McCaffrey, to whom certain rights and privileges were granted by 36 Vic ch 81 P.Q. \"An act to authorize the erection of piers and booms in the River Nicolet.\"\nThe respondent pleaded that by virtue of certain deeds and agreements entered into between Antoine Mayrand and himself and his auteurs which are also referred to in the report of the case of Ball v. McCaffrey ([2]) he had become the absolute owner of the booms and chains, &c. seized, had been in possession of the same for several years and had always stretched and maintained them and stored them in a shed during the winter with the consent and acquiescence of the appellants, and moreover that the appellants had no such right or title to the property in question as alleged by them in their declaration.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Honan with him for appellants contended that under the deeds alleged they were joint proprietors as alleged of the booms and anchors seized, and could as such revindicate them as they must be held to be movables: art. 866 C.C.P.; arts. 384, 385,. 478 479 C. C. The respondent could not have a better position than his auteur Ross, who never deprived appellant McCaffrey of the possession to enable him to-collect dues.\nThe case of Ball v. McCaffrey (1) virtually holds that the appellants are bound to maintain the booms, and that McCaffrey has the right to collect from all others-except Ball, the respondent, if so they must have the possession of the booms.\nLaflamme Q.C. and Martel Q.C. for respondent contended upon the deeds that they did not give to the appellants any such, rights of usufructuary or depositary as alleged in their declaration of the booms in question. They were new booms made by the respondent and his auteurs) and the chains were also new and not those in use in Mayrand's time. The appellants moreover were estopped by their conduct from disturbing the respondent's possession of the same for a period of more than three years.\nThe following statutes and authorities were cited by respondent's counsel: C. C. arts. 418, 457, 463, 468, 479, 2268; 42 & 43 Vic. ch. 18s. 1 (P.Q.); R. S. Q. art. 5623; Boileux ([3]); Dalloz, Rep. de Jurisprudence ([4]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: \u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case arises out of the same facts that were under consideration in McCaffrey v. Bali ([5]). The same Francis McCaffrey is also here the appellant with the assistance of O'Shaugnessy. In the previous case he claimed from Ball the boomage on the logs passed by him through the booms in question. Now he claims by saisie-revendication, the very booms themselves with the necessary materials chains &c. that form part thereof. His action has been unanimously dismissed by the two courts below and that no other conclusion could be reached is unquestionable He has no claim whatever to the possession of these booms. They belong to the defendant, which he cannot deny and he admits that they have always been in the defendant's or his auteurs possession. He McCaffrey, has a right to the boomage from all other parties than Ball, but that does not make him an usufructuary and as such entitled to the \"possession of these booms. Neither is O'Shaugnessy a depositary by the deed of June 15th. 1877, by Mayrand to him. Both McCaffrey and O'Shaugnessy are precluded by their conduct and acquiescence from disturbing Ball in the exercise of his rights on these booms as they claim to be entitled to do in this case I need on this point but refer to the remarks I made in the previous case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitor for appellants : M.

This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench on appeal.\nBelcourt and Mackay for appellant, contended that under the law of the province of Quebec unless there is an agreement in writing the attorney cannot recover against his client more than what the tariff of fees will allow him and in the present action the respondent had no right to base his action on the tariffs of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts, and charge also a commission on the amount of judgment without an agreement in writing. The learned counsel refer red to Brown v. Dorion ([1]); Larue v. Loranger ([2]); Amyot v. Gugy ([3]).\nCasgrain Q.C., Attorney-General for the province of Quebec, for respondent, contended that under rule 57 of the Supreme Court Rules the tariff is only applicable as between party and party and that the respondent, having a right of action for a quantum meruit, had the right to claim and prove by oral evidence the full and real value of his services rendered; (see Doutre v. The Queen ([4]); art. 3597, R. S. Q.); and this court would not, upon the question of quantum, review the decision arrived at by the courts below. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014There is nothing in this appeal. I would have been of opinion to dismiss it immediately after hearing the appellant, The respondents right of action cannot be denied in the face of the decision of the Privy Council in Doutre v. The Queen ([5]). Then it being in evidence that there is no tariff in the Exchequer Court or in the Supreme Court as between attorney and client, the respondent had the right to establish the quantum meruit of his services by oral evidence. Such is the well settled jurisprudence of the province. As to the amount allowed to the respondent it is amply supported by the evidence.

S. G. ch. 135 s, 29 (b).\nIn a case of a dispute between adjoining proprietors of mining lands where an encroachment was complained of, and it appeared that the limits of the respective properties had not been legally determined by a bornage, the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) held that an injunction would not lie to prevent the alleged en croachment, the proper remedy being an action en bornage.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Carada:\nHeld, that as the matter in controversy did not put in issue any title to land where the rights in future might be bound the case was not appealable. R. S. C. ch. 135 s. 29 (6).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) setting aside the judgment of the Superior Court granting an injunction to the appellant company.\nThe appellant company, proprietor of lot 19 in the 12th range of the township of Buckingham, by its pettion for a writ of injunction, alleged that it had been in possession of the lot in question since November, 1875 and that the eastern bounds of the lot were marked by posts placed about the 3rd November, 1875, by one G. C. Rainboth and that the respondent company had trespassed on lot 19 underground, and was actually mining and carrying away large quantities of phosphate from the west side of the G. C. Rainboth line. The respondent company proprietor of lot 18 by its pleas denied that the G. C. Rainboth line was the true easterly limit of lot 19, and alleged that no steps had ever been taken to legally establish the true boundary between lots 18 and 19; that the petition or demand did not allege exposure to irreparable damage, or show that injunction was the proper remedy and that the petition was premature.\nUpon issue joined and evidence taken, the judgment of the Superior Court maintained the writ of injunction until a proper boundary should be fixed. The Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) on appeal held that the proper remedy being an action en bornage an injunction did not lie to prevent the alleged encroachment.\nLaflamme Q.C. and Cross for respondent on the motion to quash: The ownership of lots 18 and 19 being ad mitted in this case the issue between the parties resolves itself into a mere question of trespass, alleged by the appellant and denied by the respondent, and we, therefore submit that this court should declare itself without jurisdiction and dismiss the appeal as the case does not come within R.

P., are entitled to bring the present action for being disturbed, and therefore we come under section 29 (b) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act the title to the land of which we are in possession being in dispute. The court has heard possessory actions wherein no amount of damages were claimed. See Hall v. Canada Land Co. ([2]) and Pinsonnault v.

The respondents are in possession of the adjoining lot no. 18. There is no controversy as to the parties respective titles. The cause of the litigation between them is the want of boundaries between their lot. The appellants alleging that the respondents encroach upon lot 19, took out an injunction to restrain them from doing so. Now, under the laws of the province, the rights to the title to this lot, or to the possession thereof, could not be determined on such a proceeding taken ab initio.

The respondent replied that this last will was null and void, and upon that issue the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court declared null and void the will of 17th January, 1885, and held the continuance of the original suit by respondent to be admitted. On appeal to the Supreme Court the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was an interlocutory judgment, and it was\nHeld, that the judgment was res judicata between the parties and final on the petition for continuance of the suit, and therefore appeal able to this court.

This is not a final judgment but an interlocutory order in the original suit. As stated in our code of procedure it is an incidental proceeding. C. C. P. ch. VII. art. 434. Dorling v.

Dumont ([5]) Dalloz Repertoire ([6]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case comes up on a motion by the respondent to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final but merely an interlocutory judgment It is necessary for a proper understanding of the question raised by the respondent to go more minutely than usual upon such a motion into the details of the case. I will do so, however, as concisely as possible.\nOn the 17th November, 1869, Isabella Cockburn, widow of George Baptist, and mother of the litigating parties in this case made her will in favour of Margaret Baptist, the present respondent and others.\nOn the 17th January, 1885, the said Isabella Cock burn made another will but this time in favour of Alexander Baptist, the present appellant. On that same date, the 17th January, 1885, she passed a deed of transfer and assignment or gift also in favour of the present appellant.\nOn the 23rd March 1889 the said Isabella Cockburn was interdicted for cause of insanity and one Houliston was appointed her curator.\nHouliston, then in his said quality, instituted an action against Alexander Baptist, the present appellant, asking, in her name, that the deed of transfer or gift passed by her, Isabella Cockburn, in favour of the present appellant, on the 17th January, 1885, be set aside, as having been passed by the said Isabella Cock burn when non compos mentis, and obtained by the appellant by undue influence and fraudulent man \u0153uvres. To this action the defendant, present appellant, pleaded a general denegation and an exception amounting to nothing more, by which he says that his mother Isabella Cockburn, though since interdicted, was compos men\/is on the 17th January, 1885, when she consented to give him the said deed and that all the plain tiff's allegations of undue influence and fraudulent man\u0153uvres are unfounded Soon after issue had been so joined the said Isabella Cockburn died, September 28th, 1889. Thereupon, Houliston's powers as her curator and plaintiff in her name. in the said action against the present appellant having come to an end, Margaret Baptist, the present respondent, asked the court to be allowed to continue the suit, alleging in her petition, as the basis of her right to do so, the said Isabella Cockburn's will of 1869 in her favour (jointly with others) and that the said will had never been revoked. To this petition the present appellant pleaded that the respondent had no right to continue the suit as he, the appellant, was the late Isabella Cock-burn's legatee by her will of 1885, revoking that of 1869. The respondent replied that this will of 1885 passed on the same day as the transfer impugned by the principal action, was null and void for the same reasons and upon the same grounds invoked in the said action, that is to say, that it had been passed when the testatrix was not compos menlis and obtained by the appellant by undue influence and fraudulent man \u0153uvres; she therefore prayed that the said will be declared void \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, and that the appellant's contention of her demand for permission to continue the suit be declared unfounded and reject ed. The parties went to trial upon those issues, which clearly raised a question pr\u00e9judicielle ([7]) and on the 16th January, 1891, the Superior Court of Three Rivers gave a judgment maintaining the will of 1885 in favour of the present appellant, holding that the respondent's allega tions of fraud and illegality against it had not been proved, declaring that the respondent was consequently not entitled to continue the original action as the will of 1869 upon which she based her claim had been revoked by that of 1885, and dismissing her petition for continuance of the principal action. Upon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, however, the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed, and the will of 1885 set aside on the grounds of insanity of the testatrix, and of undue influence and fraudulent man\u0153uvres by the present appellant. It is this judgment that the respondent contends to be not appealable to this court. I at first, was inclined to think that she was right but, after further consideration, I have come to the conclusion that we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. By section 2 of the Supreme Court Act it is enacted that the expression \" final judgment \" therein, from which an appeal would lie to this court means\nany judgment, rule, order or decision, whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nNow, though we have held that no interlocutory judgments can be reviewed by this court under that clause, and though in form, perhaps, this is, in one sense, an interlocutory judgment, yet, it is clear that, though upon a side issue, the controversy between the parties has been, as far as can be in the provincial courts determined and concluded. See Shaw v St Louis ([8]) and authorities therein cited.\nThe judgment setting aside the will of 1885 would not bind this court on an appeal from a judgment on the action setting aside the deed of assignment of the same date but it would remain in force as yes judicata between the parties upon the validity of the said will. The parties have, in fact, given themselves the luxury of two contestations where one would have been sufficient. They have made of the controversy between them on the petition for continuance of the suit a second case quite independent of the other. Upon that case the judgment which has been obtained is final and consequently we have jurisdiction. It is a noticeable fact, though not by itself a conclusive one that the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench was taken de piano by the present respondent, without objection. Of course she was appealing from a judgment which had dismissed her petition, and that judgment was appealable as a final one, but why the judgment she has obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench maintaining her petition and dismissing the contestation thereof is not also a final one, and as such appealable by her adversary to this court, I fail to see.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : A.

C.\nThe respondent obtained against the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company a judgment for the sum of $675 and costs and having caused a writ of venditioni exponas to issue against the railway property of the Montreal and Sorel Railway, the appellants, who were in possession and working the railway, claimed under a certain agreement in writing to be entitled to retain possession of the railway property pledged to them for the disbursements they had made on it, and filed an opposition afin de charge for the sum of $35,000 in the hands of the sheriff. The respondent contested the opposition. The agreement relied on by the appellant company wasentered into between the Montreal and Sorel Railway and the appellant company, and stated amongst other things that \" the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company was burthened with debts and had neither money nor credit to place the road in running order, etc.\" The amount claimed for disbursements, etc. was over $35,000. The Superior Court;, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada dismissed the opposition afin de charge.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court the respondents moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the amount of the original judgment was the only matter in controversy and was insufficient in amount to give jurisdiction to the Court. The Court without deciding the question of jurisdiction heard the appeal on the merits, and it was\nHeld, 1st That such an agreement must be deemed in law to have been made with intent to defraud and was void as to the anterior creditors of the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company. 2nd.

Art. 1972 C. C.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed the appellants' opposition afin de charge to the writ of venditioni exponas issued against the company.\nOn the 9th October, 1889, the respondent, acting for the crown as Collector of Revenue for the District of Montreal, obtained a judgment against the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal, for the sum of $675.00 with interest and costs. This sum represented the arrears of taxes due to the Government of the Province of Quebec, for the working of the Montreal and Sorel Railway, under the special act passed by the legislature of this Province, imposing a tax on railways.\nOn the 10th January, 1890, at the instance of respondent, a writ of execution fieri facias de bonis et terris issued against the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company, and the respondent caused to be seized by the sheriff of the district of Montreal all the railway of said company consisting of a line of railway of about fifty feet in width and forty-five miles in length.\nThe Montreal and Sorel Railway (defendant in the Superior Court) met this execution by an opposition afin d'annuler; and after contestation, this opposition was dismissed with costs by a judgment rendered on the 20th September, 1890. On the 10th September, 1890, a writ of venditioni exponas issued at the instance of respondent, and the sheriff caused to be published the necessary notices for the sale of the said line of railway.\nOn the 23rd December, 1890, the appellant filed an opposition afin de charge in answer to the writ of venditioni exponas, praying by its conclusions that the immovables of the defendant be sold subject to the payment by the highest bidder of the sum of $35,000; and praying further that, by the judgment to be rendered, the said appellant be given the right to retain and keep possession of said immovables until said sum should be paid in full.\nThe appellant alleged in said opposition:\u2014\n\u201cThat on the 1st June, 1889, a written lease was passed between the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company and said appellant, by which the latter under took to work the line of railway so seized by the respondent, and to make the repairs necessary to put the line in working order, the railway standing pledged to the appellant until the repayment of the advances that were to be made for such repairs.\"\n\u201cThat the appellant entered upon the possession of this railway about the 1st June, 1889, that since that time the said appellant has worked the railway and made repairs and improvements amounting in value to the sum of at least $35,000, and said appellant by his conclusions claims the right to keep possession of the railway as long as such advances shall not have been repaid, and further, that the railway be sold subject to this charge.\"\nThe Montreal and Sorel Railway Company (defend ant) did not appear in answer to this opposition; but the respondent, as creditor, contested this opposition on the following ground amongst others:\u2014 \u201cThat furthermore, supposing this pretended right of pledge did exist, the appellant should have exercised it against the writ of fieri facias, because it was in existence at that time; and it should not have been exercised against the writ of venditioni exponas.\"\n\u201cThat the contract upon which the opposition is based, having been made before the writ of fieri facias issued, all the pretended rights given to appellant ought to have been invoked against that writ, because appellant could only invoke against the writ venditioni exponas those rights of which he became possessed after the issuing of the writ of fieri facias.\"\n\u201cThat the pretended lease or contract upon which the opposition is founded is illegal, having been made to defraud the creditors of the defendant which company was completely insolvent and in bankruptcy at the time this contract was made and even before that time, to the knowledge of the appellant, and therefore the defendant could not alienate nor pledge its property; and, besides, that such contract had not been registered and could not give any right of pledge as against the rights of third parties, particularly those of respondent whose claim existed at the time the contract was made.\"\n\u201cThat, moreover, the defendant had not the right to lease its line of railway, nor to pledge its property, nor to alienate the same without the assent of its directors duly ratified by the shareholders in conformity with.\"\nThe agreement relied on by the appellant was as. Follows\nIT-MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT.\n\u201cMade this 1st day of June, 1889, between the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company acting by Charles N. Armstrong, president, duly authorized; and the Great Eastern Railway Company, acting by James Cooper, its president, duly authorized, for the purpose of this agreement, respecting the operation of the line of the said Montreal and Sorel Railway.''\n\u201cWhereas the Montreal and Sorel Railway is burthened with debts which it at present is unable to discharge and has neither money nor credit where with to place its road in running order or condition, nor rolling stock or equipment for the said purpose.\"\n\u201cAnd Whereas the Great Eastern Railway Company is interested in the road of said Montreal and Sorel Railway, and anticipates using the same as a link in its own line, and it is to the advantage of the public and the municipalities through which the said road runs, that the same should be operated and available to the community.\"\n\u201cTherefore the Great Eastern Railway Company undertake to make the necessary repairs and put the said line of the Montreal and Sorel Company between St. Lambert and Sorel in proper running order; and as soon as the sanction of the government is obtained to open the road and provide sufficient equipment to maintain a useful train service between said points and supply agents and the necessary assistance.\"\n\u201cThe total receipts of such operation shall be received and be the property of the said Great Eastern Railway Company, and be applied after the payment of current expenses to recoup the outlay of the operating company in connection with the preparation of the road for traffic and train service.\"\n\u201cIn the event of any balance remaining at the end of any quarterly term, after the payment of every expense and disbursement made and incurred by the said Great Eastern Company and the discharge of its obligations in connection therewith, such balance, less an amount equal to ten per cent of the gross earnings, shall be payable to or on account of the Montreal and Sore Railway Company, in such manner as its board of directors may advise the said amount of ten per cent to be retained and applied by the directors of said Great Eastern Company to indemnify them for the said undertaking.\n\u201cIn the event of any subsidies and bonuses being granted towards the opening and maintenance of the said line, the same shall, if made payable to the Montreal and Sorel Company, be transferred and paid over to the Great Eastern Company, the proceeds to be accounted for and disposed of as ordinary earnings mentioned above.\"\n\"The Great Eastern Company shall not be liable or responsible for any debt or obligation of whatever nature or kind of said Montreal and Sorel Company, and shall have a lien and pledge upon said Montreal and Sorel Company's property, chattels and effects or credits for the disbursements and expense made and suffered on account of the repairs, improvements and operation above mentioned and contemplated.\"\n\"This agreement may at any time be terminated on the demand of either company by giving one month's notice in writing; but if such demand be made by the Montreal and Sorel Company it shall only be effective upon tender therewith of whatever balance may he found to be due at that date to the Great Eastern Company for the reasons mentioned above.\"\nBefore the case was argued on the merits a motion was made to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nChoquette for respondent. The original judgment being for the sum of $675.00, that is to say, a sum less than $2,000, the right of appeal to this court does not exist. Possibly the appellant will pretend that the right contended for is of a greater value than $2,000; to that pretension I would answer that in the matter of an opposition the jurisdiction of the court is always determined by the original judgment. In the present case the respondent sued the defendant for a sum less than $2,000 (about $1,000) and judgment was given for $675. The opposition is an incident in the case and it appears contrary to law to allow an appeal upon an incident in a case when the court would not have jurisdiction to decide the case itself. The jurisprudence on that point appears to have been clearly established by this honourable court in the following cases: Champoux v. Lapierre ([1]); Bourget v. Blanchard ([2]); Gendron v. McDougall ([3]).\nLonergan, contra. The appellant claims over $35000 and therefore the amount in controversy is over $2,000. It is also a question of revenue and comes within sub-sec. (b.) of sec. 29, ch. 135 R.S.C. We allege in our opposition that the sheriff has in his hands several writs and under art. 642 C.P.C. the seizure could be abandoned by the sheriff unless the amount due in the several writs were paid in and these amounts aggregate over $1,500.\nSTRONG J.\u2014We will hear the case on the merits.\nLonergan for the appellant.\n1. The company were entitled under the said lease to retain the railway property until its disbursements thereunder were paid; and even wholly disregarding said lease, as an occupant in good faith it had a right to remain in possession until reimbursed the impenses utiles and cost of improvements under the provisions of article 419 of the Civil Code\n2. Defendants' obligation as a railway corporation compelled them to keep their line open and run it otherwise their charter might become forfeited. Thus in whatever financial condition defendants were at the time, in leasing their property with the condition of keeping it in running order they acted in the interest of their creditors in preserving their privileges and protecting the property from decay, le gage commun des cr\u00e9anciers. And if the company defendant were insolvent (although the ordinary tests are not applicable to a railway company and one heavily subsidized) yet it could enter into a contract necessary for the preservation of its estate and without onerous conditions Here the only obligation in resuming possession was repayment of the actual outlay of the lessees in improving and maintaining the property\u2014an expense alike advantageous to the lessor and its creditors.\n3. When a sale of the immovable was imminent under the writ of venditioni exponas the defendants failing in their obligation to maintain the company appellant in the enjoyment of the property pledged for their advances and ameliorations, the lessees were compelled to file an opposition \u00e0 fin de charge to protect their disbursements made upon the faith and pledge of the property they had so improved.\n4. While I contend that the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company was capable of legally entering into the lease in question, and that this opposition must be sustained in consequence thereof,\u2014still I further rely, independently of said lease, upon the pro visions of the articles of the Civil Code relating to improvements made by occupants in good faith, and the right thereby provided to retain the immovable until the impenses utiles are paid.\n5. The last point relied on in support of the judgment is one of procedure, viz., that under art. 664 C. P. C. the present sale cannot be stopped by opposition. In answer to this we say that the greater portion of this outlay was made between the issuing of the writs of fieri facias and venditioni exponas, and the amount of the expenditure or its usefulness is not seriously questioned. This opposition is identical with that upon which a similar opposition was maintained in appeal in Stephens et at. v. Bank of Hochelaga ([4]).\nChoquette for respondent.\nAt the time the contract was made, on the 1st June, 1889, was the defendant competent to give a right of pledge upon its immovables, or to pledge them, or even to alienate them ?\nThe negative of this proposition cannot be controverted. The defendant was wholly bankrupt and in a state of insolvency at the date of the contract; this was within the knowledge of the appellant, the fact appearing on the contract itself. The plaintiff respondent as well as the other creditors of the defendant, had an acquired right to the property of the defend ant. The principle that a debtor's property is the common pledge of his creditors is elementary, and it is useless to discuss it.\nMoreover, the appellant cannot exercise any right by virtue of this contract because it had not been registered. It is only necessary to refer to the law and to read the articles 1633 2128 of the Civil Code on this subject to gain the conviction at once that no right could be conferred upon the appellant by the contract prejudicial to the rights of third parties.\nI also contend that the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company could not lease their line of railway to the appellant or any other company without having obtained the sanction of its shareholders This company was incorporated by the act 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 35, P. Q.; and by section 18 of its charter it was expressly enacted that the company can make any arrangement with any other company to lease its line &c. &c, provided that such arrangements and. agreements, respectively, have been first sanctioned by the majority of votes at a special general meeting of share holders called for the purpose of taking them respectively into consideration after due notice given as laid down in the Railway Act of 1880 of the Consolidated Statutes of the Province of Quebec.\nThen again, could the appellant invoke against the writ venditioni exponas the reasons alleged in the op position ?\nThe cause which gave rise to the appellant's opposition afin de charge was not subsequent to the writ fieri facias but long anterior to it. This alone is a sufficient reason to dismiss the appellant's opposition, and it was so adjudged by the Superior Court and the Court of Appeals.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Lambe, the respondent, having obtained a judgment for the crown in his quality of revenue collector, against the Montreal and Sorel Rail way Company seized in execution thereof the railway of the company. Divers oppositions having been filed to the said seizure the said respondent, after adjudication on said oppositions, took out a writ of venditioni exponas. Thereupon the Great Eastern Railway Company, the present appellants, filed an opposition \u00e0 fin de charge to the said writ, alleging that by an agreement in writing, dated the 1st June 1889, passed with the said Montreal and Sorel Railway Company, which instrument is called a lease in their answers to respondent's pleas they undertook to put the railway in question and keep it in running order; that for their disbursements and expenses for that purpose it was expressly stipulated that they, the appellants, would have a lien and pledge upon the said railway; that under that agreement they, the said appellants, took possession of the said road, and have since kept it in running order; that the amount for their disbursements thereon over the receipts is $35,000, and they pray that the said railway be sold \u00e0 charge by the purchaser of paying to them the said appellants, the said sum, with right of detention by them till payment.\nThe respondent contested this opposition on the grounds, amongst others:\nThat the pretended lease or contract, upon which the opposition is founded is illegal having been made to defraud the creditors of the defendant, which company was completely insolvent and in bankruptcy at the time this contract was made and even before that time to the knowledge of the appellant; and therefore the defendant could not alienate nor pledge its property; and, besides, that such contract had not been registered and could not give any right of pledge as against the rights of third parties, particularly those of respondent whose claim existed at the time the contract was made.\nThat, moreover, the defendant had not the right to lease its line of railway, nor to pledge its property, nor to alienate the same, without the assent of its directors duly ratified by the shareholders in conformity with its rules and regulations and the lay; and that such assent and ratification were never obtained.\nSpecial conclusions to these pleas were taken that the said agreement between the two companies be set aside as illegal and fraudulent\nIssue having been joined and evidence adduced on this contention, the Superior Court gave judgment dismissing the appellants' opposition. This judgment was subsequently confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal. We are asked by the appellants to reverse those judgments.\nWe cannot do. it, in my opinion. Their opposition could not possibly have been maintained. And this on various grounds, all equally fatal to their contentions.\nFirst that the agreement of June 1st, 1889, consented to by the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company when insolvent, to the appellants who knew of that insolvency, as appears by agreement itself, is deemed, in law to have been made with intent to defraud and void as to its anterior creditors, of which the respondent was one. Arts. 1035, 1036 C. C. This is the first ground of the judgment appealed from, and one which, to my mind, remains unimpeached by the appellants.\nThe second ground of the judgment appealed from is that the appellants have no lien on this rail way, that is to say, I assume it to be meant, that they have no right of retention thereof for the payment of their claim, but that any right they may have against the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company should be adjudicated upon on an opposition \u00e0 fin de conserver on the proceeds of the sheriff's sale. This ground I take to be as fatal to the appellants as the first one. A pledgee as a general rule, has not the right to oppose the sale of his pledge under a writ of execution by another creditor of the pledgeor. A thing pledged continues to be the common pledge of the pledgeor's creditors, subject to the special pledgee's right of preference. His right of retention of the pledge till he is paid is a right quoad his debtor only and one which cannot be opposed to his co-creditors Art. 2001 C.C.; Troplong, Priv. & Hyth. under art. 2092 ([5]);Troplong on Nantissement ([6]); Pont des Petits Contrats ([7]); Pothier, Nantissement ([8]); Laurent ([9]) ' Fortier v. H\u00e9bert ([10]).\nThe Court of Appeals' judgment, in that sense, in Young v. Lambert, delivered by Mr. Justice Badgely, is reported at full length in 6 Moore, P. C., N. S. 406. The Privy Council, it is true, reversed that judgment, but they passed over the question whether the pledgees, in that case, had rightly proceeded probably because the point, as they remarked, had been taken before them for the first time. Then the cases had been heard ex parte, and the decision, ant on that account, has less weight according to what their Lordships of the Privy Council themselves said of their decisions under such circumstances, in Tooth v. Power ([11]). As to the pledge of immovables, the pledgee may perhaps, under certain circumstances, have a right of retention as. against the other chirographary creditors of the pledgeor, though that is, in France, a mooted point ([12]). With us I would be inclined to think that no distinction can be made, on this point, between the pledge of movables and the pledge of immovables. However, that may be questionable. It is sufficient for us, for the determination of the present controversy, to hold that, when a contract of pledge of immovables is un registered, as this one is, it has no effect whatever against anterior creditors generally. Arts. 2015, 2094 C.C.\nUnder our system, as a general rule, no rights whatever on immovables exist against third parties without registration. All causes of preference, or privilege on immovables, and the right of retention by a pledgee is clearly a privilege in this sense, must be made public by registration to be effectual against third parties; art. 1977 0. 0. There are a few exce tions to this rule art. 2089 C. C. but they do not include the right of retention by a pledgee. Then, a deed as the one now in question, if registered, would perhaps, at most, only entitle the pledgee to ask, before being compelled to surrender the immovable pledged, [security that its sale will bring a sufficient price to ensure the payment of his claim, art. 2073 C. 0., if he alleged that the value of the thing pledged does not exceed the amount of his claim, or that his security may he endangered by the sheriff's sale. The appellants here have failed to do this in their opposition. However, we have not to determine what may be the appellant's rights after the sale, or what they might have been if the deed of pledge had been registered. All that we determine is that they have no right of retention in the present case against their anterior creditor, the respondent.\nArt. 419 C C. invoked by the appellants does not apply Upon the principle that guided the Superior Court in Prowse v. Simpson ([13]) and the Court of Ap peal in Blatte v. Luroche ([14]) that article does not give to a pledgee a right of retention against the pledgees execution creditors for the payment of his disbursements on the property pledged ([15]).\nThe case of Monnet v. Brunet ([16]) cited by the appellants was not an action by a creditor and consequently does not support his contention. Here also, it must be remarked it is not the disbursements incidental to their possession that the appellants claim but the very debt for which the pledge has been given to them by the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company, and I have said why, in my opinion, they cannot succeed on their opposition.\nAnother serious objection to the appellants opposition were it possible otherwise to maintain it, arises from their not having proved that the deed of June, 1890 had been ratified by the shareholders of the company as required by sec. 18 of their charter, 44 & 45 Vic. c. 35. The respondent specially denied such ratification and upon the appellants, it seems to me, was, on that issue, the onus probandi.\nThe deed, it may be remarked, was not an authentic one.\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants : M.

Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Chief Justice, and Justices Crease, McCreight, Walkem and Drake) the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada is desired upon the following case:\"\n\"1. By section 5 of the provincial statute, cap. 25 Consolidated Acts of B. C., the ' County Courts Act,' the following provision is made:\"\u2014\n\"A county court shall be and is hereby established within and for the Cache Creek, Kamloops, Nicola Lake, Okanagan and Rock Creek polling divisions of the electoral district of Yale, to be called the ' county court of Yale,' having jurisdiction throughout the said polling divisions of the electoral district of Yale.\"\n\"2. The polling divisions referred to in the said section were the divisions of the district of Yale for the purposes of provincial elections to the legislative assembly for the province of British Columbia.\" \"3. Section 7 of the same act provides that a county court shall be and is hereby established within and for the electoral district of Kootenay, to be called the ' county court of Kootenay,' having jurisdiction throughout the electoral district of Kootenay.\"\n\"The electoral district of Kootenay referred to in the last quoted section was the electoral district for the purposes of elections for the provincial legislature.\"\n\"4. Section 12 of the same statute (cap. 25) enacts that ' each such court shall be holden before a judge, to be called and known by the name and style of the judge of the county court of Yale, or the judge of the county court of Kootenay,' as the case may be; each such judge shall, from time to time, be nominated and appointed by the Governor-General of Canada.\n\"5. By section 14 of the last mentioned act, as amended by 54 Vic. cap. 7, section 1, the ' County Court Amendment Act, 1891,' it is enacted that ' any county court judge appointed under this act may act as county court judge in any other district upon the death, illness or unavoidable absence of, or at the request of, the judge of that district, and while so acting the said first mentioned judge shall possess all the powers and authorities of a county court judge in the said district: provided, however, that the said judge so acting out of his district shall immediately thereafter report in writing to the provincial secretary the fact of his so doing and the cause thereof.\"\n\"6.

By the federal statute, 54 & 55 Vic. cap. 28, the following provisions are made:\"\n\" (1.)

THOMPSON,\n\"For Minister of Justice.\"\n\u00c6milius Irving Q.C. for the Attorney-General of British Columbia.\nSedgewick Q.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada. STRONG J.\u2014In answer to questions 1 and 2 I am of opinion that both section 14 of the County Courts Act (Con. Stats. of British Columbia, ch. 25) as amended by 54 Vic. ch. 7, section 1 (the County Court Amendment Act, 1891) and section 9 of the County Courts Amendment Act, 1890 (53 Vict. ch. 8) were within the powers of the legislature of British Columbia, and I am of opinion that they are so intra vires independently of any Federal legislation.\nMy reasons for this opinion are that such legislation was a valid exercise of the power conferred upon the provinces by subsection 14 of section 92 of the British North America Act, whereby provincial legislatures were empowered to make laws regarding the administration of justice in the provinces including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including civil procedure in those courts. The powers of the federal government respecting provincial courts are limited to the appointment and payment of the judges of those courts and to the regulation of their procedure in criminal matters. The jurisdiction of parliament to legislate as regards the jurisdiction of provincial courts is, I consider, excluded by subsec. 14 of sec. 92, before referred to, inasmuch as the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts plainly includes the power to define the jurisdiction of such courts territorially as well as in other respects. This seems to me too plain to require demonstration.\nThen if the jurisdiction of the courts is to be defined by the provincial legislatures that must necessarily also involve the jurisdiction of the judges who constitute such courts.\nIf this were not so it would be necessary, whenever the territorial jurisdiction of a county court was altered or enlarged, that recourse should be had to federal legislation, under the general reserved powers of parliament, to sanction the change, or that the judges should be re-appointed by a new commission. I think it clear that parliament in such a matter could not legislate without infringing the exclusive powers of the provincial legislature, and the notion that a new commission would be requisite in every case of an enlargement of the territorial jurisdiction of any of the courts in question is too preposterous to be entertained. It must follow, therefore, that the whole power of legislating as regards the jurisdiction of provincial courts is restricted to the provincial legislatures.\nI therefore answer the two first questions in the negative.\nThe expression \"any judge of a county court \" in the \" Speedy Trials Act,\" must, in my opinion, be taken to refer to any judge having, by force of the provincial law regulating the constitution and organization of county courts, jurisdiction in the particular locality in which he may hold a \" speedy trial .\" This statute would not, I conceive, authorize a county court judge having no authority from the provincial legislature so to do in holding a \"speedy trial\" without the limits of his territorial jurisdiction. This last conclusion necessarily results from the preceding observations. I may add that I do not regard the Dominion statute known as \" The Speedy Trials Act \" as a statute conferring jurisdiction, but rather as an exercise of the power of parliament to regulate criminal procedure. This answers question three.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I do not take part in this consultation. I have some doubts on the constitutionality of some of the enactments contained in the 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25, and on the power of parliament to make this court an advisory board to the executive power or its officers, or, as it seems to me to have done in some instances by that statute, a court of original jurisdiction.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I also agree with Mr. Justice Strong and scarcely understand how any doubt could have arisen among the judges in British Columbia.\n[1] 2 B.

(P.Q.) ch. 90 sec. 3, granting to respondent a statutory privilege to construct a toll-bridge across the Chaudi\u00e8re River in the parish of St. George, it is enacted that \"so soon as the bridge shall be open to the use of the public as aforesaid during thirty years no person shall erect, or cause to be erected, any bridge or bridges or works or use or cause to be used any means of passage for the conveyance of any persons, vehicles or cattle for lucre or gain, across the said river, within the distance of one league above and one league below the bridge, which shall be measured along the banks of the river and following its windings; and any person or persons who shall build or cause to be built a toll-bridge or toll-bridges or who shall use or cause to be used, for lucre or gain, any other means of passage across the said river for the conveyance of persons, vehicles or cattle, within such limits, shall pay to the said David Roy three times the amount of the tolls imposed by the present act. for the persons, cattle or vehicles which shall thus pass over such bridge or bridges; and if any person or per sons shall, at any time, for lucre or gain convey across the river any person or persons, cattle or vehicles within the above mentioned limits, such offender shall incur a penalty not exceeding ten dollars for each person, animal or vehicle which shall have thus passed the said river; provided always that nothing contained in the present act shall be of a nature to prevent any persons cattle, vehicles or loads from crossing such river within the said limits by a ford or in a canoe or other vessel without charge.\"\nAfter the bridge had been used for several years the appellant municipality passed a by-law to erect a free bridge across the Chaudi\u00e8re River in close proximity to the toll-bridge-in existence; the respondent thereupon by petition for injunction prayed that the appellant municipality be restrained from proceeding to the erection of a free bridge.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the erection of the free bridge would be an infringement of the respondent's franchise of a toll-bridge, and the injunction should be granted.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe material facts are as follows: In 1881 the respondent, by a statute passed by the legislature of Quebec, 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 90, obtained the statutory privilege to erect a toll-bridge, on the Chaudi\u00e8re River, in the parish of St. George, in the district of Beauce. In addition to the clause of the statute given in the head note section one was also referred to.\nBy that section it is provided that a after the expiration of eight years from the passing of the act, it shall and may be lawful for the municipality of St. George to assume the possession of the said bridge and dependencies and to acquire the owner ship thereof, upon paying to the said David Roy the value which the same shall at the time of such assumption bear and be worth with an addition of twenty per centum, and after such assumption it shall become a free bridge and shall be maintained by the municipality as such free bridge.\"\nThe respondent maintained in good order his bridge collecting tolls thereon for ten years, it being the only one erected on the Chaudi\u00e8re River within a distance of six miles. In 1891 the appellant municipality, in order to avail itself of a subsidy of $17,500, granted by the government of the province of Quebec to aid in the erection of an iron bridge on the river Chaudi\u00e8re, determined to erect within the limits of the municipality an iron bridge free and open to the public, and passed a by-law on the 19th June, 1891, authorizing the erection of a free iron bridge opposite the parish church of St. George, within a short distance of respondent's toll-bridge, without paying to him the indemnity mentioned in the first section of 44 4 45 Vic. ch. 90.\nAfter the passing of this by-law, on the 14th July, 1,891, the respondent applied for and obtained a writ of injunction calling upon the corporation, appellant, to suspend all action and operations under the by-law of the 19th June and to stop all work of construction on the bridge, because, amongst other reasons, the by-law was illegal null and void and also because the act of the legislature, 44 & 43 Vic. ch. 90, had given him the exclusive and perpetual privilege of building and maintaining a toll bridge within the limits of three miles above and three miles below his own.\nThe superior court of the district of Beauce held that the by-law of the 19th June was valid and that Roy did not have as against the municipality of Aubert-Grallion, the exclusive privilege to build and maintain an open bridge, and rejected the writ of injunction with costs.\nThe court of Queen's Bench also held the by-law of the 19th of June to be legal and intra vires but held that the by-law could not be carried out so long as the statutory privileges in question remained in force, and maintained the injunction.\nLini\u00e8rs Taschereau Q.C. and Lem\u00efeux for the appellant.\nThe statute 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 90 cannot be relied on as a prohibition to the municipality to erect a free bridge.\nA municipal corporation has unrestricted and clearly defined rights to build free bridges on rivers, water courses, etc.; and this power or right cannot be taken away from it by a charter granted to an individual, unless it be by a formal enactment to that effect.\nThe act recited forbids only private persons, for the space of thirty years, from entering into competition with Roy by the erection and building of a toll-bridge for lucre or gain, within three miles on either side of this bridge but this prohibition does not extend to the corporation.\nThe act forbids the erection by individuals for lucre or gain, but does not apply to the bridge intended by the corporation of Aubert-Gallion which is to be for free and gratuitous use.\nRoy answers this objection by a reason ab inconveuiente: \" A free bridge \" he says i is even more ruinous to me than another bridge for lucre or gain.\" That may be; but Roy has placed himself in that position for the act of the legislature which forbids individuals to erect bridges for lucre or gain, was passed at his request, on his own petition, addressed to the legislature and which should have contained the terms under which the statute was to be passed He de fined his own position, as appears by the preamble of the act and he cannot to-day be allowed to improve it\nMoreover, is it to be believed that if Roy had asked of the legislature an enactment forbidding the building of a free bridge by the corporation, such a monopoly would have been granted him? No, for it would have been manifestly unjust to make the interest of the whole public subservient to that of a simple individual.\nTo grant such a monopoly legislative authorization was required in formal and express terms, and such was never given directly or indirectly to municipal corporations in the province of Quebec. See Harrison's Municipal Manual ([1]). The authorities are unanimous in declaring that the terms of grants conferred on individuals must always be applied and interpreted strictly. See Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes ([2]); Maxwell on Statutes ([3]); Sedgewick on the Interpretation of Statutory Law ([4]); and also arts. 520, 542, 485, 460, 84 M.C. (P.Q.)\nFitzpdtrick Q.C. for the respondent:\nThe question which arises on this appeal is: Whether a corporation which, in the public interest, grants a perpetual and exclusive franchise to any one to build a bridge, a franchise which has been confirmed by the legislature with the condition that the said corporation may, after eight years, convert the same into a free bridge on indemnifying the proprietor, has a right to set at nought its promises and engagements, without any right on the other hand, to those who are ruined by its conduct to complain of the same?\nI contend that the statute 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 90, grants to the respondent a perpetual and exclusive privilege, and that the appellant cannot without breach of the most elementary good faith, violate a public contract, repudiate a solemn engagement and not only ruin the respondent but tax him over the bargain, in order to aid in the construction of a free bridge alongside of his own.\nThe clause by which the appellant cannot convert this toll-bridge into a free bridge, without paying the yalue thereof has not been written to protect the public, for, to the latter, a free bridge is worth a hundred-fold more than a toil-bridge. It was evidently framed in the interest of the respondent so that he might not be ruined at the caprice of four councillors. The following\" cases and authorities were cited and relied on: Galarneau v. Guilbault ([5]); Corriveau v. Corporation St. Valier ([6]); Charles River Bridge Co. v. Warren Bridge Co. ([7]);and Kent's Commentaries ([8]).\nThe learned counsel also argued the question of the validity of the by-law, but the grounds relied on for and against the validity are sufficiently reviewed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fournier.\nSTRONG J. concurred with TASCHEREAU J.\nFOURNIER J: Par un r\u00e8glement du conseil de la municipalit\u00e9 d'Aubert-Gallion, en date du deux novembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt, ii fut ordonn\u00e9 et statue.\nART. ler.\u2014Que M.

Ce privil\u00e8ge ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par l'acte 44-45 Vic. c. 90, ii n'est plus loisible \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 de rien entre prendre qui soit en contradiction avec son r\u00e8glement ni avec le statut de la l\u00e9gislature accordant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 les m\u00eames droits et privil\u00e8ges car tous deux sont de la nature d'un contrat entre la l\u00e9gislature et la municipalit\u00e9 d'une part et l'intim\u00e9, de l'autre et sont \u00e9galement obligatoires pour les deux parties.\nEn vertu des pouvoirs qui lui \u00e9taient conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le r\u00e8glement et le statut ci-haut cites l'intim\u00e9 a construit \u00e0 l'endroit indiqu\u00e9 dans la dite municipalit\u00e9, un pont offrant au public toutes les conditions de s\u00fbret\u00e9 et de commodit\u00e9 voulues. Ce pont a exist\u00e9 depuis au del\u00e0 de dix ans, et est encore en existence, et en \u00e9tat de servir avantageusement pour l'utilit\u00e9 du public. Cependant la dite municipalit\u00e9, en violation du r\u00e8gle ment et du statut ci-haut cites, a pass\u00e9 en date du 19 juin 1891, un r\u00e8glement ordonnant la construction d'un pont en fer qui devait \u00eatre un pont municipal.\nCe r\u00e8glement contient entre autres les dispositions suivantes: 1 Que ce pont serait construit en fer sous la direction du gouvernement de Qu\u00e9bec, conform\u00e9 gouvernement se chargerait de tous les frais de la superstructure du dit pont, et la municipalit\u00e9 construirait les cul\u00e9es et les piliers en pierre suivant les plans et sp\u00e9cifications annex\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement.\n3 Les clauses 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 et 15 fixent la date du commencement d es ouvrages et de leur ach\u00e8vement, le mode d'accorder le contrat, ainsi que le mode de paiement, les garanties d'ex\u00e9cution du contrat les cotisations sur les contribuables pour frais de construction, en outre une d\u00e9claration limitant la responsabilit\u00e9 de la municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 $11,500, avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de trois ans se montant en tous \u00e0 $13340 le nom du surintendant, le mode d'entretien et de r\u00e9paration du dit pont et finalement que ce pont serait libre et gratuitement ouvert au public.\nApr\u00e8s l'adoption de ce r\u00e8glement, l'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure un bref d'injonction pour faire ordonner \u00e0 l'appelante de suspendre tons proc\u00e9d\u00e9s en vertu du r\u00e8glement du 19 juin, et d'arr\u00eater tous les onvrages de la construction du dit pont, pour entre autres, les raisons suivantes: Que le dit r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait nul, et que l'acte de la l\u00e9gislature 44-45 Vic. c. 90, lui avait accord\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge exciusif de construire et entretenir un pout de p\u00e9age dans les trois milles au dessus et audessous du lieu indiqu\u00e9.\nLe jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, district de Beauce, a reconnu la validit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement du 19 juin, et a d\u00e9ni\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 son privil\u00e8ge exciusif de construire un pont \u00e0 l'encontre de la municipalit\u00e9. Ce jugement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 porte en appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc de la Reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9.\nDans leur constestation les parties out soulev\u00e9 un grand nombre de questions dont ii est inutile de s'occuper pour la d\u00e9cision du litige en cette cause.\nLa question se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 savoir si, apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par la dite municipalit\u00e9 appelante, accordant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de construire un pont, privil\u00e8ge reconnu plus tard, par l'acte de la l\u00e9gislature 44-45 Vict. ch. 90 accordant de nouveau au dit intim\u00e9, le m\u00eame privil\u00e8ge, la municipalit\u00e9 peut-elle main tenant entraver l'exercice du privil\u00e8ge de l'intim\u00e9, en construisant on permettant de construire, au m\u00eame endroit, dans la dite municipalit\u00e9 un pont libre qui aurait l'effet de d\u00e9truire compl\u00e8tement la valeur du pont de p\u00e9age de l'intime? Ne s'est-elle pas an con traire, par son dit r\u00e8glement interdit tout droit de construire un pout en opposition au privil\u00e8ge qu'elle a accord\u00e9?\nLa d\u00e9cision de cette question est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par les termes du r\u00e8glement et par les sections 1 et 3 du statut 44 45 Vict. ch. 90.\nEn d\u00e9clarant, par son r\u00e8glement qu'apr\u00e8s que le pont aura \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert au public, et tant qu'il restera en bon \u00e9tat nulle personne et nulle compagnie ne construira ni ne fera construire aucun pont ou pouts, etc., l'appelante a fait une prohibition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et absolue dans laquelle elle est n\u00e9cessairement comprise elle m\u00eame, puisqu'elle est la partie contractante et l'autorit\u00e9 qui cr\u00e9e et accorde le privil\u00e8ge en question en faveur de l'intim\u00e9. Il n'y a aucune r\u00e9serve quelconque en sa faveur et cette d\u00e9claration doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme s'appliquant \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame.\nLa m\u00eame prohibition est contenue dans l'acte 44-45 Vict. ch. 90 et doit avoir le m\u00eame effet. Elle est m\u00eame encore plus \u00e9tendue, puisqu'elle ne fait qu'une exception en faveur de celui qui passerait \u00e0 gu\u00e9 ou en canot et sans charge, cette restriction prouve bien que la prohibition est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nJ'ai dit que le r\u00e8glement doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant l'effet d'un contrat entre la municipalit\u00e9 d'une part et l'intim\u00e9 Roy, de l'autre. Ceiui-ci, en construisant un pont a accept\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Le fait d'avoir demand\u00e9 et obtenu de la l\u00e9gislature la confirmation do ce privil\u00e8ge, ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une renonciation \u00e0 ses droits. Tout au contraire, ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre con sid\u00e9r\u00e9 que comme une mesure de prudence pour se mettre \u00e0 l'abri des contestations trop fr\u00e9quentes des r\u00e8glements municipaux. Il sauvegardait ainsi ses droits en les mettant sous la protection d'un acte de la l\u00e9gislature qui lui en assurait la jouissance. Ce privil\u00e8ge doit, d'apr\u00e8s le statut, durer pendant trente ans, et d'apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement, tant que le pont restera en bon \u00e9tat.\nDans un de ses plaidoyers, l'appelante a pr\u00e9tendu quo le pout en question \u00e9tait en ruine et dangereux pour le public. Ce motif n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 comme raison d'ordonner la construction d'un nouveau pont, parce qu'il e\u00fbt alors \u00e9t\u00e9 facile \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de prouver que le pont existant \u00e9tait suffisant et en \u00e9tat de servir au public et quo le public s'en servait alors. Ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la preuve en cette cause, ainsi que le comporte le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine, d\u00e9clarant qu'il n'appert pas quo le dit; pont n'est pas eu bon \u00batat.\nDans la cause de GaIarneau v. Guilbault ([9]) la cour a en l'occasion d'examiner la question de l'\u00e9tendue d'un semblable privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 pour la construction d'un pout. Une des conditions du privil\u00e8ge \u00e9tait quo si le pout par accident ou autrement \u00e9tait d\u00e9truit, on devenait dangereux ou impassable, les demandeurs seraient tenus dele reb\u00e2tir dans les 15 mois, sous peine de forfaiture de tous les avantages accord\u00e9s par le dit acte, et que pendant tout le temps que le dit pont serait dangereux on impassable, les dits demandeurs seraient obliges de maintenir une traverse sur la dite rivi\u00e8re, pour laquelle ils pourraient percevoir des p\u00e9ages Ce pont ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9 par les glaces, les demandeurs se mirent en frais d'en construire un autre et entretinrent une traverse, les d\u00e9fendeurs pr\u00e9tendant que les prohibitions du statut n'avaient pas d'autre effet que de prot\u00e9ger le pont, pendant qu'il \u00e9tait en existence, et ne pouvaient nullement s'\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la protection de la traverse. La cour d\u00e9cida que le privil\u00e8ge exclusif accord\u00e9 par le statut s'\u00e9tendait \u00e0 la traverse, et, tant qu'elle \u00e9tait maintenue par les demandeurs, les d\u00e9fendeurs n'avaient aucun droit de b\u00e2tir un pont temporaire, etc.\nL'\u00e9tendue do ce privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e encore plus loin dans la cause de Girard v. B\u00e9langer ([10]) o\u00f9 ii avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 St-Hyacinthe, le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1872, par Sicotte, T., que la construction d'un pont sur lequel on n'exigerait pas de p\u00e9ages n'\u00e9tait pas une atteinte aux privil\u00e8ges des demandeurs.\nSur appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc de la Reine, ([11]) ce juge ment fut infirm\u00e9 et ii fut an contraire maintenu que c'\u00e9tait une atteinte aux privil\u00e8ges des demandeurs, appelants leur donnant le droit d'en demander la d\u00e9molition pour faire respecter leur privil\u00e8ge. Ce dernier judgment fut rendu unanimement en 1874 par la cour du Banc de la Reine. On en trouve la substance dans l'ouvrage de feu l'honorable juge Ramsay, o\u00f9 l'on voit qu'il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la construction d'un semblable pont n'\u00e9tait qu'un moyen d'\u00e9viter le privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 au propri\u00e9taire du pont de p\u00e9age.\nCe privil\u00e8ge a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu dans une cause de Globensky et ux v. Lukin et al ([12]) dans laquelle il fat d\u00e9cid\u00e9 '.\nQue le propri\u00e9taire d'un moulin qui a pratiqu\u00e9 ou fait pratiquer an moyen de bacs ou chalans des voies de passage et traverses dans les limites du privil\u00e8ge d'un pont de p\u00e9age, pour y traverser les gens \u00e0 son moulin gratuitement, mais dans la vue de se procurer des gains par la mouture de lenrs grains, est passible de dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats envers le propri\u00e9taire de ce pont \u00e0 raison de la perte de ses profits, qui lui sont ainsi enlev\u00e9s indirectement\nPar tous ces motifs, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens,\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondent in this case attacks, by a petition for injunction, a by-law passed by the municipality, appellant, in June, 1891, for the erection of a free bridge across the Chaudi\u00e8re River, and prays that the appellant be restrained from proceeding with the said erection on the ground that it would be an unlawful interference of the privilege granted to him by the legislature in 1881 by the act 44 & 45 Vie ch. 90, under which he was authorized to build and has built a toll-bridge across the said river, within the said municipality. Section 3 of the said act reads as follows ([13]).\nThe bridge projected by the municipality, appellant, would be within one league from the respondent's, but they contend that a free bridge would not be an un lawful interference with his franchisa. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, was adverse to their contention and ordered them not to proceed with the erection of the said bridge. I am of opinion that this judgment was right though on grounds different from those upon which the said judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was based.\nThe appellants would read section 3 above cited of the respondent s charter, as if it said: \" during thirty years no person shall erect, or cause to be erected, any bridge or bridges or works, for lucre or gain, within the distance of one league from the said bridge \" and hence argue that a bridge for lucre or gain only is prohibited by the statute, and not a free bridge. But the words \" for lucre or gain \" are not so to be found therein after the words \" any bridge or bridges or works,\" but only after the words \" or use or cause to be used any means of passage for the conveyance of any persons, vehicles or cattle.\" I do not see. that these words \" for lucre or gain \" are at all connected with the words \" bridge or bridges or works.\" I read the sentence as if the words \" for lucre or gain \" were inserted immediately after \" or use or cause to be used.\" And I am fully justified in doing so, it seems to me, by the fact that it is after the same words, \"use or cause tobe used,\" that the words \" lucre or gain \" are to be found a few lines after, in the same clause, when decreeing the penalty for in fringement of the charter. And that penalty is \" on any \"person who shall build or cause to be built a toll bridge or toll-bridges within the said limits,\" consisting in three times the amount of the tolls imposed by the act for the persons cattle or vehicles, which shall thus pass over such bridge or bridges, whether such persons, cattle or vehicle have passed free or not, such a toll-bridge it is clear, not being absolutely prohibited, sed qu\u0153re? as per Sir Montague Smith in Jones v. Stanstead, Shefford & Chambly Ry. Co. ([14]); Leprohon v. Globensky ([15]); Globetisky v. Lukin ([16]),\u2014with a penalty of ten dollars for each person, animal, or vehicle conveyed across the said river for lucre or gain, within the said limits, by any other means of passage\u2014here again, rising the words \" for lucre or gain,\" only in connection with the means of \"passage other than by a bridge.\nThen the words \" bridge for lucre or gain \" are not those generally used in statutes in pari materi\u00e2 to mean a toll-bridge. Whenever a bridge for lucre or gain is meant, it is called a toll-bridge, not a bridge for lucre or gain, and this very statute, nay this very clause itself, when decreeing penalties, is an instance of it. And if the legislature had here intended to for bid only the erection of a toll-bridge or of toll-bridges it would have said, \"no person shall erect or cause to be erected any toll-bridge or toll-bridges.5' But it did not say so. The prohibition extends to any bridge.\nNeither can this section be read again as limiting the prohibition to a bridge for lucre or gain as contended for by the appellants; \" no person shall erect or cause to be erected any bridge or bridges, or works for the conveyance of any persons, vehicles or cattle for lucre or gain across the said river.\" A bridge is built for the pas sage but not for the conveyance of any one, and the words \" for the conveyance of any persons, vehicles or cattle for lucre or gain \" are clearly governed by and relate only to the preceding words \" any means of passage.\" This section must be read, and, in fact reads as follows, in the French as in the English version: \" During thirty years, no person shall erect or cause to be erected any bridge or bridges or works across the said river within the distance of one league.\" It thus expressly enacts that no bridge of any kind shall, within a league, be erected in opposition to the respondent's privilege, a prohibition which as against a free bridge was obviously, by the legis lature itself considered as absolute, and which accordingly was left to be enforced, when necessary, as has been done by the respondent here, and by the grantee of a similar franchise, in an analogous case, in Montreal, Leprohon v. Globensky ([17]), by a restraining order, the penalties imposed applying exclusively to the infringement of the franchise by a toll-bridge or by the other prohibited means of passage.\nThis is made still clearer by the proviso of the section which specially exempts a free passage by a ford, or in a canoe, or other vessel from the prohibition to cross the river within the said limits. Does not that infer that a free bridge is to be prohibited? If not, why a proviso to allow free passage by a ford or canoe or other vessel without mention of a free bridge? If the legislature had intended to permit a free bridge, it would not so have exclusively provided for a free passage by a ford or canoe or other vessel. Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. Comp. Garnier, Reg. des Eaux ([18]).\nThe appellant would have us read this proviso as if it extended to a free bridge. But there is no rule or construction of statutes that I know of to authorize it. Quite the contrary, when the statute says that, notwithstanding the privilege granted, a free passage by a ford or in a canoe or other vessel, shall be permitted, it clearly, it seems to me, though impliedly only, decrees, or assumes rather, that a free bridge or a free passage by a bridge shall not be permitted. And is it not evident that if the legislature had, by the act, allowed the erection of a free bridge at any time, by this corporation or by any one else, in opposition to the respondent's privilege, the public would then have had no bridge at all? Suppose (says Putnam J.) ([19]) for example, a free bridge should be placed by the side of the toll-bridge, it would seem a mere mockery to tell the proprietors of the toll-bridge that they might still have all the toll that they could collect over their bridge. This free bridge would as effectually destroy their franchise as if an armed force were stationed to prevent any one passing over it. Who does not see that their charter would be subverted by this construction?\nCharters creating a monopoly or granting a franchise, it is true, are, as argued by the appellants, strictissimi juris. But they, like all other statutes, must receive, if possible, a construction which will promote the object of the law giver, not one which would defeat his intentions. And\nin every case, (says Story J.) the rule is made to bend to the real justice and integrity of the case. No strained or extravagant construction is to be made in favour of the king. And, if the intention of the grant is obvious, a fair and liberal interpretation of its terms is enforced. Whenever the grant is upon valuable consideration this rule of construction ceases and the rule is expounded, exactly as it would be in the case of a private grant, in favour of the grantee ([20]).\nSuch a grant is always made in the interest of the public, to ensure an easy access from one side of a river to the other which it has previously been impossible to get, and which without it, it must be assumed, cannot be obtained. And this very grant itself was, on its face and in express terms, so made to the respondent for the benefit of the public:\n\"Whereas (says its preamble) the construction of a toll-bridge over the river Chaudi\u00e8re, in the parish of St Greorge, in the county of Beauce, would greatly tend to promote the welfare and to facilitate the inter course of the inhabitants of the said parish and of the neighbouring parishes, and whereas David Roy has, by petition, prayed to be authorized to construct such a toll-bridge.\" Could anything be clearer? Is it not solely upon these considerations of public utility and in return for his assuming an enterprise needed by the public, that the legislature granted this franchise to the respondent?\nThese franchises (says Chancellor Kent) ([21]) are presumed to be founded on a valuable consideration and. to involve public duties, and to be made for the public accommodation and to be affected with a jus publicum, and they are necessarily exclusive in their nature.\nSee also Perrine v. Chesapeake ([22]).\nThe obligation between the Government and the grantee of such a franchise is mutual. He is obliged to provide and maintain facilities for accommodating the public, at all times, with an easy crossing. The law on the other hand, in consideration of this duty, provides him a recompense by means of an inclusive toll, to be exacted from persons who use the bridge, and, of course, it will protect him against any new establishment calculated to draw away his custom to his prejudice.\nOr, in the words of the same learned Chancellor:\nThe grant must be so construed as to give it due effect, by excluding all contiguous and injurious competition. Ogden v. Gibbons ([23]).\nFor it has been said long ago\nwhere the use is granted, everything is granted by which the grantee may have and enjoy the use ([24]).\nAnd if two constructions may be made one to mate the grant good. the other to make it void then for the honour of the king and the benefit of the subject such construction shall be made that the grant shall be good.'\" Bacon's Abridg. Prerog, F. 2.\nAnd, (says Mr. Justice Story) ([25]): Wherever a grant is made for a valuable consideration which involves public duties and charges, the grant shall be so construed as to make the indemnity co-extensive with the burden\nMcLean J. in the same case said:\nMuch discussion has been had at the bar, as to the rule of construing a charter or grant. In ordinary cases, a grant is construed favour- ably to the grantee, and against the grantor. But it is contended that in government grants nothing is taken by implication. The broad rule thus laid down cannot be supported by authority. Whatever is essential to the enjoyment of the thing granted must be taken by implication, and this rule holds good whether the grant emanates from the royal prerogative of the King in England, or under an act of legisla-ture in this country. Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge (11 Peters 557.)\nIn Newburg Turnpike Co. v. Miller ([26]), it was held, in that sense that where one has a franchise of a bridge with the exclusive right of taking toll, though no limit above or below are defined by the charter the erection of a free bridge, by another person, so near as to create a competition injurious to such franchise, is an infringement of the grant and will be prohibited by injunction.\nNo rival road bridge ferry or other establishment of a similar kind (said the court), can be tolerated so near to the other as materially to affect or take away its custom. It operates as a fraud upon the grant and goes to defeat it. The consideration by which individuals are invited to expend money upon great, expensive, and hazard ous public works, as roads and bridges, and to become bound to keep them in constant and good repair, is the grant of a right to an ex elusive toll. This right, thus purchased for a valuable consideration, cannot be taken away by direct or indirect means.\nI need not remark that the respondent's case here is still more favourable, as his charter clearly defines the limits of his privilege.\nIn Reg. v. Gambrian Railway Co. ([27]) Blackburn J. said:\nThe prosecutors right is to a ferry, or franchise, by which he had the exclusive right of carrying passengers across the river. It is well established that if that right is interfeded with, without the authority of an act of parliament, an action would lie for that disturbance.\nThat case was, it is true, overruled by Hopkins v. The Great Northern ([28]), but only on the ground that a railway bridge, authorized by act of parliament, is not an infringement of the franchise of a ferry. A question of the same nature as to a toll-bridge arose in the province of Quebec in the case of Jones v. Stanstead ([29]), which was ultimately determined by the Privy Council ([30]), but upon grounds which have no application to the present case.\nIn the United States it was also held in Re Lake v. Virginia ([31]), upon the principle that any ambiguity in the terms of the grant of a franchise must operate against the grantee and in favour of the public, that a railway bridge is not an infringement of a previous grant of the exclusive right of a toll-bridge. But neither does that case help the appellants here. It is in fact their construction of the respondent's charter which would, if adopted, then have clearly, in 1881, not been in favour of the public, since the public would not then have had the bridge which the act itself says was needed to promote the welfare of the inhabitants.\nIn the well known case of Charles River Bridge Co. v. Warren Bridge Co. ([32]) to which I have already referred, the grantees of the franchise of a toll-bridge were, it is true, defeated in their attempt to restrain the erection of another bridge near theirs; but they had no limits defined by their charter above and below their bridge for the exclusive exercise of their franchise, and moreover the bridge of the defendants had been authorized by a special act of the legislature; and the great controversy before the courts was as to the power of the legislature to pass such an act, it being contended by the plaintiffs that the act was ultra uires under the constitution of the United States, as impairing the obligation of a contract. But the case is no authority in favour of the appellants here. On the contrary, it is evident by a reference to the opinion of Taney C.J., who gave the judgment of the court, that the plaintiffs would have been successful if their charter had defined certain limits for their privilege, and, I assume from the report even without any such limits being defined in their charter, if the defendant's bridge had not been authorized by statute See also Tuckahoe Canal Co. v. Tuckahoe Railroad Co. ([33]). Such according to Garnier, Reg. des. Eaux ([34]) would be the decision, in France, under similar circumstances. See also Daniel Cours d'Eaux ([35]).\nAnd it cannot be doubted in fact it must be assumed, that if the legislature here had been asked, or were asked at any time during the thirty years of the respondent's privilege, to grant a charter, or a permission for another bridge whether a free bridge or a toll bridge, within three miles from the respondent's, such a petition would not have been, or would not he granted, if the respondent performed all his obligations, or if granted at all, would have been so, or he so, only upon providing for due compensation to the respondent. It would have been an expropriation of the franchise. It cannot be presumed that the legislature would by a clear abuse of power, have destroyed its own grant and committed a fraud on its grantee.\nAs said in Dalloz Repertoire ([36]).\nPar le fait m\u00eame de la concession, l'\u00e9tat contracte envers les adjudi cataires de constructions de ponts l'obligation de les mainteuir dans la jouissance du droit de p\u00e9age, et de n'apporter dans la situation des choses aucun changement qui serait de nature \u00e0 porter prejudice aux int\u00e9r\u00eats des concessionnaires.\nA case noted in Ramsay's Digest of Girard v. Belanger ([37]) decided by the Court of Appeal in Montreal, in 1874 is on all fours with the present one. There the court, reversing the judgment reported at 17 L. C. Jur. 263, distinctly held that a free bridge was an infringement of a charter for a toll-bridge similar to the respondent's here, and, in one respect, not so favourable to the exclusiveness of the franchise For there the proviso exempted from the operation of the act the free crossing by a ford or in a canoe or otherwise ([38]) whilst here these words \"or otherwise\" have been replaced by the words \" or other vessel,l removing one of the grounds that had given, rise to the controversy in that case of Girurd v Belager. And this decision of the highest court in the province which, as I have said was rendered in 1874 furnishes an additional argument against the appellants' contention here, the respondent's charter having been granted in 1881 after that decision. For it is a well settled rule of construction (unaffected by legislation in the province of Quebec as it is. for Dominion statutes, hype Vic. ch. 7 (D.) that where a statute has received a judicial interpretation, and the legislature has after-wards re-enacted one in pari materia it must be considered to have adopted the construction which the courts had given to it See Per Strong J. Nicholls v. Cumming ([39]). See also cases cited in Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes ([40]). This rule it seems to me applies here with the more force, as by the replacing 1 have noticed above of the words \" or Otherwise,\" by the words \"any other vessel,\" the legislature must be assumed in view of the anterior decision of the Court of Appeal to have intended the decree more clearly, and so as to remove any room for doubt that a free bridge would be an infringement of the grant to the respondent.\nIn the case of Gralarneau v. Guilbault ([41]), in this court, Mr. Justice Fournier, delivering the judgment of the court, was clearly of opinion that a free bridge, under similar circumstances, is an infringement of the franchise of a toll bridge. It was not necessary, how ever, for the determination of that case to decide the point.\nA case of Motz v. Rouleau, noted in Globensky v. Lukin, et at. ([42]), decided in the Court of Appeal, Quebec, in 1848 is the other way. On cite ces arr\u00eats comme on signale des \u00e9cueils, says Boncenne. It was there held that a free bridge was not an infringement of a charter for a toll-bridge granted in 1818, by the 58 Geo. III. ch. 25 Lower Canada, to one Verrault, of Ste. Marie, Beauce. That decision, however., was overruled by the legislature itself in 1853, by a declaratory act, the 16th Vic. ch. 260, wherein it is declared to remove all doubt, that the intention of the legislature, in the afore said act of 1818, was to prohibit the building of any bridge or bridges whatsoever in opposition to Verrault's toll-bridge. To show how similar on this point the charter there in question was to the one now under consideration, I quote it at length.\nSec. 6. No person or persons shall erect or cause to be erected any bridge or bridges or works, or use any ferry for the carriage of any persons, cattle or carriages whatsoever, for hire (pour gages) across the said river Etchemins, within half a league and if any person or persons shall erect a toll-bridge or toll-bridges over the said river Etchemins within the said limits, he or they shall pay to the said Verrault treble the tolls hereby imposed for the persons, cattle and carriages which shall pass over such bridge or bridges; and if any person or persons shall at any time, for hire or gain (pour gages ou gam) pass or convey any person or persons, cattle or carriages across the said river, within the said limits, such offender or offenders shall for each person, animal or carriage so carried across forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding forty shillings. Provided that nothing in this act contained shall be construed to prevent the public from passing any of the fords in the said river or in canoes without gain or hire (sans lucre ou gages). The court had construed that clause as the appellants here would construe section 3 of the respondent s charter, that is to say, as prohibiting only a toll-bridge within the grantee's limits and not a free bridge. That construction the legislature declared to have been erroneous, and contrary to its intentions. Could it not be argued here, if it was at all necessary for respondent's case, that, by this declaration of the legislature of what is the construction to be given to that section of Ver rault's charter, the court must give a similar section re-enacted in a subsequent charter in pari materia, even to another party, that same construction that the legislature has declared must be the true construction of the previous one? In other words, what the legislature meant in 1881, by section 3 of the respondent's charter must be what it meant by the same section enacted in 1818.\nIt is exactly, it seems to me, as if the legislature, in 1881 had contracted with the respondent that he would have, as to this bridge, the same rights that were con ceded to Verrault, in 1818, as to his bridge.\nAn additional argument against the appellant's contention is derived from the very first section of the respondent's charter, whereby the legislature provided for the case, and the only case, where they might, after eight years, have a free bridge in this locality. It reads as follows:\u2014\nAfter the expiration of eight years from the passing of the act, it shall and may be lawful for the municipality of St. George to assume the possession of the said bridge and dependencies and to acquire the ownership thereof, upon paying to the said David Roy the value which the same shall, at the time of such assumption, bear and be worth, with an addition of twenty per centum, and after such assumption, it shall become a free bridge and shall be maintained by the municipality as such free bridge.\nThe appellants would contend, for they are driven to go so far, (and the superior court had supported their contention) that they had the right to build a free bridge in the locality at any time immediately after the erection of the respondent's toll-bridge, or even simultaneously with it. That cannot be, in my opinion. Such a contention, if ii were to prevail, I have already remarked, would clearly render vain and illusory, and nullify the grant made to the respondent. Comp. Anderson v. Jellet ([43]). And apart from the reasons I have hereinbefore attempted to explain, this first section further demonstrates, in my opinion, the unsoundness of the appellant's proposition. It is only after eight years from the passing of the act that this municipality can, there, have a free bridge, and then, not one in opposition or adverse to the respondent's grant, but only upon expropriating his bridge and paying him, not merely the actual value thereof, as in ordinary expropriations, but an addition of 20 per cent over and above such value, the legislature thereby clearly, it seems to me, showing that, in its intention, such an expropriai ion, at the end of eight years, would deprive the respondent of a privilege for the balance of the thirty years against any bridge whatever, the 20 per cent above the value being for that privilege and franchise. Such a clause would not be found in the statute if, as they contend, this municipality, appellant, had, and has had, the right, at any time, to erect a free bridge within one league from the respondent's toll-bridge. It would have been futile, and ironical almost, to grant to the municipality appellant the right of expropriating the respondent's bridge, without any privilege in their favour thereafter on their paying him 20 per cent more than its value if they always had an independent right to build one themselves. And, it must not be lost sight of the erection of a free bridge by the appellants would not relieve the respondent from the duties and obligations cast upon him by the statute. He would be deprived of all the benefit of the franchise whilst he continued liable during the unexpired term of thirty years to all the burdens imposed upon him. He would have to keep his bridge in repair under a penalty of ten dollars a day, and give to the public without distinction the right to pass over it. For though the bridge is his property, yet he could not in law, refuse to any one the right of passage over it, upon payment of the statutory tolls.\nUpon the consideration of the right to an exclusive toll for 30 years he disbursed a large amount to build it, and. to repay to Cahill and Gilbert, as obliged to by his charter, their cost of a temporary bridge they had erected in this same locality. This consideration the appellants would take away from him and leave nothing but the charges and obligations. They have not the right to do so, in my opinion. The rights of a grantee are not to be extended by implication they say. Spoliation is not to be authorized by implication, I would say.\nIn France, as in England and the Unites States, as might well be expected, it is held that the right to a franchise of this nature called droit de bac and de pon tonage must necessarily be exclusive and entitle the grantee ex necessitate rei to restrain all interference with his right.

Voirie par Eau ([48]); Domat, Dr. publ. tit. ([49]); 3 Despeisses ([50]). We See in Lebret's decisions ([51]) that the King Louis XIII. having run great danger in crossing the Seine at Neuilly in a scow decided that a bridge should there be built, and that this bridge be built by private parties, upon the king granting them an exclusive right to tolls during a certain time. By an arr\u00eat of March 4th, 1705 (5 Journ. des audiences 507), it appears that the king himself, Louis XIV., successor to the grantor, paid an annual sum for the passage of the officers of his household.\nAnd in Anc. D\u00e9nizart ([52]), the following case is reported:\nThe Seignior of Coulonge, owner of the franchise of a ferry across the River Sa\u00f4ne, took proceedings against one Bourdance, to prohibit him and his servants from crossing the river in his own scow opposite his residence, twelve hundred feet from the ferry. In the Court of first instance, the Seignior obtained a judgment in his favour. This judgment, however, was reversed in appeal on the 9th January, 1758, but only upon a de claration by Bourdance that he admitted the, plaintiffs right to the franchise, and upon his binding himself not to allow any one else but members of his family and his servant to cross at all in his scow. This is a clear case where; long ago, a free passage to the public was held to be an infringement of the franchise of a ferry.\nIn modern times, this doctrine, in a case under analogous circumstances, of Turquand v. Goagon ([53]), has received the sanction of the Court of Cassation.\nIn another case reported in Sirey ([54]), the grantee of a toil-bridge was held to be entitled to recover damages from the state for a breach of the state's contract, by having allowed the construction of a railway bridge within the limit of the toll-bridge privilege. See also Sirey 59, 2, 461.\nIn 1875 also Sirey ([55]) Re Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Ponts de St. Michel, the state was declared to be responsible in damages for the erection of a free way of crossing within 40 metres of a toll-bridge. A prior case in Sirey ([56]), and another one in Sirey ([57]), seem to have been determined in a contrary sense. However, they merely declare the right generally of the state to build a new bridge, without compensation, near a toll bridge, and have no application here. They are, moreover, overruled by the more recent cases, and, at most, demonstrate, if demonstration was needed, that Sirey, like Dalloz, may well be termed '.\nUn arsenal du droit francais on toutes les erreurs peuvent trouver des' arr\u00eats et tous les paradoxes des autorit\u00e9s ([58]).\nA case of Guerin v. l'Etat ([59]), before the Conseil d'Etat in 1869, is absolutely in point. The plaintiff had obtained from the state, in 1851, the grant of the franchise of a toll-bridge of which he was in possession. The state subsequently built a free bridge on the same river three thousand metres from the plaintiff's toll-bridge. Thereupon, an action of damages against the state was instituted. The action was dismissed, but only upon the ground that the distance between the new bridge and the toll-bridge was such that the plaintiff could not be admitted to contend that his privilege extended so far, and without questioning at all his right to an exclusive privilege, even against a free bridge, within a certain distance below and above his own bridge, though such was not expressly reserved to him in his charter.\nLe requ\u00e9rant (said the Minister of the Interior for the state) se borne \u00e0 soutenir que l'interdiction qui ne se trouve pas \u00e9crite dans son con trat. y est sous entendue c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'en lui conc\u00e9dant le droit de se rembourser au moyen d'un p\u00e9age d'un partie lu capital engag\u00e9 pour la construction du pont de Magn\u00e9, le gouvernement n'a pas Pu se r\u00e9server la facult\u00e9 de lui enlever les. b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu'il croyait pouvoir retirer de ce p\u00e9age. Cette observation est exacte sans doute; le con cessionnaire d'un pont \u00e0 p\u00e9age doit avoir le monopole du passage dans une certaine \u00e9tendue de la rivi\u00e8re; mais \u00e9videmment aussi cette \u00e9tendue a des limites. Le perim\u00e8tre de protection reserv\u00e9 aux entrepreneurs ne peut pas \u00eatre illimit\u00e9.\nAnd on this last ground alone, as I have said the grantee's claim was dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I cannot entertain a doubt that the true construction of the act which has conferred upon the plaintiff his franchise is that so long as the franchise continues in force it is not competent for the appellants to erect or maintain a free bridge within the limits over which the franchise operates without expropriation of the plaintiff's franchise rights by compensating him as the act provides after expiration of eight years.

W. T. The defendants are residents of Winnipeg and carry on a lumber and mill business at Otter Tail, B.C, under the name of The Otter Tail Lumber Co. This company was not incorporated but defendants had entered into articles of partnership among themselves.\nThe manager of the company was one of the partners, W. D. Rorison.[1] The action was brought on an account for goods sold to the company and also upon a note in the following form:\u2014\nSixty days after date we promise to pay Dolan & Barr, or order, four hundred and seven 29-100 dollars, at the Imperial Bank here, value received.\nW. D. RORISON,\nManager Otter Tail L. Co.\nThis note was endorsed by the payees, Dolan & Barr, to the plaintiffs. Rorison was not made a defendant to the action.\nThe defence to the action as to the note was that it was the note of Rorison only and that the words \"Manager Otter Tail L. Co.\" were merely words of description; that to hold the company liable the note should show on its face that it was signed on behalf of the company; and that evidence of intention must be gathered from the contract itself and not otherwise.\nThe majority of the court below held the defendants liable on the note but not on the claim for goods sold. The defendants appealed.\nEwart Q.C. for the appellants. The words \"Manager Otter Tail L. Co.\" are descriptive merely. Thomas v. Bishop ([2]); Lennard v. Robinson ([3]); Leadbitter v.

D. Rorison, carried on business in partnership together as sawmill owners and manufacturers of logs into lumber, at a place called Otter Tail, in the North-west Territories, under the name of the Otter Tail Lumber Company. Of this firm Rorison was the managing partner, residing at Otter Tail where the mills of the partnership were and their business was carried on. The defendants resided at Winnipeg, in Manitoba, where one of them acted as secretary of the partnership firm. Upon the 21st September, 1889, a clerk of Rorison, in Rorison's name, addressed and sent to the secretary at Winnipeg, a letter in which it was communicated to the defendants that the lumber company had become and were then indebted to a firm, named Dolan & Barr, for logs delivered to the company, in the sum of $1,066.90 and that Rorison had given to persons trading under the name and firm of Carlin, Lake & Co., a promissory note for $300 to settle bills of Dolan & Barr to that amount. About the 9th October, 1889, Dolan & Barr were indebted to the plaintiffs for cer- tain goods purchased from the plaintiffs. This fact was communicated to Rorison and he suggested to the plaintiffs as a mode by which they could secure payment of the goods, that if they would get Dolan & Barr's note the lumber company would endorse it as they were indebted to Dolan & Barr, and that the plaintiffs could get the note, so endorsed, discounted by the bank. The defendants, however, instead of getting Dolan & Barr's note, drew a note in blank payable to Dolan & Barr for the purpose of its being signed by the lumber company, and got Dolan & Barr to endorse it and then sent it to Rorison for the company's signature. Rorison having signed the note returned it to the plaintiffs. The note as signed is as follows:\nCALGARY, 9th October, 1889.\n$407.29.\nSixty days after date we promise to pay to Dolan & Barr, or order, four hundred and seven 29\/100 dollars at the Imperial Bank here, value received.\nW. D. EORISON.\nManager Otter Tail Lumber Co.\nAnd the sole question is: Are the defendants who, it is not disputed, are members of the Otter Tail Lumber Company liable upon this note, or, on the contrary, is Rorison the only person liable, and is all after his name to be read only as descriptive of his person? This raises a question of the intent of the parties to the note, which is a matter of evidence, and in the view which I take many of the cases cited have little bearing upon the subject.\nThere can be no doubt that prim\u00e2 facie it was quite competent for Rorison, as managing partner of the lumber company, to bind the company by a promissory note, given by him in the name of the company for goods delivered to the company in the course of the business of which he was the managing partner, nor can there be any doubt that evidence of all the circumstances surrounding the making of an instrument as to the intent with which, and the consideration for which, it was executed is admissible for the purpose of showing who was or were the party or parties bound by it if there be anything on the face of the instrument which creates any ambiguity in the matter. Lindus v. Melrose ([17]), and Young v. Schuler ([18]), are sufficient authorities on this point.\nNow the evidence is express and unequivocal that the intent of all the parties to the note, and of the plaintiffs who were to receive it when made for full value given to their payees, was that the lumber company who had received the consideration for which the note was given were to be the parties to be bound by it. Then the words ''we promise\" &c. upon the face of the note indicate that more persons than one were contemplated to be makers of the note.\nIt was argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that the use of these words \" we promise,\" &c, made no difference for that if, as he contended, a note so framed had been signed by one person only as maker, as he contended the note in question was, that person would be alone bound,, and so if the note had been framed \"I promise,\" &c, and had been signed by several that all would be bound, and he argued that the note should be read as if it were written and signed as follows:\nWe the manager of the Otter Tail Lumber Company promise, &c,\nW. D. ROKISON.\nin which case, he asked, could there be a doubt that Rorison alone would be liable? But without inquiring what should be the construction of a note so framed it is a sufficient answer to such' an argument to say that it would be more consistent with the un- doubted intent of the parties to the note, and with the consideration for which it was given, and with the use of the words \"we promise,\" etc., and more natural and more reasonable to read the note as if written and signed as follows:\u2014\nWe, The Otter Tail Lumber Company, promise, &c, &c.\nW. D. RORISON,\nManager.\nin which case there could be no doubt that the lumber company would be the persons represented on the note as the makers, and this is the way in which, in my opinion, the note can and should be read, and so construing it the appeal should be dismissed with costs. It is unnecessary to refer to the contention of the defendants that by a clause in the articles of partnership Rorison was restricted from signing notes in the name of the company, or to put a construction upon that clause, for it is not suggested that Dolan & Barr or the plaintiffs had any notice whatever of their being any such clause in the articles of partnership.\nPatterson J:\u2014This is an action brought by the respondents as endorsees of a promissory note, charging the appellants as makers of the note. There was also a claim for goods sold and delivered upon which the respondents recovered. The appeal relates only to the promissory note.\nThe appellants all reside at Winnipeg. In April, 1889, they formed a partnership between themselves and one W. D. Rorison for carrying on a lumber business at Otter Tail, in the North-west Territories, where the appellants had timber limits and machinery. A written agreement was entered into by which, amongst other things, it was provided that Rorison was to devote his whole time to the business at Otter Tail, and bv which it was also stipulated that he should not incur any liability, debt or obligation in the name of the co-partnership or that should bind the members thereof either jointly or severally. The business was to be conducted in the name of the Otter Tail Lumber Company.\nRorison accordingly conducted the business at Otter Tail, and occasional debts were incurred.\nMoney became due to persons named Dolan & Barr for saw-logs. Their account as kept by the lumber company, which is in evidence, runs from the 15th of June to the 30th of September, 1889, with items on both sides of the account, those on the credit side being, all except one, for logs. There is in evidence a letter written by the defendant Bathgate, who acted as secretary of the company at Winnipeg, to Rorison at Otter Tail, in which the writer says:\nWe have a telegram this morning from Dolan & Barr re money due them. As you will learn by my last the Company here have no knowledge of the exact amount due them until they get your statement and see the contract.\nThat letter is dated the 7th of October, 1889. Two days later Rorison made the promissory note in question which is in these words:\nCalgary, 9th October, 1889.\nSixty days after date we promise to pay to Dolan & Barr or order Four Hundred and Seven 29\/100, Dollars at the Imperial Bank here. Value received.\nW. D. RORISON,\nManager Otter Tail L. Co.\nDolan & Barr at once endorsed the note to the plaintiffs. Indeed, as we learn from the evidence of the plaintiff Ferguson, the note was made for the purpose of its being used in that way. The plaintiffs wanted money from Dolan & Barr who had to get it from the lumber company. \"We have seen that they were telegraphing for it and, as Ferguson says, it was slow in coming. Rorison suggested to Ferguson that he should get a note from Dolan & Barr and the company would endorse it. That suggestion was acted on but the note was made to Dolan & Barr and indorsed by them, which put the transaction in a more appropriate shape.\nThe question is whether the defendants are properly held liable on the note.\nThere is no suggestion that Dolan & Barr or the plaintiffs knew of any restrictions on Rorison's authority, as between himself and. his partners, to do any act in the conduct of the business which a partner may ordinarily do.\nI say this without intending to imply that by giving the note Rorison violated his agreement not to incur any liability, debt or obligation in the name of the co-partnership. There is no reason to suppose that he was in any way to blame for the incurring of the debt to Dolan & Barr. He merely gave a note at sixty days for an overdue debt, and I form no opinion on the question between him and his partners.\nAt the trial the appellants were held liable on the note and the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories affirmed that decision, one of the learned judges dissenting and holding that Rorison alone was liable.\nThe appellants urge that, by reason of the form in which the note is made, Rorison is individually liable upon it, and that neither the plural pronoun \"we\" nor his designation \"Manager Otter Tail L. Co.\" would avail to save him. They support their contention by decisions of weight which convinced the dissenting judge in the court below, while the majority of the court, relying on other cases as precedents, and on the principle which they deduced from all the cases, held a different opinion.\nI do not propose to devote much discussion to questions which might arise if Rorison alone were sued as maker of the note. We have to do with the liability of his partners and only indirectly with his individual liability. If it were conceded, for the purpose of the argument, that Rorison could properly be held individually liable as sole maker of the note, which I am not prepared to admit except for the purpose of the argument, it would not follow that his partners are not also liable.\nThere can be no doubt that, as a matter of fact, Rorison made the note, and was understood by the plaintiffs as well as by Dolan & Barr to make it, on behalf of his company.\nUnder the well settled doctrines that apply to contracts in general the principal may be liable upon a contract made by the agent in his own name and on which the agent is himself also liable.\nThe rule applies not only to the case of principals whose name or whose existence is undisclosed at the time of the making of the contract, though it was once supposed to be confined to cases of that class, but it equally applies when the principal is known. That was decided in Calder v. Dobell ([19]), by the Court of Common Pleas, whose judgment was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber in 1871.\nIt had been decided thirty years earlier that, contrary to an idea that had previously prevailed, the rule applied to written contracts and not to oral contracts only, so that a dormant partner whose name did not appear in the firm was held liable on a written contract made in the names of and signed by the ostensible partners. Beckham v. Drake ([20]), in which that question was settled by the Court of Exchequer, is a singular case in one respect, viz., that the court differed, as to the liability of the dormant partner, from a decision of the Court of Common Pleas pronounced three years earlier upon the same contract and between the same parties, in Beckham v. Knight and Drake ([21]). The rule was, however, supposed not to apply to negotiable instruments. Parke B. said in Beckham v. Drake ([22]):\nThe case of bills of exchange is an exception which stands upon the law merchant; and promissory notes another, for they are placed on the same footing by the statute of Anne. In neither of these can any but the parties named in the instrument, by their name or firm, be made liable in an action upon it.\nAnd Lord Abinger C.B. used language which, though in terms directed to bills of exchange only, would seem to apply to promissory notes which are made negotiable by the statute of Anne. Referring to the Common Pleas decision as being placed on grounds contrary to the doctrines he had been just enunciating, he said ([23]):\nThe only cases cited by the judges who follow the Lord Chief Justice are cases of bills of exchange which are quite different in principle from those which ought to govern this case, and in which, by the law merchant, a chose in action is passed by indorsement, and each party who receives the bill is making a contract with the parties upon the face of it and with no other party whatever.\nThe reason thus given for the exception of bills of exchange from the general rule does not seem to be accepted in more modern cases.\nIn Alexander v. Sizer ([24]) Kelly C.B. points out the distinction between bills of exchange and promissory notes in the particular in discussion. Speaking of bills he says:\nThe acceptor, though he may purport to accept in some manner limiting his personal liability, becomes liable if he does accept. He cannot vary or limit his liability on the contract; and by his acceptance of the bill, which is addressed to him, is becomes his contract, and words of mere description or qualification are not enough, according to the usage merchants, to exonerate him. If express words of exclusion were to be used the result might be different, but then the acceptance would in fact, be no acceptance at all. Bills of exchange are all drawn on the intended acceptor in a personal character, and if he accept them he must be held to have done so in that character, and will be held liable no matter what words of mere description may be added to his name.\nIn reference to promissory notes a well known commentator says ([25]):\nThese instruments are, by the statutes 3 & 4 Anne c 9, and 7 Anne c. 25, made capable (if payable to order or bearer) of assignment, and placed in all respects upon the same footing with inland bills of exchange, so that every point of law which applies to the one may be taken generally as applicable to the other, with only this difference, that as a note is originally made between but two parties, viz., the maker and payee, and there is no third party or drawee, as in the case of a bill, so all those legal incidents of a bill which regard the position of the drawer and the nature and effect of an acceptance are, of course, foreign to a note.\nIn Pollock on Contracts ([26]) the author, discussing the technical rule as to a deed executed by an agent in his own name, which ordinarily binds the agent only, remarks that\nA similar rule has been supposed to exist as to negotiable instruments; but modern decisions seem to show that when an agent is in a position to accept a bill so as to bind his principal, the principal is liable though the agent signs, not in the principal's name, but in his own, or, it would appear, in any other name. It is the same as if the principal had signed a wrong name with his own hand.\nIn Lindus v. Bradwell ([27]) a bill had been drawn on William Bradwell, and it was accepted by his wife in her own name, \"Mary Bradwell.\" The husband was held liable on the bill on proof of the authority of his wife to act as his agent.\nIn Edmunds v. Bushell and Jones ([28]) the question was the liability of Jones on a bill drawn on \"Bushell & Co.\" and accepted by Bushell in the name of \"Bushell & Co.\" Cockburn C.J. said: The defendant (meaning Jones0 carried on business both at Luten and in London. In London the business was carried on in the name of Bushell & Co., Jones at the same time employing Bushell as manager. Bushell was, therefore, the agent of the defendant Jones, and Jones was the principal, but he held out Bushell as the principal and owner of the business. That being so, the case falls within the well established principle that if a person employs another as an agent in a character which involves a particular authority, he cannot, by a secret reservation, divest him of that authority. It is clear, therefore, that Bushell must be taken to have had authority to do whatever was necessary and incidental to carrying on the business; and to draw and accept bills of exchange is incidental to it, and Bushell cannot be divested of the apparent authority as against third persons by a secret reservation. I think Jones was properly held liable on the bill.\nIn Penkivil v. Connell ([29]), decided in 1850, there was a promissory note in these words:\nTHE ROYAL BANK, LONDON. L200.\n19th February, 1845.\nWe, the directors of the Royal Bank of Australia, for ourselves and the other shareholders of this Company, jointly and severally promise to pay G. H. Wray or bearer, on the 19th of, February, 1850, at the Union Bank of London, the sum of, \u00a3200 for value received, on account of the Company.\nT.W.Sutherland,\nJohnConnell,\nM. Boyd,\nA. Duff.\nDirectors.\nConnell was sued alone upon the note, and he moved to stay proceedings until the plaintiff should have made proof of his debt before the master appointed to wind up the affairs of the Royal Bank of Australia which was an unincorporated company. His motion was refused on the ground, as I understand the decision, that the note was not the note of the company. Pollock C.B. said:\nThe defendant is sued individually in respect of a joint and several promissory note of which he is the maker.* * *It would be a fraud upon some one if such a note were allowed to be proved against the funds of the company. The note, as sued upon, has no connection whatever with the company. Maclae v. Sutherland ([30]) in 1854. was an action on precisely similar notes against six shareholders of the company, one of whom was a director who had signed the notes, another was a director when, by his authority, the notes were issued, but the other four were only shareholders. The defendants were held liable. Lord Campbell C.J. said:\nThe decision of the Court of Exchequer in Penkivil v. Connell ([31]) we entirely concur in. Each director who signs the notes is liable to be sued separately upon them; but this does not in any degree affect the joint liability of the shareholders.\nThe cases which chiefly influenced the dissenting judge in the court below were the English case of Dutton v. Marsh ([32]) and the Ontario case of Hagarty v. Squier ([33]). The latter was a very plain case. Squier as inspector of a fire insurance company had adjusted the amount of a loss with Hagarty, and he drew upon his company at thirty days, in favour of Hagarty, for the amount agreed upon, stating in the draft that it was the amount of the claim under the policy. He signed the draft \"A. Squier, Inspector.\" On the face of that transaction the company could have been party to the bill only as acceptors. Squier personally was the drawer.\nDutton v. Marsh ([34]) was a case on a promissory note very like the notes in the Royal Bank of Australia cases of Pinkivil v. Connell ([35]) and Maclae v. Sutherland ([36]), except that the makers of the note were directors of an incorporated company The note was as follows :\u2014\nIsle of Man, 7th January, 1864.\nWe, the directors of the Isle of Man Slate and Flag Company, Limited, do promise to pay John Dutton, Esq., the sum of, \u00a31,600 sterling, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum until paid, for value received. It was signed by the four defendants, the word chairman being written after the name of Richard J.Marsh, and at the left hand side of the paper it had the seal of the company with the words \"witnessed by Leslie Lochart.\"\nThe decision was that the defendants were personally liable on the note, just as in the Royal Bank of Australia cases the directors who signed the notes were personally liable, and it might perhaps be an authority for holding Rorison personally liable in this case, though I am not prepared to say that in that respect the cases are on all fours; but as to the actual question, viz., whether the partners of Rorison are not liable; as were the shareholders in the Royal Bank of Australia, nothing is decided by Dutton v. Marsh ([37]).\nThe case of Alexander v. Sizer ([38]), on which the judgment of the majority in the court below was to a great extent founded, is much more to the purpose as a precedent, the decision being that the person who signed the note was not liable upon it.\nThe note was in this form:\n\u00a31, 500.\nOn demand I promise to pay Messrs. Alexander & Co., or order, the sum of L1,500 with legal interest thereon until paid value received the 16th of August, 1865.\nFor Mistley, Thorpe and Walton Railway Company.\nSecretary.\nWitness,\u2014Charles Taylor.\nLindus v. Melrose ([39]), is also a strong authority for the view acted on by the court below. If that case is well decided the present one I should say is so a fortiori. The note there was:\nThree months after date we jointly promise to pay Mr. Frederick Shaw, or order $600 for value received in stock on account of the London and Birmingham Iron and Hardware Company, Limited. It was signed James Melrose, Gr. N. Wood, John Harris, directors, and had at the left hand side and under the body of the note the words:\nPayable at the London Joint Stock Bank Company, Princes St. Mansion House.\nEDWIN GUESS,\nSecretary.\nThen there were the words \"we jointly promise,\" with three signatures of gentlemen with the one word \"directors\" added. Yet those gentlemen were held not to have bound themselves personally, the other things contained in the paper being taken to show that they acted only for their company.\nWe may note that in Lindus v. Melrose ([40]) the word \"directors\" was not treated as merely descriptive, nor was the word \"secretary\" in Alexander v. Sizer ([41]), the court holding that the use of those words showed that the parties signed as directors and as secretary.\nHere we couple the words \"we promise,\" which are not appropriate to a promise by one man, with the designation \" manager of Otter Tail L. Co.,\" and we go no further than the authorities warrant when we read the promise, according to what it was in fact intended to be, as the' promise of the company, and the signatures as being written as manager.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Davis, Costigan & Bangs.\nSolicitors for respondents: Lougheed, McCarthy & Mc Caul.\n[1] 1 N.

G. P.\nThe will of the late J. McG. contained the following provisions:\u2014\nFifthly, I give, devise and bequeath unto Helen Mahers, of the said parish of Montreal, my present wife the usufruct, use and enjoyment during all her natural lifetime, of the rest and residue of my property movable or immovable in which I may have any right interest or share at the time of my death, without any exception or reserve. To have and to hold, use and enjoy the said usufruct, use and enjoyment of the said property unto my said wife the said Helen Mahers as and for her own property from and after my decease and during all her natural lifetime Sixthly, I give, devise and bequeath in full property unto my son James McGregor, issue of my marriage with the said Helen Mahers, the whole of the property of whatever nature or kind movable real or personal of which the usufruct, use and enjoyment during her natural lifetime is hereinbefore left to my said wife the said Helen Mahers but subject to the said usufruct, use and enjoyment of his mother the said Helen Mahers during all her natural lifetime as aforesaid and without any account to be rendered of the same or of any part thereof to any person or persons whomsoever; should, however, my said son, the said James McGregor, die before his said mother, my said wife, the said Helen Mahers then and in that case I give, devise and bequeath the said property so hereby bequeathed to him, to the said Helen Mahers, in full property to be disposed of by last will and testament or otherwise as she may think fit and without any account to be rendered of the same or of any part thereof to any person or persons whomsoever:\nTo have and to hold the said hereby bequeathed and given property to the said James McGregor, his heirs and assigns, should he survive his said mother, as and for his and their own property for ever, and in the event of his pre-deceasing his said mother, unto the said Helen Mahers, her heirs and assigns as and for her and their own property for ever.\nHeld afirman the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that the will of J. McG. did not create a substitution but a simple bequest of usufruct to his wife and of ownership to his son.\nHeld also, that a sheriff's sale (d\u00e9cret) of property forming part of J. McG.'s estate under an execution issued against a person who was in possession under a title from the wife, such sale having taken place after J. McG.'s son became of age, was valid and purged all real rights which the son might have had under the will. Art. 711 C. C. P. Patton v. Morin, (16 L. C. R. 267.)\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing a judgment of the Superior Court ([2]), which declared the appellant proprietor of the undivided half of a portion of lot No. 560, on the official plan of the parish of Montreal, and condemning the respondents to abandon to the appellant the undivided half of the said property, and to render an account of the fruit and revenues since the 7th October, 1886, and in default to pay the sum of $2,000.\nThe main questions upon this appeal were as to the interpretation of the will of the late James McGregor father of the appellant, the validity of an order for the sale of the property granted on the advice of a family council on the 19th September, 1886, upon the petition of the appellant's mother as tutrix to her minor children, and also the effect of a sheriffs sale of the same property to respondent's auteurs.\nThe material clauses of the will appear in the head note, and the facts and pleadings are fully reviewed in the judgments of the court hereinafter given. (See also reports of the base in the courts below (M.L.R. 6, S.0.196; Q.R. 1 Q.B. 197.)\nHonan and Lafleur for the appellant:\nWhen analysed it will be found that the will contains in reality three distinct provisions: (1) a bequest of the usufruct to the testator's wife; (2) a bequest of the ownership to the son, at first in general terms but subsequently, subject to the limitation and condition that he shall survive his mother; (3) a vulgar substitution in favour of the mother if she should survive the son\nIt is important to observe that the bequest of the ownership of the property to the son, though at first expressed in general terms, is afterwards restricted to the case of his surviving his mother. The will at first says: \" I give, devise and bequeath in full property unto my son James McGregor, issue of my marriage with said Helen Mahers, the whole of the property of whatever nature or kind movable or immovable real or personal of which the usufruct, use and enjoyment during her natural lifetime is hereinbefore left to my said wife; \" and this clause might, if alone, appear to vest the ownership of the topiary in the son immediately upon the testator's death; but a little further down the generality of the bequest is restricted by the following words: \" To have and to hold the said hereby bequeathed and given property to the said James McGregor, his heirs and assigns should he survive his said mother as and for his and their own property fore er.\" The general rule of interpretation to be followed in this case is that when a will or charter contains a bequest or conveyance in general terms and subsequently in more limited terms, there being no repugnancy between the general and the more limited words of grant or bequest, the specific limitation will prevail over the general expression. This rule of construction is expressed in the old maxim: \" Quando carla, Continet generalem clausulam, posteaque descendit ad verba specialia, qu\u0153 clausul\u0153 generali sunt consentanea, interpretanda, est carta secundum verba specialia ([3]).\"\nAccordingly, the highest title which James Mc Gregor, jr., could claim under his father's will, was the ownership of the property should he survive his mother, or, in other words, the bequest by James McGregor, sr., to his son, was made under a suspensive condition and until his mother's death the son had merely the hope or expectation of becoming proprietor. Consequently, under this restriction James McGregor, jr., did not acquire upon his father's death any rights which he could transmit to his heirs. He was not yet at that date the owner of the property and as the owner ship of the property could not remain in suspense pending; his mother's usufruct, it follows that during the pendency of the condition the ownership must have vested in the mother.\nWe have therefore, the following condition of things: first a bequest of usufruct to the mother; secondly a conditional bequest of the ownership to the son if he should survive his mother, the ownership only vesting in him upon such contingency; and thirdly, a bequest of the ownership to the mother if she should survive the son.\nNow the combined result of these provisions is exactly what would, by law, take place if the testator had simply used the words, \" 'I bequeath the property to my wife and on her death to my son James.\" For a fiduciary substitution, such as the one contained in the last mentioned words would in fact give the usufruct to the wife during her life, and would vest the Dro\u00fcerty in the son from the time of her death and (fiduciary substitutions include vulgar substitutions without any expressions to that effect being necessary art. 926 C. C.) would vest the ownership in the mother, the institute if she should survive her son (the substitute.) By article 928 C. C. a substitution may exist although the term usufruct may have been employed to express the right of the institute, and the whole tenor of the act and the intention which it sufficiently expressed are considered rather than the ordinary acceptation of particular words in-order to determine whether there is a substitution or not. The appellant submits that as the various operative words of bequest contained in the above mentioned clauses of this will have in combination no other result than would be produced by the creation of an ordinary fiduciary substitution, the court must, in interpreting the will, come to the conclusion that the testator intended to create a substitution and did create one by these somewhat clumsy and inartistic expressions. To isolate any of these expressions and derive from them separately an intention of creating a usufruct rather than a substitution. would, it seems to us, be simply violating the spirit of the whole bequest. See Joseph v. Castonguay ([4]); Th\u00e9venot-Dessaules, Substitution ([5]); Roy v. Gauvin ([6]); McDonnell v. Ross ([7]); Plamondon v. de Chantel ([8]); Goutu v. Dorion ([9]); Phillips v. Bain ([10]).\nBut even if the will in question were held not to contain a substitution, the sheriff's sale would still be null and void as having been made super non domino et non possedente. This was well established by the testimony of Thomas Craig, and if our view of the facts is concurred in, the sheriff's sale has not discharged the property from the appellant's right of ownership. Art. 708 C.C. The sale was therefore super non domino, and the appellant, even if no substitution existed, could attack the sheriff's sale on this ground and afterward's attack the previous chain of title on the ground of fraud and illegailty.\nWe also submit that according to the well established jurisprudence the lawful owner could assert his right of ownership in a direct action en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret, even if he had not filed an opposition to the sale. The advertisements of the seizure and sale on Craig, who was neither the owner nor in possession could not convey any information or warning to the appellant that his rights were in danger. He had at that time sued the ostensible owner and possessor, Devlin, to recover his property, and this action was still pending. See Dufresne v. Dixon ([11]).\nThe learned counsel also contended that the sale made by the wife as tutrix to her son, under judicial authorization of the property in question to one Devlin, was null as not having been made in accordance with all the formalities required by law and that\njudicial authorization was fraudulently obtained, and referred to and cited art. 1278 C.C.P.; arts. 652, 656, 269 C. C.; McTavish v. Pyke ([12]); Rattray v. Larue ([13]) and Demolombe ([14]).\nR. Laflamme, Q.C., and H. Abbott, Q.C. for respon dents.\nThe main question is whether the will created a substitution. We adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9.in the court below, and we contend that the will of the late James McGregor divested of technical phraseology bequeaths in effect:\u2014firstly, a usufruct of the property to the wife; secondly, the ownership to the son; and thirdly a substitution from the son in favour of the mother in case she should survive him or perhaps a conditional legacy of the property to the wife in case she should survive him. The third case was never in fact realized as the wife died before the son; so that whether there was a substitution in favour of the wife, or a conditional legacy, is immaterial, and the two first effects are the only ones to be considered, namely, that there was a legacy of usufruct to the wife with a legacy of the property to the son. Merlin Vo Condition ([15]). Rolland de Villargues, Substitutions prohib\u00e9es ([16]). Now, if we assume that the will contained a usufruct in favour of the wife with ownership to the son, the effect of the sheriff's deed of sale which took place after the appellant came of age when he could have demanded the nullity of the seizure and of the anterior titles, under an execution against and upon the person who was in the legal possession of the property constituted a valid title to the respondent. Art. 711 C. C.\nThe learned counsel also contended that the different formalities required by law for the successive sales which had been made of the immovables in question since the testator's death, were complied with and referred to Davis v. Kerr ([17]).\nLafleur in reply relied on the findings of fact of the trial judge.\nSTRONG J.\u2014concurred with Fournier J.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le present appel est interjet\u00e9 d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec, infirmant un jugement de .a Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, rendu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al par l'honorable juge Pagnuelo, en date du 30 mai 1890, d\u00e9clarant l'appelant propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 indivise d'une partie du lot n 260 du plan officiel de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al et condamnant l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 faire abandon \u00e0 l'appelant de la moiti\u00e9 indivise de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 compter du 7 octobre 1886 ou \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de ce faire, \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $2,000.\nLe juge a de plus ordonn\u00e9 une expertise pour faire l'\u00e9valuation des am\u00e9liorations faites sur la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse et Helen Mahers ordonnant aussi de faire rapport si la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9e, etc., etc.\nDans sa d\u00e9claration l'appelant r\u00e9clame cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du testament de son pr\u00e9 en date du 28 janvier 1863.\nL'intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 par d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait, et all\u00e8gue qu'une partie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e formant le no 15 du plan de Perreault et maintenant formant partie du lot 560, n'a jamais appartenu \u00e0 James McGregor, p\u00e8re. Par son deuxi\u00e8me plaidoyer l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que l'appelant est devenu majeur d'\u00e2ge le 16 juin 1882, et en \u00e9tat de prot\u00e9ger tons ses droits et r\u00e9clamations sur la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue par le sh\u00e9rif le 18 novembre 1884 sur Thomas Craig alors en possession ouverte et publique de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9; que l'intim\u00e9e l'a de bonne foi achet\u00e9e \u00e0 cette vente, qui avait eu l'effet d'\u00e9teindre et de purger tous les droits que l'appelant pouvait avoir sur la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nDans son troisi\u00e8me plaidoyer l'intim\u00e9e donne la longue \u00e9num\u00e9ration de ses titres et de ceux de ses auteurs. Elle all\u00e8gue que sur les lots 16 et 17 du plan Perrault, acquis par James McGregor, il n'y avait presque aucune am\u00e9lioration; et que l'inventaire de sa communaut\u00e9 avec la m\u00e8re de l'appelant a fait voir que le passif exc\u00e9dait l'actif; qu'en cons\u00e9quence Helen Mahers, sa m\u00e8re, se fit autoriser en justice \u00e0 vendre les dits lots et les vendit apr\u00e8s l'accomplissement de toutes les formalit\u00e9s voulues. Tous les titres subs\u00e9quents sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail. Ensuite, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Mde McGregor apr\u00e8s avoir acquis les lots 16 et 17 construisit avec de l'argent emprunt\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de magasins et de maisons sur tout le lot 560 comprenant les lots originairement connus sous les nos 15, 16 et 17, et d'autres constructions, au montant de $20,000 et que la valeur des lots 16 et 17 en fut consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s ces diverses constructions, Mde McGregor vendit les dites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 O. J. Devlin pour $20,000 dont $5,800 payable \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et la balance payable aux divers pr\u00eateurs qui avaient avanc\u00e9 les fonds pour la construction des dites b\u00e2tisses. Ensuite le pr\u00eat par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Thomas T. Craig de la somme de $15,000 avec hypoth\u00e8que sur la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 y est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ainsi que la vente de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\nL'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue en outre la prescription de dix ans et la possession par elle-m\u00eame et ses auteurs pendant le temps n\u00e9cessaire et dans les conditions pour acqu\u00e9rir la prescription; elle plaide aussi qu'elle ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 moins d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e de ses am\u00e9liorations.\nL'appelant a r\u00e9pondu sp\u00e9cialement, r\u00e9it\u00e9rant l'all\u00e9gation que feu James McGregor \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire du lot 560 avant sa mort et que l'appelant en \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 indivise comme appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le testament de son p\u00e8re.\nC'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il est fait mention que le testament de son p\u00e8re contient une substitution, qu'il invoque par exception et non par action. Il all\u00e8gue que le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9, qu'il contenait une substitution dont sa m\u00e8re \u00e9tait grev\u00e9e en sa faveur comme appel\u00e9 que cette substitution n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte que le 7 octobre 1886 par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re; et que la vente par le sh\u00e9rif n\u2019avait pas en l'effet de purger la dite substitution.\nDans le mois de mars 1882 l'appelant institua une action contre 0. J. Devlin sa m\u00e8re James Thomas Craig, et les repr\u00e9sentants de feu William Quinn, auteurs de Thomas Craig, all\u00e9guant qu'il ignorait alors la vente de Devlin \u00e0 Craig, et demandant par cette action que tous les actes et proc\u00e9d\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par i\u2019 intim\u00e9e dans son plaidoyer fussent annul\u00e9s. Cette action \u00e9tait pendante au temps de la saisie et de la vente faite par le sh\u00e9rif dont l'appelant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ignorant.\nL'appelant a aussi all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'inventaire \u00e9tait faux et frauduleux. Il attaque aussi l'\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s faite par l'expert nomm\u00e9 par le juge, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'autorisation -de la vente. Il a aussi mis en cause parson plaidoyer tous les auteurs de l'intim\u00e9e ainsi que les h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants de Mde McGregor.\nL'intim\u00e9e a. longuement r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette r\u00e9ponse sp\u00e9ciale de l'appelant en niant sp\u00e9cialement toutes ses all\u00e9gations. Par une des all\u00e9gations de sa r\u00e9plique, l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que l'appelant est un des h\u00e9ritiers d'Helen Mahers, sa m\u00e8re, qu'il n'a jamais renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa succession et que si elle a fait aucun acte ill\u00e9gal au sujet des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question, l'appelant, comme son h\u00e9ritier en est responsable et ne peut aucunement les attaquer. Comme r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette partie de la r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e, l'appelant a produit, le 20 mai 1889, une renonciation \u00e0 la succession dc sa m\u00e8re trois mois apr\u00e8s l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action et pr\u00e8s de trois ans apr\u00e8s la mort de sa m\u00e8re.\nL'appelant a aussi all\u00e9gu\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 de la vente comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite super non domino et non posse denle. La r\u00e9ponee \u00e0 ce dernier moyen est que lors d\u00ba la vente par le sh\u00e9rif, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que Devlin avait fait opposition \u00e0 la vente sur le principe que Craig n'\u00e9tait pas en possession comme propri\u00e9taire lors de la saisie et l'opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. Il ne peut plus \u00eatre question maintenant de cette pr\u00e9tention.\nPar cette longue plaidoirie les parties out soulev\u00e9 les questions suivantes: 1 Savoir, si par le testament de James McGregor, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait une substitution en faveur de James McGregor, son fils. 2\u00b0 Si l'ordre rendu par le juge ordonnant la vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question, accord\u00e9 le 19 septembre 1886, apr\u00e8s avis dun conseil de famille, est legal. 3\u00b0 L'effet de la vente par le sh\u00e9rif de cette m\u00e9me propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du titre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de ses auteurs\nLe testament de James McGregor contient-il une substitution en faveur de son fils ?\nPar l'article 5 de son testament feu James McGregor, l\u00e8gue \u00e0 Helen Mahers, son \u00e9pouse, l'usufruit et jouissance, sa vie durant du r\u00e9sidu de ses biens meubles et immeubles, \u00e0 quelque somme qu'il puisse se monter, et sans aucune r\u00e9serve. Par l'article 6 du dit testament, il donne \u00e0 son fils James McGregor, issu de son mariage avec la dite Helen Mahers, tous ces biens de quelque nature quills soient, tant meubles qu'immeubles dont l'usufruit est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite \u00e9pouse mais sujet au dit usufruit et jouissance de sa m\u00e8re, Helen Mahers, sa vie durant, et sans que celle-ci soit oblig\u00e9e de rendre compte des dits biens on de partie diiceux \u00e0 qui que cc soit. Dans le cas cependant o\u00f9 le dit James McGregor d\u00e9c\u00e9derait avant la dite Helen Mahers, alors et dans ce cas, il donne et l\u00e8gue les dites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la dite Helen Mahers en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9, pour en disposer comme bon lui semblera et sans \u00eatre tenue d'en rendre aucun compte \u00e0 qui que ce soit.\nPar le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cc testament contenait une substitution dans laquelle la mere \u00e9tait l'institu\u00e9e et son fils, l'appelant, suhstitu\u00e9 et que la vente du sh\u00e9rif faite le 18 novembre 1884 ayant eu lieu avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la m\u00e8re, la substitution n'\u00e9tait pas ouverte, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence les droits de l'appelant comme substitu\u00e9 n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 purges par le d\u00e9cret.\nLa Cour du Banc de la Reine a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 au contraire qu'il n'y avait pas de substitution, mais un simple legs d'usufruit en faveur d'Helen Mahers, et un autre legs de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de l'appelant. C'est \u00e9videmment conforme aux termes m\u00eames du testament qui ne contient aucune expression faisant voir que l'intention du testateur \u00e9tait de faire une substitution. Au contraire on y trouve un legs d'usufruit pur et simple pour la vie durant d'Helen Mahers, avec, an lieu de la charge de rendre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, la dispense de rendre, aucun compte de tout ou partie des dites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 qui que ce soit. Cette disposition est tout \u00e0 fait contraire. \u00e0 l'essence de la substitution et \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition qu'en donne le Code civil art. 925: \" La substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire est celle o\u00f9 celui qui re\u00e7oit est charg\u00e9 de rendre la chose soit \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, soit \u00e0 un autre terme,\" selon Th\u00e9venot d'Essaules ([18]).\nLa substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire doit \u00eatre d\u00e9finie une disposition de l'homme par laquelle en gratifiant quelqu'un express\u00e9ment ou tacitement on le charge de rendre la chose a lui donn\u00e9e ou une autre chose \u00e0 un tiers qu'on gratifie en second ordre.\nLa substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire est la disposition que je fais au profit de quelqu'un par le canal dune personne interpos\u00e9e que j\u2019ai charg\u00e9e de lui remettre. Pothier, Substitution ([19]).\nComme on le voit par l'art, du Code et par les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es la charge de rendre est le principal caract\u00e8re de la substitution. Ici la charge de rendre des biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s en usufruit n'est nullement impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'usufruiti\u00e8re qui au contraire est dispens\u00e9e m\u00eame de conserver les biens sujets \u00e0 l'usufruit. On a vu qu'elle est aussi dispens\u00e9e de rendre aucun compte \u00e0 qui que ce soit, du tout ou de partie, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un legs de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C\nIl y a ensuite un legs de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils, James McGregor, de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s quelconques dont l'usufruit a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re, sa vie durant; F suivi d'un autre legs conditionne], par lequel ii l\u00e8gue \u00e0 Helen Mahers, dans le cas le son fils mourrait avant elle, tous les biens qu'il lui avait l\u00e9gu\u00e9s en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce legs ne peut non plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une substitution en faveur de la m\u00e8re, parce que la charge de rendre n'est pas impos\u00e9e au fils. Dans cette m\u00eame disposition de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur du fils, le testateur r\u00e9affirme la d\u00e9claration que c'est un legs d'u sufruit qu'il a fait \u00e0 sa femme. Il le change en un legs conditionnel dans le cas o\u00f9 ce fils pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9derait. Toutefois il ne peut s'\u00e9lever aucune question au sujet de ce dernier legs puisque la m\u00e8re est morte avant son fils.\nIl est clair que la pr\u00e9tention qu'il y a eu substitution n'est pas fond\u00e9e, en cons\u00e9quence la vente par le sh\u00e9rif de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'appelant \u00e9tait majeur, et sans aucune opposition de sa part a eu l'effet de purger la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de tous droits r\u00e9els et de donner un titre complet et absolu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e S'il avait exist\u00e9 une substitution non ouverte comme on l'a pr\u00e9tendu lors de la vente par le sh\u00e9rif d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 710 C. 1?. C. cette substitution n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e, mais cet article n'a aucune application dans le cas actuel, puisqu'il n'y avait pas de substitution.\nJe ne consid\u00e8re pas qu'il soit utile d'entrer dans la discussion des nombreuses questions soulev\u00e9es au sujet de la vente par autorit\u00e9 du juge \u00e0 la requ\u00eate do Mde McGregor, non plus que de celles soulev\u00e9es au sujet de l'inventaire car toutes ces proc\u00e9dures attaqu\u00e9es out \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faites. Mais ind\u00e9pendamment de cela, la vente qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faite depuis par le sh\u00e9rif, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a mis fin \u00e0 toutes ces questions. Cette vente n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite comme l'a pr\u00e9tendue l'appelant super non domino et non possedente. Au contraire, Craig, sur qui elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en \u00e9tait alors en possession publique et paisible comme propri\u00e9taire en vertu de titres authentiques, enregistr\u00e9s et r\u00e9guliers, apr\u00e8s m\u00eame une contestation par opposition faite par Devlin aux droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Craig.\nD'apr\u00e8s la loi et les d\u00e9cisions dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec la-vente judiciaire accompagn\u00e9e des formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales donne un titre complet et absolu \u00e0 l'adjudicataire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue et purge tous les droits dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre grev\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'exception de l'hy poth\u00e8qu\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de la commutation des rentes seigneuriales, de l'emphyt\u00e9ose, des substitutions non ou vertes et du douaire coutumier non ouvert. Par l'art. 711 C. P. C. le d\u00e9cret purgre tous autres droits.\nComme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit plus haut le testament de McGregor ne contenant pas de substitution, la vente judiciaire a eu son plein et entier effet et a purge les droits du propri\u00e9taire faute d'avoir fait opposition \u00e0 la vente en temps opportun. On ne trouvera pas de d\u00e9cisions de nos cours contraires \u00e0 ce principe mais on en trouve qui le soutiennent hautement.\nDans une cause de Patton v. Morin ([20]) o\u00f9 la demande de la nullit\u00e9 d'un d\u00e9cret \u00e9tait demand\u00e9e comme fait super non domino il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9: 1o que le d\u00e9cret purge un immeuble de tous les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, except\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire est lors du d\u00e9cret en possession de l'immeuble saisi super non domino.; 2\u00b0 que si au moment de la saisie de l'immeuble le vrai propri\u00e9taire n'en est pas en possession, il doit, pour conserver son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s'opposer \u00e0 la vente par les moyens ordinaires. Un des consid\u00e9rants de cc jugement est comme suit: \" Consid\u00e9rant que la vente judiciaire accompagn\u00e9e des formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales, doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e et ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e en droit sans porter atteinte \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 d'un titre accord\u00e9 par los mains do la justice la cour maintient la d\u00e9fense du d\u00e9fendeur et renvoie l'action du demandeur.\nUn autre consid\u00e9rant affirme le principe que le de mandeur aurait d\u00fb se porter opposant \u00e0 la saisie et vente du dit immeuble mais qu'au contraire ii a laiss\u00e9 vendre et adjuger le dit immeuble en justice sans formuler sa plainte et s'opposer \u00e0 la dite saisie et vente.\nJe suis d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is an appeal by plaintiff from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversing a judgment of the Superior Court which had been given in his favour. The judgment of the Superior Court is reported in M. L. R. 6 S. C. 196 and that of the Queen's Bench in Q. R. 1 Q. B. 197.\nThe action of the present appellant was brought to obtain the partition and licitation of an immovable property in the parish of Montreal and to claim from the defendant company the fruits and revenues collected since the opening of the plaintiff's right.\nThe declaration alleged that the late James McGregor the appellant's father, was in community of property with his wife Helen Mahers, and that during the marriage the consorts had acquired the immovable in question which, consequently, fell into the community; that by his will of the 28th January, 1868, the late Mr. McGregor bequeathed to his wife the usufruct of one-half of this immovable property with substitution in favour of his son the plaintiff\" that Helen Mahers died on the 7th October 1886; that on the last mentioned date the substitution opened in favour of the plaintiff who, in cons\u00e9quence, became the owner of the one-half of said immovable property; that the defendant company, who were lawfully possessed of the one undivided half of the said immovable as representing Helen Mahers, were illegally in possession of the undivided half belonging to the plaintiff. The conclusions of the action prayed that the plaintiff be declared the owner of the undivided half of the said property; that the defendant company be ordered to account for the fruits and revenues thereof from the 7th October, 1886, and that a partition or licitation be ordered in the ordinary course.\nThe defendant company met this action by pleading ing that they were the proprietors of the undivided one-half claimed by the plaintiff and alleged the following chain of title:\u2014\n\"1. A deed of sale of 7th April, 1885, from the sheriff of Montreal to the company, the property having been sold in a case wherein one McDougall was plaintiff against Thomas Craig his debtor, to whom he had advanced, on the 17th September, 1875, a sum of $15,000, secured by hypothec on the property in question.\"\n\"2. A deed of sale of 30th August, 1875, from O. J. Devlin to Thomas Craig.\"\n\"3 A deed of sale of 11th May 1875 from Helen Mahers to O. J. Devlin.\"\n\u201c4 A deed of sale of 25th October, 1876, from William Quinn to Helen Mahers of no. 16, being part of the lot in question, and a deed of sale of 14th January, 1870 from James Thomas to Helen Mahers of no. 17, the other part of said lot.\"\n\u201c5. A sale by authority of justice, dated 15th October, 1866, from Helen Mahers, acting on her own behalf and also in her capacity of tutrix, to James Thomas of lot no. 17, and a sale by authority of justice, dated 15th October, 1866, from Helen Mahers, acting as aforesaid, to William Quinn of lot no 16.\"\nThe defendant company alleged that at the time of the sheriff's sale the plaintiff had attained his majority and was in a position to protect his rights if any he had; that the sheriff's sale against Thomas Craig had been made against a proprietor in open and public possession; that the defendant-company had purchased in good faith at a sale made with all the requisite formalities, and that the effect of the sheriff's sale was to purge the property of any rights which the plaintiff might have had therein.\nThe plaintiff filed special answers to these pleas attacking the validity both of the sheriff's sale and of the sale by authority of justice to Quinn and Thomas. He alleged in regard to the sheriff's sale that it could not purge the rights of the plaintiff inasmuch as the substitution did not open in his favour until 1886 two years after the said sale. He also alleged that even if the will were held not to contain a substitution the sheriff's sale would be null and void as having been made super non domino et non possidente, inasmuch as the sale from Devlin to Craig was simulated and Devlin was the owner and in possession of the lots in question at the time of the sheriff's sale. He also impugned the sale by the tutrix under the order of the court as tainted with fraud\nThe judgment appealed from holds that the will of the late James McGregor did not create a substitution, but simply a legacy of the usufruct to the wife and of the ownership to the son I unhesitatingly adopt that view of the will. I am also of opinion that, as held by the court below, the plaintiff, being of age at the time of the sheriff's sale to the defendant, though I do not see what difference that makes) was bound then to oppose the sale and assert his right, if he had any; that his default to do so precludes him from now at tacking the validity of the defendant's title, as this sale has been accompanied with all the formalities required by law, and as Craig upon whom it has been made was then in possession as proprietor of the said lot in virtue of duly registered authentic deeds. The case of Dufresne v. Dixon ([21]) cited by the appellant was totally different from the present one, as a reference to the report will clearly show.\nThere the sheriff had sold Mrs. Dixon's property, to which she had a title and of which she was in possession, and so having both title and possession the sheriff's sale thereof against another person was annulled. Here the actual possession was in Devlin, but by the registry office the title was in Craig. Now, under those circumstances, Devlin's possession was Craig's possession. Upon Craig alone could that property be sold as it was so sold. If at the period of the seizure of an immovable the proprietor is not in possession thereof he must, for the preservation of his rights of property, oppose the sale by the usual means. Such is the law as laid down in the case of Patton v. Morin ([22]) to which we must give application in the present case. Assuming that he had rights to this property the appellant has lost them by the sheriff's sale. Vigil antibus non dormientibus subvenil lex. In Rodi\u00e8re, Proc. Civ. ([23]) and Beriat du St. Prix ([24]), inter alias, the difference between the old and the new law in France on this subject is pointed out.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE J. I concur that the will under which the plaintiff claims did not not create a substitution in his favour as contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff but devised the usufruct to his wife and the ownership to the appellant with substitution over to the wife in case the son should die during his life, and I concur in the opinion of my brother Taschereau that, for the reasons which he has stated in his judgment which I have had the opportunity of reading, the title of the respondents which is derived from the sheriffs sale cannot be impeached and that the appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : M.

Defendants pleaded \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and that the article was a fair comment on a public matter. On the trial the defendants put in evidence, plaintiff\u2019s council objecting, to prove the charge of personal dishonesty, and evidence in rebuttal was tendered by plaintiff and rejected. Certain questions were put to the jury requiring them to find whether or not the words bore the construction claimed by the innuendo or were fair comment on the subject matter of the article; the jury found generally for the defendants and in answer to the trial judge who asked if they found that the publication bore the meaning ascribed to it by the plaintiff, the foreman said: \u201cWe did not consider that at all.\u201d On appeal from an order for a new trial:\nHeld, that defendants not having pleaded the truth of the charge in justification the evidence given to establish it should not have been received, but it having been received evidence in rebuttal was improperly rejected; the general finding for the defendants was not sufficient in view of the fact that the jury stated that they had not considered the material question, namely, the charge of personal dishonesty. For these reasons a new trial was properly granted.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Man. ([1]), setting aside a verdict for the defendants and ordering a new trial. The action against the defendant company was for an alleged libel in a newspaper owned and published by them against the plaintiff, then attorney-general of the province as well as railway commissioner, charging him with malfeasance of office in connection with the construction of the Northern and Manitoba Railway. The defendants pleaded not guilty and that the alleged libellous publication was a fair comment on a matter of public interest. On the trial certain questions were submitted to the jury who returned a verdict of not guilty, and on being asked by the trial judge as to their finding on the question as to whether or not the publication bore the meaning ascribed to it by the plaintiff, the foreman replied:\n\u201cWe did not consider that at all We found the article complained of was a fair comment on a matter of public interest, but the jury while giving the verdict desire to state that it would have been better if more temperate language had been used.\u201d\nOn appeal to the full court the verdict was set aside and a new trial ordered, the majority of the court being of opinion that the answer of the foreman meant that the jury had not considered the case as submitted. The defendants appealed.\nHaegel Q.C. for the appellant. The whole matter was tried out and nothing can be gained by a new trial. See Merivale v. Carson ([2]). The publication was not libellous. Campbell v. Spottiswood ([3]) Odger v. Mortimer ([4]).\nEwart Q.C. for the respondent. An appellate court will not interfere with an order for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. Toulmin v. Hedley ([5]). Even under the recent statute, granting a new trial will be regarded as a matter of discretion in the court appealed from. See Barrington v. The Scottish Union (1); Accident Ins. Co. v. McLachlan (2); Moore v. The Connecticut Mutual Ins. Co. (3).\nThough having jurisdiction since the statute of 1891 the court will refuse to interfere in such a case. Scott v. The Bank of New Brunswick (4).\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal, for which as we read the case as presented upon the appeal books there does not seem to be any substantial foundation, must be dismissed with costs, and the new trial had as directed by the order of the court below.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This is an action for libel. The respondent is plaintiff in the action and complains of the publication, in a newspaper published by the appellants, of the words:\nAnother disgraceful piece of business, which has never been explained, was the celebrated $500 per mile charge, which, had it not been for the watchfulness of the \u201c Free Press,\u201d would have put $90,000 in the promoters\u2019 pockets, and everybody knows that the Attorney General (meaning the plaintiff) was the principal promoter.\nInnuendo,\nthat the plaintiff, as a member of the executive council of the province of Manitoba, took part in the negotiation of a contract between Her Majesty the Queen and certain persons who afterwards became incorporated as the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, and that at the instance and connivance of the plaintiff provision was made in the contract arising from such negotiations whereby a large sum of money should be raised by the said company, a portion of which was to be dishonestly and corruptly received by the plaintiff for his own use and benefit to the great detriment of this province. There is no doubt that these words are capable of a meaning defamatory to the plaintiff who is charged as being the principal promoter of some scheme or project which would have put $90,000 into the pockets of the promoters but for the watchfulness of the newspaper.\nThe pleas are first, not guilty; secondly,\nThat before and at the time of the alleged publication of the alleged libel great public interest was felt in the province of Manitoba in reference to the negotiation and making of the contract in the declaration referred to, and the subject was much discussed in the said province, both in the public newspapers and otherwise, and the words complained of were and are part of an editorial article referring to said matter, and the defendants being the proprietors of a public newspaper published the words complained of, together with the whole of said editorial article, which is the publication complained of; and the words complained of were fair comment on the said matters of great public interest in the said province, and were published by the defendants bon\u00e2 fide for the benefit of the public and without any malice toward the plaintiff.\nThere is a large mass of evidence which does not, except to a very small extent, bear on the matter now before us. It appears that in 1888 negotiations were going on between the government of Manitoba, generally represented by the plaintiff who was attorney-general of the province and railway commissioner, and certain contractors, respecting the construction of a railway. There is abundant evidence that great public interest was taken in that negotiation.\nOn the third of August, 1888, the \u201cFree Press\u201d published a memorandum of agreement made, under date 26th of July, 1888, between the plaintiff as railway commissioner and three persons designated contractors. By that instrument the contracting parties mutually agreed to endeavour to procure from the Manitoba legislature a charter incorporating a company to be called The Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, and within ten days after the incorporation of the company to execute a contract for the construction of the railway, a draft of which was annexed to the memorandum of agreement and was also published in the \u201cFree Press\u201d along with the memorandum.\nThe draft contract provided for the delivery by the commissioners to the company of guaranteed bonds and unguaranteed bonds, to amounts computed, with reference to the work done, according to a defined scale. In connection with this we learn what it is that the libel alludes to as \u201cthe celebrated $500 a mile charge.\u201d It appears from the following extract from clause 11, of the draft contract:\nThe effect of this is intended to be that where the construction and equipment of the said line costs less than $16,000 per mile, the commissioner will retain in his hands, in unguaranteed bonds, the difference between the cost as aforesaid and $16,000 per mile, and when the line costs more than $16,000 per mile the commissioner will deliver to the company the overplus of the cost above $16,000 in accumulated unguaranted bonds in the hands of the commissioner. In calculating the amount of work done for the purpose of delivering to the company the amount of unguaranteed bonds the commissioner agrees to add the sum of $500 per mile to the actual cost of construction and equipment.\nThat draft contract was executed, but after the incorporation of the company ([6]), a fresh contract was prepared and was executed by the plaintiff as railway commissioner, and by the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Rail\u2019 way Company. It bore date the 29th December, 1888, but had before that date been approved and ratified by the legislature of Manitoba by an act that was assented to on the 4th of September, 1888 ([7]), the contract forming schedule A to that act. As thus approved and executed the contract contained a $500 per mile clause in these terms:\nIt is farther agreed that in calculating the amount expended on the said lines from Winnipeg to Portage la Prairie, and from Morris to Brandon, the sum of five hundred dollars per mile shall be allowed for cost of organizing, preparing and printing bonds and coupons and legal expenses in connection with such organization and preparation of bonds, etc.\nBut by another provincial act passed on the fifth of March, 1889 ([8]), the money arrangements of the contract were put on a different basis; six clauses of the contract, including that in which the $500 per mile was provided for, were abrogated, and others were substituted for them. All this provincial legislation was confirmed by an act of the Parliament of Canada passed on the 16th of April, 1889 ([9]).\nThe article containing the words charged to be libellous seems to have originally appealed in a paper called the Morden \u201cMonitor,\u201d and it was copied, with words of approval, in the \u201c Free Press \u201d of the 18th of September, 1890 It referred, in a tone of hostile criticism, to several matters connected with the railway arrangements of the provincial government. The passage touching the $500 per mile clause is as follows:\nAnother disgraceful piece of business, which has never yet been explained, was the celebrated $500 per mile charge, which, had it not been for the watchfulness of the \u201cFree Press,\u201d would have put $90,000 into the promoter\u2019s pockets, and everybody knows that the attorney-general was the principal promoter. By the prompt exposure of this transaction on the part of men who had just been returned to power for their devout pledges to secure honest government for the people, the \u201cFree Press\u201d compelled the government to hastily drop this palpable attempt at jobbery as though it were a hot cinder, and a second bargain was entered into, but with as much despotic secrecy as ever.\nAs far as this passage is properly comment or criticism it is, no doubt, capable of justification as being not so unfair as to amount to an actionable libel. The imputation of dishonesty in framing the contract so as to put unearned money into the pockets of \u201c the promoters,\u201d whatever that term is here intended to mean, may have been undeserved, but, judging merely from the documents, the inference was one for which there was room. The plaintiff does not complain on that score, nor could \u201c the promoters\u201d whoever they are supposed to be. The complaint is that the plaintiff personally is charged with framing the contract so as dishonestly to put money into his own pocket. That is the meaning of the statement that he is the principal promoter, and the personal charge is an allegation of fact and not a comment on admitted facts.\nThe new fact so asserted may itself happen to be the subject of comment, as was the case in Davis v. Shepstone ([10]), where a newspaper charged certain acts against the British Resident Commissioner in Zululand and commented severely upon the acts assumed to have been done. It has been so here, for whatever is said of \u201cthe promoters\u201d is said of the plaintiff\u2019. But, as remarked by Lord Herschell in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Zululand case:\nThe distinction cannot be too clearly borne in mind between comment or criticism and allegations of fact, such as that disgraceful acts have been committed or discreditable language used. It is one thing to comment upon or to criticise, even with severity, the acknowledged or proved acts of a public man, and quite another to assert that he has been guilty of particular acts of misconduct.\nThis general doctrine was evidently well understood and was present to the mind of the learned judge who tried this action, and I find no trace in the report of the trial of any suggestion that the alleged fact of the plaintiff\u2019s complicity in the\u2019 asserted fraud could be regarded as a known or admitted fact.\nOn the part of the defence evidence was offered in proof of the alleged fact, and what took place in connection with that evidence gave rise to some of the questions which we have to discuss.\nA general idea of the positions taken may be gained from reading a page or so from the printed report of the trial. There are one or two places where the meaning is slightly confused, probably from inaccuracy in taking or transcribing the shorthand notes, or perhaps from some typographical error.\nMr. Howell is counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Haegel for the defendants. A witness named Hagarty is under examination on the part of the defence, and is asked concerning a conversation with the plaintiff:\nQ. Relate what that conversation was as regards the $500 a mile clause ?\nMr. Howell\u2014What issue is this going to meet ?\nMr. Haegel\u2014I submit it is the most material evidence.\nHis Lordship\u2014For what purpose?\nMr. Haegel\u2014For the purpose of showing there was some foundation in fact, all the defendant has to show, for the purpose of proving the plea of bon\u00e2 fide comment, not that they are true, it is not necessary that he should establish that, but it is necessary that he should establish that he commented on this matter in the public interest, and that there was some foundation in fact for the statements which he made. Cites Odger at page 38. I submit if I show that the plaintiff himself has made explanations of this $500 a mile provision, which admit that it is not a proper and honestly made provision or which failed to explain and satisfy a reasonable man, but kept it tainted, that it is evidence under that plea of fair and bon\u00e2 fide comment. Wills v. Garman ([11]). I propose to prove by this witness that certain admissions were made touching the $500 a mile clause.\nMr. Howell\u2014It seems to me it would have been more manly to have come here and said you are a thief, and you have said you are a thief. I will accept the truth of it, that is the going into it if we are allowed to deny it in rebuttal, but it would have been more manly if you had pleaded it.\nHis Lordship\u2014It appears to me that there are really two questions that arise under this language that is charged to the defendant. The first is whether the language that is used is language that can be construed fair comment upon the contract of this kind made under the circumstances. The second is the direct statement that is made in it that the plaintiff was what was called one of the promoters into whose pockets it appears to be charged that some of these moneys went; that charge of fact whether he was such or not, it appears to me the defendant cannot raise without placing it on the record distinctly. They are not entitled to raise it, but they are entitled to go into anything that shows the nature and effect of this contract for the purpose of showing whether the language used with regard to it, which, to a certain extent, is open to the jury to connect with the plaintiff is correct and, therefore, it appears to me to that extent it may be used, but that the defendant cannot give any evidence whatever for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff was one of the promoters, because they have not placed on the record that he was, and if they are not willing to assert in court that he was, they are not entitled to have the evidence taken. I think the question in the present form I have to admit subject to that statement, that evidence bearing merely upon the question whether the plaintiff was one of the promoters or rather parties into whose pockets it was charged this money should go, the defendant is not entitled to give any evidence.\nMr. Howell\u2014There is another reason for its exclusion. How can his conversation with the plaintiff give Mr. Luxton any right to libel the plaintiff?\nHis Lordship\u2014Do you propose to show communication to the defendant ?\nMr. Haegel\u2014Yes, my Lord.\nMr. Wilson\u2014Prior to the writing of the article ?\nMr. Haegel\u2014I don\u2019t know that I can show that. It is just as good evidence if the plaintiff never learned it. I can show it if it is pressed for.\nHis Lordship\u2014I think I will still allow it, notwithstanding, I may say, that I am not quite satisfied in my own mind whether it ought to be allowed, but it must be to show whether the language used was justified with regard to this contract.\nThen when another witness for the defence, one A. F. Martin, was asked about a discussion that took place at a caucus of the liberal party, to which the plaintiff belonged, respecting the contract, this is reported to have occurred:\nQ. Did you hear any discussion about the $500 a mile ?\u055b\nA. Yes; there were strong objections against it at the time. The strongest objections were made by Mr. Isaac Campbell and Mr. Fisher and Col. McMillan and Mr. Thompson, of Carberry. The strongest objections to it were by Mr. Campbell and Mr. Fisher.\nMr. Howell\u2014Of course we expect to be able to rebut this evidence.\nMr. Haegel\u2014My learned friend has no reason to assume that we are making a bargain.\nHis Lordship\u2014I can\u2019t undertake anything of the kind, Mr. Howell. Mr. Howell\u2014It is either objectionable or I have the right to rebut it if it can be received in evidence; or I will make a bargain with my learned friend to let it go in, we having the power to meet it.\nMr. Haegel\u2014I must object to that.\nHis Lordship\u2014On what grounds do you want this evidence, Mr. Haegel ?\nMr. Haegel\u2014On the same ground I put before\u2014that these statements were made in the presence of the plaintiff, and I propose to prove what the plaintiff said and did on that occasion in answer to the statements: what justification he made to the charges.\nMr. Howell\u2014I agree it is evidence on the view the people there took of it, and if your Lordship can only see your way clear to receive it I shall be only too glad.\nHis Lordship\u2014I will allow it to be given on the same principle as that with regard to the other.\nA good deal of evidence was given on the part of the defence in direct support of the personal charge of corrupt dealing by the plaintiff. This evidence consisted chiefly, and it may be said altogether, of conversations with the plaintiff sworn to by Mr. Luxton, the managing director of the defendant company, and by other witnesses, and amounting, if believed to have taken place as stated, to express admissions by the plaintiff that the design of the $500 per mile provision was to provide money for use, either personally or as members of a political party, by himself and others.\nIt was evidence that would have been properly receivable upon a plea justifying the statement complained of as being true, and it was not properly receivable without such a plea.\nIf the libel had in direct terms stated, as it did less directly, that the plaintiff had been guilty of a palpable attempt at jobbery by framing the contract so as to put money into his own pocket, the only effective plea to a declaration charging the publication of a libel in those terms would have been a plea that the asserted fact was true. A plea that the contract was a matter of public interest and that the libel was a fair comment or criticism of it would manifestly have fallen short of meeting the gravamen of the complaint.\nTo state facts which are libellous is not comment or criticism on anything.\nPer Field J. in R. V. Flowers ([12]).\nSuch a plea ought to be met by a demurrer as in the Irish case of Lefroy v. Burnside ([13]). In giving the judgment of the Court of Exchequer in that case, allowing the demurrer, Palles G.B. said:\nThat a fair and bon\u00e2 fide comment on a matter of public interest is an excuse for what would be otherwise a defamatory publication is admitted. The very statement, however, of this rule assumes the matters of fact commented upon to be somehow or other ascertained. It does not mean that a man may invent facts, and comment on the facts so invented in what would be a fair and bon\u00e2 fide manner on the supposition that the facts were true.\nThe conclusion from this statement of doctrine, and from the allowance of the demurrer to the plea, is that the truth of the allegation of fact should be pleaded.\nThe rule is stated in Odger on Libel and Slander ([14]), that:\nIf the comment introduces an independent fact, or substantially aggravates the main imputation, it must be expressly justified. Thus the libellous heading of a newspaper article must be justified as well as the facts stated in the article.\nThe authorities cited for this are Lewis v. Clement (4), where the report of proceedings in a court of justice would probably have been held to give no right of actions, but for the heading \u201c shameful conduct of an attorney,\u201d and a somewhat similar case of Bishop v. Latimer (5), where the heading was \u201cHow Lawyer Bishop treats his clients.\u201d\nIn another part of the same treatise the case of Mountney v. Watton (6), is cited, in which case the libel was contained in a newspaper paragraph headed \u201c horse stealer.\u201d The innuendo was that it was intended to charge the plaintiff with felony. The plea which justified all the statements except the heading in which the imputation of felony was implied was held bad on demurrer.\nWere such a justification formally pleaded the plaintiff would of course be entitled to give evidence in answer to that given by the defendant, who would, in his turn, be entitled to call witnesses in rebuttal.\nThe assumption on the part of these defendants was that, as put by their counsel according to the report from which I have, read an extract, in order to maintain that the publication was a fair comment on the matter of public interest it was not necessary to establish the truth of their allegation of fact, but only to show that there was some foundation in fact for it.\nI do not profess to see the distinction between a statement being true and its having a foundation in fact, but I do not find any authority for the contention that imputations of personal misconduct can be excused by anything short of proof that they are well founded in fact. The passage in Mr. Odger\u2019s work to which counsel is said to have referred in support of his proposition is, I imagine, the following ([15]):\nIt will be no defence that the writer, at the time he wrote, honestly believed in the truth of the charges he was making, if such charges be made recklessly, unreasonably and without any foundation in fact.\nThe authority cited being Campbell v. Spottiswoode ([16]). What was discussed in Campbell v. Spottiswoode was the imputation of motives, not statements of fact. Cockburn C.J. said:\nI think the fair position in which the law may be settled is this: That when the public conduct of a public man is open to animadversion and the writer who is commenting upon it makes imputations on his motives which arise fairly and legitimately out of his conduct, so that a jury shall say that the criticism was not only honest but also well founded, an action is not maintainable. But it is not because a public writer fancies that the conduct of a public man is open to the suspicion of dishonesty he is, therefore, justified in assailing his character as dishonest.\nThere is nothing in that decision to favour the assumption on which the evidence was offered. The conduct of a public man which may be commented on, and from which inferences unfavourable to his character may be fairly deduced, must be something known or admitted or proved, not conduct which the writer chooses to ascribe to him.\nThe case of Lefroy v. Burnside ([17]) was also relied on, or rather an Ontario case of Wills v. Carman ([18]) in which, in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, the case of Lefroy v. Burnside was referred to by the court. In Wills v. Carman the pleas were not guilty and \u201c fair comment,\u201d and there was no express justification of defamatory statements which I suppose were statements of fact, though the report does not make that clear. The Chief Justice said:\nThe defendant did not justify, nor did he seek to justify, the alleged defamatory matter published as being true, but he alleged that it was a fair comment upon matters of public and general interest, and he was entitled to show that the matters on which he commented were true and without so doing it is clear that he could not have established his plea of fair comment.\nI entirely agree with this last statement; but I do not hold that without a plea of the truth of defamatory allegations of fact a defendant can insist on giving evidence of their truth, nor do I consider that a contrary opinion is necessarily involved in the refusal of a new trial where the evidence may have been given and the question pronounced upon by the jury though not formally raised upon the record. I may read a few words more from Palles C. B. in Lefroy\u2019s case. They immediately follow those already quoted:\nSetting apart all questions of forms\nhe says\u2014meaning, as I understand, without strict regard to the precise issues joined upon the record\u2014\nthe questions which would be raised at a trial by such a defence must necessarily be\u2014first the existence of a certain state of facts; secondly, whether the publication sought to be excused is a fair and bon\u00e2 fide comment upon such existing facts. If the facts as a comment upon which the publication is sought to be excused do not exist the foundation of the plea fails.\nI may quote also from the Chief Baron\u2019s reference to the facts alleged in the plea before him which, mutatis mutandis, is not inapposite to the plea before us.\nThe imputation to be justified is that the plaintiff dishonestly or corruptly supplied to a newspaper information acquired by him as manager of the Queen\u2019s Printing Office. Leaving out the qualifications of \u201cdishonesty \u201d or \u201ccorruptly,\u201d as clearly comment, the allegation of fact to be excused is that he did supply it. There is an allegation of the defendant\u2019s belief that the information could only have been procured from the Queen\u2019s Printing Office, but there is not even an allegation of fact (as distinguished from belief) that the information could only have been so procured.\nThe evidence given on the \u0440 art of the defendants being given for the purpose of proving, and being fitted to prove, the defamatory statements on which the action was founded was, in my opinion, improperly admitted; but having been insisted on by the defendants and admitted at their instance, just as it would have been if they had regularly pleaded their justification, it was not open to them to object to its being met by counter evidence on the part of the plaintiff, not only to contradict the witnesses who swore to admissions, but to disprove the charges. The question was not whether certain admissions had been made, but whether the plaintiff was guilty of what was charged against him, and the alleged admissions were merely evidence on that issue.\nOwing to some misapprehension of the rights of the plaintiff in this respect his evidence was rejected. A witness named McNaught who had acted in the negotiations for the contractors or the company was called by the plaintiff, and in reply to the defendants\u2019 evidence, and after he had, under the ruling of the judge, been allowed to speak in contradiction of the defendants\u2019 evidence touching the conversations with the plaintiff, he was asked some questions on the substantial question of fact. I read from the notes. Mr. Culver here appears with Mr. Haegel as counsel for the defendants.\nQ. What was the object of putting that $500 a mile in the contract ?\nMr. Culver\u2014That clearly was matter in chief, and is not rebuttal.\nMr. Haegel\u2014And the object is not an answer; the only question is, what did the object seem from the surrounding circumstances? The object might have been pure, but it might have seemed bad from the surrounding circumstances, and it is pertinent to the issue.\nMr. Howell\u2014They suggested or endeavoured to show all sorts of schemes and frauds, and I ask him what was the object of putting that in. Was it a base object or otherwise ?\nHis Lordship\u2014I don\u2019t think you can go into that question at all now.\nQ. Was that clause as to $500 a mile put in for the benefit of any other person than the Northern Pacific Railway Company ? Mr. Haegel objected to this. His Lordship\u2014I can\u2019t allow it.\nQ. Was there any fraudulent design of any kind in putting in that clause ?\nObjected to.\nHis Lordship\u2014I can\u2019t allow it.\nQ. Was there any intention that Mr. Martin or any member of the local government should take any benefit of any kind whatever out of that $500 a mile?\nObjected to and ruled out.\nThe same course was pursued with Mr. Kendrick another witness and with the plaintiff himself. The evidence ought, under the circumstances, to have been received.\nThe case presents this dilemma:\nThe defendants\u2019 evidence ought not to have been admitted, or the plaintiff\u2019s counter evidence ought to have been admitted.\nOn this ground alone I should decline to interfere with the order for a new trial, but there are other grounds equally fatal to the appeal.\nAfter a very full and careful charge to the jury the learned judge asked them to answer three questions:\n1st. Are these words defamatory in themselves within the definition I have given you ?\n2nd. Do they bear the construction that the plaintiff in this case in the innuendo annexed to the declaration says they bear ?\n3rd. In either sense are they fair comment upon this question upon which they are said to be comment ?\nCounsel for the plaintiff made some objections to the charge, one of which is thus noted.:\nFurther, in any event, Your Lordship should have told the jury that there should be a verdict for the plaintiff unless they found that there was a foundation in fact for the charge, and secondly, that there was a bon\u00e2 fide belief in the truth of the charge.\nThen the report proceeds:\nThe jury having come into court the foreman (F. W. Stobart) announced that they found for the defendant.\nMr. Howell asked if the questions were answered.\nHis Lordship to the jury\u2014Have you anything to say as to any of the questions? Do you find whether the publication has the meaning ascribed by the plaintiff ? Mr. Stobart (foreman). We did not consider that at all. We found the article complained of was a fair comment on a matter of public interest, but the jury while giving the verdict desire to state that it would have been better if more temperate language had been used.\nIt is impossible to hold that the court improperly exercised its discretion in sending the case to another\nNo doubt a jury may lawfully decline, in ,a libel case, to give any verdict except a general verdict. If that, right had been insisted on here, and a general verdict for the defendants given without explanation, the plaintiff might have been driven to rely on his objections to the judge\u2019s charge and to the reception or rejection of evidence, or upon the verdict being against the weight of evidence. With the explanation given it is evident that the most material inquiry received no attention from the jury. The meaning ascribed to the publication by the plaintiff, in other words the innuendo that a corrupt act was charged against the plaintiff personally, the jury say they did not consider at all. They found that the article complained of was a fair comment on a matter of public interest, and so they may well have found if they separated from it the allegation that touched the plaintiff personally, and which, as expressed by Lord Field in R. V. Flowers ([19]), was not comment or criticism on anything, or at least might properly have been held so if the jury had considered that point.\nThe ground of misdirection or non-direction, indicated by the objection to the charge which I have noted, is involved with the question of the improper\u2019 reception or rejection of evidence and need not now be further considered.\nOn the whole the case is clearly one in which the order for a new trial cannot be said to be improper.\nI ought not to omit to refer to the very important case of The Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty (2) in the House of Lords, and to the discussion by Lords Selborne, Penzance, Blackburn and Bramwell of the respective duties of the court and the jury in actions of libel, and particularly to what is said by those learned lords, as well as in the cases referred to by them, as to the duty of the jury to say whether the publication has the meaning ascribed to it in the innuendo, the duty which the jury in this case declared they did not perform. I refer to the case without attempting an analysis of the judgments delivered. To do that would be to write an essay of some length.\nI shall merely quote from the remarks of Lord Selborne the words:\nThe Court of Appeal has thought that there was no evidence to go to the jury, and I must be satisfied that their judgment was wrong before I can say that it ought to be reversed.\nThe present case is one for the application of that useful principle.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Haegel & Bonnar.\nSolicitors for respondent: Ewart, Fisher & Wilson.\n[1] 8 Man.

E. & W. agreed to this and extended the time for payment of their claim and made further advances and, as the last mentioned agreement authorized, they re-hypothecated the bonds to the bank on certain terms.\nAt the expiration of the extended time the railway company again made default in payment and notice was given them by the bank that the bonds would be sold unless the debt was paid on a certain day named; the company then brought an action to have such sale restrained.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, that the bank and E. & W. were respectively first and second encumbrancers of the bonds, being to all intents and purposes mortgagees, and not trustees of the company in respect thereof, and there was no rule of equity forbidding the bank to sell or E. & W. to purchase under that sale.\nHeld further, that if E. & W. should purchase at such sale they would become absolute holders of the bonds and not liable to be redeemed by the company.\nHeld also, that the dealing by the bank with the bonds was authorized by the Banking Act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge who had granted an interim injunction to restrain the Halifax Banking Company from selling the bonds of the appellant company's road.\nThe facts upon which the judgment of the Supreme Court is founded are fully set out in the reasons for judgment given by Mr. Justice Strong.\nHenry Q.C. and Newcombe for the appellants.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondents, Eisenhauer and Wade and Russell Q.C. for the Halifax Banking Company.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts of this case are not in dispute, and the importance of it consists wholly in the large amounts involved and not in any difficulty in the law applicable to the facts as they appear in the documentary and other evidence.\nThe appellants are a railway company incorporated by the legislature of Nova Scotia, and are owners of a line of railway extending from Middleton to Lunenburg in that province.\nBeing in want of money for the completion of their line of railway, which was then in course of construction, the appellants, for the purpose of raising loans and advances, and securing the repayment of the same, entered into the agreements and transactions hereinafter stated:\u2014\nBy an agreement between the appellants and the defendant Wade, bearing date the 13th February, 1889, it was agreed, among other things, that the defendant Wade should furnish the appellants with money for the completion of their railway in an amount not to exceed at any one time $200,000, and with a bank credit or guarantee in any amount necessary for the purchase of rails, rolling stock, etc, not to exceed $200,000; that the defendant Wade should carry $130,000 of the said cash advance for six months after 1st January, 1890; that the appellants should pay for the use of said money the ordinary bank rate of interest, and for the said guarantee or credit whatever the regular bank charge therefor should be, and in addition should pay the defendant Wade $27,500; that if the appellants should require more than $200,000 the defendant Wade should furnish such further sum, not to exceed $50,000, upon which the appellants should pay interest at the same rate as on the $200,000, and in addition to the defendant Wade an amount equal to ten per cent upon the said further sum so to be advanced; that out of the said sum of $200,000 the amount due to the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer for notes then in the bank to secure previous advances made by the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer should be paid at once, also the amount of a note then outstanding to the defendant Eisenhauer for commissions upon said past advances; that as to said sum of $27,500 one-third thereof should be paid to the defendant Wade out of the first advances made in respect of said sum of $200,000, one-third on 1st October, 1889, and the balance with the commission aforesaid upon further advances beyond said sum of $200,000, if any, on 15th December, 1889; that the total amount of all said advances and guarantee including said commission should be secured upon the appellants' entire bond issue and the subsidies granted, or to be granted, to the appellants by the Dominion and Provincial Governments.\nAt or shortly before the time of this agreement the appellants, by virtue of the powers granted in their charter, executed bonds amounting in all to $740,000. These bonds and the interest coupons thereunto attached were payable to bearer and were secured upon the appellants' railway, rolling stock, franchises and other property by a first mortgage executed by the appellants to the Farmer's Loan and Trust Company, of New York, as trustees, and the bonds were placed in the possession of said Farmer's Loan and Trust Company as such trustees.\nIn order to comply with this agreement the defendant Wade agreed with the defendant Eisenhauer and the defendant, The Halifax Banking Company, that the money required should be advanced by the bank upon promissory notes of the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer, and the appellants, in pursuance of the said agreement, entered into an agreement, or power of attorney under seal, with the defendants, dated 4th July, 1889, whereby, after reciting that the defendant Wade had agreed to furnish to the plaintiff certain funds, to raise which the defendant Eisenhauer had agreed to endorse the promissory notes of the defendant Wade, which the bank had agreed to discount, and that the appellants had agreed to pledge the said bonds to secure the said advances, the appellants appointed the bank its attorney irrevocable in case the appellants should fail to carry out their said agreement with the defendant Wade, or should fail to pay the said advances at the times and in the manner agreed, to receive the said bonds from the said Farmer's Loan and Trust Company, and dispose of the same to the best advantage, and out of the proceeds pay first the expenses incident to obtaining the said bonds from the said Farmer's Loan and Trust Company, secondly the amount of any paper then held by the bank as security for said advances, thirdly any further advances made by the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer including amounts due them for commission and remuneration, and fourthly the balance to the appellants. And it was also provided by the said power of attorney that in case the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer should require the bank to proceed with the sale of said bonds for the purposes aforesaid, that the bank should then forthwith proceed to sell said bonds, or forthwith substitute the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer as the attorneys irrevocable of the appellants, with as full and ample authority in the premises as was by the said power of attorney granted and conferred upon the bank. Also that the said power of attorney should in no case be revoked without the consent of the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer.\nAfterwards, on 12th August, 1889, it was agreed between the appellants and the defendant Wade, that the defendant Wade should advance additional funds for the appellants, and that if required by the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer the appellants should increase their bond issue to an amount not exceeding $1,000,000 which should be exchanged for the said bonds then already executed and which said new bonds should be delivered as security to the bank for all moneys then or thereafter to be advanced by the defendants, including the commissions of the defendant Wade.\nIn accordance with the last mentioned agreement, and at the request of the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer, the previous issue of bonds was re-called, and a new issue of bonds was made by the appellants on or about 1st January, 1890. This new issue comprised 1,000 bonds of $1,000 each, payable with interest semi-annually at the rate of five per cent within forty years. These bonds, with the coupons for interest attached, were payable to bearer, and were secured and deposited with the Farmer's Loan and Trust Company in like manner as the previous issue of $740,000 had been.\nIn pursuance of this agreement of the 13th February, 1889, the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer, from time to time, advanced on the appellants' account large sums of money.\nThe appellants did not pay the advances or commissions as agreed, and about the month of May, 1890, the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer paid to the bank $100,000 or thereabout on account of the said indebtedness to the bank. The bank then also, at the request of the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer, and under the provisions of the power of attorney of the 4th July, 1889, procured the said 1,000 bonds from the said Farmer's Loan and Trust Company, and have since held the same.\nThe statement so far is taken from the appellants' statement of claim.\nOn the 13th of May, 1890, the appellants being then indebted to the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer in a very large amount for money paid by them to the bank, and in respect of their liability to the bank for advances made to the appellants' company, and they having threatened to sell the bonds under a substitution as attorneys in pursuance of the power given to the bank so to constitute them, contained in the instrument of the 4th July, 1889, a further agreement was entered into in the form of a letter written by Mr. George W. Bedford, the general manager of the company, to Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade.\nThis agreement was as follows:\nHalifax, N. S., May 13th, 1890.\nJames Eisenhauer, Esq., and F. B. Wade\nDear Sir,\u2014On behalf of the Nova Scotia Central Railway Company, and as their duly authorized agent or attorney, I have to request that you will not carry out the purchase of the bonds of said railway as this day contemplated, but that instead you will, if possible, arrange to have the Halifax Banking Company substitute you for them as the attorneys irrevocable of the railway company for the sale of the bonds, and in case you do so the said railway company agrees as follows:\n1. That you shall have the sole and absolute right to sell said bonds at such price, upon such terms, and subject to such conditions as you, in your judgment, may deem best in the interest of all concerned.\n2. That out of the proceeds of the sale of said bonds, after deducting all expenses incurred in connection therewith, you shall first deduct,\n(a) All sums advanced or hereafter to be advanced by you or either of you on account of said railway, and all commissions due or to grow due in connection therewith.\n(b) A reasonable commission or charge for carrying said loan after the 1st of January, 1890, and for the extra trouble, labour, etc., etc., occasioned thereby, and by the circumstances arising out of the same, and for making said sale.\n(c) You shall deduct and pay to F. B. Wade a sum as an equivalent for his services and efforts in connection with the enterprise, which sum up to the 1st January, 1889, has been agreed upon as $20,090, in addition to his charge for legal services and expenses; his services from that time to the present not being yet determined.\n3. That you have the power to hypothecate said bonds pending a sale, and that in order to carry the present loan you are at liberty to pay to any bank, and charge to commission account against the railway, a bonus not to exceed $1,000 per month until bonds sold.\n4. That during the continuance of this arrangement and until the bonds are sold and the money paid, the railway to remain under its present management. 5. That in case the earnings of the road are not sufficient to pay the operating expenses during said time, the railway company will pay the deficit promptly, in order that the credit of the company may be maintained.\n6. That in case the local government makes payment of any subsidy upon representations or promises of yours or either of you as to the final completion of the road, the company will, to your satisfaction, secure the performance of said representations or promises.\n7. That the company will execute and deliver to you any documents or papers necessary to carry this proposal and agreement into effect.\n8. These things being performed out of the balance of funds in your hands from the sale of the bonds, you are to pay C. O. Stearns the sum of $70,000, and the balance pay over to G. S. Hutchinson, or the railway company.\n9. That you shall have power to settle the Vickers suit upon the best terms possible, if you find it necessary, in order to facilitate the sale of the bonds.\n10. The company will agree to put a siding in at Morgan's, if the new road opened from there to Kaizer's or Bare's corner.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) GEO. W. BEDFORD,\nNova Scotia Central Railway Co.\nThe authority of Mr. Bedford to bind the company by this letter is impeached by the statement of claim, but in the argument at the bar of this court that point was not raised or insisted upon, and the learned counsel for the appellants, in answer to an inquiry from the court, distinctly stated that on behalf of the railway company they waived all question as to Mr. Bedford's authority in this respect.\nThis new agreement of the 13th of May, 1890, was accepted and adopted by the respondents Wade and Eisenhauer, and on the faith and security of it they not only extended the time for payment, but also made further advances.\nIn pursuance of the power so to do, contained in the 3rd clause of the letter or agreement of the 13th of May, 1890, the respondents Wade and Eisenhauer re-hypothecated the bonds to the bank by an instrument dated the 15th of May, 1890, which is as follows:\u2014\nThis agreement made this 15th day of May, A.D. 1890, between James D. Eisenhauer, of Lunenburg, merchant, and Fletcher B. Wade, of Bridgewater, barrister-at-law, both in the county of Lunenburg, of the first part; and the Halifax Banking Company, of the second part.\nWitnesseth:\u2014Whereas, the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade are indebted to the said Halifax Banking Company in the sum of three hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, for advances made to James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade, on account of Nova Scotia Central Railway construction and equipment.\nAnd whereas, the said Fletcher B. Wade has given the promissory note of him, the said Fletcher B. Wade, in favour of James D. Eisenhauer, or order, for the sum of three hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, payable on demand with interest at the rate of seven per centum to the said James D. Eisenhauer, and the said James D. Eisenhauer has endorsed the said promissory note to the said Halifax Banking Company, and the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade, attorneys of the said Nova Scotia Central Railway Company, have hypothecated the first mortgage bonds of the said Nova Scotia Central Railway Company to said Halifax Banking Company as collateral security for the payment of the said sum of three hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade having, under a certain agreement or power of attorney, required the said Halifax Banking Company to proceed with the sale of the said bonds for the purposes mentioned in said agreement or power of attorney, and the said Halifax Banking Company under said agreement or power of attorney have substituted said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade as attorneys irrevocable of the said Nova Scotia Central Railway Company, with as full and ample power and authority in the premises as have been granted and conferred upon the Halifax Banking Company.\nIt is hereby agreed by and between the same James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade, parties of the first part, and the Halifax Banking Company, parties of the second part, that the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade shall pay in addition to the sum of three hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, and interest thereon after the rate of seven per centum per annum, or upon such portion of the same as may be due and remaining and unpaid to the Halifax Banking Company, a commission of one thousand ($1,000) dollars per month on said sum of three hundred and forty-five thousand, six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, or any part thereof, and any part or fraction of a month during which said sum or any part thereof shall remain unpaid shall be considered and taken to be one whole month. And the said Halifax Banking Company, the party of the second part, cloth hereby agree to allow the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade the period or time not exceeding six months from the date of these presents for the payment of the said three hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, together with interest thereon at the rate of seven per centum per annum and the commission aforesaid; and it is hereby expressly agreed between the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade, the parties of the first part, and the said Halifax Banking Company, the party of the second part, that the giving of the aforesaid time, the agreement to give or extend said time for the payment of the aforesaid sum or any part thereof, shall not in any way release or discharge the endorser, said James D. Eisenhauer, on the aforesaid note made by Fletcher B. Wade in favour of said James D. Eisenhauer, or order, and endorsed by said James D. Eisenhauer to said Halifax Banking Company, nor shall it discharge or release any security or securities which the said Halifax Banking Company have, or which they may have, for the payment of the said sum of three hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty-eight cents, with interest thereon at the rate of seven per centum per annum and commission aforesaid, or any portion thereof.\nAnd it is also hereby agreed by the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade that they shall not in any way interfere with the possession of the said bonds by the said Halifax Banking Company, nor shall the said Halifax Banking Company be required to deliver said bonds into the possession of any person or persons whatsoever, until the whole amount due by said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade is paid to the said Halifax Banking Company, and the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade do hereby covenant and agree with the said Halifax Banking Company that they, the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade, have full power and authority to hypothecate and deliver the first mortgage bonds of the Nova Scotia Central Railway Company to the said Halifax Banking Company.\nIn witness whereof the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade have hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals, and the Halifax Banking Company has executed these presents by Robie Uniacke, President, and Wilson L. Pitcaithly, cashier of said Halifax Banking Company, subscribing their names to these presents and affixing thereto the corporate seal of said bank at Halifax.\n(Sgd.) JAMES D. EISENHAUER [L.S.]\n(Sgd.) FLETCHER B. WADE [L.S.] A large sum of money being due to the bank for advances, which were secured to them by the hypothecation of the bonds already mentioned by the respondents, Eisenhauer and Wade, under the agreement of the 13th of May, 1890, amounting to $319,213.84, the bank, on the 17th of December, 1890, gave a written notice to the railway company that they would at once proceed to sell the bonds unless before the 29th December, 1890, the amount of their debt should be paid. At this time there was due to Wade and Eisenhauer a large sum for advances which they had made and money which they had paid to the bank in reduction of the debt of the latter, in respect of which sum of money Wade and Eisenhauer were entitled to a charge upon the bonds, subordinate in point of priority to the lien or charge of the bank.\nOn the 29th day of December, 1890, the appellants brought the present action, claiming that the sale of the bonds by the Halifax Banking Company should be restrained.\nAn interlocutory injunction having been granted was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting en banc; subsequently the cause was heard before Mr. Justice Ritchie, who dismissed the action, and on appeal to the Supreme Court this judgment was affirmed.\nFrom this latter decision the appeal now in judgment has been brought.\nThe view taken by the Supreme Court was that the Halifax Banking Company and the respondents Eisenhauer and Wade were in the relative positions of first and second encumbrancers, the respondents being to all intents and purposes mortgagees, and this being so, that there was no rule or doctrine of equity which forbade the Banking Company from selling and the respondents Wade and Eisenhauer from purchasing under that sale. The contention of the appellants was that the respondents Eisenhauer and Wade were under a disability to purchase because they were by the original power of attorney of the 4th of July, 1889, made trustees for the appellants in case they should themselves sell the bonds.\nIt is, I think, very clear that there is no foundation, equitable or otherwise, for the action\nHowever informal some of the documents constituting the security may be we must look at the substance of the several transactions, and doing this we cannot fail to see that the respondents Wade and Eisenhauer, having ample authority so to do under the express power conferred upon them by the 3rd clause of the agreement contained in the letter of the 13th May, 1890, pledged or hypothecated the bonds in question by the instrument of the 15th of May, 1890, with the Banking Company to secure the debt for which the latter proposed to sell. In my opinion Wade and Eisenhauer are, as I have said, to be regarded as successive mortgagees or encumbrancers. In respect of the $100,000 and upwards which they had actually paid in cash to the bank they had no security but these bonds. In respect of their security for this debt it is true they were subordinated in point of priority to the bank, but subject to that they had an effectual charge upon the bonds. There could, therefore, be nothing to interfere with the right of the Banking Company to sell for the realization of the debt, nor with the right of Wade and Eisenhauer to purchase.\nThe fact that under the first power of attorney, that of 4th July, 1889, they were to sell for the benefit of and as trustees for the railway company, in case the bank should decline to sell, cannot possibly make any difference between the present case and that of successive mortgagees. In the first place the sale which it is sought to restrain was not a sale by the respondents Eisenhauer and Wade under the power of attorney, but by the Banking Company under the hypothecation of the 15th of May, 1890, executed by Eisenhauer and Wade in pursuance of the 3rd clause of the new agreement of the 13th of May, 1890.\nNext it is clear, upon the authorities referred to in the judgment of the Supreme Court, that if property is substantially mortgaged, charged or hypothecated to secure a debt it makes no difference that the mortgagee, chargee, or hypothecary creditor may be called a trustee. Being a creditor he has the rights of one just as much as if his security was created by a mortgage deed expressed in the most regular and conventional form. Kirkwood v. Thompson[2]; Locking v. Parker[3] are conclusive authorities to this effect.\nThe case then just resolves itself into one of a sale by a first mortgagee or pledgee and a purchase by a second mortgagee or pledgee.\nThe appellants do not merely insist that the second mortgagees, Eisenhauer and Wade, having purchased are liable to be redeemed and are not the absolute purchasers, but further that the sale was absolutely void and liable to be set aside on the ground that the relationship of Eisenhauer and Wade to the appellants was such that they were disabled from purchasing. As I have before shown, and as the courts below have held, this last position is wholly untenable.\nThe first contention, however, is equally so. Eisenhauer and Wade, having purchased, are entitled to hold the bonds absolutely and are not liable to be redeemed in turn by the railway company. The authorities upon this head are decisive. The cases of Kirkwood v. Thompson[4] and Shaw v. Bunny[5] are conclusive of the question. Of course any surplus of the purchase money which would remain after paying off the bank would, in this view, belong to the railway company. The court below are, therefore, in all respects right upon these points.\nIt was further said that the transaction was ultra vires of the Banking Company. A sufficient answer to this is, however, given by Mr. Justice Ritchie in his judgment at the hearing, an answer which I adopt.\nIt was also made a point by the statement of claim, though it was not argued before this court, that the railway company had no power to borrow and that, therefore, the securities were wholly void. The plain answer to this is that they were authorized by statute to make a mortgage, and issue the bonds in question secured by it, for the very purpose of raising a fund of borrowed capital in order that they might be enabled to complete the construction of the line of railway.\nNo fraud or want of good faith is proved.\nAs regards want of authority in Mr. Bedford to enter into the agreement of the 13th May, 1890, of which the appellants got the benefit, all objection on that score was, as I have said, expressly waived by the learned counsel for the appellants upon the argument at the bar of this court.\nThe appeal must be dismissed, but the judgment to be drawn up must be prefaced with a recital of the waiver by counsel of all objections to the authority of Mr. Bedford to bind the railway company by the agreement of the 13th of May, 1890.\nThe dismissal must, of course, be with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal: The appellants' whole contention seems to be that Eisenhauer and Wade were in the position of trustees and could not become purchasers under the sale by the bank. But they were not mere trustees. Their position is more analogous to that of a second mortgagee. The whole purpose of the transaction was not to create any trust for the benefit of the railway company but to secure, in the first place, the advances made by the bank to Wade, and by Wade to the railway company, and in the second place, after this claim was satisfied, to secure the amounts over and above this amount due to Wade and Eisenhauer and to Wade personally.\nThe original power of attorney of 4th July, 1889, expresses that the bonds are to be held by the Trust Company \"in trust to secure the Halifax Banking Company and the said James D. Eisenhauer and Fletcher B. Wade the payment of the amount of their respective advances.\" This purpose colours the whole transaction and distinguishes it clearly from the case of a trust for the benefit of the railway company. In effect there is no fiduciary relation between Eisenhauer and Wade and the appellant railway company, nor between the respondent Banking Company and the appellant rail way company, and the principle that a trustee for sale cannot purchase the subject matter of the trust for his own advantage has no application in this case.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action instituted in the name of the Nova Scotia Central Railway Company as plaintiffs who in their statement of claim pray for an injunction to restrain the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer from purchasing from the defendants the Halifax Banking Company certain bonds issued by the plaintiff company and pledged to the bank for advances made to the company by the bank and Wade and Eisenhauer respectively, upon the allegation that Wade and Eisenhauer to whom the bank contemplated selling the bonds had, by divers transactions between them and the company since the first advances for which the bonds were pledged as security, become trustees of the said bonds for the sale thereof for the plaintiffs and could not therefore become purchasers thereof, or in the alternative that an account may be taken of what is due by the plaintiffs to the defendants and each of them in respect of which the defendants or any of them are entitled to hold the said bonds as security, and that it may be adjudged and declared that the plaintiffs are entitled to redeem the new bonds upon payment of the amount so found due. And that the proposed sale may be restrained and stayed, &c. The whole merits of the case were entered into upon the motion for the injunction upon the affidavits of one Bedford who deposed as general manager of the plaintiff company, and one Stearn who deposed as president of the company who says nothing in addition to what is stated in Bedford's affidavit in support of the motion, and upon the affidavits of the defendants Wade and Eisenhauer and one Pitcaithly who deposes as cashier of the bank in answer to the motion. The motion for the injunction having been refused the case went down to trial, upon substantially the same evidence as that contained in the affidavits on the motion for injunction, when a verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendants which has been sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. From that judgment the present appeal is taken and the sole question appears to be whether such relationship of trustees for sale as prevented Wade and Eisenhauer becoming purchasers of the bonds which in point of fact were sold by the bank existed between them and the plaintiffs. Apart from this question it must, I think, be conceded that there is no merit whatever in the case to justify an avoidance of the sale in the interest of the plaintiffs. By the deed of the 4th July, 1889, the Halifax Banking Company were made mortgagees of the bonds of the railway company therein mentioned upon trust and as attorneys irrevocable of the railway company, in the event of the latter failing to pay the Banking Company by the 1st January, 1890, and Eisenhauer and Wade their respective advances made by Eisenhauer and Wade through the Banking Company to the railway company upon the discounted paper of Eisenhauer and Wade, to sell the bonds and from the proceeds thereof to pay themselves and to retire any of the said paper of Eisenhauer and Wade then held by the said Banking Company, and then upon trust to pay the said Eisenhauer and Wade any further advances that might have been made by them over and above the amount discounted by the Banking Company and any sums remaining due to them for commissions for making such advances, and upon the further trust to pay any balance remaining from the sale of the bonds to the railway company. By the deed it was agreed and provided that the Banking Company should not be compelled to act in the premises any further than they were willing, from time to time, to do, but that in case they should be required by Eisenhauer and Wade to proceed with the sale of the said bonds for the purpose aforesaid, they should, thereupon, either proceed forthwith to sell the same, in which case they should be entitled to be placed in funds and guaranteed for expenses, or they should forthwith substitute said Eisenhauer and Wade as attorneys irrevocable of them the said railway company, with as full and ample power and authority in the premises as were by the said deed granted and conferred upon the said Banking company. The railway company having made default in the payments by them to be made to the Banking Company, the latter was proceeding to sell the bonds in the month of May, 1890, when to prevent that sale the railway company, through their manager, made a proposition to Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade which was accepted by them whereby, amongst other things, it was agreed that Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade should arrange with the Banking Company to substitute them for the bank as the attorneys irrevocable of the railway company for the sale of the bonds at such price, upon such terms and upon such conditions as in their judgment they might deem best in the interest of all concerned, with power to the said Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade to hypothecate the said bonds until sold, and that in order to carry the then existing loan they should be at liberty to pay any bank a bonus not to exceed $1,000 per month until the bonds should be sold and to charge such sum to the railway company. In pursuance of this agreement and to give effect thereto, Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade negotiated with the Halifax Banking Company to obtain from them time to endeavour to effect sale of the bonds. The bank agreed with them that upon their paying $100,000 to the bank on account of the debt then due the bank, amounting then to $445,683.48, and giving their promissory note for the balance with interest thereon at 7 per cent and also paying the bank a commission of $1,000 per month so long as such balance should remain unpaid, and hypothecating the bonds to the bank as security for the payment of such balance and interest thereon and said commission they would give to the said Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade six months time to pay such balance, during which period Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade should have power to sell the bonds for that purpose, and that the Banking Company would constitute them, the said Eisenhauer and Wade, attorneys irrevocable of the said railway company under the powers in that behalf vested in the bank by the deed of July, 1889. Accordingly Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade paid the bank the said sum of $100,000 and the terms of the above agreement were perfected by two deeds bearing date the 15th of May, 1890, executed by and between Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade and the bank with, as there can be no doubt whatever, the full knowledge and approbation of and for the benefit of the railway company. Now the effect of this arrangement was to deprive the bank of all power to sell the bonds so hypothecated with them for the said period of six months at the expiration of which time, in case default should be made in fulfilment of the terms of the said agreement, their power to sell the bonds to the extent that they had such power under the deed of July, 1889, would revive and be in full force. During the six months it appears by the evidence that Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade did their utmost to procure a sale of the bonds beneficial to the Railway Company in which, however, they failed, not from any default of their own but, I think that it may be fairly said, by reason of their endeavour to meet the views of the company and the impracticability of dealing with the company. The six months, however, expired without a sale having been made and thereupon the right of the bank as mortgagee and pledgee of the bonds accrued, which right the bank gave to the railway company and to Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade notice they intended to exercise. Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade thereupon endeavoured to procure the railway company and the persons composing the company to make a payment on account which might be satisfactory to the bank and to endeavour to get further time for sale of the bonds. This the railway company and the persons composing the company refused to do and there was no alternative left but for the bank to sell the bonds. Under the circumstances above detailed Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade were not in any sense trustees or attorneys of the railway company to effect the sale contemplated by the bank. That sale was conducted by the bank in their own right and in this sale there was nothing, in my opinion, to prevent Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade becoming purchasers in their own right and there is nothing in the evidence offered by the plaintiffs to displace the evidence of the defendants that the sale was as good a sale as could have been made and in fact that a better price was given by Messrs. Eisenhauer and Wade than could have been got from any other persons. The plaintiffs have been repeatedly offered the bonds if they would pay the amount paid for them; this they have always declined to do. The judgment, therefore, of the court below must, in my opinion, be sustained and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Drysdale, Newcombe & McInnes.\nSolicitors for respondent Halifax Banking Company: Russell & Ross.\nSolicitors for respondents Wade and Eisenhauer: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\n[1] 23 N.

Bernardin v. North Dufferin (19 Can. S.C.R. 581) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division[2] in favour of the defendants.\nThis action was for the recovery of the price of a steam fire engine manufactured by the plaintiffs for the defendants, and five hundred feet of fire hose, known as the \u201cWaterous\u201d brand.\nThe defendants are a municipal corporation incorporated under the Municipal Act of the province of Ontario.\nOn the 12th of April, 1890, the defendants passed a resolution in council: \u201cMoved by Deputy\u2011Reeve Freeland, seconded by councillor McLean, that this council recommend the fire and water committee to ask for the lowest price and terms from the Waterous Engine Works Company, the Ronald Company, or any engine offered for sale for fire engine, and report at the next meeting of this council.\u201d\nOn the 19th of May, 1890, the committee reported as follows: \u201cThe Fire and Water Committee beg leave to report that according to instructions we have received communications from the Waterous and Ronald Fire Engine Companies, and would recommend that your committee be empowered to purchase a fire engine and five hundred feet of hose, price not to exceed $2,150.00.\u201d\nThis report was received by the council and adopted.\nIn pursuance of this report a contract was entered into under the corporate seal of the plaintiffs and of the defendants for the construction of a steam fire engine for the defendant corporation. This contract was signed by the mayor and countersigned by the clerk, and the seal of the corporation attached thereto. The contract was also signed by the plaintiff company and the seal of the company affixed thereto.\nFull and particular specifications of this engine were attached to the said contract.\nNo by-law of the defendant corporation was ever passed sanctioning the purchase of a fire engine, or sanctioning the said contract.\nThe plaintiffs proceeded to prepare an engine for the defendants pursuant to this contract and specifications attached thereto.\nBy the terms of this contract the engine and 500 feet of hose was to be delivered free on board the cars at Palmerston on or before the 19th June, 1890.\nThe engine was duly delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendants free on board the cars at Palmerston before the 19th of June, 1890, pursuant to the contract, and was placed in the town hall of the defendant corporation. On the 2nd June, 1890, at a meeting of the council of the defendant corporation, the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants was read, and the committee reported that they had purchased an engine and 500 feet of hose pursuant to the report adopted at the meeting of the council on the 19th of May. The said report was thereupon adopted by the council. It was thereupon moved and carried that McLean, Robbins and Best, three members of the council, should be a committee to engage experts to investigate the working of the engine on the day of the test.\nOn June 19th, 1890, the engine was tested in the presence of the experts appointed by the committee, and on June 20th the experts reported favourably upon the test.\nOn 21st July, 1890, a resolution of the council was passed that all negotiations with the plaintiffs with reference to the fire engine be dropped, and that the plaintiffs be notified to remove the engine from the town hall.\nOn the trial the presiding judge found as a fact that the engine had answered the test and complied with the requirements of the contract, but he held that plaintiffs could not recover for want of a by-law of the council authorizing the purchase, the Municipal Act, R.S.O., (1887) ch. 184, providing by sec. 282, that \u201call the powers of the council shall be exercised by by-law unless otherwise expressly authorized or provided for\u201d and the power to purchase fire apparatus, which is expressly given to a municipal council by section 482 of the act, coming under the said provision. The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge. The plaintiffs appealed to this court. Wilkes Q.C. for the appellants. The contract contains all the requirements of a by-law and should be construed as such.\nA by-law was not necessary. The powers to be exercised under section 282 are legislative powers only.\nThe corporation is estopped from setting up want of a by-law. Agar v. Athen\u0153um Life Assurance Society[3]; Prince of Wales Assurance Company v. Harding[4]; Doe d. Pennington v. Taniere[5]; Bernardin v. North Dufferin[6].\nA.M. Clark for the respondents.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appellants brought this action to recover the price of a fire engine which, as they allege, the respondents contracted to purchase from them. Mr. Justice Rose, before whom the cause was tried, the Divisional Court of Chancery, and the Court of Appeal, have all successively held that the contract was never executed but was wholly executory. In this conclusion I entirely agree. The much debated question as to the liability of a corporation on an executed contract not entered into with the requisite formalities imposed either by common law or by statute does not, therefore, arise here.\nThe question we have to determine is whether the municipal corporation of an incorporated town is liable on a contract for the purchase of a fire engine which has been entered into without the authority of a by-law under seal, and which contract has remained unexecuted.\nBy sec. 480 subsec. 1 of the Municipal Act power is given to a municipal council to purchase or rent for a term of years, or otherwise, fire apparatus of any kind, and fire appliances and appurtenances belonging thereto respectively.\nA fire engine is manifestly an appliance and apparatus within the meaning of this section.\nBy sec. 282 the powers of a municipal council shall be exercised by by-law when not otherwise authorized or provided for, and sec. 288 requires that every by-law shall be under the seal of the corporation and shall be signed by the head of the corporation, or by the person presiding at the meeting at which the by-law has been passed, and by the clerk of the corporation.\nIt requires no demonstration to show that the purchase of a fire engine by a municipal corporation is the exercise of a power conferred upon it by the statute. Then no by-law was ever passed authorizing the purchase of the fire engine in question, although the Fire and Water Committee passed a resolution to that effect. This resolution does not, however, appear to have been followed by a by-law with the formalities of signing and sealing required by the statute.\nUnder the circumstances the result is inevitable that there never was any contract legally binding on the municipality respecting the purchase of this fire engine.\nThe statute of 1890, authorizing the special fund for fire protection purposes, so far from dispensing with a by-law expressly requires one.\nThe only possible escape from the conclusion that there never was a contract would be by holding that the formalities presented by secs. 282 and 288 were not indispensable but merely directory.\nWe cannot, however, do this in the face of such clear and distinct authorities to the contrary as we find in the cases of Young v. Leamington[7] and Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[8], cases which are express decisions on the point that contracts of a municipal corporation are absolutely void, whether executed or executory, unless they comply with all statutory requirements as regards formality of execution, a result which I should have thought clear unless the courts have power to override and dispense with statutory provisions in their discretion. In the cases referred to decisions holding contracts with corporations void for want of statutory formalities were, indeed, unsuccessfully impugned even as regards executed contracts, to which class of contracts, however, this contract does not belong. For further reasons and authorities I refer to my judgment in Bernardin v. North Dufferin[9] which was, it is true, not in accordance with the opinion of the majority of the court in that case, but the contract there was executed. There is nothing, however, in the judgment of the court in that case against applying the principle of Young v. Leamington7 and Hunt v. Wimbledon8 to an executory contract such as the present.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon 12th April, 1890, a resolution was passed by the municipal council of the corporation of the town of Palmerston, in council assembled, that a committee of the council named the fire and water committee should ask for the lowest price and terms from the Waterhouse Engine Works Company, the Ronald Company or any engine offered for sale for fire engine and report at next meeting of council. Upon the 19th of May following the said fire and water committee, in accordance with the above resolution, reported to the council that they had received communications from the Waterous and Ronald Fire Engine Companies, and recommended that they, the committee, should be empowered to purchase a steam fire engine and 500 feet of hose at a price not to exceed $2,150.00. This report was based on a proposition in writing which the committee had, and which was signed by the Waterous Engine Works Company by D.J. Waterous, for building a steam engine and for supplying therewith 500 feet of hose for the municipality. Upon the same 19th of May the above report of the fire and water committee was received and adopted by the council and an entry to that effect was made in the minutes of the proceedings of the council. In pursuance of the adoption by the council of the said report a contract bearing date the same 19th May, under the corporate seal of the said municipality thereto attached, was signed and executed by the mayor of the said municipal corporation and the clerk of the municipality and is in the words following:\u2014\nThis agreement, made this 19th day of May, 1890, by and between the Waterous Engine Works Company, of Brantford, Ont., the party of the first part, and the Corporation of the Town of Palmerston, party of the second part, witnesseth: that the party of the first part agrees to sell to the party of the second part the following fire apparatus, to wit: one No. 2 Waterous steam engine as described in the attached proposal, and 500 feet of 2\u00bd inch cotton rubber lined fire hose known as the \u201cWaterous\u201d brand, all to be in accordance with the specifications and guarantees set forth in the proposal of the party of the first part hereunto annexed and dated this 19th day of May, 1890, the same to be delivered free on board cars at Palmerston on or before the 19th day of June, 1890. The party of the second part agrees to purchase and pay for the aforesaid property delivered as aforesaid, the sum of twenty-one hundred and fifty dollars to be paid in manner following, that is to say: the above amount, viz.: twenty-one hundred and fifty dollars in sixty days from date of delivery. It is further agreed that the parties of the second part will not hold the parties of the first part responsible for delay in delivering the apparatus, such delay being occasioned by fire or other causes unforeseen that could not be prevented by reasonable diligence. In witness whereof the said party of the first part has caused these presents to be executed by David J. Waterous, its duly authorized agent for that purpose, and the party of the second part has caused its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed attested by its mayor, R. Johnston, the day and year first above written.\nRICHARD JOHNSTON, Mayor,\nChairman of Committee. Seal of Town of Palmerston.\nE.A. DUMAS, Clerk.\nWATEROUS ENGINE WORKS CO., L\u2019D., Seal of Waterous Engine Works Co., Ltd.\nPer DAVID J. WATEROUS,\nGeneral Manager,\nAt the next meeting of the council, namely, on the 2nd June, 1890, the Fire and Water Committee reported that they had purchased a fire engine and five hundred feet of hose from the Waterous Engine Works Company, as per report adopted at the last meeting of council. At this meeting the contract so entered into between the Waterous Engine Works Company and the town of Palmerston was read in council; and the said report of the Fire and Water Committee was read a second time and thereupon a committee of three members of the council was appointed to engage experts to investigate the working of the engine on the day of the test, and entries to the above effect respectively were made in the minutes of the council. The engine with the 500 feet of hose was duly forwarded and delivered free on board the cars at Palmerston within the time specified in the contract for that purpose and delivered to the officers of the corporation to be subjected to the test specified in the proposal attached to the contract, and upon the 19th June, 1890, the engine was subjected by the authorities of the corporation to such test in the presence of experts appointed by the committee of council for that purpose who, upon the next day, reported that the engine fully came up to the specifications of the contract with the exception as to the time taken to get up steam and throw water, which was eleven and one-half minutes; the contract specified ten minutes as the limit. But the experts reported that this could be partly accounted for by the fact that 600 feet of hose were attached, whereas the contract specified only 100 feet. Upon this point the learned judge who tried the case found as a fact that the engine did answer the test, and did fully comply with the contract and was capable of getting up steam and throwing water within the ten minutes specified as limit. Upon the close of the test to which the engine was submitted it was taken to and left in the engine house belonging to the municipality where it has ever since remained, and still is, but on the 21st of July, 1890, the council passed a resolution to the effect that all negotiations with reference to the fire engine with the plaintiffs be dropped, or at least,\nso far as this council can legally do so, and that they be notified to remove the engine from the town hall and further that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Waterous Engine Works Company properly attested with the signature of the mayor and clerk and the corporation seal attached thereto.\nA copy of this resolution was received by the plaintiffs on or about the 6th August, but they, instead of complying with the notification therein to remove the engine from the premises of the municipality where it had been ever since the 19th June, commenced this action on the 6th September, 1890.\nNow it cannot be, and has not been, contended that this contract so executed by and under the direction and authority of the governing body of the corporation was not executed in such a manner as to make it a valid contract binding on the corporation unless there be some provisions in the Municipal Institutions Act of Ontario which invalidates it; but it is contended that there is a clause in the Municipal Act, ch. 184 R.S.O. of 1887, which renders it wholly null, void and ultra vires. The section referred to is that numbered 282 of said ch. 184 which is identical with sec. 186 of 22 Vic. ch. 99, an act passed on the 16th day of August, 1858, when it was first introduced; which act is incorporated in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada as ch. 54. The section is as follows:\u2014\nThe jurisdiction of every council shall be confined to the municipality the council represents except where authority beyond the same is expressly given; and the powers of the council shall be exercised by by-law when not otherwise authorized or provided for.\nThe contention is that this last sentence covers contracts made by the corporation, the power to make which, it is contended, can be exercised by by-law only.\nThe question thus raised is certainly a very grave one for if the contention be maintained it wholly, as it appears to me, revolutionizes the law as heretofore understood and administered for thirty-four years for then no contract whatever entered into by and with the corporation, even though under the corporate seal, and however trifling or necessary might be the subject of such contract, namely, whether it be for executing absolutely necessary repairs in a highway or sidewalk or for the purchase of fuel or other necessary articles for the use of the officers of the municipality in the discharge of their duties in their offices or elsewhere, or for the employment of menial officers or day labourers, or, inshort, for anything whatever, could have any validity whatever unless, in the words of the section, the power of the council to enter into the contract should \u201cbe exercised by by-law\u201d and further, the corporation could never be made liable for any work whatever, whether contracted for orally or under the seal of the municipality, though set thereto by direction of the council, and although the work had been executed and the corporation had had and received the full benefit and enjoyment thereof, unless the power of the council to enter into such contract should \u201cbe exercised by by-law,\u201d for this is the principle involved in Hunt v. Wimbledon[10], affirmed irrevocably to be law by the House of Lords in Young & Co. v. Leamington[11] Where a statute requires a contract, in order to its being binding upon a corporation, to be entered into in a particular manner it cannot be entered into validly otherwise than as prescribed by the statute. There can not be recognized any judicial exception from a statutory obligation, so that in the case of municipal corporations not only the doctrine which, after much judicial contention, had become firmly established, to the effect that corporations may be held liable upon oral contracts which have been executed, and of which the corporation had had full benefit and enjoyment, must be expunged from the jurisprudence of the province of Ontario, but contracts also entered into under the common seal of the municipality must be pronounced to have no validity whatever unless the municipal corporation in entering into the contract exercised their power to do so by by-law. The principle upon which the cases that affirm as against corporations the validity of oral executed contracts of which the corporations have received the benefit proceed is that it is competent for the courts to recognize such cases as constituting an exception from the common law rule that corporations can contract only under their common seal, but no such exception can be made from a statutory provision which prescribes a particular mode for corporations to enter into valid contracts. Young & Co. v. Leamington11 is conclusive authority that such a provision is mandatory and not directory and cannot be dispensed with by any court. If, therefore, the contention of the defendants be well founded there can be no contract whatever which shall be binding upon a municipal corporation entered into by the corporation whether orally or under the corporate seal unless by force of a by-law for that purpose first passed. No such construction of the clause in question appears to have been entertained when the clause was first introduced into the act of 1858. In Perry v. The Corporation of Ottawa[12] an engineer sued the corporation for the value of services rendered by him in making survey estimates and plans, &c., of the necessary expenditure for supplying the city with water, under the following circumstances: In 1860 a committee of the council of the corporation had reported to the council making certain recommendations, among others that the same or some other committee should be appointed with power, among other things, to treat with and recommend to the council an engineer to make the requisite survey, plan and estimates of the intended expenditure for supplying the city with water, for applying to Government to grant a site for a reservoir and water power and generally to superintend the matter. This report was adopted and a committee appointed in June, 1860. In August, 1861, an alderman named Skead being in Quebec wrote to urge the plaintiff to come to that city to assist in pressing for the site for the proposed reservoir and an alderman named Goodwin was a witness at the trial and stated that he was a member of the waterworks committee and acted as chairman and that they (the committee) employed the plaintiff to make plans of the hill and of the reservoir proposed to be constructed on it, to be laid before the Commissioner of Public Works. This witness told the plaintiff to go to Quebec. A Mr. Boucher, chairman of the street committee in 1861, proved that by the authority of that committee he employed the plaintiff to make a copy of a certain plan which was in the registry office, which the plaintiff made but was not paid for. The plaintiff also proved a report prepared by him for the water works committee which they submitted to the council of the corporation with their own report, and he proved the value of those services. For the defendants it was contended that the plaintiff could not recover as the contracts in respect of which the plaintiff brought his action were not executed under the corporate seal of the municipality. But Draper C.J. held that the court, notwithstanding the passing of the Municipal Act of 1858 which contained the clause now under consideration, was bound by the judgment in Pim v. The County of Ontario[13], and Hagarty J. was of the opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for his plans and reports simply on the ground that he was employed to make them by a duly appointed committee of the council which committee reported what had been done by them and by the plaintiff under their orders, and the council by resolution adopted the action of the committee; as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for services in going to Quebec rendered under the direction of the chairman of the committee he doubted, but finally concurred as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for these services also for the reason that in the report of the committee which was adopted by the council in October it appeared that the chairman of the committee and the plaintiff had interviews with the commissioner of crown lands on 17th September, so that the council when adopting the report must have known that those interviews took place at Quebec, and not at Ottawa. Now, if the clause under consideration includes within its purview contracts made by the corporation, it comprehended the contract made with Perry and upon which he recovered in that action, equally as it does the contract entered into with the plaintiff in the present action, yet it never occurred to any one to contend that the contract with Perry was null, void and ultra vires because the municipal council of the city of Ottawa had not first passed a by-law for the purpose of giving itself authority to enter into the contract. Again, in Broughton v. The Corporation of the Town of Brantford[14], it was held by Hagarty C.J. in 1869 that the plaintiff, under and in virtue of a contract entered into with him by the corporation under their corporate seal for the performance of certain services to be rendered to the corporation by him at a salary of $900.00 per annum, was entitled under the contract contained in the instrument executed under the corporate seal to maintain an action against the corporation for wrongful dismissal. Hagarty C.J. giving the judgment of the court said that he considered the plaintiff up to the date of his dismissal held his office \u201cunder and upon the terms of his original appointment.\u201d\nWe find, he says, a report of a committee of council to the whole body in December, 1865, recommending plaintiff\u2019s appointment at this salary ($900.00 per annum.) We also find a resolution of the council authorizing the mayor to execute the bonds between plaintiff and the town.\nAnd upon this the plaintiff was held entitled to recover against the corporation for a wrongful breach of their contract so made with him. Now, here again if the clause under consideration has the effect now contended for it cannot, I think, be doubted that it applied to the contract in that case equally as it does to the contract in the present case.\nThen, in the case of Brown v. The Town of Belleville[15], it appeared that on the 6th May, 1868, a report of a committee of the town council was made to the council which stated that the committee had put themselves in communication with one Alexander Brown, who owned a steam dredge, which was then in the state of New York, and which he had consented to loan to the corporation to use for dredging the harbour, and also to build a scow to receive the dredge when it should arrive, on condition that the corporation would pay the cost of transport to Belleville and pay him for the use of the dredge a sum not exceeding ten per cent per annum on the actual cash value of the dredge and the scow, while the same were employed by the corporation; the corporation to keep the machinery in good order and to return the dredge in good condition, ordinary wear and tear alone excepted; the agreement to be subject to a vote of the people to raise funds for dredging the harbour, and all expenses connected therewith, and that the committee considered the offer a very favourable one and recommended the same for acceptance by the council.\nThis report of the committee was adopted by the council in due form by resolution. After the adoption of the report the chairman of the committee saw Mr. Brown, the plaintiff in the action. The clause in the report that the agreement should be subject to a vote of the people authorizing funds to be raised for dredging the harbour was introduced into the report when it was before the council and before the resolution was passed adopting the report. For this reason the chairman of the committee drew the attention of the plaintiff to the clause and to the risk he ran of the by-law for raising the funds not passing, but assured him he thought it would pass. Finally the chairman concluded the arrangement with the plaintiff and told him to bring the dredge, which the plaintiff thereupon sent for and had it brought to Belleville. The action was for the expense of bringing it, viz., $373.50. The defendants never used the dredge for the reason that after the above arrangement between the chairman of the committee and the plaintiff was made and entered into, and on the 17th June, 1868, the committee again reported that they had under consideration the cheapest and best mode of carrying out the work of dredging the harbour, and had consulted persons of experience and had recommendations as to the propriety of letting the same out by contract at so much a cubic yard or at a round sum for the whole work, and that the committee was not prepared to recommend the conclusion of any negotiations until the by-law for raising the money for the work was confirmed and finally passed. At this time a by-law for raising the money was provisionally passed and advertised for taking the votes of the people thereon, which were taken on the 6th July, and although it went through the form of being passed by the council on the 15th July, upon which day the committee again reported to the council that they had unanimously decided that it was desirable that the work of dredging the harbour should be let out by contract at a certain sum per cubic yard measured on the scow after the same had been excavated, the work to be executed as the committee might, from time to time, direct, duly reporting to the council as the work progressed; and the committee desired to be authorized to advertise for tenders for the work, requiring those who tendered to state at what price per cubic yard they would perform such work, providing the dredge, scow and all necessary apparatus. This report was in due form adopted by the council. The committee in the meantime had seen a plan of dredge which it was thought would be better for working in saw-dust than the plaintiff\u2019s, and they finally decided to let the contract for dredging the har- bour to a Mr. Hayden, who used the new style of dredge, and a contract under seal of the corporation was entered into with Hayden. In the meantime the plaintiff\u2019s dredge had been brought to Belleville but it was never used by the contractor. The by-law which had been submitted to the vote of the people on the 6th July proved to be defective and a new by-law for raising the necessary funds for drainage of the harbour was introduced into the council and passed in the month of December following. The plaintiff brought his action for the recovery of $373.50 the expense of bringing his dredge to Belleville under the contract for that purpose entered into with him by the chairman of the committee of council. The defence was that the corporation had never used the dredge, had never received it from the plaintiff and that they were not liable as there was no contract made with the plaintiff by the defendants under their corporate seal. Now, here again it is to be observed that there was no by-law passed by the council authorizing the committee or their chairman to enter into any contract with the plaintiff. The plaintiff had done what he had undertaken to do under his contract although the defendants never had received the dredge or intermeddled with it; and he was held to be entitled to recover notwithstanding. The terms in which the judgment of the court was delivered by Richards C.J. impress my mind with the conviction that the defendants would have been held liable in damages for breach of their agreement in not employing the plaintiff and using his dredge if an instrument under the corporate seal had been executed embodying the terms of the agreement as expressed in the plaintiff\u2019s proposal reported by the committee to the council notwithstanding that there had been no by-law authorizing the contract to be entered into. The learned Chief Justice says, delivering the judgment of the court:\u2014\nThe plaintiff was the owner of a dredge which was then in the United States, the committee persuaded him to offer to send for it and to let them have it on certain terms, the first stipulation in the agreement being that he should send for the dredge and bring it to Belleville, doubtless that there might be no delay in the matter.\nAgain:\nThe committee report the offer to the council, say they consider it very favourable and recommend the same for acceptance to the council. The council adopt the report of the committee, and the chairman informs the plaintiff of it and persuades him to send for the dredge at once which he does and expends money to the extent of over $300 in bringing it to Belleville. In the meantime the committee think a more favourable arrangement can be made for the interest of the town and, after the arrival of the dredge, advertise for proposals to do the dredging, the committee furnishing the dredge and all implements, etc., etc. They do not carry out the arrangement to use the plaintiff\u2019s dredge, and finally decline paying pay him the money he has expended in good faith in carrying out the arrangement entered into with their express approval.\nAgain:\nThere may be some nice distinctions drawn between this case and some of the decided cases, but we think the law now has gone so far that when a contract has been entered into by the express direction of the corporation and has been performed by the party and the corporation has received the advantage of it, the corporation cannot set up as a defence that the contract was not under seal, always assuming, of course, that what was contracted for was a matter within the scope and powers of the corporation to contract for. Now, here the plaintiff did bring his dredge to Belleville to be used by the defendants.\nNow these cases, as already observed, must have been all ill decided if the contention of the defendants in the present case be correct. But that the construction contended for by the defendants is not a sound construction of the section, I think the fact that it was not suggested in any of the above cases, nor so far as I have seen since the passing of the clause in the act of 1858 until very recently, is strong evidence of a common consensus of opinion that it is not, and I am of opinion that the clause is not open to the construction contended for.\nThe clause is found inserted under the head or title \u201cgeneral jurisdiction of councils;\u201d so associated the words \u201cpowers of the councils\u201d in the section appear to me to refer naturally and reasonably to the governing legislative powers of the councils in the matters over which jurisdiction or legislative authority is vested in them by the Municipal Act, which powers are to be found in part 7 of the act under the title \u201cpowers of municipal councils\u201d and nothing there is said as to the mode of entering into contracts. The section under consideration therefore has not, in my opinion, any reference to the mode in which contracts shall be entered into by municipal councils; that is a matter provided for by the common law, namely, by a contract inter partes, executed under the corporate seal by authority of the governing body. This is a matter, more properly speaking an executive power of the corporation, incidental to its incorporation, whereas \u201cthe powers of the councils\u201d referred to in sec. 282 appear to me to be those governing or legislative powers conferred upon the municipal councils by the Municipal Act itself.\nThe contention of the defendants has two aspects, namely, that the section either imperatively requires that a contract to be entered into by a municipal corporation with an individual must be entered into by a by-law, that is to say by an instrument to which by reason of its nature the person with whom the contract is to be entered into cannot by possibility be a party, or else that the corporation can by a by-law give to itself a power to contract which before it had not.\nAs to the first of these propositions I confess to being unable to appreciate what is meant by the expres- sion, \u201centering into a contract by by-law.\u201d I cannot understand how an agreement between a corporation and an individual can be entered into by an instrument to which such individual can not by possibility be a party, nor can I understand the sense of construing the section as enacting that a municipal corporation can confer upon itself a power, which before it had not, of entering into a contract. Up to the present time it has not been so construed by the courts. Of course, if it be necessary for the corporation to raise money by a rate to pay for the thing contracted for by a municipal corporation that must be done by the exercise by the council of their legislative power, that is to say, by a by-law, but such a by-law might be passed as well after as before the execution of the contract, and if the corporation had funds to pay for the thing contracted for without imposing a rate to pay for it such a by-law would be unnecessary. Now, it sufficiently appears in evidence, I think, that the defendants at one time had control of funds sufficient to have enabled them to pay for the engine built for them by the plaintiffs which funds, however, they seem to have misapplied to other purposes under circumstances, however, which make them responsible to replace the funds so misapplied; but whether the corporation had funds or not when the contract was signed, or would be in funds to pay for the thing contracted for in the terms of the contract when it should be fulfilled by the plaintiffs, does not raise a point affecting the validity of a contract entered into under the corporate seal in respect of a matter for which they had power to contract. Unless, therefore, all contracts of whatsoever nature, and how much soever they may be within the purposes for which the municipal corporation is incorporated, are absolutely null and void unless they are entered into under or in virtue of a by-law first passed for the purpose by the municipal council the contract made with the plaintiffs under the corporate seal of the defendants cannot be pronounced to be void. That the corporation had power to enter into that contract is, I think, placed beyond doubt by section 480 of said chapter 184. What greater power the corporation could obtain by a by-law passed by the council than that conferred on them by the legislature by that section I am unable to see. It is argued, however, that this section 480 is limited by the section 282 construed as the defendants construe it. I have already stated my reasons for thinking the section 282 not open to the construction put upon it by the defendants; but the difference between the language of that section and of the sections 479 and 489 and all other sections relating to the exercise of legislative powers seems to show that the legislature intended by section 480 to confer the right to contract in respect of the matters therein mentioned in the ordinary manner; that is to say, that they recognized the distinction between what I think may be properly called an executive power from a legislative power. By section 479 it is said: \u201cThe council, etc., may pass by-laws for, etc.\u201d In section 480: \u201cEvery municipal council shall have power to contract for, etc.\u201d And again by section 489 and all other sections relating to legislative power: \u201cThe council, etc, etc., may pass by-laws for, etc.\u201d So that, as I have already said, the words \u201cpowers of the council\u201d in section 282 appear to me to refer solely to the governing or legislative powers vested in the jurisdiction of the council by the Municipal Act, and do not at all refer to the power of entering into contracts, the mode of exercising which is prescribed by the common law to be by an instrument inter partes under the corporate seal, which power is a common law incident to the corporation as a corporate body, and is, more properly speaking, an executive than a legislative power. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the contract entered into with the plaintiffs under the corporate seal of the defendants set to the contract by the authority of the governing body, the council, and being for a matter for which the corporation had power to contract, is a good and valid contract, and as its terms have been fulfilled by the plaintiffs they are entitled to have judgment for the full amount. Indeed, upon the authority of Brown v. Belleville,[16] everything appears to me to have been done to give the defendants the benefit of the contract, and to have entitled the plaintiffs to have recovered as upon an executed contract of which the defendants had received the benefit if the contract had been an oral one and not under seal, for the plaintiffs delivered the engine which they had built for the defendants to them at Palmerston free on board; the defendants received the engine and subjected it to the test agreed upon, which the learned judge has found that the engine answered; and after subjecting it to the test the defendants took it and kept it in their engine house (where it still is) although the defendants, upon the 6th August, or thereabouts, communicated to the plaintiffs a resolution of council which substantially was to the effect that they repudiated the contract which they had procured the plaintiffs to enter into and which they had fulfilled.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I do not think that any sufficient reason has been shown for holding that the judgment of the Ontario courts has misinterpreted the Municipal Institutions Act of that province[17]. The general doctrine touching the mode in which a corporation can be bound by contract is not really in question. We have to deal with two distinct bodies. One is the corporation, which consists of all the inhabitants of the municipality, and the other is the council which is not a corporation.\nBy section 8 the powers of the corporation are to be exercised by the council.\nBy section 282 the powers of the council are to be exercised by by-law.\nWhat is the full scope and extent of this word \u201cpowers,\u201d and whether it includes all the administrative functions of the council which necessarily embrace the most trivial details of every day affairs as well as more important matters, need not now be discussed. It may be that the discussion of that question, when there arises a necessity for discussing it, may develop some difficulties in working the law in strict obedience to the letter of it, and may throw doubt on the wisdom of maintaining an enactment so sweeping and so imperative.\nThe English Public Health Acts of 1848 and 1875 have very stringent provisions respecting contracts by local boards of health, requiring them always to be under seal. These statutes were the subject of decision in Frend v. Dennett[18]; Hunt v. Wimbleton Local Board[19], and Young v. Mayor and Corporation of Royal Leamington Spa[20], and were construed so strictly as to apply even to executed contracts. I had occasion to refer particularly to those cases in Bernardin v. North Dufferin[21] But those English statutes did not apply to contracts in small and every day matters. In the act of 1848 the rule was confined to contracts whereof the amount or value should exceed \u00a310. That amount was probably found to be so small as to be too restrictive, and in the act of 1875 it was increased to \u00a350. It may possibly be found expedient to modify section 282, or, as the Manitoba legislature has done, omit it altogether.\nThere is nothing necessarily incongruous in requiring the two things which, it is argued, cannot both be necessary, viz., the contract under seal and the by-law which must also be authenticated by a seal.\nThe contract is the contract of the corporation. By what authority is the common seal of the corporation affixed to that contract? It must be by the action of the council, and section 282 requires that the resolution of the council shall be evidenced by by-law. The by-law is the by\u2011law of the council not of the corporation. The decision to purchase the fire engine was a matter of sufficient importance to deserve whatever amount of deliberation and care the law aims at securing by requiring the action of the council to take the form of a by-law.\nI do not take the first subsection of section 480 of the Municipal Institutions Act to imply any departure from the general rule in making contracts of this kind. It gives power to a council to purchase fire apparatus, &c., and subsection 2 speaks, at the same time, of the powers of a municipal corporation for lighting, &c. The powers under both subsections must be exercised by the council and, as I understand it, in accordance with the rule of section 282.\nThe argument from the alleged acts of the mayor or the council, which are relied on as amounting to an acceptance of the engine, does not seem to me to advance the appellants\u2019 case. It strikes me as being the same discussion of section 282 in a slightly different form.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Hardy, Wilkes & Hardy.\nSolicitor for respondents: Alister M.

Were machinery and build of mill good as regards safety of workmen? No.\n2. Were chock blocks sufficient? No.\n3. (a) Was slant of rollway dangerous, (b) or did it require sufficient blocks to render it safe ? Yes to both.\n4. What was the inducing cause or causes of accident, having regard to slant, chock blocks, and alleged negligence? Slant of rollway and defective chock blocks were inducing causes.\n5. Could the plaintiff by the exercise of such care and skill as he was bound to exercise have avoided the injury, having regard to the proper discharge of his duties as chainman ? No.\n6. Did plaintiff complain of the chock blocks to the person or persons who appeared to be the authorized person or persons to whom he should complain? Yes.\n7. Did plaintiff know of slant? No.\n8. Did Burns promise to make chock blocks good? Yes.\n9. What was Burns's position and authority in the mill? Millwright in charge of machinery.\n10. (a) Apart from machinery, were discipline and management of mill good, (b) and was want (if any) of such an inducing cause of accident? (a.) No. (b.) Yes.\n11. Was plaintiff aware of the state of the chock blocks? Yes.\n12. Were defendants, or either of them, cognizant of defect in chock block? No.\n13. If they were not cognizant ought they, or either of them, to have been so? Yes; as manager and foreman the defendant, Mr. Webster, should have taken cognizance of this matter.\n14. Did they exercise due care as to rollway and blocks being in a safe and proper condition? In his capacity of manager and foreman, the defendant, Mr. Webster, appears not to have exercised due care as to rollway and blocks.\n15. If the rollway and blocks were defective, was it by reason of the personal negligence of the defendants, or either of them, or did they, or either of them know it? The defective conditions of the rollway and blocks appears to have been due to personal negligence on the part of one of the defendants, Mr. Webster, in his capacity of manager and foreman.\nJudgment was reserved by the trial judge and the plaintiff afterwards moved for judgment in accordance with the findings and the defendant moved for a nonsuit and for the findings as to the amount of damages and negligence to be set aside. Plaintiff's motion was granted and judgment entered for him with $5,000\u2014damages as found by the jury. The full court affirmed this judgment and the defendants appealed to this court.\nCassidy for the appellants. There was no evidence of negligence for the jury; if there was it was not negligence of the defendants but that of fellow workmen of the plaintiff.\nUp to 1868 the law governing the liability of a master to his servants was that with regard to defects, &c., in machinery and materials the master was bound to use personal diligence and could not protect himself by any delegation of authority. See Priestley v. Fowler[2] and subsequent cases. In 1868 the law was altered by the decision of the House of Lords in Wilson v. Merry[3] which necessitated the passing of The Employers' Liability Act.\nThe use by an employer of dangerous machinery is not in itself wrongful. Dynen v. Leach[4].\nThe following cases in Ontario on this subject were decided before the passing of The Employers' Liability Act. Jarvis v. May.[5]; Plant v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[6]; Rudd v. Bell[7]; Miller v Reid[8].\nIn Hamilton v. Groesbeck[9] the decision was in favour of the employer even under the act.\nThe following cases also were referred to on the general question of liability : Matthews v. Hamilton Powder Co.[10] ; Ross v. Cross[11] ; Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Jackson[12]. In Rajotte v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[13] which was a common law action similar to the present, the authorities are all collected.\nThe jury found that the defendants did not know that rollers were unsafe but that they ought to have known it. That was an improper finding in the present state of the law. Wilson v. Merry [14]. The employer is only bound to have competent persons to exercise his authority and if there is such a person his competency will be presumed and the onus is on plaintiff to disprove it. See Rajotte v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[15] and cases there collected, and the late case of Hedley v. The Pinkney S.S. Co.[16].\nThe court improperly held that they had no jurisdiction to grant a new trial. Even if this was so this court could grant it. Supreme Court Act sec. 61.\nEwart Q.C. for the respondent. This appeal is against the findings of the jury as well as the judgment. As to the former the defendants are precluded by the statute which requires notice to be given within eight days which was not done. R.S.B.C. ch. 31 secs. 60, 61 and 67. Davies v. Felix [17].\nThe master was bound to exercise due care to have his machinery in proper condition. Smith v. Baker [18].\nThe jury found that defendant Webster knew of the defective condition of the roadway and his negligence is binding on his partners. Dublin and Wicklow Railway Co. v. Slattery[19].\nThe learned counsel also referred to Weems v. Mathieson[20] ; Black v. Ontario Wheel Co.[21]; Smith on Master and Servant [22]. STRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal may be disposed of on a very short ground.\nThere was ample evidence for the consideration of the jury that the \"rolling and chock blocks\" were in a dangerous condition. There is, therefore, no ground for displacing the finding of the jury in favour of the plaintiff on this head. There being no evidence of contributory negligence the only question was, it seems to me, one of law, that which was principally insisted upon by the appellant's counsel, namely, whether or not it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that the appellants had notice of the dangerous nature of the \" rolling and chock blocks \" at which he had to work.\nThis question may be answered in the negative on the very high authority of Lord Watson in the late case of Smith v. Baker & Sons[23]. The whole law applicable to the present case is covered by two paragraphs in this opinion of Lord Watson. His Lordship says:\u2014\nIt does not appear to me to admit of dispute that, at common law, a master who employs a servant in work of a dangerous character is bound to take all reasonable precautions for the workman's safety. The rule has been so often laid down in this house by Lord Cranworth, and other noble and learned Lords, that it is needless to quote authorities in support of it. But, as I understand the law, it was also held by this house, long before the passing of the Employers' Liability Act[24], that a master is no less responsible to his workmen for personal injuries occasioned by a defective system of using machinery than for injuries caused by a defect in the machinery itself. In Sword v. Cameron[25] the First Division of the Court of Session found a master liable in damages to a quarryman in his employment who was injured by the firing of a blast before he had time to reach a place of shelter, although it was proved that the shot was fired in accordance with the usual and inveterate practice of the quarry. That case was cited in Bartonshill Coal Company v. Reid[26] in support of the proposition that the doctrine of collaborateur was unknown to the law of Scotland; but Lord Cranworth pointed out that the decision did not turn upon the negligence of the fellow-workman who fired the shot, and expressly stated that it was justifiable, on the ground that \" the injury was evidently the result of a defective system not adequately protecting the workmen at the time of the explosion.\" The Lord Chancellor (Chelmsford) expressed the same view in Bartonshill Coal Company v. McGuire[27]. The judgment of Lord Wensleydale in Weems v. Mathieson[28] clearly shews that the noble and learned Lord was also of the opinion that a master, is responsible in point of law not only for a defection his part in providing good and sufficient apparatus, but also for his failure to see that the apparatus is properly used.\nAnd at page 355 Lord Watson pointed out that at common law notice to the employer of the unsafe state or the unsafe working of appliances or apparatus was not required, and that he was bound at his peril to make proper provision in these respects, but that the Employers' Liability Act had, in this respect, altered the law in favour of the employer by requiring that the workman should give information of the dangerous or defective state of the appliances.\nThe language of Lord Watson as to this point is as follows :\u2014\nIt is material to notice that the Employers' Liability Act, under which the present action was brought, by sec. 2 subsec. 3, provides that a workman shall have no right to compensation for injuries caused by reason of any defect or negligence which is specified in sec. 1 in any case where he knew of the defect or negligence which caused his injury, and failed within a reasonable time to give information thereof to the employer or some person superior to himself in the service of the employer, unless he was aware that the employer or such superior already knew of the said defect or negligence. I think the object and effect of the enactment is to relieve the employer of liability for injuries occasioned by defects which were neither known to him nor to his delegates down to the time when the injury was done. At common law his ignorance would not have barred the workman's claim, as he was bound to see that his machinery and works were free from defect, and so far the provision operates in favour of the employer; but, as was pointed out by Lord Esher in Thomas v. Quartermaine[29] in cases where the employer and his deputies were personally ignorant of the defect it is made a condition precedent of the workman's right to recover that he should have given them information of it before he was injured.\nThis is conclusive upon the point made by the appellant's counsel that the appellants had no notice or knowledge of the dangerous character of the rolling and chock blocks, and of the risk of injury incurred in working them, and this was the only material point argued before us.\nThere was, therefore, no ground for a new trial, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I should have preferred to send this case down for a new trial for the elucidation of some facts which do not appear to me to have been sufficiently brought out at the former trial, but as my learned brothers are unanimous in a contrary opinion I do not dissent from their judgment.\nPATTERSON J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants : A.

The jury may be asked to find on the facts from which reasonable and probable cause may be inferred but the inference must be drawn by the judge. Lister v. Ferryman (L.R. 4 H.L. 521) followed; Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Co. (11 Q.B.D. 79, 440; 11 App. Cas. 247) considered.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court by which a non-suit at the trial was set aside and a new trial granted.\nThe defendant is inspector of police for the city of Toronto who caused plaintiffs to be arrested on a charge of keeping a house of ill-fame. The information was laid by a woman named Dale who had boarded with the plaintiffs for a time and plaintiffs claimed that she did so with a view of regaining possession of her trunks which had been held by plaintiffs for payment of her bill for board. The case was tried three times, resulting each time in a non-suit which was afterwards set aside and a new trial ordered. From the last order defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the judges of that court being equally divided the order stood confirmed. Defendant then appealed to this court. The principal question raised on the appeal is whether or not the trial judge should have submitted to the jury questions as to the defendant\u2019s belief in the truth of the information and as to whether or not he had made proper inquiries before causing the warrant to issue.\nMacLaren Q.C. for the appellant. The question of want of reasonable and probable cause is for the court alone, and there were no facts in dispute on which the jury should have passed. See Lister v. Ferryman[1]; Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Company[2]; Brown v. Hawkes[3].\nTytler for the respondents cited Hamilton v. Cousineau[4] and authorities there collected by Hagarty C.J.O.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an action for malicious prosecution brought by the respondents against the appellant for having caused their prosecution and arrest on a warrant issued by the police magistrate of the city of Toronto, on the information of the appellant, on a charge of keeping a house of ill-fame. The charge was founded on the information of one Alice Dale, who had been an inmate of the respondents\u2019 house, and who, on the 11th of October, 1889, furnished to the appellant, who is staff inspector in the Toronto police force, and as such specially charged with the suppression of houses of ill-fame, a statement in writing signed by him in the following words:\u2014\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT, Toronto, Oct. 11th, 1889.\nMrs. John Dale, at present rooming on Victoria Street, between Queen and Shuter, west side, with a woman who takes in washing, \u201cLaundry\u201d over door, vs. Mrs. McLaren, of 292 Adelaide Street West, with whom she (Mrs. Dale) has been rooming for about five weeks, from 2nd September to 8th October, keeping an house of assignation, allowing, and, in fact, soliciting, the complainant to bring men into the house and pay her fifty cents for use of room with each man. This she (Mrs. Dale) did on several occasions, giving Mrs. McLaren fifty cents each time; in addition to this, Mrs. McLaren made arrangements with Mrs. Dale to go with another man, from whom she received twenty dollars on four different occasions, and gave Mrs. McLaren five dollars on three different occasions; and on Mrs. Dale refusing to give the five dollars on the fourth occasion, she was ordered by Mrs. McLaren to pack up and leave the house; and she now refuses to give up Mrs. Dale\u2019s two trunks.\nI have had the foregoing read over to me by Staff Inspector Archibald, and I subscribe to it as being correct.\n(Signed) ALICE DALE.\nUpon this information received from Alice Dale the respondent laid and swore to the following information and complaint:\u2014\nCANADA, Province of Ontario, County of York, City of Toronto, To Wit:\nThe information and complaint of David Archibald, of the City of Toronto, staff inspector, taken on oath before me, George Taylor Denison, Esquire, police magistrate in and for the said city, the fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine.\nThe said informant, upon his oath, saith he is informed and believes that Mr. and Mrs. Duncan and Margaret McLaren within the past three months, to wit: on the fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine, and on divers other days and times between that day and the day of the laying of this information, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did keep a certain house of ill-fame at 292 Adelaide Street West, in the said City of Toronto, contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided.\nComplainant prays that a warrant may issue, and justice be done in the premises.\n(Signed) D. ARCHIBALD.\nSworn before me, this fourteenth day of October, 1889.\n(Sgd.) G.T. DENISON, P.M.\nThe prisoners plead not guilty.\nDischarged.\n(Sgd.) G.T. DENISON, P.M. The respondents having been arrested on the warrant issued on this complaint the charge was heard before the police magistrate and by him dismissed.\nSubsequently to the laying of the information and before the hearing of the case the appellant was informed by another inspector of the Toronto force\u2014Inspector Johnston\u2014that he did not think there was much in Alice Dale\u2019s charge, and also what he had learned upon a visit to the house, viz., that disturbances which had occurred there and which had called for the interference of police had been occasioned by quarrels between the respondents themselves. It is, however, distinctly proven that this ultimate report from Inspector Johnston was made after the information had been sworn to.\nThe action was first tried before Mr. Justice Street, who gave judgment dismissing the action. This judgment was set aside by the Common Pleas Division and a new trial was ordered. The second trial took place before Mr. Justice McMahon, who again non-suited the plaintiffs. This second judgment having been also set aside by the Common Pleas Division, a third trial was had before the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, at the Toronto autumn assizes of 1890, who held that the plaintiffs had failed to prove a want of reasonable and probable cause, and dismissed the action. From this judgment the respondents again appealed to the Common Pleas Division who ordered a third new trial. The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the judges of that court being equally divided in opinion the appeal was dismissed.\nFrom this latter judgment the present appeal has been taken.\nThe well known case of Lister v. Ferryman[5] had, as I have always supposed, settled the law as regards D this class of action, to be that the question of reasonable and probable cause was, although a question of fact, one to be determined by the court and not by the jury. That in such cases the respective functions of the trial judge and jury were these, that whilst the jury were to find all the facts from which the inference was to be drawn, yet that the inference itself, deducible from those facts, was one to be drawn, not by the jury, but by the judge.\nThis is certainly most clearly laid down in the case of Lister v. Ferryman5, and the apparent anomaly and exceptional character of the rule by which a question of fact was thus withdrawn from the jury, who, generally speaking, were judges of the facts, and left to be decided by the court, occasioned expressions of surprise from some of the law lords, who, having been trained in courts of equity, or in the Scottish tribunals, had not been practically familiar with such questions. It has, however, been suggested in a little book written by Mr. Stephens, on the law of Malicious Prosecutions, that this rule of Lister v. Ferryman5 was displaced by the decision in the case of Abrath v. The North Eastern Railway Company[6]. Having repeatedly read this last mentioned case, and having also read Mr. Stephens\u2019s book, I am clearly of opinion that there is no warrant for this proposition. The judge is entitled, no doubt, to the utmost assistance from the jury in finding the facts, and he is entitled for this purpose to put questions to them in any form which his ingenuity may suggest, but he, and not the jury, is to make the deduction, and if he shifts the burden of doing so upon them the case is not properly tried.\nIn the late case of Brown v. Hawkes[7] decided in June, 1891, and therefore, long since the judgment of Armour C.J. in the present action which is now under appeal was pronounced, Lord Esher M.R. thus states the law:\nThe question whether there is an absence of reasonable and probable cause is for the judge and not for the jury, and if the facts on which that depends are not in dispute there is nothing for him to ask the jury, and he should decide the matter himself. If there are facts in dispute upon which it is necessary he should be informed in order to arrive at a conclusion on this point, these facts must be left specifically to the jury, and when they have been determined in that way the judge must decide as to the absence of reasonable and probable cause.\nNow it appears to me that if the learned Chief Justice had had this clear enunciation of the law as to the respective functions of judge and jury in these cases of malicious prosecution before him at the trial and had expressly adopted it for his guide, he could not have followed the rule laid down by the Master of the Rolls more exactly than he actually did.\nThere were no disputed facts. The only question of fact could have been whether Alice Dale signed the written statement which she gave to the appellant, a fact which was not disputed. It was not and could not have been in dispute that Inspector Johnston\u2019s report was not handed to the appellant until after the charge was laid and the warrant issued.\nThere were then no facts in dispute to leave to the jury, and the learned judge could not have left any question material to be decided in the case to them without abdicating the functions which the law had delegated to himself.\nThen it only remains to inquire whether the statement of the woman Dale warranted the appellant, as a police officer, in adopting the course he pursued. This is the inference from the facts which it was for the learned judge to draw, and his finding in respect to it is, I take it, open to review on appeal. As to this I entirely agree with, the remarks of both the Chief Justice at the trial and of Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal. If a police officer in the position of the appellant is not warranted in acting without further inquiry on such information as he receives from a woman who had been an inmate of a suspected house, as Alice Dale had been, his efforts to perform his duty in the suppression of such places would obviously be fruitless. There was ample evidence of probable cause deducible from the undeniable facts of the case, and the conclusion of the Chief Justice at the trial was, in my judgment, altogether right.\nI may add that it would not have made the slightest difference in my conclusion if the second report of Inspector Johnston had been communicated to the appellant before he swore to the complaint before the police magistrate. The charge made by Alice Dale was not that the respondents kept a disorderly house, but that they kept a house of ill-fame, a house of assignation as she calls it, which was resorted to for purposes of prostitution. The facts communicated by Inspector Johnston would only apply to contradict a charge of a disorderly house which was not the charge which led to the prosecution.\nOn the whole I do not see how the appellant, if he had omitted to act as he did on the statement of Alice Dale, could have justified himself before his superior officer if he had been charged with neglect of duty.\nUpon this question of probable cause the cases of Lea v. Charrington[8]; Hope v. Evered[9]; and Brougton v. Jackson[10] seem to me to be authorities for the appellant in the present case and to support the conclusion I have arrived at. In the case last cited Lord Campbell C.J., says the defendant\nmust show facts which would create a reasonable suspicion in the mind of a reasonable man.\nApplying this test the evidence before us was amply sufficient to show probable cause.\nThe appeal must be allowed, and the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division pronounced at the trial restored with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nFOURNIES, J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I dissent. I would dismiss this appeal. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Rose in the Divisional Court, I think that a new trial should be ordered. Upon the evidence, the judge presiding at the trial should have left it to the jury to say if the defendant believed the story of Alice Dale and if he took such precautions as a reasonable man should have done to satisfy himself if her story was at least plausible. The character of that woman, which he well knew, should have made him more cautious.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must, I think, be allowed and upon the grounds stated by Justices Burton and Maclennan in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. There was no contradiction in the evidence upon any matters of fact upon which the non-existence of reasonable and probable cause necessarily depended. It was for the learned judge who tried the case to determine whether or not there was anything in the evidence or in the manner in which it was given which created a doubt in his mind as to the defendant\u2019s belief in the truth of the statement made to him by the woman Dale, or which cast a doubt in his mind as to the bona fides of the defendant in laying the charges against the plaintiffs which he did before the police magistrate. It was upon the learned judge, and, in the absence of contradictory evidence upon essential facts on which the question of existence or non-existence of probable cause depended, upon him alone, that the duty of determining whether the defendant had or had not reasonable and probable cause for making the charges which he did rested. If he saw in the evidence no grounds to doubt the belief or bona fides of the defendant, and was of opinion that the evidence failed to establish a want of reasonable and probable cause or to cast a doubt upon its existence, I do not think that a new trial should be granted because a judge who had not tried the case or heard and seen the witnesses should see something in the evidence which he thinks would have induced him to submit to the jury a question as to the belief of the defendant in the facts stated to him and as to his bona fides in laying the charge\u2014or which he thinks would have made it proper for the learned trial judge, though not absolutely necessary,\u2014to have submitted to the jury such a question. For my own part I must say that I do not see anything in the evidence which I can say ought to have created such a doubt in the mind of the learned trial judge that he should have submitted a question to the jury as to the belief of the defendant in the facts stated to him and as to his bona fides in laying the charge. In the absence of evidence which manifestly ought to have created a doubt as to such belief and bona fides of the defendant, I do not think that a judge who has not presided at the trial should interfere with the judgment of the learned trial judge because he did not submit to the jury a question upon a matter which, by the law, it was his duty to pronounce upon and as to which the evidence had failed to create any doubt in his own mind.\nThe appeal must, I think, be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge sustained. PATTERSON J.\u2014This is an action by the respondents, husband and wife, against the appellant for malicious prosecution.\nAt the trial before Chief Justice Armour the action was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to establish the absence of reasonable and probable cause. A divisional court of the Common Pleas Division set aside that judgment and ordered a new trial on the ground that some question touching the good faith of the defendant ought to have been submitted to the jury.\nOn the appeal to the Court of Appeal there was a division of opinion, in consequence of which the decision of the divisional court remained undisturbed.\nThe trial was the third trial of the action. The three trials resulted in the same way, and in each case a new trial was ordered. It appears to have been understood by the divisional court, or at all events by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court, that at the last trial the attention of the presiding judge had not been called to the opinions expressed by the court in ordering the new trial. We are told by counsel on both sides that this was a misapprehension, the fact being that the judgment of the divisional court was communicated to the trial judge, which fact would have been stated to the Court of Appeal if the matter had been spoken of during the argument in that court where the learned Chief Justice, in ignorance of the explanation, comments on the statement as contained in the judgment delivered in the divisional court, justly characterizing it as almost incredible.\nAt the trial of the action the only evidence given was that adduced by the plaintiffs. The facts shown may, therefore, be fairly treated, for all purposes of the present inquiry, as undisputed facts. The defendant is a police inspector of the city of Toronto.\nA woman called Alice Dale came to the defendant on the eleventh of October, 1889, and gave him information which he wrote down, Alice Dale signing the paper, which reads thus:\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT,\nTORONTO, October 11, 1889.\nMrs. John Dale, at present rooming on Victoria Street, between Queen and Shuter, west side, with a woman who takes in washing, \u201cLaundry\u201d over door, vs. Mrs. McLaren, of 292 Adelaide Street West, with whom she (Mrs. Dale) has been rooming for about five weeks, from 2nd September to 8th October, keeping an house of assignation, allowing, and in fact soliciting, the complainant to bring men into the house and pay her fifty cents for use of room with each man. This she (Mrs. Dale) did on several occasions, giving Mrs. McLaren fifty cents each time; in addition to this, Mrs: McLaren made arrangements with Mrs. Dale to go with another man, from whom she received twenty dollars on four different occasions, and gave Mrs. McLaren five dollars on three different occasions; and on Mrs. Dale refusing to give the five dollars on the fourth occasion, she was ordered by Mrs. McLaren to pack up and leave the house; and she now refuses to give up Mrs. Dale\u2019s two trunks.\nI have had the foregoing read over to me by Staff Inspector Archibald, and I subscribe to it as being correct.\n(Signed) ALICE DALE.\nThe eleventh of October was Friday.\nOn Monday, the fourteenth of October, the defendant laid an information against the two plaintiffs, Margaret McLaren and her husband, for keeping a house of ill-fame.\nThe plaintiffs were arrested at an early hour on the morning of Tuesday, the 15th. They were brought before the police magistrate on the forenoon of the same day and were discharged.\nThe question of reasonable and probable cause, or of the absence of it which is what the plaintiffs had to establish, does not depend on Mrs. Dale\u2019s statement alone. There are other things to be presently men- tioned, but we may first note something of what the plaintiff, Mrs. McLaren, tells in her evidence, though it may only indirectly affect the defendant who was a stranger to her and her history. Her story is that she had entertained Mrs. Dale as a lodger whom she considered respectable for a couple of weeks, and then Mrs. Dale and her husband for some three weeks more; until the evening of Tuesday, the eighth of October, when she discovered, by reading a letter that Mrs. Dale gave to Mr. McLaren to mail but had left open, that Mrs. Dale was a person of bad character, when she promptly made her leave the house, but kept her trunks on account of five dollars due for the two weeks before the husband came. On Wednesday, the 9th, Mrs. Dale had tried ineffectually to get her trunks, and on Thursday, the 10th, she got a lawyer to write a letter which she took to Mrs. McLaren who produced it at the trial. The defendant had, of course, nothing to do with all this, nor is it his concern which is the true version of the relations between the two women that told him by Mrs. Dale or that given by Mrs. McLaren. But it is evident from the lawyer\u2019s letter that his client told him the same story on Thursday that she told on Friday to the defendant, and that the defendant did not misinterpret her statement when he laid the information.\nThis is what the lawyer wrote:\nTORONTO, October 10th, 1889.\nDEAR MADAM.\u2014I have had a conference with Miss Dale who has explained to me the difficulty between you, and the relations between you.\nYou have no right to hold her trunks and clothing. If you do not give them up at once proceedings will be taken. If any exposure occurs the fault will be your own.\nNow, what occurred between Friday, when Mrs. Dale made her statement, and Monday when the information was laid? The defendant took no immediate action on the statement, but he asked Inspector Johnston, who was the police inspector for division no. 3 which included the plaintiff\u2019s house, to procure information as to the character of the house. Johnston learned from other policemen that disturbances occurred in the house which had to be quelled by the police, and he told this to the defendant on the Monday before the information was laid. Johnston\u2019s information seems to have been that the disturbances were fights between the husband and wife occasioned by the wife\u2019s intemperance. He intimated that to the defendant on the Tuesday morning after the arrest of the plaintiffs, expressing at the same time his own opinion that there was not much in the charge of keeping a house of ill-fame.\nIt has been regarded as an open question in the courts below whether the information as to the nature of the disturbances was given by Johnston to the defendant before the laying of the information on Monday, or not until Tuesday, and the question has been regarded as almost a crucial test of the good faith of the defendant. I do not attach so much importance to the time when the communication was made, but at the same time I am unable to see that upon any fair reading of the evidence, which, as I have said is all adduced by the plaintiffs, and which, on this topic, is the evidence of Johnston and of the defendant, it can be doubted that the only information conveyed to the defendant on the Monday was the general fact that rows had occurred in the house, or that the character of the rows was only mentioned on Tuesday just before and in reference to the trial of the charge which Johnston thought had not much in it.\nAnother fact brought out was that, after the defendant had taken Mrs. Dale\u2019s statement and before he had heard from Johnston, his attention was called by the Mayor and by an alderman to the necessity for farther police protection in division no. 3, several streets being particularized, but none in the immediate vicinity of the plaintiffs\u2019 house. The use made of this incident in argument is in support of the charge of malice rather than that of want of reasonable and probable cause, the suggestion being that the defendant was stimulated into action by imputations on his efficiency as the inspector more particularly assigned to the duty of suppressing houses of ill-fame, and did not act from an honest belief in the truth of Mrs. Dale\u2019s information.\nThis is, however, only argument and suggestion. The evidence which connects in any way the two incidents is, as far as it goes, affirmative evidence of the defendant\u2019s belief in Mrs. Dale\u2019s story, and it certainly implies no doubt of the truth of what she had stated.\nI shall read the passage:\n47. Q.\u2014Tell me, Inspector, had the information that you received from the Mayor and Alderman Verrai anything to do with your laying this information against the McLarens? A.\u2014It certainly had, for in making the report to the Chief that this complaint had been made by the Mayor and Alderman, and the request for special police protection in No. 3 Division, I stated that I had positive information about a house in this neighborhood.\n48. Q.\u2014Stated to whom? A.\u2014To the Chief.\n49. Q.\u2014What house had you in your mind? A.\u2014I had the McLaren\u2019s house in my mind, and he said: \u201cThen if you have evidence, why not bring it up?\u201d\n50. Q.\u2014When you had McLaren\u2019s house in your mind, it was from the information that you had received from Inspector Johnston and Alice Dale\u2014that put it in your mind? A. It was the information I had received from Alice Dale.\n51. Q.\u2014And Inspector Johnston? A.\u2014I had not yet received the information from Inspector Johnston.\n52. Q.\u2014Then, the Chief told you if you had any positive evidence why not bring them up? A.\u2014Yes; to which I replied: \u201cI will make further inquiries of the inspector of the division, and if that information is corroborated, I will do so.\u201d\n53. Q.\u2014You did make further inquiries from the inspector of the division, who is Inspector Johnston? A.\u2014Yes.\n54. Q.\u2014You got his report, and with that report and the evidence from Alice Dale you took these proceedings? A.\u2014Yes.\nA number of decisions on the subject of the respective functions of the court and the jury in dealing with the question of reasonable and probable cause have been cited and commented on at the bar, as well as by learned judges in the courts below. I do not think it necessary to discuss those cases, because the law as settled by them is to be found fully and correctly stated in several treatises of recognized learning and accuracy.\nI shall quote from two of those treatises, viz., Taylor on Evidence[11] and Pollock on Torts.\nJudge Taylor, after discussing the general nature of the class of cases termed \u201cmixed cases,\u201d gives the following summary of the decisions that had been reported on the subject down to the year 1884:\u2014\n\u00a728. First: It is now clearly established, albeit the wisdom of the rule has been stoutly disputed, that the question of probable cause must be decided exclusively by the judge, and that the jury can only be permitted to find whether the facts alleged in support of the presence or absence of probability, and the inference to be drawn therefrom, really exist. For instance, in an action for malicious prosecution the jury, provided the evidence on the subject be conflicting, may be asked whether or not the defendant, at the time when he prosecuted, knew of the existence of those circumstances which tend to show probable cause, or believed that they amounted to the offence which he charged; and if they negative either of these facts the judge will decide, as a point of law, that the defendant had no probable cause for instituting the prosecution. This rule, which is based on the assumption that judges are far more competent than juries to determine the question how far it may have been proper for a person to have instituted a prosecution, is equally binding however numerous and complicated the facts and inferences may be; for although in some cases it would doubtless be attended with great difficulty to bring before the jury all the combinations of which numerous facts are susceptible, and to place in a distinct point of view the application of the rule of law, according as all or some only of the facts and inferences from facts are made out to their satisfaction, yet the task is not impracticable; and if would obviously savour of gross inconsistency to hold that a rule which is undisputed in a simple case should not equally apply when the facts were complicated. For where could the line be drawn, and who should determine what degree of complexity would transfer the burden of decision from the judge to the jury. The difficulty, too, is more apparent than real, for it rarely happens but that some leading facts exist in each case, which present a broad distinction to the view without having recourse to the less important circumstances; and as the judge has a right to act upon all the uncontradicted facts, it is only when some doubt is thrown upon the credibility of the witnesses, or where some contradiction occurs, or some inference is attempted to be drawn from some former fact not distinctly sworn to, that he is called upon to submit any question to the jury.\nI read from Mr. Pollock\u2019s work, which was published, I think, in 1887, the concluding passage of the section that treats of false imprisonment[12].\nWhat is reasonable cause of suspicion to justify arrest is, paradoxical as the statement may look, neither a question of law nor of fact. Not of fact, because it is for the judge and not for the jury; not of law, because \u201cno definite rule can be laid down for the exercise of the judge\u2019s judgment.\u201d It is a matter of judicial discretion such as is familiar enough in the classes of cases which are disposed of by a judge sitting alone; but this sort of discretion does not find a natural place in a system which assigns the decision of facts to the jury and the determination of the law to the judge. The anomalous character of the rule has been more than once pointed out and regretted by the highest judicial authority, but it is too well settled to be disturbed unless by legislation. The only thing which can be certainly affirmed in general terms about the meaning of \u201creasonable cause\u201d in this connection is that on the one hand a belief honestly entertained is not of itself enough; on the other hand a man is not bound to wait until he is in possession of such evidence as would be admissible and sufficient for prosecuting the offence to conviction, or even of the best evidence which he might obtain by further inquiry. It does not follow that because it would be very reasonable to make further inquiry, it is not reasonable to act without doing so. It is obvious also that the exist- ence or non-existence of reasonable cause must be judged, not by the event, but by the party\u2019s means of knowledge at the time.\nThe numerous cases cited by Judge Taylor as authority for the propositions he lays down include all those cited to us down to the date of Abrath v. N.E. Railway Co. in which the decision of the Court of Appeal[13] pronounced in 1883, was affirmed in 1886 by the House of Lords[14].\nThat case is not cited by Mr. Pollock in connection with the passage I have read from his treatise, but he cites it when dealing with actions for malicious prosecution[15] and gives the following extract from the judgment of Lord Justice Bowen[16]:\u2014\nIn an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff has to prove, first, that he was innocent and that his innocence was pronounced by the tribunal before which the accusation was made; secondly, that there was a want of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution, or, as it may be otherwise stated, that the circumstances of the case were such as to be, in the eyes of the judge, inconsistent with the existence of reasonable and probable cause; and lastly, that the proceedings of which he complains were initiated in a malicious spirit, that is from an indirect and improper motive, and not in furtherance of justice.\nIn the present case there is no conflicting evidence. The facts on which the defendant acted are uncontradicted facts. The main fact is that Mrs. Dale made the statement, but this must, of course, be taken along with the fact that it was made to the defendant in his official character as police inspector and as the officer whose special duty it was to look after houses such as Alice Dale described. She had been referred to the defendant by the lawyer already mentioned, and the defendant\u2019s special line of duty appears from his examination. If these were all the facts, that is to say, if the defendant had laid the information immediately after taking Alice Dale\u2019s statement, I could not say that a judge who held that there was reasonable and probable cause for making the charge was wrong in so holding. The facts stated by Alice Dale respecting her tenancy of the room she had in the plaintiff\u2019s house, are of the same character as those on which in Reg. v. Rice[17] a conviction for keeping a disorderly house was sustained by the Court of Criminal Appeal although there was no evidence of indecency or disorderly conduct perceptible from outside the house.\nThe great contention is that the jury should have been asked to say if the defendant believed what Alice Dale told him. But there is not a word in the evidence on which to found a suggestion of bad faith, and it is, in my judgment, impossible to say that the Chief Justice gave too much effect to the fact that the defendant acted throughout in his official character.\nThe other facts, the inquiry made through Inspector Johnson and the report of disturbances at the house, certainly do not aid the plaintiffs in their attempt to negative the existence of reasonable and probable cause for laying the information, nor do I see that even if Johnston\u2019s full intelligence had been given at once, and the defendant had, therefore, laid the information understanding that the female plaintiff was addicted to excessive drinking which led to quarrels with her husband by which the peace of the neighbourhood was disturbed, the gravamen of Alice Dale\u2019s imputations against the female plaintiff, and by consequence against the husband who would naturally be credited with complicity in the purposes for which it was alleged his house was used, was at all done away with. I agree with the learned judges of appeal who considered that the non-suit ought not to have been set aside and I am of opinion that we should allow the appeal[18].\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C.R.W.

That it was sufficient for the expert to state in his second proc\u00e8s-verbal made within the six months that the works described had been executed and that such works had given to the immovable the additional value fixed by him. The words \"executes suivant les r\u00e9gles de l\u2019art\u201d are not strictissimi juris.\n4. That if an expert includes in his valuation works for which the builder had by law no privilege such error will not be a cause of nullity but will only entitle the interested parties to ask for a reduction of the expert's valuation APPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) which confirmed judgments dismissing appellants contestations of the respondent's claim against the insolvent estate of C. & N. Vall\u00e9e.\nThe following are the material facts:\u2014\nOn December 19th, 1887, a notarial contract was passed between Cyrille Vall\u00e9e, one of the insolvents, and Levesque & D\u00e9sy, contractors, by which the latter undertook to construct, according to the plans and specifications prepared by Vall\u00e9e's architect, all the wood work in a hotel to be built for Vall\u00e9e, on cadastral lot 237 of the parish of Vaudreuil. The work was to be completed on May 1st, 1888, and the contractors to be paid $10975.00.\nBefore the beginning of the work, on the 14th of January, 1888, Levesque & D\u00e9sy presented to one of the Superior Court judges for the district of Montreal, a petition to have an expert appointed to establish the value of the land upon which the work was to be done and have a proc\u00e8s-verbal of the same drawn up in order to take a builder's privilege on said land.\nMr. Justice Grill granted the petition on the same day and appointed as such expert Peter O'Cain, of the town of St. John district of Iberville, contractor.\nPeter O'Cain, having first been sworn, went to visit \"La Pointe Masson, \" known as official number 237 of the parish of Vaudreuil; and by deed passed before notary Decary, on the 16th of January, 1888, he prepared a proc\u00e8s-verbal stating he had found out that there were about 172,574 feet in superficies; on said building lot were stone foundations 92 feet in front and 9 feet and 7 inches in width; a first range of beams had been laid on these foundations with a rough floor on and he valued the whole land and improvements at the sum of $1,939611. This proc\u00e8s-verbal was registered on the 17th of January, 1888,\nThe contractors executed their contract, which the appellants claimed was completed and accepted by C. & N. Vall\u00e9e on the 1st May, 1888, but which was found by the courts below to have only been completed in August as claimed by the respondent.\nOn December 5th, 1888, Levesque & D\u00e9sy petitioned the same judge for the appointment of another expert, to receive and accept the work in question, and to establish, by an official statement, the additional value given the property by such work, and one Aubry was accordingly appointed.\nOn 6th December, 1888, Aubry made a proc\u00e8s-verbal by which he declared that on examining all the work done by the contractors, to wit., \" tous les ouvrages en bois dans la construction d'un h\u00f4tel\" built on the land in question, he values this work at $13,050.00, at which sum he also fixed the additional value.\nOn the 10th of January, 1889, C. .& N. Vall\u00e9e made a judicial abandonment of their property and on March 14th 1889 the curator sold en bloc all the immovables of the estate, consisting of lots 237 and three little islands being lots 372, 373, 374, of the parish of Ste. Jeanne de l'Isle Perrot for $12,650.\nOn the 23rd February, 1889, Levesque & D\u00e9sy transferred, for value, to respondent all their rights, claims and privileges against C. & N. Vall\u00e9e and against said lot 237 for the payment of the sum of $7,693077, balance due them for the execution of the works.\nin the 20th of May, the respondent filed in the hands of the curator. Desmarteau, his sworn claim against the estate for $7,436.32; the curator prepared his dividend sheet and collocated respondent for $7,288.44, on the ground that his claim was secured by 39 buildes's privilege. Appellant, Dufresne, who had a mortgage on the property for $2,257.00, registered on the 9th August, 1888, and appellant, L. Vall\u00e9e, who had another mortgage on the same property for $3,077. 50, and registered on 17th October, 1888, contested the respondent's alleged privilege, and the collocation made by the curator and further contested the dividend sheet itself because of the distribution of the above price of sale between the respondent, and the bailleur de fonds creditors, without a previous relative valuation (ventilation). The grounds urged by the contestation \"were '.\n1. The second proc\u00e8s-verbal, was made too late, having been prepared and registered more than six months after the completion of the work.\n2. The second proc\u00e8s-verbal, was null, because it omitted to state that the works in question were accepted by the expert, Aubry.\n3. By their first petition the contractors only demand a privilege for the work to be done under the contract. But, as a matter of fact, they did extra work, not contemplated by nor connected with the contract, and the second expert instead of fixing the additional value given by the contract work, established the additional value conferred by all the work done by Levesque & D\u00e9sy, without distinguishing between the contract and non-contract work.\n4. The petitions for appointment of experts are null, not having been filed in the prothonotary's office, nor entered in the minute book.\n5. At all events, the respondent was collocated for too much, not more than $5,000.00 remaining due for work done under the contract.\n6. In any case a relative valuation should have been made before dividing the price of the several immovables sold en bloc, The respondent joined issue on the contestation in so far as they attacked his privilege, but consented that a ventilation be made, asking, however, that the contestation be dismissed with costs.\nThe Superior Court (Tellier J.) set aside the collocation in respondent's favour, because no previous ventilation had been made, and ordered such ventilation. The judgment, however, maintained respondent's privilege, ordered that he he collocated for whatever sum might be fixed by the ventilation, and condemned appellants to pay the costs. On appeal this judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. Both appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the two appeals were argued together.\nThe articles of the Civil Code bearing on the subject are referred to in the judgments hereinafter given.\nGeoffrion Q.C., and Beique Q.C., appeared for the appellants, Dufresne et al and Geoffrion, Q.C. and Beaudoin, Q.C., appeared for the appellant Vall\u00e9e and contended that arts. 1695, 2013, 2103, CO., and arts. 333 and 334 C.C. P. had not been complied with, it being necessary for the respondent to show\n1. That a statement of the original condition of the premises be prepared by a judicial expert, who\u2014as nothing is said to the contrary\u2014must be deemed subject to the rules governing experts generally, and among others to that rule which requires notice to the parties interested.\n2. That the work done be in fact accepted and received by another judicial expert, within six months of its completion.\n3. And the fact of such acceptance,\u2014i. e. of an acceptance by such person and within such time\u2014be established by a second statement, which must also establish the value of the work, and that none of the above requirements had been complied with in the \u00a1 present case.\nThe learned counsel cited and relied on the following authorities:\nLepage\u2014Lois des b\u00e2timents ([2]); Fr\u00e9my-Ligneville-Legislation des b\u00e2timents ([3]); Brown v. Smith ([4]); Farmer v. O'Neill ([5]); Carre & Chauveau ([6]); Dalloz Rep. ([7]); Laurent ([8]); Aubry & Rau ([9]); Pont ([10]); Troplong ([11]).\nGIROUARD, Q.C., and Madore, appeared for the respondent, and contended that all the requirements of the law had been sufficiently complied with, adopting the reasoning of Mr. Justice Blanchet in the court below([12]), and in addition cited and relied on Gilbert et til. v. de Lahh\u00e8ze ([13]); Vauger v. carny ([14]); Rayon & Collet, Dictionnaire de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2tie ([15]); Dalloz Codes Annot\u00e9s ([16]); Troplong, Privil\u00e8ges & Hypoth\u00e9ques ([17]), and art. 345, C.

Rieutord ([18]).\nSTRONG J. concurred with Fournier J.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le present appel est d'un jugement de la Cour du Bauc de la Reine confirmant celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure maintenant la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9 contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en faillite de C. et N. Vall\u00e9e. Cette r\u00e9clamation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un privil\u00e8ge de construction obtenu en vertu de l'article 2013 du Code Civil. L'appelant a contest\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge r\u00e9clame et sa contestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. Les faits suivants ont donn\u00e9 lieu aux diverses questions soulev\u00e9es en cette cause.\nLe 19 d\u00e9cembre 1887, L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy, entrepreneurs-menuisiers. s'engag\u00e8rent par acte authentique\nA faire executer et parfaire, sur le lot num\u00e9ro 237 du cadastre de Vaudreuil, pour le compte de Cyrille Vallee, propri\u00e9taire d'icelui, tous les travaux et ouvrages n\u00e9cessaires et requis pour la construction d'un h\u00f4tel pie le dit C. Vall\u00e9e \u00e9tait \u00e0 faire construire et \u00e9riger au dit endroit et ce, en bons mat\u00e9riaux, suivant les, r\u00e8gles de l'art et aux aires de l'architecte, sous la surveillance duquel les travaux devaient \u00eatre faits pour la somme dc $10,975.00.\nConform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l'art. 2003 C.C. ils s'adress\u00e8rent \u00e0 un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en obtinrent un ordre nommant Peter O'Cain, expert pour constater l'\u00e9tat des lieux o\u00f9 devaient \u00eatre \u00e9rig\u00e9es les constructions projet\u00e9es. Celui-ci fit rapport par acte notari\u00e9 constatant:\n1\u00b0 Ou'il existait sur le terrain en question un solage en pierre mesurant 92 pieds de front sur 99 pieds et seps pouces de profondeur; qu'un premier rang de soliveaux y \u00e9tait pose, ainsi qu'un plancher brut; 2\u00b0 qu'il \u00e9vacuait le terrain \u00e0 la somme de mille piastres et le solage, le rang de soliveaux et le plancher \u00e0 $931.11. Ce proc\u00e8s-verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 le lendemain, 17 janvier 1888.\nApr\u00e8s l'accomplissement de ces formalit\u00e9s et l'h\u00f4tel \u00e9tant alors termin\u00e9 D\u00e9sy et L\u00e9vesque demand\u00e8rent au juge la nomination d'un autre expert pour accepter et recevoir les dits ouvrages. Ferdinand Aubry fut nomm\u00e9 le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1888, par ordonnance du juge:\nAux fins de recevoir et accepter les dits ouvrages, et faire le proc\u00e8s verbal requis par la loi en pareil cas.\nLe 6 d\u00e9cembre 1888 Aubry par un proc\u00e8s-verbal notari\u00e9 fit rapport:\nQu'apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le terrain et les travaux faits, par L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy, savoir: tous les travaux en boss n\u00e9cessaires dans la construction d'un h\u00f4tel b\u00e2ti sur l'emplacement susdit, il estimait les travaux et les ouvrages faits, pat, les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy, dans la construction du dit hotel \u00e0 la somme de $13,050.00, \u00e9tant cette dite somme la plus-value donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'emplacement, par les ouvrages faits par les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy dans la construction du dit hotel, pour laquelle dite somme, les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy ont droit d'avoir privil\u00e8ge et hypo th\u00e8que de constructeurs.\nLe 11 'D\u00e9cembre 1888, enregistrement du second proc\u00e8s-verbal conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 2103 C.C.\nLe 10 janvier 1889 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 C. N. Vall\u00e9e, propri\u00e9taire de l'h\u00f4tel en question fit cession de biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers le 14 mars 1889. Le curateur duement autorise vendit en bloc tous les immeubles appartenant \u00e0 la dite faillite, consistant dans le lot 237 et aussi dans les lots 372, 373, 374, de la paroisse de Ste. Jeanne de l'Isle Perrot, pour une somme totale de $12,650.\nL'intim\u00e9 comme cessionnaire de L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy produisit une r\u00e9clamation de $7,436.22 pour balance due sur la construction de l'h\u00f4tel. Dans son projet de loi de distribution d\u00e8s deniers, le curateur a d'abord colloqu\u00e9 les cr\u00e9anciers bailleurs de fonds au montant de $3,678.10 et ensuite, l'intim\u00e9, pour $7,288.44 sur le principe que sa r\u00e9clamation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le privil\u00e8ge de constructeur.\nL'appelant cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire sur le lot n\u00b0 237 a contest\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge r\u00e9clame par l'intim\u00e9, ainsi que la collocation faite par le curateur et le projet de distribution du prix de vente entre l'intim\u00e9 et les bailleurs de fonds, parce qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement fait une ventilation des dies immeubles\nLes moyens de contestation invoqu\u00e9s sont 1o que le second proc\u00e8s-verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait trop tard; ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9pare et enregistr\u00e9 plus de. six mois apr\u00e8s que les ouvrages eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s et qu'avis des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de l'expert n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 aux parties.\n20 Nullit\u00e9 du second proc\u00e8s-verbal par\u00e9e qu'il n'y est pas dit que les ouvrages en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s par l'expert Aubry. 30 Paree que dans l'estimation de la plus-value, l'expert Aubry n'a pas fait la distinction entre les ouvrages faits conform\u00e9ment aux stipulations du contrat et ceux qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en addition et hors du dit contrat.\n4. Que les nominations d'experts sont nulles parce que les requ\u00eates n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites au bureau du protonotaire ni entr\u00e9es dans les registres de la cour.\n5. L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 colloqu\u00e9 pour un montant trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, -parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait d\u00fb que $5,000 sur les ouvrages du contrat.\n6.

Les architectes, constructeurs et autres ouvriers ont un privil\u00e8ge sur les \u00e9difices et autres ouvrages par eux construits pour le paiement de leurs ouvrages et mat\u00e9riaux, sujets aux regles contenues an titre des privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques et au titre de l'enregistrement des droits r\u00e9els.\nArt. 2013. Le constructeur ou autre ouvrier, et l'architecte ont droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence seulement sur la plus-value donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritage par leurs constructions, \u00e0 l'encontre du vendeur et des autres cr\u00e9anciers, pourvu qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par un expert nomm\u00e9 par un juge de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans le district, un proc\u00e8s-verbal constatant l'\u00e9tat des lieux o\u00f9 les travaux doivent \u00eatre faits, et que dans les six mois a compter de leur ach\u00e8vement, les ouvrages aient \u00e9t\u00e9 acceptes et re\u00e7us par un proc\u00e8s-verbal contenant aussi une \u00e9valuation c es ouvrages faits, et dans aucun cas le privil\u00e8ge ne s'\u00e9tend an del\u00e0 de la valeur constat\u00e9e par le second proc\u00e8s-verbal, et il est encore r\u00e9ductible an montant de Ta plus-value qu'a l'h\u00e9ritage an temps de Ta vente. Au cas d'insuffisance des deniers pour satisfaire le constructeur et le vendeur on de contestation, la plus-value donn\u00e9e par les constructions est constat\u00e9e au moyen d'une ventilation faite conform\u00e9ment aux prescriptions contenues an code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nArt. 2103. Le privil\u00e8ge du constructeur ne date que du jour' de l'enregistrement du proc\u00e8s-verbal constatant l'\u00e9tat des lieux tel que requis au titre des privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques, et il n'a d'effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des autres cr\u00e9anciers enregistr\u00e9s que par l'enregistrement du second proc\u00e8s-verbal constituant l'\u00e9valuation et la r\u00e9ception des ouvrages faits, dans les trente jours \u00e0 compter de sa date.\nLa plus s\u00e9rieuse des objections faites par l'appelant contre la proc\u00e9dure de l'intim\u00e9 pour obtenir le privil\u00e8ge de construire est celle, sans doute, all\u00e9guant que le second proc\u00e8s-verbal constatant l'\u00e9valuation et la r\u00e9ception des ouvrages n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans les six mois \u00e0 compter de l'ach\u00e8vement des travaux. Cette condition est de rigueur et s'il \u00e9tait vrai que le second proc\u00e8s-verbal n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait qu'apr\u00e8s l'expiration des six mois le constructeur n'aurait pas de privil\u00e8ge. Il en serait de m\u00eame s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai, car le privil\u00e8ge ne date que du jour de l'enregistrement du premier proc\u00e8s-verbal constatant 1 \u00e9tat des lieux, et le privil\u00e8ge n'a d'effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des autres cr\u00e9anciers enregistr\u00e9s, que par l'enregistrement du second proc\u00e8s-verbal constatant l'\u00e9valuation et la r\u00e9ception des ouvrages.\nCe second proc\u00e8s-verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1889, en forme notari\u00e9e par Aubry nomm\u00e9 expert par ordon nance du juge Grill; et a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 le 11 d\u00e9cembre m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. L'appelant pr\u00e9tend qu'il s'\u00e9tait alors \u00e9coul\u00e9 plus de six mois depuis l'ach\u00e8vement des travaux.\nD'apr\u00e8s lui, les ouvrages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9s le ter mai 1888, et il cite \u00e0 l'appui de ce fait, un re\u00e7u de L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy reconnaissant avoir re\u00e7u de C. Vall\u00e9e la somme de $7,657077 par billet pour travaux faits \u00e0 Vaudreuil, et mentionnant le ter mai comme date de la livraison de l'h\u00f4tel. Bans ce r\u00e8glement qui n'\u00e9tait pas final, il n\u2019est pas fait mention que les ouvrages entre pris sont achev\u00e9s.\nIl est vrai que vers cette Capoue Vall\u00e9e a pris possession de l'h\u00f4tel et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert au public mais de cela on ne peut conclure que les ouvrages \u00e9taient achev\u00e9s. Il est au contraire prouv\u00e9 par de nombreux t\u00e9moins que les travaux se sont continu\u00e9s tr\u00e8s tard dans la saison Pour \u00e9tablir cette date il est n\u00e9cessaire de re courir \u00e0 la preuve faite sur ce point. C'est une question de fait qui peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e par la preuve testimoniale. L'enqu\u00eate \u00e9tablit que les travaux \u00e9taient assez avanc\u00e9s pour que Vall\u00e9e put prendre possession de l'h\u00f4tel au mois de mai mais elle \u00e9tablit aussi que les ouvriers des constructeurs ont continu\u00e9 d'y travailler pendant les mois de mai, juin etjuillet,c'est-\u00e0-dire pendant un temps assez long apr\u00e8s le ter mai, pour que le d\u00e9lai de six mois n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expire lors de la confection du second proc\u00e8s-verbal.\nIl est encore fait une autre objection \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ce second proc\u00e8s-verbal, c'est que, dit l'appelant, les privil\u00e8ges \u00e9tant de droit \u00e9troit, les formalit\u00e9s pour les obtenir doivent \u00eatre rigoureusement observ\u00e9es \u2014et il n'est pas fait mention dans ce second proc\u00e8s-verbal que l'expert a accept\u00e9e les ouvrages En question. Il est vrai que les privil\u00e8ges sont de droit \u00e9troit;\u2014dans ce sens qu'on ne doit pas les \u00e9tendre d'un cas \u00e0 un autre,\u2014 mais il ne s'ensuit pas moins qu'ils sont soumis aux r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation et qu'on ne peut leur appliquer des nullit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas prononc\u00e9s par la loi. Ils doivent comme les autres transactions \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 produire leur effet. L'article 2013, en disant que les ouvrages doivent \u00eatre accept\u00e9s et re\u00e7us dans les six mois, imposait-il \u00e0 l'expert Aubry, l'obligation de se servir des termes m\u00eames de l'article, \"accept\u00e9s et re\u00e7us.\" Ces expressions sont-elles sacramentelles, ne pouvait-il pas y substituer d'autres expressions rendant tout aussi bien l'id\u00e9e de l'acceptation et de la r\u00e9ception que s'il avait fait usage de ces deux mots.\nL'appelant s'est aussi plaint qu'aucun avis n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 aux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es par les experts avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'expertise. Quelles sont ici les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es? L'appelant a voulu sans doute indiquer les cr\u00e9anciers de Vall\u00e9e, et non les propri\u00e9taires de l'h\u00f4tel au nom desquels il n'a aucun droit de prendre une telle objection, et encore moins les contacteurs qui faisaient eux-m\u00eames la demande d\u2019expertise. Les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans ces proc\u00e9dures ne peuvent \u00eatre autre que le propri\u00e9taire d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et les contacteurs de l'autre. Les cr\u00e9anciers ant\u00e9rieurs n'ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre appel\u00e9s lors de ces proc\u00e9dures qui ne peuvent en aucune mani\u00e8re affecter leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il ne s'agit que de cr\u00e9er au profit d'un tiers une hypoth\u00e8que ou plut\u00f4t un privil\u00e8ge sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui n'existe pas encore, mais qui va \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le travail et la valeur des ouvrages que ce tiers se propose de continuer. Rien n'est plus juste que le tiers soit pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 tous autres sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il va cr\u00e9er par son travail. Il n'inter vient donc nullement avec les droits existant ant\u00e9rieurement sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et ceux qui les poss\u00e8dent sont absolument sans int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 recevoir avis des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qu'il fait pour s'assurer un privil\u00e8ge sur le produit de son travail.\nPour les cr\u00e9anciers post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'enregistrement du premier proc\u00e8s-verbal, comme ils prennent rang apr\u00e8s le privil\u00e8ge du constructeur, lorsque le second proc\u00e8s-verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et enregistr\u00e9, la loi les traite comme parfaitement \u00e9tranges \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de l'expertise. N'y ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 parties, la loi leur donne le droit de l'attaquer, de contester la plus-value rapport\u00e9e par l'expert et m\u00eame de la faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard res inter alias acta. Lesage Lois des b\u00e2timents ([19]) dit que lors de la premi\u00e8re op\u00e9ration il n'y a aucune contradiction; pour la seconde il ne mentionne comme parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es que le propri\u00e9 taire et tous ceux qui out droit au privil\u00e8ge. A la page 91 il ajoute.\nCette seconde op\u00e9ration qui se fait toujours entre le propri\u00e9taire et ceux qui ont travaill\u00e9 a la construction a pour but de fixer ce qui est d\u00fb a ces derniers.\nFr\u00e9my de Ligneville ([20]) est aussi du m\u00eame avis et dit formellement que les tiers int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 contester les privil\u00e8ges, c'est-\u00e0 dire les autres cr\u00e9anciers du propri\u00e9taire, ne sont pas pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la confection des proc\u00e9s-verbaux.\nTroplong sur art. 2103 ([21]) dit en toutes lettres que les cr\u00e9anciers ne sont pas appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la confection des proc\u00e9s-verbaux.\nL'expert Aubry apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9crit dans son proc\u00e8s-verbal l'emplacement sur lequel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites les constructions d\u00e9clare '.\nQu'apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le dit emplacement et les travaux faits par les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy, savoir: tous les ouvrages en boss dans la construction d'un h\u00f4tel b\u00e2ti sur le dit emplacement.\nQue le dit comparant estime les travaux et ouvrages faits par les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy dans la construction du dit hotel a la somme de treize mille cinquante piastres, \u00e9tant cette dite somme la plus-value donn\u00e9e au dit emplacement par les ouvrages faits par les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy dans la construction du dit h\u00f4tel, pour laquelle dite somme, les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy ont droit d'avoir un privil\u00e8ge et hypoth\u00e8que de construction.\nLes termes dont s'est servi l'expert Aubry ne laissant aucun doute sur un examen s\u00e9rieux de sa part des travaux faits par les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy,\u2014il est \u00e9vident qu'en se servant des expressions \" faits par les dits L\u00e9vesque et D\u00e9sy, \", il a voulu faire voir qu'il en faisait la distinction d'avec les travaux ant\u00e9rieurement faits et constat\u00e9s par le premier Proc\u00e8s-Verbal; afin d'en mieux faire sentir la distinction il ajoute '\" savoir tous les ouvrages en bois dans la construction d'un hotel b\u00e2ti sur le dit emplacement.\" Cette derni\u00e8re estimation au montant seulement de la plus-value Le rapport de l'expert n'est pas concluant par rapport \u00e0 eux, car ils n'y \u00e9taient point parties.\nIl est \u00e0 peine n\u00e9cessaire de mentionner l'objection que les nominations d'experts sont nulles pour n'avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites au bureau des protonotaires. Elles l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en temps utile et cela suffit. Elles n'ont pas pour cela perdu leur caract\u00e8re judiciaire.\nLa cinqui\u00e8me objection, que la collocation de l'intime est pour un montant trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, n'est pas fond\u00e9e, La preuve constate sp\u00e9cialement par les billets promissoires de Vall\u00e9e, tous produits en cette cause, que le montant r\u00e9clame est encore d\u00fb.\nQuant \u00e0 la sixi\u00e8me objection au sujet de la ventilation, la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Le curateur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'a pas fait cette ventilation \u00e0 cause du peu de valeur des trois immeubles vendus en bloc avec l'h\u00f4tel. C'est probablement pour cette raison que l'appelant n'en a pas fait la demande lorsqu'il a produit sa r\u00e9clamation, mais la cour Sup\u00e9rieure la lui a accord\u00e9, et vu que son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9, l'appelant en aura le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice parce que le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine est confirm\u00e9 en entier\nTASCHEREAU J. This is a contestation of a builder's privilege by the appellants, hypothecary creditors of one Cyrille Vall\u00e9e, an insolvent. The respondent is the assignee of the builder's claims. The appellants' claims were registered after the first proc\u00e8s-verbal, but before the second.\nThe special provisions of the Code bearing on the subject are the following:\u2014\u2022\nArt. 1695, C. C: Architects builders and other workmen, have a privilege upon the buildings or other works constructed by them, for the payment of their work and materials, subject to the rules contained in the title of privileges and hypothecs, and the title of registration of real rights.\nArt. 2013 C. C.: Builders or other workmen, and architects have a right of preference over the vendor and all other creditors, only upon the additional value given to the immovables by their works, provided an official statement, proc\u00e8s verbal, establishing the state of the premises on which the works are to be made, have been previously made by an expert appointed by a judge of the Superior Court in the district and that within six months from their completion, such works have been accepted and received by an expert appointed in the same manner, which acceptance and reception must be established by another official statement containing also a valuation of the work done . and in no case does the privilege extend beyond the value ascertained by such second statement and it is reducible to the amount of the additional value which the immovable has at the time of the sale. In case the proceeds are insufficient to pay the builder and the vendor or in cases of contestation, the additional value given by the buildings is established by a relative valuation effected in the manner prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure.\n2103 C. C.: The privilege of the builder dates only from the registration of the statement establishing the condition of the premises, as required in the title of privileges and hypothecs, and takes effect against other registered claims by means only of its registration within thirty days after the date of the second statement establishing the valuation and acceptance of the works done.\nSee also La Corporation du S\u00e9minaire de St. Hyacinthe v. La Banque de St. Hyacinthe ([22]).\nThis privilege has always existed from the time of the Roman law, but subject always, in France, to certain formalities and conditions, Pothier Hyp. ch. 2, par. 2 sec. 3. It is, however, only by 4 Vic. ch. 30, secs 31 and 32 I believe, that the formalities required by the above cited article 2013 were for the first time en acted in the province of Quebec. They originated, it Would appear in an arr\u00eat du Parlement de Paris of August, 1766, reproduced in Guyot Rep. vo. B\u00e2timents and in Ancien D\u00e9nizart vo. Privil\u00e8ges No. 42 and which the Code Napol\u00e9on also subsequently adopted. 2 Grenier, Hyp. 255. The builders in the present case did get the two proc\u00e8s-verbaux or official statements required by art. 2013, but the legality of these documents is impeached by the appellants on various grounds, and they ask that it be declared that the respondent has no priority over them for his claim notwithstanding the registration of the two pproc\u00e8s-verbaux.\nI will examine these grounds in the order in which I find them in their factum.\nThe first is \"because it does not appear that notice of the proceedings of either expert was given to any of the parties interested.\" This ground was, in the courts below, unanimously held not to be fatal to these documents, assuming it could be invoked by the appellants, though they have not specially pleaded it in their contestation. The respondent urged, with great force, that if such an issue had been directly raised by the appellants, he might have proved either that notice to the parties had in fact been given, or that these formalities had been waived by conduct either by their presence at, and acquiescence in, the expert's proceedings, or otherwise. However, assuming that the objection can be taken by the appellants, I am not prepared to reverse the judgment of the courts below on that point, though it would have been more regular, on general principles, that such notices should have been given,\u2014 and that the fact should appear on the face of the proc\u00e8s-verbaux. Nowhere are such notices now required by express enactment, though they were in France by the law of 1766 and are now in Belgium as to the first proc\u00e8s-verbal. Laurent, Avant-projet ([23]). The proceedings by experts as regulated by articles 322 and following of the Code of Procedure to which we have been referred by the appellants, have no application. The expertise\u2019s there provided for are those in cases pending before a court Here, the expert. under art. 2013 is of a totally different character He has not the power to examine witnesses and his report binds no one specially if he proceeds ex parte. The similarity between the two kinds of expertises ends where it begins, at the word \" expert.\"\nThen the appellants, who here invoke this ground of nullity, became creditors of Cyrille Vall\u00e9e, subsequently to the registration of the first proc\u00e8s-verbal, and consequently were informed of the builders' claim. The registration of the said proc\u00e8s-verbal was also it is con ceded, effected as required by law. And they do not allege or prove that they have suffered, or that their rights have in any way been affected from the want of such notice. In France the commentators are not all agreed on the necessity under the code of a notice to the creditors; Delvincourt for instance says ([24]) that the experts are named by the judge, so as to protect the creditors who he adds are not notified of the proceedings on the proc\u00e8s-verbaux. Mourlon ([25]), says: \"Les conditions substantielles d'un acte sont \u00e9videmment celles Qu'il doit r\u00e9unir pour remplir son objet, ou en autres termas, pour atteindre le but auquel la loi l'a pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\"\nIn the present case, the object of the law has been attained and to defeat these builders' Claim for the omission of secondary or accessory formalities would, it seems to me be to create nullities and to forget that: L Les nullit\u00e9s ne s'\u00e9tendent pas par analogie d'un cas \u00e0 un autre.\" ([26])\nThe second ground of objection taken by the appellants is that the second proc\u00e8s-verbal or official statement, was not, as a matter of fact, made within six months of the completion of the work as ordered by art. 2013 C. C. That clearly involves a pure question of fact, which has been found in favour of the respondent by the two courts below. And we cannot be expected, according to the consistent jurisprudence of this court, to reverse such a finding upon contradictory evidence.\nThe third ground urged by the appellants against the validity of these documents is \" because even if the work were in fact accepted within the six months, neither the acceptance nor the fact of its having been made within that time appear from the second proc\u00e8s-verbal or official statement, which is the only legal proof of these matters. \"\nThis ground is untenable It has been said that the proc\u00e8s-verbal must state that the works have been completed, \" suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art.\" That was so under the arr\u00e9t du Parlement of 1766, but it is not so under art. 2013 where no such words are to be found. All that is now required is that the works be accepted and received by the expert within six months from their completion, and that such acceptance and reception be established by his proc\u00e8s-verbal. I have already said that the second proc\u00e8s-verbal here, as found by the courts below has in fact been made within six months after the completion of the works. The contention that this should appear, on pain; of penalty, by the proc\u00e8s-verbal is unfounded. How can the expert know anything of the date when the works were completed? I should think it more correct to say that it must be assumed that the order of the judge for the second expertise has been granted only upon an affidavit that the works had been completed within six months. As to the contention that the expert Aubry does not say in so many words, in this proc\u00e8s-verbal, that he has accepted and received the works I cannot think it serious. He was. expressly named by the judge for that very purpose. Nous, juge soussign\u00e9, accordons la dite requ\u00eate et nommons Ferdinand Aubry, entrepreneur de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, expert aux fins de recevoir et accepter les ouvrages mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus et faire le proc\u00e8s-verbal requis par la loi en pareil cas pour \u00e9tablir la plus-value.\nCHARLES GILL\nJ. C. S.\nUpon that nomination, the proc\u00e8s-verbal says that he proceeded to the valuation required and found the works done to be worth $13,050.00, the said sum being the increased value given to the lot by these works for which increased value the said builders have a right to claim a priority.\nI cannot see in those words anything else but an acceptance by the expert of these works. He went there for that purpose, and that purpose only. Did he refuse to accept the works? Clearly not. And how could he refuse to accept works which the proprietor had accepted himself and received long before? And, under the circumstances, not refusing them was, by itself, accepting them, it seems to me. As the proprietor was satisfied with the builders' works he the expert, had to rest satisfied. Then, when he reports that the builders have a right of priority for $13,050, value of their works, does he not accept such works? The appellants argue that, privileges being strictissimi juris, equivalents will not do.\nBut they must not forget that \" nullities are odious, and that \" il n'existe pas de nullit\u00e9 sans grief ([27]).\"\nThe appellants here have no grief whatever. They took mortgages on this insolvent's property with their eyes opened, fully aware of the buildings he was erecting thereon and of the builder's registered first proc\u00e8s-verbal. They never had a mortgage on these buildings. That is what the law amounts to. If they succeeded in their demand to rank before these builders they would clearly get all the benefit of their labour, and pocket their earnings.\nOn ne peut, (dit Grenier ([28])) surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de prononcer une d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de privil\u00e8ge ou d'hypoth\u00e8que, donner une extension aux formalit\u00e9s prescrites par la loi ([29]).\nLepage, Lois des b\u00e2timents, ([30]) has been cited by both parties on this point, as well as on the. other points of the case but I do not attach much weight to that book, at least to that passage of it. The author seems there to have made a code of procedure in the matter. It may not be a bad one but it is not to be followed on pain of nullity. Then the book is full of errors. He says, for instance, page 86, that the proprietor alone has the right to petition for the appointment of the first expert, except where it has been agreed in the contract that the builders would also have that right See 1 Pont P. & H. 220.\nNow, that was so under the law of 1766, but it is not so now either in France or here. The same may be said of the passage of this book where the author says that the expert must declare if the works have been done \"suivant les r\u00e8gles do l'art.\" Those are the words of the law of 1766, as I have remarked but not of the code. The more recent work of Fr\u00e9my Ligne ville, on the subject is more reliable. It would undoubtedly be better to serve notice of the petition either for the first or for the second proc\u00e8s-verbal, and when made either by the proprietor or by the builders on all the other parties, and that of all their proceedings, the experts should also give notice to every party interested, including the party upon whose petition they have been appointed. The proc\u00e8s-verbaux should mention all these formalities, and the second one should state in express terms besides the valuation of the works, that the ex pert has accepted and received them; also stating when they have been completed. However, I repeat it I am not prepared to reverse, the judgments of the two courts below in the cases which hold that the proc\u00e8s-verbaux of the builders are not nullified by the want of these formalities. Ravon, Code des B\u00e2timents ([31]); Pandectes Francaises ([32]).\nAs a fourth ground of nullity against the second proc\u00e8s-verbal, the appellants say that the value of the contract work does not appear from it as it includes in its valuation other work which is valued in one lump sum with the contract work, The judgment appealed from disposes of this objection on two grounds. First, that, as a matter of fact, it appears by the proc\u00e8s-vebal itself, that the expert has not included in his valuation anything else but that for which the builders could legally claim priority, and secondly that even if he had wrongly included certain works, that would not be a cause of nullity of the proc\u00e8s-verbal, but could only entail the reduction of such valuation at the instance of the interested parties Doutre v. Green ([33]). In my opinion these reasons against the appellant's contentions are unimpeachable. We must leave it to the law to decree nullities; see Merlin ([34]); and besides, art. 2013 itself provides for the case of reduction of the expert's valuation, ox in case of contestation, for the mode of establishing contradictorily, the amount of the increased value given by the works to the property. In fact, the appellant's objection is not to me intelligible.\nI do not see that the contract price agreed upon between the builders and the insolvent has anything to do with the questions in controversy here. The expert's duty was to establish the value of the work done but it is not on that value that the builder's right of preference is to be fixed, but only upon the additional value, at the time of the sale, given to the immovable by their works in quantum res pretiosior facta est, which additional value the expert Aubry had not the power to determine, as he has done. Troplong ([35]). And that is what is ordered by the judgment in this case.\nAppeals dismissed with costs ([36]).\nSolicitors for appellants, Dufresne, et al. : Beique, Lafontaine, Turgeon & Robertson.\nSolicitors for appellant Vall\u00e9e : Beaudin & Cardinal.\nSolicitors for respondent : Madore and Larochelle.\n[1] Q.R. 1-Q.B. 330.\n[2] 2 vol. p. 88.\n[3] 2 vol. p. 608 No. 917.\n[4] 6 L.

(1887) c. 159\u201453 V. c. 42 (O)\u2014Application to company incorporated by special charter\u2014Collection of tolls\u2014Maintenance of road\u2014Injunction.\nThe provision of the General Road Companies Act of Ontario (R. S. O. [1887] c. 159) as amended by 53 V. c. 42 relating to tolls and repair of roads apply to a company incorporated by special acts and on the report of an engineer as provided by the general act that the road of such company is out of repair it may be restrained from collecting tolls until such repairs have been made.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal on motion for entering injunction (19 Ont. App. R. 234) overruled and that of the Divisional Court (21 O. R. 507) approved.\nAppeal by leave of the court from a decision of the Chancellor of Ontario without an intermediate appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nThe action is brought for an injunction restraining the defendants from collecting tolls upon their road and from keeping the toll-gates closed or otherwise maintained, so as to obstruct persons travelling along the road until the county engineer appointed under the provisions of 53 Vic. ch. 42 (O.), shall have examined the road in connection with certain proceedings alleged to have been taken under the provisions of that act, and shall have certified that the defendants' road had been repaired in a good and efficient manner. The respondents, the Vanghan Road Company, are incorporated by special charter, 13 & 14 Vic. cap 134, and own a road in the township of Vaughan, and the question to be decided is: Does 53 Vic. ch. 42 (O.) \"An Act to amend the General Road Companies Act\" (R. S. O. [1887] ch. 159) apply to this company?\nThe amending act authorizes such proceedings as were taken in this case when a road subject to the General Road Companies Act is out of repair. The general act provided that certain sections only should extend to companies incorporated by private acts.\nAn application was made to a Divisional Court for an interim injunction which was granted[1], but the Court of Appeal reversed the order[2] holding that the provision extending a part of the general act to private companies did not make them subject to that act and, therefore, that 53 Vic. ch. 42 did not apply to this company. As this decision was given on the application for the interim injunction the plaintiffs could not appeal therefrom so they proceeded to trial before the Chancellor who, following the decision of the Court of Appeal on the question of law, dismissed the action. The plaintiffs then, by leave of the Supreme Court, appealed directly to that court from the judgment of the Chancellor.\nS. H. Blake Q.C., and Lawrence for the appellants referred to Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes[3]; Luckraft v. Pridham[4].\nBain Q.C. and Kappele for the respondents cited The Queen v. Inhabitants of Merionethshire[5], The Queen v. Stock[6]; Seward v. Vera Cruz[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: PATTERSON J.\u2014It is not improbable that the fuller discussion before this court has directed attention to some features of the provincial legislation respecting road companies which were not made so prominent in the argument of the interlocutory motion before the Court of Appeal. Since the argument before us I have carefully examined the various statutes, and with the greatest respect for the opinions of the learned judges who concurred in the judgment which is in fact, though not in form, the subject of this appeal, I find myself unable to adopt their conclusion. I interpret the statutes in very much the same way as did the divisional court of the Common Pleas Division and the learned Chief Justice of Appeal.\nA short glance at some of the statutes will suffice to explain the grounds of my opinion.\nI may observe that the terms \"Charter\" and \"Act of Incorporation\" seem to be used in the statutes interchangeably. Whether any road companies in the province exist, or ever existed, by royal charter I do not know, but it is evident that from the act of 1849[8] to that of 1890[9] the terms are used indifferently to denote a private act of incorporation[10].\nThe private act 13 & 14 Vic. ch. 134, adopting for the Vaughan Road Co. the terms of the act of 9 Vic. ch. 88, which incorporated the Albion Road Company of which the Vaughan Company was an offshoot, provided for the corporate existence and certain functions and powers of the company, but made no provision for the important subject\u2014important as far as the public was concerned\u2014of enforcing the proper maintenance and repair of the road. In 1853 the act 16 Vic. ch. 190 was passed,\nAn Act to amend and consolidate the several Acts for the formation of joint stock companies for the construction of roads and other works in Upper Canada.\nThat act recognized and dealt with two classes of companies:\n1st. Companies incorporated under general acts;\n2nd. Companies for which charters had been obtained or which are otherwise described as having private acts of incorporation.\nThe 59th section of the act provided that certain enumerated sections and no other sections of the act should extend to companies of the second class.\nThe excluded sections were those which regulated the powers and functions of corporations as bodies politic formed under general acts. In the case of companies having special acts of incorporation those things were provided for by the private acts. In excluding the excluded sections the act of 1853 simply left each of those companies to live its own corporate life uninterfered with by enactments meant for companies of another class; but every provision of the act which bore on the conduct of the enterprise which was the basis of the contract between the company and the public applied to all companies alike.\nThe sections that did not apply to companies which had special acts dealt with the subjects of the incorporation and ordinary corporate powers of companies[11]; directors, shares, calls and actions for calls[12]; the time within which works were to be completed[13]; rate of tolls, width of tires, and intersection of roads[14]; certain exemptions from paying toll[15]; competency of officers and shareholders as witnesses[16]; cure of informalities in the incorporation of some companies[17]; and the reports which, the directors were to make to the municipality[18].\nThe subjects dealt with by the sections which applied to all companies alike may, in a general way, be thus specified \u2014\nExpropriation of land and materials; arbitration; borrowing money or issuing new stock to facilitate the extension of the works; union of companies; dealings with municipalities; tolls; repair of road; protection of road; recovery of fines, &c.; limitation of actions; power of municipality to purchase the stock after 21 years from completion of the work.\nSome of the learned judges in the courts below intimated an opinion that these provisions thus made applicable, or, to use the language of the statute, \"extended\" to companies having private acts of incorporation, became in effect parts of those private acts, and would so remain even if the general act was repealed, just as if enacted by way of direct amendment of the private act, and it was so contended before us on the part of the respondents. I notice the contention merely in order to say that I, do not accede to it. There is nothing in the force of the language of the statute or in the necessity of the case to indicate that such was the intention of the legislature. The legislature, having at the moment in contemplation certain artificial bodies created for a certain purpose, laid down rules for their government as it might have done in the case of natural persons, and which rules it did in fact apply, in 1859,[19] to natural persons who purchased roads or other works at a sale under legal process. In the individual's case the rules could create no natural right, nor did they enter into the essence of the legal entity so as to prevent their being changed or superseded by other general rules at the will of the legislature. It will tend to clearness, and will do no violence to the act of 1853, to separate the two objects of the statute, which are not necessarily connected though they happen to be covered by the one document.\nOne of these objects is the incorporation of the companies which I have classed as no. 1, and providing for their ordinary corporate functions.\nIf we set on one side these companies of the first class, and range with them the companies of the second class, we have an array of corporate bodies undistinguishable from each other as legal entities, and differing only in the mode of their creation.\nOver against this array of companies set the other part of the statute, containing the rules which are to govern all the companies alike.\nIt is manifest that, in respect of these rules, any one of the companies is subject to the statute in the same sense as any other of them.\nThe respondent company thus comes literally within the act of 1890, being \"subject to the General Road Companies Act,\" the provisions of the act of 1853 having, in the particulars in discussion, been carried forward by way of the Consolidated Statutes of 1859 and the Revised Statutes, 1877, to the Revised Statutes, 1887, where they now appear in chapter 159.\nIn my opinion we should allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Lawrence, Ormiston & Drew.\nSolicitors for respondents: Bain, Laidlaw & Kappele.\n[1] 21 O.

On an appeal from the judgment dismissing the appeal it was objected that there was no decision arrived at.\nHeld, that the Appellate Court should not go behind the formal judgment which stated that the appeal was dismissed; further, the position was the same as if the four judges had been equally divided in opinion in which case the appeal would have been properly dismissed.\nIn an action against several mill owners for obstructing the River Ottawa by throwing sawdust and refuse into it from their mills a reference was made to the master to ascertain the amount of damages.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the master rightly treated the defendants as joint tort feasors; that he was not called upon to apportion the damages according to the injury inflicted by each defendant; and he was not obliged to apportion them according to the different grounds of injury claimed by the plaintiff.\nHeld further, that the master was the final judge of the credibility of the witnesses and his report should not be sent back because some irrelevant evidence may have been given of a character not likely to have affected his judgment, especially as no appeal was taken from his ruling on the evidence. On a reference to a master the latter, provided he sufficiently follows the directions of the decree, is not obliged to give his reasons for, or enter into a detailed explanation of, his report to the court.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Chancellor who upheld the report of a master on a reference to assess damages.\nThe defendants are respectively proprietors of sawmills on the Ottawa River, and the action is brought for damage to plaintiff\u2019s business by the sawdust and refuse from the mills being thrown into the river where it accumulated so as to obstruct the navigation thereon. The plaintiff claimed that he was not only prevented from running his boats on the river as formerly, but that his business as a letter of boats for hire was injured by reason of the sawdust and refuse accumulating in front of his boat-house. The defendants pleaded a prescriptive right to put sawdust in the river and that they should not have been joined as joint tort-feasors.\nOn the trial judgment was given for defendants, which was set aside by the Divisional Court and the decision of the latter affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. The case was then referred to a master to take an account and his report adjudged each of the defendants liable to pay $1,000. An appeal was taken against this report, defendants claiming that the master should have considered how much of the damage was caused by other mill\u2011owners and apportioned the damages against defendants severally; also that he should have found how much was due on each head of damage claimed by plaintiff. The report was affirmed by the Chancellor and by the Court of Appeal and defendants appealed to this court.\nIn addition to the objections made to the report it was argued on this appeal that the Court of Appeal pronounced no judgment on the case, two of the four judges being in favour of dismissing the appeal and the other two withholding their opinion.\nGormully Q.C. for the appellant. As to the court interfering in matters of evidence affecting the quantum of damage see Bigsby v. Dickinson[1].\nThe loss of custom should have been proved. Fritz v. Hobson[2]. Iveson v. Moore[3].\nAppellants were entitled to the decision of all the judges in the Court of Appeal.\nO\u2019Gara Q.C. for the respondent. It was sufficient for plaintiff to prove general loss of custom. Ratcliffe v. Evans[4]. McArthur v. Cornwall[5].\nThe formal judgment of the appeal court is all this court can look at for the decision.\nGormully Q.C. in reply. All the cases are collected in Benjamin v. Storr[6].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing the appeal of the present appellants from the judgment of the Chancellor, who had dismissed an appeal against the master\u2019s report.\nThis action was commenced on the 9th September, 1884.\nThe respondent claimed damages against each of the appellants for throwing into the Ottawa River sawdust and refuse from their mills at the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls, which formed a bank in front of the respondent\u2019s property fronting on the river on which he resided and carried on the business of a boatman, and thereby injured the respondent and his business by destroying access to his property to and from the river, and polluting the water of the river.\nThe defences set up by the appellants to the action are not printed by them in the case. They only pleaded that they had the right by prescription to put sawdust into the Ottawa River, and that they ought not to be joined together in the same action.\nMr. Justice Proudfoot at the trial gave judgment in favour of the appellants, on a technical ground as to the respondent\u2019s title to the land, but this judgment was set aside by the Divisional Court.\nThe appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, but that court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the judgment in favour of the respondent.\nThe appellants then appealed direct to the Privy Council and that appeal was also dismissed.\nIn pursuance of these judgments the decree was carried into the master\u2019s office to determine the amount of the respondent\u2019s damages and the amounts respectively that the appellants should pay.\nThe particulars of the respondent\u2019s account brought into the master\u2019s office are set forth in the case before us.\nThe appellants objected before the master that the particulars were not sufficient, but the master overruled the objection.\nFrom this ruling the appellants appealed, alleging that the particulars were too vague, and because one amount only was claimed for the injury complained of instead of several amounts under the various aspects in which the respondent\u2019s injury was presented.\nThis appeal came on before Mr. Justice Ferguson, who held that the particulars followed the judgment and were sufficient, and he dismissed the appeal.\nThe reference then proceeded before the master and he awarded one thousand dollars damages against each of the appellants, and five hundred dollars against the defendant Gordon, who does not now appeal.\nThe appellants then started a fresh series of appeals against the report on the ground that the amount allowed was too large and against the weight of evidence, and that it should be subdivided under various heads, and that the master did not take into account damages from sawdust thrown into the river by other mill owners on the north side of the river.\nThis appeal was dismissed by the Chancellor.\nThe appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal on the same grounds. The Court of Appeal also dismissed this appeal, Chief Justice Hagarty and Mr. Justice Osler holding with the Chancellor that the evidence clearly supported the master\u2019s finding, and that, after the several appeals already had, the objection as to the want of particularity in the pleadings, and that respecting the non-distribution of the damages, ought not to prevail, especially as the report of the master was according to the statement of the claim and the form of particulars carried in before the master and approved of by Mr. Justice Ferguson, whose decision the appellants did not appeal against. Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Meredith agreed that the evidence warranted the findings as to amount, but that the report ought to have stated how much was allowed under each aspect of the claim.\nThe appellants now appeal from the last mentioned judgment to this court.\nIt thus appears that the present is the seventh appeal in the cause.\nThe preliminary objection urged by the learned counsel for the appellants, that by reason of two of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal having withheld their opinions no judgment could properly have been pronounced, is not well founded for two reasons: first, we have before us the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal, and we ought not to look behind that judgment; secondly, because the respondent ought to be in no worse position than if the two learned judges had dissented (if indeed the judgments they pronounced in favour of sending the case back to the master does not amount to a dissent), and in case of their dissent the court would have been equally divided, and in that event the proper order to have been made would have been that which was actually made, namely, one dismissing the appeal.\nAs regards the merits I entirely agree in the judgment of the learned Chancellor and of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osler affirming it.\nThe original decree declared that the defendants were guilty of, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the defendants for, the wrongful acts and grievances in the pleadings mentioned, and it was referred to the master to inquire and state the amount of damages which the plaintiff had sustained by reason of the wrongful acts and grievances aforesaid, and the amount of such damages for which the said defendants were respectively liable to the plaintiff.\nThe wrongful act in the pleadings mentioned was the causing a public nuisance in the Ottawa River by creating an obstruction in that river consisting of a solid mass formed by sawdust, slabs, edgings and refuse thrown into the channels of the river by the defendants and which obstruction caused peculiar damage to the plaintiff. The wrongful act was thus, not the mere throwing this refuse matter into the river, but the formation by means of such refuse of the mass of sawdust and matter causing the obstruction and pollution of the river, which was complained of. This must have been sufficiently proved before decree, sa the Privy Council affirmed the judgment (though the record before us does not contain the evidence taken at the trial), and it has been also proved again in the evidence before the master. The defendants were, therefore, properly treated by the master as joint tort-feasors, and the master was not, strictly speaking, called upon to apportion the damages so as to restrict the liability of each defendant to the proportion in which he may have contributed to the nuisance. Neither was it incumbent on the master to have distinguished between the heads of damage under which he found apportioning so much to the head of injury to the plaintiffs personal enjoyment as a riparian proprietor, caused by the pollution of the water and otherwise, and so much to the injury to his business as a letter of boats, caused by the state of the river produced by the conjoint acts of the appellants.\nThe damages found are entirely warranted by the evidence, and I have never understood it to be the duty of the master, provided he sufficiently follows the directions of the decree, to give his reasons or to enter into a detailed explanation of his report.\nThat the evidence sufficiently warrants the master\u2019s finding is apparent when we read the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, including, particularly, the plaintiff, Ratt\u00e9, himself, Lett, Maingy, Emile Asselin, Josephine Asselin and Grisbourne. These witnesses show that damages not too remote were sustained by the plaintiff under both the heads of inquiry referred to in Mr. Justice Burton\u2019s judgment. The master was, of course, according to the well established practice in Ontario, the final judge of the credibility of these witnesses and he gave credit to their testimony. The defendants met this case by endeavouring to show that the loss of custom was attributable, not to the obstructions in the river caused by the deposit of mill rubbish, but in consequence of the public taste having undergone a change which induced persons boating for pleasure to resort to the Rideau Canal instead of to the Ottawa River. This led the plaintiff, in reply, to give evidence in rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s line of evidence. As could scarcely have been avoided some irrelevant evidence crept in, but I am bound to say, after reading the depositions, that this was but trifling, and not such as was likely to have affected the master\u2019s judgment. At all events the defendants might have objected to it in limine, and if they chose they could have appealed from the master\u2019s ruling, but this they did not do. I think it would be monstrous now to send this report back and thus further to prolong this litigation, which has already lasted upwards of eight years and in the course of which there have been no less than seven appeals, four of these by the defendants, all of which latter have been unsuccessful, merely because some evidence not strictly admissible may possibly have found its way into the depositions.\nIt is clear that the master has not erred in principle, and that, if we are to believe the witnesses he has accredited, there was ample evidence to warrant the amount of damages he has reported. Had I myself now to deal with this evidence I should be disposed to award much larger damages than the master has given.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants, Booth and Perley & Pattie: Christie, Christie & Greene.\nSolicitors for appellants, Bronson & Weston: Gormully and Sinclair.\nSolicitors for respondent: O\u2019Gara, MacTavish and Gemmill.\n[1] 4 Ch.

On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) dismissing the appellants' plea:\nHeld, that the appellants' obligation to keep the road in repair under the by-law not being \"future rights within the meaning of section 29 (6). the case was not appealable. County of Verch\u00e8res v. Village of Varennes (19 Can. S. C. R. 365) followed and Reburn v. Ste. Anne (15 Can. S. C. R. 92) distinguished. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) rendered on the 26th December, 1891, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Montreal, by which the appellants were condemned to pay to the respondent the sum of $262.14, for money paid out by respondent for the performance of macadam work imposed upon the appellants by a municipal by-law passed by the council of the respondent.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court the respondent's counsel moved to quash the appeal on the ground of want of jurisdiction. Geoffrion Q.C. for respondent cited and relied on Verch\u00e8reS V. Varennes ([1]).\nFortin for appellants contra cited Reburn v. Ste. Anne ([2]) and contended that in the case of Verch\u0141res v. Varennes (1) the question was as to the validity of a proc\u00e8s-verbal, whilst in the present case as in the case of Reburn v. Ste. Anne (2) the validity of the municipal by-law was denied.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is an appeal from a. judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Montreal by which the appellants were condemned to pay to the respondent the sum of $262.14. The respondent moves to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nThe action was for the recovery of said sum of $262.-14, being for money paid out by respondent for the performance of macadam work imposed upon the appellants by a municipal by-law passed by the council of the respondent. To this action the appellants pleaded the nullity of the said by-law.\nThis case is clearly not appealable to this court. The appellants' right in future as to the obligation to keep this road in repair may be bound by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, but these rights do not fall under the denomination of any of those mentioned in section 29 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe appellant attempted to base his claim to an appeal upon the authority of the case of Reburn v. Ste. Anne (2) but that case as we intimated at the argument, is no authority on the question of jurisdiction, two of the judges being of opinion that the appeal in that case did not lie and His Lordship the Chief Justice assuming jurisdiction without deciding the point as on the merits he was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Verch\u00e8res v. Varennes ([3]), and Wineberg v. Hampson ([4]), determined since Reburn v. Ste. Anne ([5]), are authorities precluding us from entertaining this appeal.\nGWYNEE J. To an action for debt upon a by-law it is, in my opinion, competent for a defendant to defeat the action by showing the by-law to be ultra vires and void and so that the debt never existed in law The by-law in question affects to impose upon the lands of the appellants the obligation of bearing the expense of macadamising and maintaining macadamised during all time a piece of road extending about 20 arpents along the extent of his lands; this obligation, if the by-law should be maintained, would operate as a burthen upon the land during all time and no one can say that the pecuniary damages resulting from the imposition of such a burthen on the appellants' land does not amount to the sum of two thousand dollars so as to deprive the appellants of their right to question upon this appeal the validity of the by-law which affects to impose such a burthen on their lands and of the judgment rendered upon the basis of the validity of the by-law. The matter in controversy in the present action is not merely the sum for which, as the cost of constructing but a small portion of the road, the judgment has been recovered, but the validity of the by-law upon which alone that judgment can be sustained and which affects to impose so serious a burthen for all time on the appellants' land. In short the controversy is whether the title to their land can be so injuriously affected. In my opinion this is a matter which is appealable in the present action notwithstanding the small amount for which the judgment has been rendered and which is but a fraction of the burthen which the by-law affects to impose; and that the case is appealable is, in my opinion, concluded by the judgment of this court in Reburn v. Ste. Anne du Bout de l'Iste ([6]).\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Bastien & Fortin.\nSolicitors for respondent : Ouinet & Emard.\n[1] 19 Can. S. C. R. 365.\n[2] 15 Can. S.

R. claimed, under the will of Hon. C. S. Rodier and an act of the legislature of the province of Quebec (54 Vic. ch. 96), from A. L. testamentary executrix of the estate the sum of $200, being for an instalment of the monthly allowance which A.L. was authorized to pay to each of the testator's daughters out of the revenues of his estate. The action was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, and on an appeal to the Supreme Court it was\nHeld, that the amount in controversy being only $200, and there being no \"future rights\" of B.R. which might be bound within the meaning of those words in section 29 (b) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Acts, the case was not appealable.\nAnnual rents in subset. (b) of sec. 29 of R.S.C. ch. 135 mean \"ground rents \" (rentes fonci\u00e8res) and not an annuity or any other like charges or obligations.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada.\nThe appellant by her action alleged that she was entitled to receive $100 monthly out of the revenues of the estate of her father the late Honourable C.S. Rodier under his will, which monthly allowance had been increased to $300 by an act of the legislature of the province of Quebec (54 Vic. ch. 16) and claimed from the respondent as testamentary executrix the additional $200 for the month of February, 1891.\nThe respondent pleaded that the act of the legislature, 54 Victoria chap. 96, imposed no obligation on her, but simply an authorization to pay whenever she might deem proper to do so.\nThe Superior Court for the province of Quebec, district of Montreal (Davidson J.) held that the respondent was bound to pay, but this decision was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) (Wurtele J., dissenting.)\nOn an appeal to the Supreme Court the respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the case was not appealable under sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nGeofrion Q.C., and Beaudin Q.C., for respondent, cited and relied on Gilbert v. Gilman[1]; Dominion Salvage Co. v. Brown[2], and art. 1241 C.C.\nLash Q.C. and DeMartigny for appellants contended that the claim was for rent within the meaning of that word in subset. (b) sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and that this case was distinguishable from that of Gilbert v. Gilman and other cases since decided.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appellant claims from the re\u00adspondent by her action, a sum of $200 for an instalment of a monthly allowance due to her as she alleges in virtue of her late father's will, and of the act 54 Vic. ch. 96 of the province of Quebec passed in relation to that will. Her action has been dismissed and she now appeals. The respondent moves to quash the appeal for want 1892 of jurisdiction. This motion must be allowed. This is clearly not an appealable case. The appellant argued that her appeal could be entertained on the ground that as the judgment dismissing her action, if allowed to stand would be resjudicata between her and the respondent, and a bar for ever of her claim, her appeal came within the words \u201cwhere the rights in future might be bound\u201d of section 29 of the Supreme Court Act. But that contention cannot prevail. We have in numerous cases determined that these words of the statute are governed by the preceding words of the clause \u201cfee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty or any title to lands or tenements, annual rents, or such like matters or things.\u201d The words \u201cannual rents\u201d cannot support the appeal. They mean ground rents (rentes fonci\u00e8res), and not an annuity or any other like charges or obligations.\nNeither can the appeal be entertained on the ground that the appellant's claim, being for a monthly allowance of $200, should be considered as being for an amount exceeding $2,000. The only amount actually in controversy in the present case is $200. The consequences of the judgment and its effect on the appellant's future rights in the matter cannot render the case appealable as being a case of $2,000. This monthly allowance is liable to be extinguished at any time by the death or re-marriage of the respondent for instance, according to the terms of the will in question.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Be\u00efque, Lafontaine & Turgeon.\nSolicitors for respondents: Beaudin & Cardinal.\n[1] 16 Can.

The estate having become involved an absolute deed of the realty was executed in favour of one of the testator\u2019s children by the widow and other children, and the grantee undertook to pay off the liabilities and reconvey the lands on repayment of the amounts advanced for the purpose. The grantee managed the estate for some years but was eventually obliged to convey it to trustees for the benefit of creditors, it then owing her some $18,000.\nA portion of the land so conveyed was sold for taxes and the purchaser, to perfect his title, obtained quitclaim deeds from the heirs of the original testator of such portion and of one hundred acres of timber land adjoining. The latter was not included in the assignment for benefit of creditors. Similar quit-claim deeds had previously been given for other portions of the estate and the moneys paid for the same equally distributed among the surviving children and grand children of the testator. Before the distribution of the purchase money in the last case, however, the deed executed by the widow and children of the testator, which had been mislaid for several years, was dis- covered, and the children of the grantee under it, who had died, claimed the whole of the money. The other heirs brought an action for their respective shares and obtained a verdict therefor at the trial, which was affirmed by the Divisional Court, on the ground that an agreement for the equal division of the money was proved. The judgment of the Divisional Court was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Supreme Court held, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the purchaser at the tax sale paid the money to obtain a perfect title, and as the defendants were the only persons who could give such title, the legal estate being in them, plaintiffs could not claim any part of the money, and that the agreement to apportion the money was not proved, any agreement made by plaintiffs with the purchaser not binding the defendants.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal was accordingly affirmed.\nMarsh Q.C. for the appellants.\nDonovan for the respondent.\n"}

That the bond fide subscription of $100 000 within six months from the date of the passing of the act of incorporation, and the payment of the 30 per cent thereon, were conditions precedent to the legal organization of the company with power to carry on business and as these conditions had not been bond fide and in fact complied with within such six months the Attorney-General of Canada was entitled to have the company's charter declared forfeited. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's . Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court and declaring forfeited the charter of the Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Company, one of the present appellants.\nThis was a proceeding in the name of the Attorney-General at the instance of John McDougall, the relator, under arts. 997 et seq. of the Civil Code of Procedure, to set aside and declare forfeited the charter of the Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Company created a corporation by the Dominion Statue 44 Vic. cap. 61. The grounds of complaint were that the company did not in organizing conform to the conditions of their charter which required a bond fide subscription of stock to the amount of $100,000 and a deposit of 30 per cent thereon in a chartered bank within six months after the passing of the act of incorporation before being able to call a meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, it being alleged that only $60,000 had been subscribed and that a fraudulent subscription of the additional $40000 had been made by one of the directors in trust, not for himself but actually for the company, with the understanding that he would not be called upon to pay it; and that the deposit of $30,000 in a chartered bank was not real but only simulated, being borrowed from the bank by three of the directors, and after the deposit was made and notified to the authorities at Ottawa, immediately withdrawn, which it was contended was a fraud on the public justifying the interference of the Attorney-General, and involving the forfeiture of the company's charter, the relator claiming that he Bud. others who had taken stock on the faith of a bond fide subscription of $100,000 being obtained were threatened to be sued and could not make their defence available until the charter should be declared null and forfeited.\nThe company pleaded:\u2014\n1st. By demurrer on the ground that if any such ' cause of complaint existed the prosecution should be by the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec, and not by the Attorney-General of the Dominion.\n2nd. That all the proceedings had been in good faith and were valid. The relator had been a promoter of the company, took part in their proceedings and acquiesced therein. The business of the company was for a time prosperous, the relator made no objection to the proceedings for several years, nor until the company were unfortunate, and then, with others in like position, to avoid payment of their subscriptions. The company having become insolvent were put in liquidation and a liquidator appointed, and that the present suit could by reason thereof he of no utility.\n3rd. That the Attorney-General had no right or quality to set aside a parliamentary charter.\nMatthew Leggatt, one of the appellants, a shareholder, intervened, and he took the same grounds as the company had taken and concluded by praying that the charter should be sustained; that the action of the Attorney-General should be dismissed and the liquidator ordered to proceed with the liquidation.\nThe evidence as to the manner in which the $100,\u00b0 000 were subscribed, of which $40,000 were subscribed for by one Gregory in trust who subsequently transferred $35,000 of it as paid up stock to one Merritt after the six months had expired and surrendered the balance of $5000 to the company, and the device used to comply with the statutory condition of paying thirty per cent on the $100,000 of subscribed stock, is reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given, and also in the report of the case of Brown v. The Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Co. ([1]).\nMr. Justice H. T. Taschereau, in the Superior Court, dismissed the plaintiffs' action and maintained the intervention. The Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversed the judgment 01 the court below, and declared the company's charter forfeited.\nBefore the institution of this suit proceedings were taken to wind up the company. The proceedings to wind up were dated 6th June, 1884. The proceedings to annul the act of incorporation at the instance of the Attorney-General were commenced on the 17th June following. On 20th June, 1884, the winding-up order was made.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Goldstein for the appellant company.\nAn act of the parliament of Canada cannot be declared forfeited, annulled, set aside or repealed except by the same parliament which passed it, and the Attorney-General had no right or quality to take the action in question.

Harris ([7]).\nWith reference to the nature of the present action and proceedings instituted against the company, the petition of John McDougall prayed for the issue of writ of scire facias The fiat of the Attorney-General granted permission to issue a scire facias. The order of the judge was to like effect, the writ is specially termed a scire facias and the conclusions of the declaration pray for the issue of a writ of scire facias. Proceedings concerning suits by scire facias are governed by' arts. 1034 and 1035 of the Code of Civil procedure, and it is the only remedy by scire facias provided by the laws of the province of Quebec, but it will be seen that they only, apply to letters patent, We also submit it is the only case in which scire facias is applicable at common law. Stephen's Commentaries ([8]); Chitty on Prerogatives of the Crown ([9]); Grant on (corporations ([10]). .\nThis company was incorporated by special act of the parliament of Canada, consequently these provisions of the Code of Procedure are not applicable.\nAt the argument in the court below the respondent contended that the proceedings were brought under art. 997 et seq. of the Code of Procedure, referring to corporations illegally formed or exceeding their powers. it is questionable whether these articles can be enforced by any officer other than the Attorney-General of Quebec as they are local provisions, but it is clear that the action has not been entered in virtue of these articles, their special provisions not having been complied with, nor can they be interpreted to apply to the annulling of an act of parliament. We have been unable to find any precedent applicable to this case, in the case of Sarazin v. La Banque de St. Hyacinthe ([11]) where the Attorney-General refused to issue his flat. See also Angell & Ames on Corporations ([12]).\nBut admitting the right exists our next point is that the respondent has wholly failed to establish any such irregularity or violation of the act incorporating the appellant company which would justify a declaration of forfeiture.\nThe courts do not favour forfeiture and a reasonable and substantial performance of the conditions is all that is required to defeat a claim of forfeiture. Field, ultra vires ([13]); Abbott Digest of Corporation Law Supp. ([14]); Harris v. Mississippi Valley Railroad Go.

Orfila ([21]).\nThen again these proceedings could not he taken after the presenting of a petition for a winding-up order.\nD. MACMASTER Q.C. for the intervenant-\u2014appellant, followed.\nTo admit the remedy by scire facias against a corporation created by act of parliament is to admit that in the Crown lies the right to attack, cancel and repeal an existence created by parliament.\nThe writ in the present case is a scire facias. But scire facias cannot lie against a company incorporated by act of parliament. The plaintiff cannot elude this issue, as he has. sought to do by means of the contention that it is a proceeding under art. 997 C.C..P.\nWhatever may be the rights of the Attorney-General for the province of Quebec to proceed by special information under art. 997 C.C.P. it certainly seems established that the Attorney General of Canada has no right to proceed against this company by scire facias in the face of the fact that the provisions of our Code of Civil Procedure limit that remedy to the cancellation of letters patent. It is for him to show the extraordinary right at common law to take any such proceeding's.\nWhen we find that no such proceeding has ever been taken in England against a corporation created by act of parliament the claim to any such extraordinary common law right disappears.\nNor is this a mere matter of form. In addition to the guarantee which the attacked corporation has, under procedure by information, of having the party who put the Attorney-General in motion joined in the proceedings as a relator, and to the further fact that the right to proceed by special information belongs not to the Attorney-General for the Dominion but to the Attorney-General for the province, it must he remembered that a writ of fscire acias is a Crown writ, issuing not by permission of the legislature but as a part of the royal prerogative.\nOn the merits we submit that no forfeiture has taken place. By the 7th section of the act of incorporation the provisions of the Canada Joint Stock Companies' Clauses Act, 1869, are made to apply to the company so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this act.\nSection 12 of this act, is in pari materi\u00e2 with section 5 of the act of incorporation, and all their provisions according to the general rules of statutory interpretation should be construed together. Wilberforce on Statute Law ([22]) If so it must be concluded that the provisions as to subscription and payment are merely directory.\nSection 5 contains nothing to indicate that non-observance of its terms involves the nullity of the incorporation. On the contrary section one unconditionally constitutes the persons therein named a corporation.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the evidence and contended that the conditions precedent had been com-plied with, and that the relief sought by McDougall, the relator, was barred by gross laches in prosecuting his claim, and by acquiescence in the transactions now impugned, by him.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. and G. Lajoie for respondent.\nAs to the status of the Attorney-General of Canada we contend that the law which respondent seeks to enforce is a Dominion law; the charter which it is sought to have declared forfeited a Dominion charter and the proper officer to enforce the same is the Attorney-General for the Dominion ([23]), and once the Attorney-General grants the use of his name, the courts cannot look at the interests of the relator in the proceedings but must decide whether there has been a good use or an abuse of the charter. Com. Dig. on Forfeiture ([24]); Hamilton Road Co. v. Townsend ([25]).\nNow is the action brought the proper proceeding in the present case? The plaintiff has taken his proceedings under article 997 and following articles of the Code of Civil Procedure. Those articles provide for the case where a corporation violates any of the provisions of the acts by which it is governed or becomes liable to a forfeiture of its misfits and enact that it is the duty of the Attorney-General to prosecute such violations of the law. Whenever any corporation has forfeited its rights, privileges and franchise the judgment declares it to be dissolved and to be deprived of its rights.\nThe formalities imposed by the Code of Civil Procedure have been substantially complied with, and if anything were wanting in this respect the appellants, not having filed an exception to the form of the respondent's procedure, are now too late to take advantage of any informality. The declaration annexed to the writ declares facts sufficient in law to justify the forfeiture of the charter. The fact that the writ is called a writ of scire facias, even if this appellation were improper would not nullity the procedure. It is a well established rule of procedure that a wrong name given to a writ or other procedure will not alone have the effect of voiding it. Bourgoin v. Montreal Northern Golonization Railway Co. ([26]).\nThe writ issued under articles 997 and following is in the nature of a writ of scire facias; it seeks to have the charter of the offending corporation declared forfeited and the corporation deprived of its rights. Under the common law of England such a writ undoubtedly exists under the name of scire facias to cancel the charters of companies incorporated by letters patent but it may be questioned whether the same remedy could be applied in England in the case of companies incorporated by act of parliament. However this may be in England, in the province of Quebec the Attorney-General has the right to ask that the charter of a company incorporated by act of parliament be declared forfeited; and those proceedings being of the same nature as those taken to have letters patent cancelled, it does not seem proper to style the writ one of scire facias. Moreover articles 997 and following are general and include corporations created by act of parliament. It cannot be contended that they only apply to corporations created by letters patent, there being special provisions for the charter of those corporations under articles 1034 and following articles in the same code. The learned counsel then contended on the evidence that the conditions imposed by the charter had not \"been complied with, and that the respondent was entitled to a judgment declaring the charter set aside; and cited and relied on Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes ([27]);Maxwell on Statutes ([28]); Morawetz on Corporations ([29]); Angell and Ames on Corporations ([30]); Cass v. Ottawa Agricultural Co. ([31]); The Eastern Archipelago Co. v. The Queen ([32]).\nAs to the proceedings taken to wind up the company they cannot affect the right of the Crown. Banque Hochelaga v. Murray ([33]); Brice ultra vires ([34]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J. The controversy in this case arose before the Superior Court in Montreal, upon proceeding's taken by the Attorney-General of Canada under arts 997 et seq of the Code of Procedure to have the appellants' charter declared forfeited. The information dated the 17th June, 1884, alleges in substance::\nThat the appellant, the Dominion Salvage Company, was incorporated by act of parliament, 44 Vic. ch. 61, with a capital of $300,000.\nThat certain provisional directors were appointed by the act to collect subscriptions and organize the company.\nThat the act provided that as soon as one hundred thousand dollars should have been subscribed and thirty per cent paid thereon, a meeting of shareholders might take place for the election of directors. That it was also provided that the subscription and deposit in question should be made within six months from the passing of the act\nThat the act was assented to on the 21st March 1881.\nThat there was not a duly bone tide subscribed capital of one hundred thousand dollars, nor a deposit as required within the six months.\nThat only $60,000 had been subscribed within that time, and nothing paid thereon.\nThat certain provisional directors then caused a fraudulent subscription of $40,000 to be made by S. E. Gregory, a man without sufficient means.\nThat this subscription was not a bond fide subscription and was made in trust for the company.\nThat a fraud was thus perpetrated upon the public and upon the bond fide subscribers of the company.\nThat it is the duty of the Attorney-General to protect the public against such frauds.\nAnd the prayer is to the effect that a writ of scire facias issue and that the court declare the charter of the company forfeited, null and void.\nThe point has been taken in limine by the appellants that no writ of scire tacias lies to annul a charter granted by act of parliament. But it is not necessary here to consider that question.\nThe articles of the Code of Procedure under which the Attorney-General took out these proceedings apply by their very terms to all corporations whatsoever, and the fact that he has erroneously called a scire facias what is strictly not a scire facias, or might have called a quo warranto what is not a quo warranto does not invalidate them. The conclusions he takes are those authorized by the code and that is sufficient. Cot\u00e9 v. Morgan ([35]). In the Attorney:-General v The Colonial Building Association ([36]) the charter sought to be annulled, under the same articles of the code, was also a parliamentary charter, yet it was never doubted in the Privy Council, that the Attorney-General had a right to proceed as he had done.\nThe appellants' other contention that the Attorney-General for the province of Quebec would alone have had the power, in 1884, under the code as it then stood, of taking out such proceedings is also unfounded. By the Revised Statutes of Canada oh. 21 sec. 4 it is enacted that:\nThe duties of the Attorney-General of Canada shall be as follows:\nHe shall be entrusted with the duties which belong to the office of the Attorney-General of England by law or usage so far as the same powers and duties are applicable to Canada, and also with the powers and duties which by the laws of the several provinces belonged to the office of Attorney-General of each province up to the time when the British North America Act, 1867, came into effect, and which laws, under the provisions of the said act are to be administered and carried into effect by the Government of Canada ([37]).\nIt seems to me unquestionable, as held by all the judges in the two courts below, that the Attorney-General of the Dominion has the right to impeach the legality or ask the forfeiture of a Dominion statutory charter. Whether, and in what cases, the Attorney-General for the province could also exercise that right we have not here to consider.\nNow as to the merits of the case. The clause of the company's charter upon which the information is based is as follows: \u2014\nWhen and so soon as one hundred thousand dollars of the said capital stock shall have been subscribed as aforesaid, and thirty per cent thereon shall have been paid in to some chartered bank to the credit of the company, such subscription and payment being made within six months after the passing of this act, the said provisional directors may call a general meeting of shareholders, at some place to be named in the city of Montreal, giving at least fifteen days continuous notice thereof in two daily newspapers published in the said city, at which general meeting the shareholders present in person or represented by proxy shall elect seven directors in the manner and qualified as hereinafter provided who shall constitute a board of directors, and shall hold office as hereinafter provided; provided always, that no person shall be eligible to be or continue a director unless he shall hold in his own name and for his own use at least ten shares of the capital stock of the company, and shall have paid all calls thereon, and all liabilities incurred by him to the company; and the shareholders shall have power to increase the number of directors at any general meeting to any number not exceeding nine, or to reduce them to any number not less than five.\nIt seems to me plain that, under this clause, the company could not be organized and carry on any business unless one hundred thousand dollars were subscribed within six months and thirty per cent thereon paid into some bank, also within the same time. That was a condition subsequent to the incorporation itself; it could not but be so; but it was a condition precedent to the organization of the company, required for the protection of the public and, as such, imperative, and not merely directory.\nThe provisional directors having failed to get the $1000000 subscribed and the thirty per cent paid in within the six months their powers had lapsed; the provisional incorporation was gone, the conditional charter was effete. By the express terms of section 4 of the act they were appointed for the purpose of organizing, the company, and for that purpose only. The appellants would expunge from the statute the words \"such subscription and payment being made within six months \" But that cannot be done. Such a construction would have given an unlimited time to organize the company. That was clearly not the intention of the statute.\nStatutes creating corporations and granting them powers and privileges, subject to compliance with certain regulations or conditions, are to be construed strictly. The regulative provisions which are imposed in the exercise of the corporate powers for the protection of the public are essential and must be strictly submitted to. There were here those two principal conditions; $1000000 subscribed for within six months, and a deposit thereon of $30,000 within six months.\nNow it is in evidence that $60500 only of bond fide subscriptions were taken in during the six months. When the delay was on the point of expiring some of the provisional directors, acting for the company, resorted to the following device to save the charter. They induced one Gregory a man altogether without means, who had already held one thousand dollars of stock to subscribe forty thousand dollars more, in trust for the company, upon the understanding that he would never be called upon to pay anything on that subscription.\nThis subscription was clearly made for the purpose of saving the charter by a sham compliance with the statutory conditions. Herriman himself, the president, refuses to swear that it was a bon\u00e2 fide subscription, It was nothing else but a clumys evasion of the statute.\nSome of the witnesses say that this stock was to be subscribed afterwards and Gregory relieved of his shares others and this is the contention of the appellants that these shares were to be applied in part payment of two certain wrecking steamers concerning the purchase of which negotiations were then pending with one Merritt, but which the provisional directors had not the right to conclude. However, it appears from the evidence that only one of these steamers was bought, more than six months later, under terms and conditions totally different from those proposed in September, 1881, and under an entirely new agreement. But this is quite immaterial and could not in any case validate Gregory's subscription.\nOf the $40,000 in question it seems that $35,000 were transferred as paid up stock to Merritt in May 1882, and that the remaining $5000 were surrendered to the company.\nThis subscription was clearly fraudulent, made only for the purpose of misleading the public and those \"who had then subscribed upon the faith of the requirements of the charter. In fact it was not a subscription within the six months at all but the simulation of one only. These original subscribers had the right to rely upon the fact that the organization of the company would be made regularly according to its charter and that the conditions concerning the amount of the subscriptions and the deposit would be complied with. It was an implied condition of their contract with the company that if the necessary subscriptions and payment could not be got there was to be no company at all to carry on the business contemplated, as it was also under the implied condition that the company was lawfully organized that the subsequent subscribers consented to Joint it Great care was taken to conceal the circumstances of that Gregory subscription from coming to the knowledge of the directors in good faith of the company. It bears date the 25th August 1881 and had been made with the approbation of Herriman and Henshaw; The latter were present at a meeting of the board of directors held on the 9th of September 1881. Brown Alfred Masson and R. Cowans three of the Montreal promoters were also there. A letter from Gregory was read, dated 25th August, in which he said that he presumed by this time the required amount had been subscribed in Ontario. Not one word from him in that letter of his subscription of forty thousand dollars made on that same date, nor from Herriman and Henshaw, who nevertheless knew all the circumstances.\nBrown suggested that the secretary should write to Gregory, the future assistant manager of the company, in order to ascertain if really all the required subscriptions had been obtained and praying him to send the names and the amount of each subscription.\nAt the following meeting of the board of directors, held on the 18th September, no report had been received from Gregory and the conversation turned upon the necessity in which the company was to find subscriptions in order to avoid the loss of the charter. The delay was to expire on the twenty-first of that month.\nBrown then notified the secretary that, in view of the non-fulfilment of the conditions of the charter within the required delay, he retired from the company and did not consider it regularly organized. .The other promoters from Montreal did the same.\nThat there has been fraud, fraud against the law, cannot be denied. It is contended by appellants that the fraud was between a certain number of the directors only, and not by the shareholders of the company, and that Gregory's subscription was legal. Assuming, with the appellants, that Gregory would have been bound towards the other shareholders to pay the subscription in question, and could not have invoked the circumstances above related to escape liability, though that is to my mind very doubtful, it seems to me unquestionable that the company itself could not have claimed anything from him under the circumstances.\nAt all events, towards the promoters in good faith of the company, and the subsequent subscribers, this subscription was deceitful.\nBy accepting under these circumstances for such a large amount, the subscriptions of a man without means, even if it had not been in trust for the company, the provisional directors have not acted in conformity with the charter.\nIt is necessary that the required amount of capital be subscribed by persons apparently able to pay the assessments which may be made upon their shares. Fictitious subscriptions, or subscriptions made by persons unable to contribute their proportion of the capital, do not satisfy the requirements that the whole capital of a corporation shall be subscribed before it's members can be assessed.\nSays Morawetz on Private Corporations ([38]),\nBut the fraudulent organization of the company is made still more apparent by the contrivance which was resorted to in order to simulate a deposit of thirty per cent upon the capital subscriber. Not a dollar had been paid by the subscribers though they had bound themselves to pay thirty per cent on demand. In order again to save the charter, Herriman, Henshaw and Harvey three of the directors, entered into the following agreement with Nash, the manager of the Union Bank of Montreal. Two of them Herriman and Henshaw, made their promissory note on the 20th of September, the day before the expiration of the six months, for thirty thousand dollars, in favour of Nash, in his capacity of manager, said note payable on demand.\nThis note was then discounted for form's sake and a deposit entry dated the same day of thirty thousand dollars was made to the credit of Herriman Henshaw and Harvey in trust for the company with the under-standing that the funds should not be withdrawn.\nA certificate of this entry was thereupon given by Nash to Herriman and Henshaw who sent the same to the Government. Then on the 23rd, two days after, they gave their cheque to Nash for that same amount of thirty thousand dollars, and the entry to the credit of Herriman Henshaw and Harvey was thereupon can- celled by the entry of the cheque to their debi t So little importance was attached to the transaction by Herriman and Henshaw that they even forgot to get their note returned. It remained in the bank and was produced at the trial by the manager, in 1888.\nIt is contended by the appellants that the thirty per cent need not necessarily have been paid by the shareholders upon the amount subscribed, and that the company could borrow the amount for that purpose. The words \"thirty per cent thereon\" they say, in section 8 of their charter, do not mean \"thirty per cent thereof.\" But that contention is untenable. It was thirty thousand of the one hundred thousand dollars subscribed that must have been paid in within the six months.\nThe French version of the statute says:\nLorsque et aussit\u00f4t que $100,000 du fonds social auront \u00e9t\u00e9 sons-crites, et qu'il en aura \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 trente pour cent.\n\"of which 30 per cent shall have been paid.\" That-makes it still clearer, if possible to make it clearer that 30 per cent thereon in the English version means 80 per cent thereof. The appellants would contend forsooth that a liability for that amount of $80,000 was a compliance with the statute. That is a proposition that a court of justice will not sanction. The case of The Eastern Archipelago Company v. The Queen, in the Exchequer Chamber ([39]) is directly in point. There, a charter incorporating a trading company directed that the sum of \u00a3 100,000 (one hundred thousand pounds) at the least should be subscribed for within twelve calendar months from the date of the charter; that the sum of fifty thousand pounds (\u00a350,000), at the least, should be paid up within such period; and that the said corporation should not begin business until a certificate of such subscription and payment had been given to the President of the Board of Trade. The company had commenced business before the required amount had been paid upon a certificate falsely stating that it had been paid. The court, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ([40]), declared the charter forfeited for a breach of the conditions and a misuser of the franchise\nCreswell J. said:\nOf these directions, (which in this charter must be treated as conditions) some appear to have been framed with the object of protecting the shareholders, others for the protection of the public. The clause prohibiting the commencement of business until capital to a certain amount had been paid up is of the latter description, and extremely necessary for that purpose inasmuch as the creditors of this incorporated partnership would have no remedy against the members but against the corporate property only. If then the corporation, under colour of their charter, began to trade before they were authorized so to do it was an abuse of their charter which worked a forfeiture, and rendered them liable to have it cancelled by means of a scire facias. And this is a matter in which the subject is interested; the abuse of the franchise is to his prejudice; and he, ex debito justitice. is entitled to a scire facias to procure the cancellation of it. Every franchise granted by the Crown is subject to the implied condition, that it shall he used according to the grant; and if it be used otherwise the franchise is forfeited. Here the franchise of being a corporation, and trading as a corporation was to be exercised when a capital of \u20a450,000 had been paid up; without any express condition this would have been subject to an implied condition that they should not trade otherwise; and their trading as a corporation, when not authorized to do so, would be an abuse of their charter.\nIn a case from Ontario, Niagara Falls Road Co. v. Benson ([41]) where, as here, the directors had evaded the prepayment required of a part of the capital by the discounting of notes, Robinson C.J. for the court said:\nWe consider that it is only when these conditions have been truly and it fact complied with, that the persons associated can become incorporated, and that their setting up a delusive appearance only of their having been complied with will avail nothing, because fraud vitiates everything. They had no right to assume those powers till six per cent had been paid up, for, in that case, the public would have no security that the whole was not a scheme of adventurers possessing no real capital.\nUpon these considerations there is, in my opinion, no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal which granted the Attorney-General's conclusions, and declared this charter forfeited\nI can see nothing in the contention that this company, being now in liquidation under a winding-up order, the Attorney-General is thereby debarred from asking the forfeiture of its charter. The winding-up order itself, it is to be noticed, was subsequent to the service of the information, and its legality is in many respects doubtful. Imperial Anglo-German Bank ([42]). Then in La Banque de Hochelaga v. Murray ([43]), though the company whose charter was impeached was in liquidation under a winding-up order anterior to the Attorney-General\u2019s information, yet the Privy Council granted its conclusions.\nAs to Leggatt's intervention it was rightly dismissed. His allegations are no answer to the Attorney-General's information. No ratification, waiver or acquiescence by any of the shareholders can validate, as against the crown, what is void, or he invoked against nullities of public order, or abuses of franchise to hinder or defeat such an action by the Attorney-General taken in the public interest. Compare Ashbury Railway Go. v. Riche ([44]); Coppell. Hall ([45]). The Attorney-General, in such proceedings under the code, whether he requires security to be given or not by the party applying for his fiat, is the plaintiff acting in lieu of the crown, and the only plaintiff. It is wholly immaterial whether such proceedings have been taken with or without a relator. The assent of the Attorney-General to the prosecution, in his name, by a private prosecutor is of the same effect as if he had. himself on behalf of the crown, initiated the proceedings. Per Ld. Campbell, C.J., and Wightman J in The Queen v. Eastern Archipelago Co. ([46]). I refer also to Attorney. General v. Mayor of Galway ([47]); Attorney-General v. The Iron Mongers Co- ([48]) Attorney-General v. wright ([49]); Attorney-General v. Haberdashers Go. ([50]).\nIf he had the right, at the expiration of the six months to have this charter declared forfeited, as I think it clear he had, I do not see upon what grounds it can be contended that he has now lost that right. \"With the consequences of such a forfeiture we have nothing to do. The court has not the power to inquire whether the Attorney-General has been well or ill advised in granting his fiat. Per Coleridge J. in The Queen v. Eastern Archipelago (1).\nIn view, however, of the assertion made by counsel at the bar that such contrivances, as have been proved to have been concocted in this case by the directors of this company to simulate a compliance with the conditions of their charter, are frequently resorted to, under similar circumstances, by those intrusted with the organization of similar companies, I deem it but right to say that, in my opinion, the Attorney-General, in duty bound as he is to check as much as it is in his power to do it such infractions of the laws of the country, could hardly have been expected, in the present instance to withhold his fiat. The beneficial effect of these proceedings upon those who may in the future assume such organizations cannot but prove to be a powerful protection to the public. And were it for that consideration alone his intervention in the matter was clearly in the public interest. When, in such cases, the promoters find it impossible to get the required amount subscribed and the de-posit made within the time allotted by their charter their only remedy, if they do not intend to desist from the undertaking\", is to apply to the legislative authority for an extension of that time. In the grantor alone vests the power to modify, alter or enlarge the conditions of the grant.\nI wish to add that when I used in the foregoing' remarks the words fraud\" or \" fraudulently, \" I meant \" fraud or fraudulently\" against the law, in fraudem Iegis, as a well recognized expression in legal parlance, and not fraud with the intention to cheat. There is no evidence whatever, on the record, of such indention, or of wrongful motives, against any of the parties connected with this company.\nI am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal with costs distraits to Lacoste, Bisaillon, Brousseau and Lajoie jointly and severally against the appellants.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014On the 17th March, 1881, four days before the royal assent was given to the act of incorporation of the Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Company, a meeting of the gentlemen named in the act as provisional directors of the company was held in the city of Montreal, which meeting was presided over by Mr. Alfred Brown, one of such provisional directors, and was attended by seven others of such directors including Mr. S. E. Gregory. The bill of incorporation had then already passed both Houses of Parliament and awaited only the assent of the Governor-General to become law. -At this meeting a discussion took place as to the necessary vessels and plant which the company would require to enable them to commence operations and a stock subscription book was opened in which four of the provisional directors then present subscribed, for stock, which they agreed, to take to the amount of $25,000; and another of such stock subscription books was placed in the hands of Mr. S. E. Gregory, who undertook to get subscriptions therein in the province of Ontario. In the book subscribed by the four provisional directors Mr. McDougall, the relator in the present proceedings, on the 19th March, 1881, subscribed his name whereby he agreed to take $6,000 stock. On the 80th July, 1881, a Mr. Merritt, one of the provisional directors who resided at New York engaged in wrecking operations, addressed a letter to Mr. Henshaw at Montreal, who was acting as secretary of the provisional directors of whom he also was himself one wherein Mr. Marriott offered to furnish the company with steamers necessary for their operations as follows'.\u2014\nSteamer Rescue with wrecking material complete in good order and ready for sea. There pumps, two cables, two anchors, two sets of blocks and falls one hoister two surf boats, two boilers, one diving apparatus, and sundry tools for the sum of $40,000, $25,000 cash, $15000 stock. Steamer Relief same outfit as above mentioned for the sum of $50,000, $300000 cash, $20,000 in stock. Both steamers with outfits as above mentioned for the sum of $90,000, $50,000 cash, $40,000 stock.\nIf both these vessels should be purchased by the company on the above terms it will be seen that Mr. Merritt had undertaken to become a subscriber of stock to the amount of $40,000. On the 17th August, 1881, a meeting of the provisional directors was held at Montreal to consider the above proposition which was attended by the relator, McDougall, and it was resolved that two of the provisional directors, namely Captains Donnelly and Herriman:\u2014\nShould proceed to New York and examine thoroughly the vessels and their equipment and report back to a meeting to be called by the secretary pro tern, after receiving the report of the gentleman named.\nMr. Gregory attended this meeting, and upon the 25th August, 1881, entertaining a conviction that an arrangement would be arrived at by the company for the purchase of the vessels on the basis of Mr. Merritt's proposition, and after consultation with Mr. Herriman he signed the stock subscription book for $440,000 on trust,\" upon the understanding that the stock to be transferred to Mr. Merritt in the event of an arrangement being made with him for the purchase of his vessels or either of them should be taken from the stock so subscribed for by Mr. Gregory in trust. This transaction took place in the most perfect good faith and in the belief that it was quite regular and in point of fact the transaction, after continued negotiations carried on from the first offer in July 1880 was completed by an agreement dated the 21st day of March, 1882, whereby Mr. Merritt sold to the company the steamer Relief, together with all her machinery, tackle and apparel complete for $50,000, of which $25,000 should be accepted in paid up stock of the company, and which was transferred to him by Mr. Gregory out of the said $400000 subscribed by him in trust, and by the said agreement the said Merritt also sold extra plant to the company, at and for the further sum of $10,000 which he agreed to take also in paid up stock of the company, and which sum was also transferred to him by Mr. Gregory out of the said $40000 stock subscribed by him in trust. Now on the said 25th day of August, 1881, when Mr. Gregory signed the book for the said sum of $40,000 in trust there were actual subscriptions in the stock subscription books of the company to the further amount of $60,500. On the 2nd November, 1881, the provisional directors in the belief that the $40000 subscribed for in trust by Mr. Gregory was well subscribed so as to form part of the $1000000 required by the act to be subscribed before the company should commence operations, and that a note for $30,000 made by two of the provisional directors to the cashier of the Union Bank and deposited in that bank and discounted by that bank, and the amount deposited to the credit of the two upon the note and a third of said provisional directors \u201cin trust\" was a sufficient compliance with the act of incorporation, proceeded to organize the company by the election of directors. On that same day another of the provisional directors, Capt. Donnelly, signed the stock subscription book for $1,000. However irregular this proceeding was the evidence leaves no doubt, I think, that the parties thought all was right; and they were acting in the most perfect good faith and in accordance with a practice which appears to have been prevalent in Montreal and believed to be a compliance with the provisions of the act. From the nature of the operations contemplated by the act of incorporation it is apparent that wrecking operations were not intended by the company in November, 1881, to commence before the opening of navigation in the following spring and in the interim between the 2nd November, 1881, including Donnelly's subscription of that date and the 3rd May, 1882, when the company had acquired plant to enable them to commence operations, subscriptions were made in the stock subscription books to the further amount of $43,500, or including the paid up stock transferred to Merritt as part of the purchase money of the necessary plant purchased from him, about $140,000. Between the 3rd May, 1882 and 25th March, 1883 further stock was sub-scribed for to the amount of $5,500. Upon this capital the company have' been carrying on the operations for which they were incorporated until the month of May, 1884, when proceedings were taken against them under the Winding-up Act. Now of the stock so subscribed including the $35,000 transferred 'to Merritt for which the company received full value, $92,600 have been paid in full, leaving the only sum remaining unpaid, to be $52,400. It is under these circumstances, and while the company is in liquidation under the Winding-Up Act where the rights of all persons having a just claim to exemption from liability to contribute to payment of the debts incurred by the company during the two years that it was in actual operation can be protected, that we are asked to declare or to maintain an adjudication declaring that the company never had any legal existence, or that there was no legal sanction for any contract they may have entered into, or for any debt they may have incurred with persons dealing with them in the bon\u00e2 fide belief that they were a company having legal existence and subject in case of insolvency to the provisions of the Winding-Up Act.\nThere can be no doubt that immediately upon the passing of the act the company's corporate existence commenced, and there is nothing in the act which declares that it shall cease at the expiration of six months from the passing of the act unless the one hundred thousand dollars of capital stock mentioned in the 5th section shall have then been subscribed for in the books opened under the fourth section of the act\nThere is nothing in the act which, in my opinion, would. justify a court of justice in pronouncing a judgment that for such default the act becomes forfeited in a case where, subsequently to the six months and before the company commenced the operations for carrying on which they were incorporated, the necessary amount was subscribed and the company carried on the business for which they were incorporated without interruption for years in the course of which they incurred debts. Now in the present case the company having, although not within the six months but before entering upon the operations for which they were incorporated, obtained subscriptions in their stock subscription books mentioned in the fourth section to an amount in excess of one hundred thousand dollars of which more than $90,000 was paid in full, and having for two years actually carried on as a company the business for carrying on which they were incorporated, and having in the course of such business entered into contracts with divers persons by which they incurred debts which they have been unable to pay and for non-payment of which they have been put into liquidation under the Winding-up Act, a judgment now rendered to the effect that by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the fifth section within six months from the passing, of the act the act of incorporation ceased to have any effect and became and is forfeited, cannot, in my opinion be maintained. Such a judgment would be fraught with such infinite mischief and such injustice to parties who (during the two years that the company did de facto carry on the operations for which they were incorporated) became creditors of the company in the bou\u00e2 tide belief that they had de jure the existence of which de facto they appeared to have, that in my opinion the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs and the relator at whose instance the present proceeding was instituted, and all parties interested, should be remitted to the proceedings in liquidation instituted under the Winding-up Act where the rights of all parties having a just claim to exemption from liability to contribute to the payment of the debts of the company can be protected. The present case is very different from that of La Banque d'Hochelaga v. Murray et al. ([51]). There letters patent issued under the great seal of the province of Quebec which had been obtained upon a false and fraudulent representation that the defendants and others had petitioned for the same, were for that reason declared to be fraudulent, null and void. The application in the present case is not to avoid letters patent as fraudulently obtained, but to declare an act of parliament, not to have been fraudulently obtained but to have lapsed and become forfeited for non-subscription within the limited period of six months from the passing\" of the act of the amount required by the act to authorize the provisional directors to organize the company, and the proceeding is instituted upon the relation of and for the benefit of a gentleman, himself a provisional director and subscriber for stock in the books opened under authority of the act, and whose duty as such provisional director it was to prevent the organization of the company if the necessary amount had not been subscribed for, and the object of the proceeding is to relieve such relator from liability in the winding-up proceedings to payment upon the stock so subscribed for by him towards liquidation of debts due to divers persons who became creditors of the company in the bond fide belief that the company in which the relator was a subscriber for stock and of which he was a provisional director, was legally organized, thus doing injustice also to divers persons who, some before and some since the expiration of the six months, had become subscribers for stock and had paid up in full upon the faith of the relator's position as a subscriber for stock and a provisional director, and in the bond fide belief that the company was legally organised.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant company : Carter & Goldstein.\nSolicitors for intervenant : Macmaster & McGibbon.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bisaillon Brosseau & Lajoie.\n[1] 20 Rev.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.[NOTE.\u2014This and the following cases decided in 1892-3 the reporters have not been in a position to publish until now.]\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWill\u2014Construction\u2014Devise to children and their issue\u2014Per stirpes or per capita\u2014Statute of limitations\u2014Possession.\nUnder the following provision of a will \u201cWhen my beloved wife shall have departed this life and my daughters shall have married or departed this life, I direct and require my trustees and executors to convert the whole of my estate into money * * * and to divide the same equally among those of my said sons and daughters who may then be living, and the children of those of my said sons and daughters who may have departed this life previous thereto:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Ritchie C.J. dissenting, that the distribution of the estate should be per capita and not per stirpes.\nA son of the testator and one of the executors and trustees named in the will was a minor when his father died, and after coming of age he never applied for probate though he knew of the will and did not disclaim. With the consent of the acting trustee he went into possession of a farm belonging to the estate and remained in possession over twenty years, and until the period of distribution under the clause above set out arrived, and then claimed to have a title under the statute of limitations.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that as he held under an express trust by the terms of the will the rights of the other devisees could not be barred by the statute.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Ferguson J. at the trial. The action in this case was brought for the purpose of having construed the will of the late Thomas Bell and for the administration of his estate.\nThe said Thomas Bell died in 1840 and his property was left to his widow for life for the support of herself and her unmarried daughters. The will contained the following provision, which is the only one material to the questions raised on this appeal:\u2014\n\u201cWhen my beloved wife shall have departed this life, and my daughters shall all have married or departed this life, I direct and require my trustees and executors hereinafter named to convert the whole of my estate into money to the best advantage by sale thereof, and to divide the same equally among those of my said sons and daughters who may be then living, and the children of those of my said sons and daughters who may have departed this life previous thereto.\u201d\nOn the death of the widow and the only one of the daughters who had not married there were several children and grandchildren of the testator entitled to the benefit of the above clause. The question for decision is: Did such beneficiaries take per stirpes or per capita? The Court of Appeal held that they took per stirpes reversing the decision of Ferguson J. on this point.\nThe other question raised in the action which comes before the court on cross-appeal is, whether or not James J. Bell, one of the sons of the testator and one of the executors and trustees named in the will, is entitled to certain land which formed part of the estate by virtue of the statute of limitations. He was only fifteen years of age when his father died and never applied for probate of the will through leave was reserved for him to do so. He was aware of the will but took no part in the execution of the trusts thereunder. In 1861, with the consent of the acting trustee, he entered into possession of a farm which had belonged to the testator and remained in possession continuously from that time. He now claims title to the said farm by prescription.\nThe Court of Appeal held, affirming the decision of the trial judge, that the said James J. Bell must be considered as necessarily affected with notice of the provisions of the will and the express trusts thereby created as regards the land he claims, and as he admits that he thought he was devisee of the land when he entered the entry was not tortious and his possession was that of trustee under the will. He could not, therefore, set up the statute of limitations and claim the land as his own. The said James J. Bell took a cross-appeal to the Supreme Court from this decision, and is, also, a respondent to the main appeal on the question of the construction of the will.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. for the appellants, the Wrights, and Beck for the other appellants in the main appeal, argued that the testator\u2019s devisees took per capita, citing Tyndale v. Wilkinson[2]; Payne v. Webb[3]; Wood v. Armour[4]; Bradley v. Wilson[5]; Martin v. Holgate[6]; In re Orton\u2019s Trust[7]; In re Philps\u2019 Will[8].\nMcCarthy Q.C. and S.H. Osler for the respondent, James J. Bell and Hoyles Q.C. for Charles J. Bell referred to In re Campbell\u2019s Trusts[9]; West v. Orr[10]; In re Smith\u2019s Trusts[11]; In re Goodhue[12]; Board v. Board[13].\nIn the cross-appeal McCarthy Q.C. and Osler for the appellant argued that James J. Bell was never an acting trustee and could claim the benefit of the statute of limitations, citing Dickenson v. Teasdale[14]; Cunningham v. Foot[15]; Sands v. Thompson[16]; and that never having accepted the trust the moment he disclaimed the deed as to him was void ab initio. Doe d. Chidgey v. Harris[17]; Paine v. Jones[18].\nBlake Q.C. and Hoyles Q.C. for the respondents cited Ryan v. Ryan[19]; Gray v. Bickford[20]; In re Arbib & Class\u2019s Contract[21].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014After giving this case every consideration I am unable to arrive at the conclusion which my brother judges have reached, and therefore put forward my views with diffidence and doubt. My impression certainly is that the testator contemplated an equal distribution among his sons and daughters living at the time of distribution, and the children of the sons and daughters who may have departed this life previously thereto, meaning thereby that the children should represent their parents, not that the shares of the sons and daughters then living should be reduced by giving to the children of deceased sons and daughters more than the shares of the sons and daughters then living, thereby making an unequal distribution between the living sons and daughters, and the sons or daughters who may have departed this life; in other words I think the children of Mary Houghton took substitutionally in lieu of their mother; consequently I think that each child of Mary Houghton is not entitled to an equal share of the estate with each of the sons and daughters of the testator living at the death of Deborah Bell, and that they are not entitled to rank with such sons and daughters per capita. They do not take as claiming in their own right but as representing parents.\nI think the object of the testator was to divide his property at the death of Deborah Bell, the last unmarried daughter of the testator, equally among his sons and daughters then living and the children representing his deceased sons and daughters; in other words that he neither desired to cut down the shares of his living sons and daughters, nor to increase the shares of the deceased sons and daughters, thereby destroying all equality, which it seems to me it was the testator\u2019s intention to secure, but that the sons and daughters should take their shares and the children of the deceased sons and daughters the shares of their respective parents, thereby preserving equality among his children; in other words, I think the children of the deceased parent took a contingent vested interest at the time of the parent\u2019s death, and the testator intended to have the division as it would have been if all the sons and daughters had survived, but substituting the children of each deceased son or daughter to the share their parent would have taken if living.\nTherefore the appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the cross-appeal, I do not think John Joseph Bell has established any title to the property under the statute of limitations. I think he entered on the property under the will of his father by which he was constituted a trustee, and cannot now claim the property in his own right. I entirely agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge on this branch of the case, and think the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This appeal involves two questions, one relating to the construction of the will of Thomas Bell, which is the subject of the principal appeal, and the other as to the application of the statute of limitations in favour of James Joseph Bell, who has raised this last point by a cross-appeal.\nThe clause of the will which we are required to construe is as follows:\u2014\nWhen my beloved wife shall have departed this life I direct and require my trustees and executors hereinafter named to convert the whole of my estate into money to the best advantage by sale thereof, and to divide the same equally among those of my said sons and daughters who may be then living, and the children of those of my said sons and daughters who may have departed this life previous thereto.\nThe gift then clearly was to such of the testator\u2019s sons and daughters who should survive the period of distribution, that period being the death of his widow if she should survive her daughters or the marriages of all of them, or, in the event of the widow dying leaving any unmarried daughters, then the marriage or death of the last unmarried survivor of these, an event which happened when Deborah Bell died in 1883.\nTherefore, as regards the testator\u2019s sons and daughters, the gift to them having been contingent until that event\u2014the death of the last survivor of the life tenants in 1883\u2014thereupon became vested in such sons and daughters as then survived. As regards the testator\u2019s grandchildren who were to take under this devise the exact period of vesting is not quite so clear. According to Marti v. Holgate[22], if it applied, the interests of the children of sons and daughters of the testator who died before the period of distribution would not be contingent upon their surviving the last tenant for life but would become vested on the death of their parents, the reason for this being that, according to the construction which is authorized by Martin v. Holgate22, the words \u201cwho may be then living\u201d being confined by the testator to his sons and daughters, and not repeated as to the children of those sons and daughters, could not by implication be extended to the grandchildren, who would therefore take vested interests on the death of their fathers and mothers. In Martin v. Holgate22 the devisee was to distribute and divide amongst such of certain nephews and nieces of the testator as should be living at the death of his widow, \u201cbut if either should then be dead leaving issue such issue should be entitled to their father and mother\u2019s share.\u201d The question upon this form of gift was whether a nephew having died in the lifetime of the tenant for life leaving a daughter that daughter took a vested interest upon her father\u2019s death, or whether she took only contingently upon her surviving the widow, the tenant for life, and it was held that she took a vested interest immediately upon the death of her father. It is to be observed that in that case there was no difficulty in ascertaining the share which thus vested since the children of nephews and nieces who died before the widow were to take their \u201cfather\u2019s or mother\u2019s share.\u201d Had the shares of the children of the first beneficiaries been dependent in that case, as they are in this, upon the fluctuations in a class which could not possibly be ascertained with certainty until the termination of the life estates the decision in Martin v. Holgate[23] might have been different. Otherwise, in the view which I take and which I have yet to mention as to the shares which the devisees, grandchildren as well as children, of the testator take under this will, this inconvenience would follow. The shares given to the children of sons and daughters who might die not being here given by way of substitution for those which their fathers and mothers would have taken if they had survived the life tenants, but original shares which could not be exactly ascertained until the period of distribution (the death of the last life tenant) arrived, the shares originally vested would be liable to be diminished and divested pro tanto by subsequent events. I think, therefore, that the case of Martin v. Holgate23 does not apply in a case like this where it is apparent that the exact shares of none of the devisees can be ascertained until the arrival of the period of distribution. Therefore, even if the will had not contained the direction which it does contain as to personal enjoyment in specie, instead of a sale and conversion by the trustees at the election of the class who were to take, 1 should have considered Martin v. Holgate23, so far as it is relied on as an authority showing who were the persons composing the class of devisees to take in the present case, though of course a decision of the highest authority and conclusive as to a devise in the same terms, yet of doubtful application to the particular will before us in the present case.\nIt appears, however, that this question as to who were the beneficiaries to take may be solved by a reference to the direction in this particular will to which I have just now incidentally adverted. The words of the testator are:\u2014\nBut if my said family should consider it more to their advantage to keep the yearly income and divide it among them in the same manner they are directed so to do.\nWe have here an indication of an intention entirely repugnant to the notion that some of the devisees might take vested interests even though they should pre-decease the last life tenant. The word \u201cfamily\u201d refers to the whole class of devisees, sons and daughters and the children of sons and daughters, taking under the will; these persons are, the testator says, to have the option of enjoying in specie, so that the sale by the trustees is not to be imperative. This clearly indicates that there was to be the possibility of actual personal enjoyment in specie by the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty at the death of the last tenant for life, and this could not be if the children of those who died before that event, and who in their turn might pre-decease the tenant for life, were to take vested interests which would be subjects of alienation, and might therefore become vested in strangers, a construction inconsistent with the testator\u2019s intention that there might be enjoyment in specie by the \u201cfamily\u201d if they should so elect, at the death of the tenant for life.\nThe question here is as to the ascertainment of a class, and recognizing the case of Martin v. Holgate[24] as an authority binding on me to the fullest extent I do not think it applies, as regards the point now under consideration, to the terms of this will. The construction, then, which I attribute to the testator\u2019s language is, that in the events which have happened he has given his property to a class composed of such of his children, sons and daughters, as survived Deborah Bell, and such of the children of sons and daughters who pre-deceased Deborah Bell as were living at her death, thus excluding altogether children of sons and daughters who survived their parents (children of the testator) but died before the last tenant for life. This construction, besides being, in my opinion, the natural meaning of the testator\u2019s language, has also the support of authority so far as authority is of consequence in questions of testamentary construction. I refer to the decision of Wood V.C. in Re White\u2019s Trusts[25] as a case which appears to me to be strongly in point.\nAs regards the question principally argued, that as to the shares taken by children and grandchildren of the testator respectively, I am compelled to differ from the learned judges of the court below. I can find nothing in this will which warrants the construc- tion contended for, namely, that the children of sons and daughters took their father\u2019s and mother\u2019s shares, in other words, took per stirpes and not per capita. It seems to me that the word \u201cequally\u201d used by the testator applied, as I am of opinion it must have, to a class all the members of which are to be ascertained at one and the same time; the period for distribution, the death of the last tenant for life, means exactly what, taken in its primary signification, it imports, namely, that each member of the class is to have the same share.\nFurther, the case of Martin v. Holgate[26] certainly applies here to show that the gift to the children of sons and daughters in this will is to be construed as a gift per capita. It has long been a settled rule of construction that under a gift by will to A, and the children of B, without more, all take equal shares\u2014per capita and not per stirpes. In Blackler v. Webb[27], Lord King says that under such a devise \u201ceach should take per capita as if all the children had been named by their respective names.\u201d Then we have here the addition of the word \u201cequally\u201d to which effect could not be given save by holding that it applies as between the testator\u2019s sons and daughters on the one hand and his grandchildren on the other as well as between the latter as amongst themselves.\nThe class then being once ascertained all its members must take equally, and to hold otherwise, as would be done by saying that the grandchildren of the testator took per stirpes, i.e. took their parents\u2019 shares only, would be to make them take unequally with the other devisees in direct contradiction to the terms of the will.\nThat the will thus construed may seem harsh or capricious cannot of course have any influence in its construction. The testator had a right to make any will he chose so long as he did not offend against the rules of law, and we can only derive his intention from the actual words he has used read in conjunction with the context. I am, therefore, compelled to differ from the full and able judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal on this part of the case, and to express my concurrence in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson.\nAs regards the cross-appeal, by which James Joseph Bell seeks to have the benefit of the statute of limitations given to him, I am of the same opinion as the majority of the Court of Appeal who in this respect agreed with Mr. Justice Ferguson.\nNo doubt, according to Butler and Baker\u2019s case[28], which was determined in Siggers v. Evans[29] to be applicable to gifts and conveyances of estates burthened with onerous trusts, the legal estate vested in James Joseph Bell until disclaimer even though he had no knowledge of the will, although a court of equity would not have considered him liable as a trustee as regards the performance of active trusts until he had notice of the trusts and had accepted or at least acquiesced in them[30]. The statute of limitations would not, however, have run in favour of James Joseph Bell by reason of a possession taken and held in ignorance of the will and the trusts contained in it for the statutory period of limitation. The case of Lister v. Pickford[31] is authority for this. Lord Romilly there says:\nSuppose that they (referring to certain trustees) had imagined bon\u00e2 fide that they themselves were personally entitled to the property, and that they were not trustees of it for any one, it would nevertheless have been certain that they would have been trustees for the cestuis que trust and no time would run while they were in such possession. The point, however, does not really arise here for either James Joseph Bell had notice of the will as Mr. Justice Ferguson held he had, in which case he would of course be incapable of setting up the statute of limitations against the beneficiaries taking under it, or being ignorant of the will and being let into possession in the manner he himself describes by his brother John Bell, who had full knowledge of the will and its trusts and was undoubtedly a trustee under it, he (James Joseph Bell) was a tenant at will claiming under an express trustee, and therefore a person in whose favour the statute would not run as is expressly provided by the 30th section, of R.S.O. c. 111. This is well pointed out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan with whom I agree as regards this part of the case.\nJohn Bell did not of course acquire, under his purchase from the purchaser at the tax sale, any title paramount to that which he took under the will, but the estate he so acquired became in all respects subject to the trusts of the will. This does not appear to have been doubted by the learned judges in the court below, and is too plain to require further observation.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the cross appeal be dismissed with costs, the effect of which will be to restore the judgment pronounced by Mr. Justice Ferguson in every respect. I do not think that the costs of the appeal should come out of the estate; it should be dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants; James Joseph Bell must pay the costs of the cross appeal both here and in the Court of Appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I have come to the same conclusion for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Strong.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014We have here a trust to convert the estate into money at the period of distribution and\nto divide the same equally among those of my said sons and daughters who may then be living and the children of those of my sons and daughters who may have departed this life previous thereto.\nThe general rule of construction was concisely stated by Vice-Chancellor Sir James L. Knight Bruce in Leach v. Leach[32] as being that:\nWords in a will are to be construed according to their ordinary sense and meaning, unless the testator has declared, or by the context shown, that he uses them otherwise.\nThere is nothing in this will, outside of the passage itself, to modify its meaning, and I cannot discover anything in the words used, or any justification in the authorities cited to us or in any of the numerous other cases at which I have looked, for holding otherwise than that the class of beneficiaries consists of the living sons and daughters and the children of those deceased, all taking per capita.\nI was for some time disposed to look for an indication of a different intention in the circumstance, which I think had some influence in the court below, that the period of distribution, when the class was to be ascertained, was not at the death of the testator but at an indefinite time which, in the event, proved to be half a century later; but I cannot satisfy myself that that circumstance can, upon any grounds more substantial than mere conjecture, be taken to modify the literal meaning of the language. There are other circumstances peculiar to this will but not, so far as I can perceive, affording a safe basis for reasoning as to the intention of the testator. For example, the sons who were to share in the distribution took no benefit in the meantime, nor did any daughter except while she remained unmarried. Any attempt to reason from these things is as likely to lead towards the per capita as towards the stirpetal distribution. The leading idea may be plausibly argued to be to provide for the widow and the unmarried daughters, no thought being given to the maintenance or advancement of the others, and then to divide among the whole of the indicated class.\nI can hardly find reason for saying, as Vice Chancellor Malins said in Payne v. Webb[33] that:\nIf I were at liberty to conjecture what the testator intended to do I should have no doubt that he meant to divide his residuary property into seven shares, giving one share to each of his surviving children, and one share per stirpes to the children of the deceased daughters.\nI quote mutatis mutandis, but even if I entertained that opinion I should feel myself bound, as the Vice Chancellor did in that case, to construe the words according to their literal meaning.\nSeveral of the most instructive of the recent decisions are those of Lord Justice Kay when a judge of the chancery division, such as Lord v. Hayward[34], and In re Hutchinson\u2019s trusts[35]. They are not so directly upon the point in discussion as to call for citation at present, but I find in the report of the argument of that learned judge when at the bar, or of Lord Macnaughten who was with him, in Swabey v. Goldie[36], the following passage which I may adopt as apposite and as, in my opinion, borne out by the cases he cites:\nThe principle of the cases is that where the fund is to be kept together and divided at one period there is no reason for inferring distribution per stirpes; but if it is divisible at different times then the distribution per stirpes is to be preferred: Hawkins on Construction of Wills[37]; Willes v. Douglas[38]; Arrow v. Mellish[39]; Waldron v. Boulter[40]; Turner v. Whittaker[41]; Wills v. Wills[42]; Jarman on Wills[43].\nI am of opinion that on this branch of the case the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the court of first instance restored.\nUpon the cross-appeal of James Joseph Bell he had the judgment of the court of first instance and also that of the Court of Appeal against him, the decision of the latter court not being unanimous.\nI have examined the evidence carefully and I am satisfied that the judgment is correct.\nThe account given by the appellant of the way he was put into possession of the lands by his brother John Bell, and the understanding on which he entered upon the occupation of the lands which has lasted for nearly thirty years, is to my mind simply incredible, and it does not gain in plausibility from the style of his answers as reported by the shorthand writer. Setting all that aside, however, and assuming that he had the idea when he entered upon the farm that the will of his father gave it to him, I do not see on what principle that alters the fact that he was a devisee in trust under the will, or deprives the cestuis que trustent of the protection of the statutory enactment[44] that:\nNo claim of a cestui que trust against his trustee for any property held on an express trust, or in respect of any breach of such trust, shall be barred by any statute of limitations.\nIt might, perhaps, have been more satisfactory if John Bell and Deborah had survived so that we might have had the benefit of their testimony, but if it were important that we should know John Bell\u2019s understanding of the position enough has been shown, even by the appellant himself, to make it apparent that John\u2019s understanding was very different from that on which the appellant relies. In fact all that we hear of John\u2019s doings, the action that he brought to eject Simon Peter Munger in the name of the appellant conjointly with his own, the repurchase of the lands that were sold for taxes, and other things, are consistent with the true position under the will. There is not a shadow of reason to doubt that John Bell fully understood the real situation, and there is no conceivable motive for his misrepresenting it as the appellant would have it believed that he did.\nThe fact of crucial importance is that the appellant held under an express trust by the terms of the will, and that the statute protects the interests given by the same will to the others.\nThe cross-appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants, The Houghtons: Beck & Code.\nSolicitors for the appellants, The Wrights: Lefroy & Boulton.\nSolicitors for the respondent, James J.
